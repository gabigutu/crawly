		<shortDescription>A true masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Road to Perdition, a movie undeservedly overlooked at that year Oscars is the second work of Sam Mendes (and in my opinion his best work), a director who three years before won Oscar for his widely acclaimed but controversial American Beauty. This is a terrific movie, and at the same time ultimately poignant and sad.It's a story of a relatively wealthy and happy family from outward appearance during difficult times of Depression when the, Michael Sullivan, a father of two children, played by great Tom Hanks (I'm not his admirer but ought to say that) is a hit-man for local mafia boss, played by Paul Newman. His eldest son, a thirteen years boy Michael Sullivan Jr., perfectly played by young Tyler Hoechlin, after years of blissful ignorance finds out what is his father job and on what money their family live. Prompted by his curiosity and his aspiration to know truth he accidentally becomes a witness of a murder, committed by John Rooney, son of his father boss. Such discovery strikes an innocent soul and it caused numerous events that changed his life forever. The atmosphere of the period, all the backgrounds and decorations are perfectly created, editing and cinematography are almost flawless while the story is well written. But the main line of the movie, the most important moments and points of the movie and the key factor of the movie success are difficult father-son relations in bad times. They are shown so deeply, strong and believable. Tom Hanks does excellent and has one of the best performances of his career in a quite unusual role for him and all acting across the board is superb. Finally worth to mention a very nice score by Paul Newman and in the result we get an outstanding work of all people involved in making this beautiful (but one more time sad) masterpiece. I believe Road to Perdition belongs to greatest achievements of film-making of this decade and undoubtedly one of the best films of the year.My grade 10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite what you may have heard, it's an awesome movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many have either hated, loved, or been let down by this film. Hype does terrible things to the best and worst of things. Most of the reasons i have heard for not liking this film are ridiculous. Let me just tell you, if you have not seen it yet, go see it. Even if for some reason you don't think its amazing, it will be among the best films you have seen of the year anyways. Road to Perdition is a beautiful movie, both visually and in performance. Every actor here is deserving of acclaim and Academy attention, mainly Jude Law. Any emotional detachment is intentional; It is a tragic story, one of betrayal, love, bonds, and revenge. There is no doubt this film will become a classic. Don't dare compare it with Godfather: this is a GANGSTER film, not a MAFIA movie! Godfather will never be surpassed, so don't compare to it. Road to Perdition as of now is the leading Best Picture Oscar contender. Unlike past years, it deserves it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A subtle masterwork of a great forthcoming director!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This couldn't have been better. The strong restraints on Mike Sullivan's expressions couldn't have been portrayed in any other way. Tom Hanks delivers the best performance of his career. Young Tyler Hoechlin drives an emotional wheel; playing the basis character for the story. And veteran Paul Newman gives one of his best character performances in a long time.This film is based on a bold graphic novel by Max Allan Collins and Richard Piers Rayner. This is a father/son story which basically employs the two candidates solely unfit for the roles. Mike Sullivan had no father as a child, so John Rooney took him in. Although a generous man, Mr. Rooney involved himself in organized crime. Therefore, the debt of Sullivan was only to be paid off in involving himself in the business. Now, Sullivan has a wife and two children and is trying to keep his children safe, but at the same time pay back his boss. The events to follow, will test Sullivan's loyalty and embrace his family's fate.With a great adaptation by David Self, the dialogue comes out seldomly, but yet very virtuous. The story unfolds in a beautiful 1930's setting (Brilliant Art Direction by Richard L. Johnson &amp; Nancy Haigh) covered with a dark rainy (snow on the ground) exterior. Driving the story, is Thomas Newman's wonderful Irish score, settling in only when necessary.But the most important technical element in the film is Conrad L. Hall's beautiful photography. This is some of the best cinematography I've seen; and I watch a lot of films. The scene when Mike and Michael are in the car, entering Chicago is quite impressive. The shot starts at the front of the car, revealing Mike(Hanks) through the windshield. It subsequently dollys around to the side of the car, to see Michael(Hoechlin) awakening and peering out his side window. As it continues, it trucks sideways and dollys back, completely around the car and reveals a gorgeous scenic 1930's Chicago.With a great cast and crew, the principle man creates a brazenly amazing film. I'm talking about Sam Mendes, who made his feature film debut in 1999 with American Beauty. (won him various awards) Before American Beauty, Mendes worked as a play director for the British Theater, but decided that he wanted to move on saying that there was nothing new for him in theater. With only two films, Sam Mendes has marked himself in my book as one of the great directors (In a list of about twenty-five).The film illuminates a brazen genre that has its hits and misses and expresses the true theme brilliantly. The photography, acting and story is phenominal. I'm still waiting for Scorcesee's Gangs of New York, but for now, I'm fully confident in saying that this is the "Best Film of the Year". Considering it's competition (Signs, Insomnia, Minority Report) thats a strong statement.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Acting This film is a very well acted film. I will say that the performances are slightly weak at times; but for the most part, the acting is very good. The only actor that blew me away with his performance was Jude Law as Harlen Maguire. He was incredible! Tom Hanks seemed alittle unsure at at a few points throughout the film but he too was incredible. Paul Newman, good as always. Cinematography This is what made the movie a masterpiece (and I rarely use that word). Conrad Hall is a true genius. If at any point in the movie you were to pause it, you will see the delicately crafted work of this man. He sets up every shot so that nothing is left out. When the camera is still, there is a postcard like quality to the screen. When the camera is moving, every shot is planned to understated perfection. But it doesn't stop there. Conrads choice of colors and contrast between light and dark settings is a work of art. The way he lights the set is some of the most amazing lighting work I've seen. His work on this movie made it what it is. This movie is at the top of the list for best Cinematography with LOTR, Black Hawk Down, Hero, CTHD, Moulin Rouge, and Vertigo. Story People will say this movie is a 1930s gangster flick but, I believe they missed the point of the movie. It is a love story about a hit-man who fails in trying to protect his son from the life he chose. It is a brilliantly crafted story that unfolds into a beautiful bond between two people who have nothing but each other. The screen Writing is worthy of an Oscar. Music Thomas Newman conducts a sad but hopeful score to intensify this sad but hopeful story. The music is some of the most beautiful and moving scores I've herd. Direction Sam Mendes is a new director with a feel of an experienced director. The symbols he uses and the performances he gets from his actors is a rarity in todays film-making world. I will be on the lookout for the next Sam Mendes Film. 10/10 one of the most moving and beautiful movies I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved so much about this movie...the time taken to develop the characters, the attention to detail, the superb performances, the stunning lighting and cinematography, the wonderful soundtrack...It has a combined intensity and lightness of touch that won't work for anyone who wants the typical fast-paced action flick. If we lived in Elizabethan days, I'd say this movie's a bit like a Shakespearean tragedy. But since we don't, let's say it's more like a Drama-Suspense movie.The plot is simple, but the story is complex. The movie is intelligent in the way relationships and issues are explored. Much of the story is shown rather than told, which I find makes it more subtle and moving - and which also works well for a story based on a comic book (or graphic novel). At times I felt I was actually there in the 1930s, part of this story - there was such a realistic yet dream-like quality in the style of its telling.I don't often prefer movies to the books they were based upon, but in this case I do. (Though I did enjoy the book too.) I've bought the DVD, which is great because it has some wonderful deleted scenes and insightful commentary.(I also took my little cousin, who's a little younger than the boy in the movie, to see it after I saw it for the first time, because he has issues at home and I wanted to use this as a way of starting a discussion on father-son issues with him. He loved it - and the discussion.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hall Leaves On A High Note</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Conrad Hall went out with a bang. The great film photographer finished his illustrious career with this movie before passing on. He did himself proud as this is one of the best-looking crime films you'll ever see.Of course, the acting ain't bad when you have Tom Hanks and Paul Newman playing the leads! The amount of action in here is just right, too: not too much; not too little.None of the characters in here, frankly, are "good guys" as Hanks is a professional hit-man for town boss Newman. Hanks' only redeeming quality is not wanting his young son to wind up a killer like him, although he does teach him how to be the getaway man in robberies! Huh?As good as the acting is and as interesting as the story is, the real star of this film is cinematographer Hall, who paints scene after beautiful scene with his lens. His work is just awesome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Rolls-Royce Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I f you thought Sam Mendes' first film, the much heralded American BEAUTY was a movie with style to spare, wait until you see his highly anticipated second effort, the unrelentingly grim 30's gangster melodrama ROAD TO PERDITION. Some critics have hailed this new movie as a worthy successor to THE GODFATHER, a rash judgment made by several reviewers taken with Mr. Mendes' extraordinary technical prowess. If the mechanics of movie making are what make a picture great, then yes, ROAD TO PERDITION is a distant cousin to THE GODFATHER in terms of what it achieves in cinematography, editing, music scoring and sound. What it doesn't have is a resonance that all great stories and some very rare movies have that stay with the viewer long after the experience of reading or seeing it is over. As with American BEAUTY, there is a cold, distancing feel to this movie, despite some very tense scenes involving paternal love, loyalty and betrayal.This story of a hit man (Tom Hanks) and his relationship to a surrogate father - figure who is also his boss, an elderly Irish mob leader (Paul Newman) , seems to have been culled from innumerable gangster movies of years past. The father /son motif that hangs over this picture is so heavy handed in its treatment that there is not much room for spontaneity ; the entire enterprise has been very carefully wrought , and nearly all the dialog is delivered with an air of great portent : this is obviously a gangster film , hence the requisite amount of violence and bloodshed , but the film is nearly devoid of any humor to speak of ; only in scenes involving a young boy driving a getaway car in a cunningly edited montage is there any sense of lightheartedness to leaven the pervasive sense of doom.That being said , I have nothing but the highest praise for the stunning look of this film ; indeed , it is not an overstatement to say that this is one of the most beautifully photographed and designed movies I have ever seen. Veteran cameraman Conrad Hall will very likely win another Oscar for his work here . The production 's sets and costumes are just as exemplary ; in fact , the entire film is a technical marvel. Mr. Mendes continues to astonish with his vivid use of color, and he and Mr. Hall again make very dramatic use of red blood splattered against pale colored walls , all the more effective and disconcerting due to the preponderance of blacks, blues and grays that dominate the movie's color scheme.If I have failed to duly note the acting , it is not because the actors do not purport themselves ably ; everyone in the film is top notch, with special mention going to the two malevolent bad guys : Daniel Craig is the classic "man you love to hate", the spoiled, impulsive son of Newman's gangster father ; and an almost unrecognizable Jude Law as an especially slimy miscreant who goes on pursuit of Hanks and his son and figures very importantly in the film's riveting second half. But acting in a movie this dazzling is bound to take a back seat to the photographic fireworks on display here. If a Rolls-Royce was a movie , I've no doubt it would look like ROAD TO PERDITION.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes familiar, but always good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best made movies from 2002. Maybe it is not the best movie, but it looks the best, has great acting and is directed perfectly by Sam Mendes, who debuted with 'American Beauty'.It tells the story of a gangster named Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) who is seen by his son (Tyler Hoechlin) on one of his jobs. Michael's boss, John Rooney (Paul Newman), thinks things will be okay but his jealous son Connor Rooney (Daniel Craig) sets both his father and Michael up, leading to the death of Michael's wife (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and second son. Michael thinks Rooney is responsible and Rooney has to choose for himself and sends a hit-man Harlen Maguire (Jude Law) to finish the job. Since Michael is a respected man within the organization he tries to win some friends who can help him including mob boss Frank Nitti (Stanley Tucci).In a way 'Road to Perdition' is a standard gangster movie but it is so well made you almost can not see that. This movie is good in its production design, art direction, sound, music and most of all in its cinematography. All these elements are able to surprise and create suspense although the outcome is pretty certain. That Hoechlin is not a annoying kid and Hanks, Law and Newman know how to act helps, of course.Based on a comic this movie is so much better than you would expect and although it has it flaws it belongs to the better movies in the genre. Sometimes there are events where you realize you have seen it so many times before, but for some reason it also feels fresh at the same time. The scenes between the adult Hanks and the child Hoechlin help in that area. See this movie that will look familiar at times but is totally new on a lot of areas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frankly, this movie has gone over the heads of most of its detractors.The opposite of perdition (being lost) is salvation (being saved) and this movie is one of a very few to deal with those two concepts. The movie also explores the love and disappointments that attend the father-son relationship. It should be noted at the outset that none of these are currently fashionable themes.The premise is that the fathers in the move, hit-man Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) and his crime boss John Rooney (Paul Newman), love their sons and will do anything to protect them. But Rooney's son Connor is even more evil than the rest. He kills one of Rooney's loyal soldiers to cover up his own stealing from his father. When Connor learns that Sullivan's son Michael witnessed it, he mistakenly kills Sullivan's other son (and Sullivan's wife) in an attempt to silence witnesses.Sullivan decides he wants revenge at any price, even at the terribly high price of perdition. Rooney, who in one scene curses the day Connor was born, refuses to give up his son Connor to Sullivan, and hires a contract killer named Maguire (Jude Law) to kill Sullivan and his son. So Rooney joins his son Connor on the Road to Perdition.For the rest of the movie, accompanied by his surviving son young Michael, Sullivan pursues Connor Rooney down the Road to Perdition, and Maguire pursues Sullivan. When Sullivan confronts Rooney in a Church basement, and demands that he give up Connor because Connor murdered his family, Rooney says - "Michael, there are only murderers in this room,.., and there's only one guarantee, none of us will see Heaven." As the movie ends, somewhat predictably, one character is saved and one character repents.I'm not a big Tom Hanks fan, but he does step out of character to play hit-man Sullivan convincingly, giving a subtle and laconic performance. Newman does well as the old Irish gangster Rooney, showing a hard edge in his face and manner, his eyes haunted by Connor's misdeeds. Jude Law plays Maguire in a suitably creepy way. Tyler Hoechlin plays Young Michael naturally and without affectation.The cinematography constantly played light off from darkness, echoing the themes of salvation and perdition. The camera drew from a palette of greens and greys. The greys belonged to the fathers and the urban landscapes of Depression era Illinois. The greens belonged to the younger sons and that State's rural flatlands. Thomas Newman's lush, sonorous and haunting music had faint Irish overtones and was played out in Copland-like arrangements. The sets were authentic mid-Western urban - factories, churches. The homes shone with gleaming woodwork.The excellence of the movie lies in its generation of a unique feeling out of its profound themes, distinctive acting, and enveloping music and cinematography. The only negative was a slight anti-gun message slipped into the screenplay y, the movie's only nod to political correctness.I give this movie a10 out of 10; in time it will be acknowledged as a great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>`Road to Perdition' is a rocky road of revenge and reconciliation, punctuated by some gorgeous Conrad Hall cinematography. Tom Hanks is a 1930's mob hit man whose 12 year-old son sees him commit a murder. The rest of Director Sam Mendes' (`American Beauty') film is the boy's coming to terms with that knowledge. Paul Newman plays a `godfather,' a father to his errant son and like a father to Hanks.Laced throughout are 3 father-son relationships, which seem to move toward the violent ends reserved for mobsters. Hanks' son is ambivalent about his dad, whom he seems to adore yet hold accountable for his crimes. Newman's son is like Sonny Corleone, too loose to be in charge and no heir apparent; Hanks owes his lifestyle to Newman-all these relationships are subsumed by the business needs of the larger organization.This is noir with a dark palette, costuming in clothes metaphorically heavy, and sounding often as stylized and minimal as the murders Hanks commits. `Road to Perdition' lacks the grandeur of Coppola's `Godfather' epic, but it succeeds in evoking an old-testament judicial system where eye meets eye and tooth savages tooth. The revenge motif is too dominant to let the film rest on the promising father-son motif.Hanks' son learns about morality and decides about following in his father's footsteps. Hanks gives another controlled performance, and Paul Newman lets us know there is room for one more powerful screen godfather.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Performances Paper Over Any Minor Flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ROAD TO PERDITION can be summed up by Thomas Newman's score . It's haunting and beautiful but you're aware that this music is similar to Newman's other work and while listening to the soundtrack you're reminded of SCENT OF A WOMAN , MEETING JOE BLACK and THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION you're reminded of other films as the story unfolds on screen . As the Sullivans drive round America trying to escape from a psychotic hit man you think of THE GETAWAY , Irish gangsters is MILLER'S CROSSING whilst the subtext of guilt and redemption can be summed up by Coppola and Leone's gangster epics. Despite having a seen it all before feel this shouldn't be taken as a heavy criticism of Sam Mendes film which I repeat is haunting and beautiful and the only flaws that work against it is a very slow opening twenty minutes and I was slightly confused as the events that caused Michael Sullivan to be betrayed . But if you stop to consider how much of a sentimental mess Spielberg might have made with the story that revolves around a father and his twelve year old son running for their lives you can't help thinking what a superb director Mendes is ROAD TO PERDITION is a film where the entire cast give flawless performances . I've never been all that keen on Tom Hanks but he's every bit as good here as he has been in any starring role , probably better . Paul Newman plays a character with an Irish accent but at no point did I believe I was watching an American screen legend putting on a false accent - Newman's performance works due to the subtle body language , his character is torn up by guilt but Newman never milks it or goes over the top . While never upstaging Newman who gives the best performance in the movie the two Brit supporting actors Craig and Law are also very memorable as American gangsters and while Law will still have a long career as a leading actor one wonders how Daniel Craig might have progressed as a character actor if he hadn't decided to become James Bond , a role which heralds the end of an actors career</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest movies of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having been driven out of the house and into the theater by the sweltering heat, I could not have been more pleased. The Road to Perdition, directed by Sam Mendes (American Beauty), is destined to become one of the greatest movies of all time. Perhaps I'm just getting old; perhaps I've just seen the same themes recycled time and again. But this movie is indeed different.The story opens with young Michael Sullivan Jr. facing out to the sea, contemplating the duality of his father's legacy -- one of the best men to ever live, one of the most evil. This duality snakes its way throughout the movie. The story revolves around crime boss John Rooney (Paul Newman) and Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks), the young man Rooney once took in and who now serves as his personal "Angel of Death." Rooney is tied by blood to his own son, but tied by love and loyalty to Michael. Young Michael Jr., intrigued by the stories he reads, steals away in his father's car one night while Dad goes off to "work" with Connor Rooney, heir to the family "business." Connor lets the situation get out of hand, and what was meant only to be a warning turns into murder -- witnessed by Michael Jr. Upon the discovery that young Michael has seen what he should not have seen, the plot is set in motion as conflicting loyalties collide. Soon, Michael Sr. is on the run with his young son, pursued by contract killer Harlen "The Reporter" Maguire (Jude Law).I will disclose no further details in order to avoid any potential spoilers. However, I strongly encourage viewers to examine the many dualities that present themselves in the movie: Problems between sons and fathers (Michael Sr &amp; Jr., John Rooney &amp; son Connor), between the world at home and the world at "work", between good and evil, between those who pretend to be men of god and those who really are, between "clean" money and "dirty", between the town of Perdition and Perdition as hell. And along the way, savor the visual brilliance of cinematographer Conrad L. Hall (9 nominations, 2 oscars for best cinematography): rain pouring off fedoras, shots through mirrors (especially on swinging doors), tommy-gun flashes from out of the shadows, absent any sound. Not only has 75-year-old Hall given us perhaps the best cinematic product of his career, but 77-year-old Paul Newman offers one of his best performances ever.Yes ... I may be getting old. But I've seen a lot ... and this is fresh and invigorating. The Road to Perdition presents a lasting and loving tribute to the gangster genre, to films of the 40s, to dark comic-book figures lurking in the darkness, to villains and heroes, to American film in general. Go see it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An innocent lad gets involved in his father's underworld business by accident. This is my interpretation of the film. I don't doubt that director's intentions were the same but I think it was either poor execution of the idea or may be screenplay did not have anything new at all in the first place. I think it was all about cool shots in the rain, lighting and camera movement. Road to perdition would have been a much better film if it was not hijacked by the cinematographer. Through out the film shots are so well composed that you forget the character itself. It looks as if you are sitting in front of a TV to witness composition of each frame and not the story. I think the story is good for one hour. In the first half an hour you don't know what's going on and that the only interesting part. Once you know the characters there's nothing to watch except for rain, suits and car. Extremely overrated film. Acting wise I don't think there was a scope for any great stuff. Recommended only for film students. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start this off by saying this movie is beautiful. By a technical standpoint, perfection was achieved. I'll remember this movie as proof of example; outstanding direction/cinematography cannot fully compensate for a lackluster plot.On paper, the plot is an average set up. Relationships in a crime family are tested, but none are ever stretched too far. In this sense it feels somewhat familiar and not very original.But what does keep this movie from being average-blah, is the care put into EVERY shot. I give a huge amount of credit to the cinematographer. A good amount of noticeable techniques were used. I particularly liked one symmetrical pillar shot that used a zoom in dolly in trick. A slight variation of the Vertigo introduced, zoom in dolly out.But with all of these wonderful shots I noticed something. There was so much technically stunning camera work, I found myself completely drawn out of the story. Was this done intentionally? To some degree I think so. This nicely compliments the dark and rainy 1930's settings.Noticing this I tried to put more thought into the plot. There basically was none. The characters were cold and lacked development. Any dialog is important and used sparingly. I couldn't stop myself from drawing comparison to The Godfather. What Road to Perdition lacks is any underlying intensity between the characters. I never feel like they were a tight-knit family and do feel as if I'm simply watching characters play their parts. The story has no poetry and feels more like a collection of parts that aren't worth its sum.I appreciate it in its stunning visuals, but once the credit rolled I felt nothing. And I find no reason to return back to it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tom Hanks at his finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a beautiful film. The true tale of bond between father and son. This is by far, Tom Hanks at his finest. Tom Hanks is really out of the box in this movie. He usually has the nice guy roles. Yet in this film,he comes off in this film as a bit gritty, but still emerges smelling like a rose, even until the very last scene, the assassination of his character. The cast of this movie was well put together. I also love the part when there is total silence when Tom Hanks' character shoots and kills all of the men in Mr. Rooney's group. There is something chilling and yet profound about no sound in that scene, just simply emotion. I love the look on John Rooney, Paul Newman's character's face when he realizes even before seeing him, that it is Tom Hanks's character getting revenge, and he knows his fate has come. The first time I saw this movie I was blown away and knew I had to go out and get the video and I since have, adding it to my collection of my all time favorite movies.Tom Hanks is my favorite actor, so this film has a special place in me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Sullivan works for John Rooney. When Sullivan's son, Mike, hides in Sullivan's car to find out what he actually does for Rooney he finds that his father is a hired gun, a gangster if you will. Mike sees his father and Rooney's son Connor kill three men. Connor begins to suspect that Mike could tell someone and thus expose that Connor is stealing his father's money and goes to kill the family. His attempt on Mike and Sullivan fails but his wife and other son are dead. Sullivan and his son take to the road, with Sullivan's desire for his son's safety only slightly behind his desire for revenge on Connor.I have a problem with modern films. No. I have a problem with how modern films are hyped. Can't anything just be good anymore? It seems everything either has to be rubbish or a masterpiece. Look how many films jump straight into high positions in the imdb 250 list to see what I mean. But on top of that films are advertised as being amazing etc rather than slightly more subdued messages.Here we have the `best gangster film ever made' and `better than the Godfather'. Neither of these statements are true but that's not to say that it is rubbish. It's a good, often wonderful film that is as good in some ways as it is poor in others. I was lucky to approach it with not having read reviews and mostly managing to miss the `epic' trailers that are everywhere ? and I was the better for it, with no expectation then you can't be let down!The plot is a little predictable in how it develops and where it ends, but it's still enjoyable. The weakness of it however is the use (or misuse) or the parental theme. Where was it? The foundations were laid with Sullivan and his son, Rooney with his son and a father/son thing between Sullivan and Rooney. But what was done with it? Very little ? apart from some minor bonding between the two Michaels. It felt like there was more there that either wasn't or didn't come out. The story felt heavy at points too, the relationship between the two Michaels didn't flow and there were too many scenes which felt ponderous. I didn't want more action but I wanted it tighter or at least with a bit more soul behind the dialogue and the characters.The cast is like a heavy weight boxer and therefore I did expect it to hit harder. To be blunt ? Hanks is not right for this role. A lot was made out of him being a `bad guy' but was he really playing a bad guy? He tries hard to not overplay it and lose the audience but I felt the film was trying to give him as much moral leeway as possible. The majority of his killings are in the name of revenge which, in film morals, is fine. The only killing before the death of his family we don't see him do, and we have him say `we're just going to talk?' before hand and then shout at his partner for putting him in a killing situation. Compare this to Leon (aka The Professional) ? he is cold and ruthless and we love him more for his emotional growth and love. Here Hanks only really shines when being friendly or in the rare comedy moments. I felt he laced the ability, the desire or maybe the audience acceptance to be able to play `bad' and take his character beyond it into a development.Newman is good in a few scenes but isn't working too hard for his money. His role is good but it's at his tiredest when he does well. Law is excellent despite his cartoon villain character ? he is best in his early scenes and his first meeting with Sullivan is good. Tucci is good and Leigh is good for all she has to do. Craig is good value and is very well cast. Hoechlin is very good and deserves the Oscar nomination that he will no doubt get for supporting actor. But none of these were the powerhouse performances I had hoped for with such a top class cast available.The star of the film is Mendes himself. People were surprised by how well he directed in his debut and if he got an Oscar for that then he simply must have one for this. Ignoring the weaknesses in plot, pacing and some of the performances, visually this is stunning. Normal shots from cars and of snow are really well set up and shot, while the tour de force is a shoot out in the silence, in the rain where the camera's focus is on one man's resignation and almost ignores the carnage all around. The clichés of the plot and the slight ponderous feel of the beast may distract but I found myself admiring the shots and noticing the imagination Mendes showed in his direction. There are so many well directed or clever scenes in this that I almost forgot that this was not the norm for films.Overall it isn't rubbish and it isn't the best gangster film ever made?. Instead it is a good film about parental relationships and revenge that doesn't really address either. Instead it feels sluggish at times and could have had more spark from a talented and deep cast. But Mendes makes everything feel and look clever and makes the film better. `A really good multiplex experience despite the failings' ? put that one your poster!</fullReview>

The instruments mix are very beautiful. The actors are amazing in different levels. I love the Tom Haks character, Paul Newman are incredible for the boss, &amp; Jude Law looks very lethal. I love this movie a lot &amp; I consider the cult classic of the 2000 movies. I haven't seen a decent gangster movie since Goodfellas by Martin Scorsese &amp; Miller's crossing by Coen Brothers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Road To Perdition' is essentially a 'Bugsy Malone' for grown-ups affair with shoot em-up violence lifted straight out of Dick Tracy and a boring, moralistic script occupying the space once reserved for musical numbers and splurge-guns. The worst thing about it, is the unbelievable miscasting of the three leads: Hanks, Newman and Law. I can only assume they were cast in a moment of madness as they fail quite spectacularly to bring any depth or conviction to their roles. Jude Law can spend an eternity in the 'ugly chair' trying to bust-up his middle class mummy's boy good looks, but he will never, ever ever, convince anyone in a trillion years that he's a psychotic killer cos' he will always look like the big girls blouse he so blatantly is! The less said about Tom Hanks, the better and as for Paul Newman...it just breaks my heart that this was to be his swansong. R.I.P.

		<fullReview>There's a lot of solemnity and slowness in Sam Mendes' gangster flick 'Road to Peridition': unfortunately, this is not enough to make it a serious movie. Tom Hanks is almost unrecognisable as a hard-man (it's amazing what a little bit of stubble will do), but film buys into too many of the standard Hollywood clichés. This is a world where revenge is always justified; and where there are bad gangsters but also good ones, who only kill when provoked, who love their families, and who can mow down an entire mafia of wrong 'uns to boot. Morevoer, the film gets worse as it progresses, and the eventual ending is completely corny. I always thought 'American Beauty' was less subversive than its fans would acknowledge; 'Road to Peridition' contains not a single subversive idea. This is a watchable film, but ultimately a disappointing one as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tom Hanks has been in such hit movies as Forrest Gump, Saving Private Ryan, and The Green Mile. For the most part, his roles have been good guys that we cheer for. In Road to Perdition, his character Michael Sullivanis a little bit different.In Sam Mendes' film Road to Perdition based on the graphic novel by Max Allan Collins, he shows the story of a man and his son on the road during the Great Depression in Chicago. What is different about this little road trip is that Sullivan is a hit-man who is now being hunted by his former partner. His boss or ex-boss John Rooney (Paul Newman) loves him almost more than his own son, Sullivan's partner Connor (Daniel Craig).After a job done the wrong way because of Connor, the only witness to his mistake are Sullivan and his son who wasn't supposed to be there. So Connor tries to take out Sullivan and his family, but only gets the wife and other son Peter. Sullivan outsmarts the hit and rushes home to find Michael Jr. sitting at the table...just sitting. With his wife and child dead, Sullivan takes to the road to find answers.The story follows the two as Sullivan tries to make things right in memory of his wife and kid, and for Michael who feels like he is to blame for all this. He feels his curiosity killed his mother and brother. Tyler Hoechlin does a terrific job as Michael Jr. He brings maturity and also a sense of still being juvenile. His loss of innocence is well acted out as he travels from town to town, leaving nothing behind him.Mendes' previous hit film was American Beauty which received five Oscars including Best Picture and Best Director. This film didn't do nearly as well at the Oscars only winning one award for best cinematography but receiving five other nominations for music, sound, and a Best Actor in a Supporting Role for Paul Newman. This picture is a great story that takes you on a ride through the Midwest and into the legend of Mike Sullivan: husband, hit-man, and devoted father. This movie is a sleeper film that should be watched for years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best films in recent years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Road to Perdition was one of the best films in the last ten years. It is lyrical, like a great opera, not to be appreciated by the masses (or, as Harlan Ellison calls them, "the great wad"). Thus it is misunderstood by the common man - and yet this film is all about him! The great longing of the unredemptive soul, the deep sorrows of the empty heart, the yearning for something or someplace beyond the horrid commonality of everyday existence. It is more than a morality, or a simple "ode to an earlier time." It is a "gangster film" like 2001 is a "sci-fi flick." Such subterranean musings are best left to the multiplex neophyte, the Spielberg-wannabe troglodyte. This film was under-appreciated because of its predecessor, the director's Academy award-winning opus to immorality and deviant behavior, "American Beauty." It is as if Mr. Mendes emerged from pupae stage and became a lovely Emperor butterfly with the making of this movie. (Perhaps we should thank the lovely and immensely talented Ms. Winslet -?) What can be said about Tom Hanks? Stand up comic indeed! More than a "Jimmy Stewart for our times" he is - it can finally be said - one of the finest actors on the planet. Road to Perdition is a masterpiece that will echo throughout time and film history more for the sum of its parts (perfect cinematography, perfect casting, etc) than for any simplistic reason that has to do with gunfights and car chases.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this film! I'm a true Tom Hanks fan, and I have always been impressed with all of his work. From his most dramatic roles like Cast Away, The Green Mile, Saving Private Ryan, Forrest Gump, Apollo 13 &amp; Philadelphia. To his hilarious roles like A League of Their Own, Turner and Hooch, Catch Me If You Can, The Lady Killers, Big &amp; of course Toy Story. But in this film Hanks isn't the only great actor who lights up the screen. Tyler Hoechlin, an up and coming star who shows great promise in Hollywood co stars as Hanks son and delivers nothing short of a great performance. He is certainly someone to watch out for over his career, I believe he will do great things. Paul Newman as always delivers a brilliant performance on screen. He is truly a legend. We can't forget the people who didn't have such big roles in the film, but still helped make it great. The beautiful &amp; very talented Jennifer Jason Leigh, who's performance in Bastard Out of Carolina &amp; Single White Female I will never forget, brings her grace to the screen as Hank's wife in the film and does a superb job. Liam Aiken is another found treasure in film. He does such a great job with such a small role, and like his roles in Lemony Snickets, and Sweet November, and I Dreamed Of Africa he gives a great performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>AKA the Road to Bogus City (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seldom does a movie fail on so many levels and in so many genres.As a Coming of Age Story it's unrealistic. Anyone whose entire family had been shot dead, and was on the run from both police and the mob (oh sure, Capone just forgave him taking all that money) isn't going to be a faux, philosophical boy-man. They're going to be an emotional basket case.As a Depression Era Gangster Movie it's shallow. We learn nothing about Chicago, the gangs, the Depression (everybody looks plenty rich in this movie) or even Sullivan himself. Everyone and everything is a complete cipher. This movie could have taken place in any decade of the 1900s and wouldn't have been a bit different.As a Revenge Flick it's hokey. One well-known guy and his punk son take on the Capone Mob and the "Rooneys"? Yeah, sure.As a Father and Son Caper movie it's unintentionally hilarious. "Gee Dad, let's rob a bank today. C'mon, let's shoot some guys. Dad, Dad, I wanna go ambush the Capone Mob!!" "No, son. You must not grow up to be a gangster like me. You should let creepy Jude Law kill you because it's better to be a dead innocent youth than a stone cold killa like your old man."And so on. Some parts are just ridiculous beyond belief. Jude Law is after Tom Hanks and Son under orders to kill them. He sees them making a telephone call, and oh-so-cleverly picks up the phone after they've left and pretends to have been disconnected. He finds out where they're going. Why the hell does he even care? Why doesn't he just *kill them right there and then?!?*The boy is doing a voiceover (in the same voice he used during the movie) about how "that was the last time I touched a gun." Last time since when, boyo? A few weeks ago? If this is supposed to be Grown Up Gangster's Son, why is he reminescing in a kid's voice?Speaking of winter, boy Chicago sure has some mild ones, huh?Tom Hanks ambushes the "Rooneys" (what a dumb name for a gangster clan) from the shadows and starts blasting them with a tommie gun that has about a 1000 round clip. In classic Hollywood style, nobody dives for cover. They just stand there and get shot. Paul Newman never goes for his gun. He stands there and waits for Hanks to come up and shoot him point blank. Yep.Jude Law, dead guy photographer. I guess the police are so corrupt that they never ask questions about why Law is killing off people himself. Creepy Jude Law is becoming a fixture, the next Crispin Glover. When you see his name, you can be almost certain there will be some "psycho" character in the film. Oh, he's a brilliant hitman too. Instead of waiting outside the diner and plugging Hanks when he's finished eating, and killing the sleeping boy in the car, Law goes in there and sits right down and starts talking to him, setting the scene for Hanks to escape. Brilliantly Stupid.But the worse part of the whole mess is the director's inability to decide what story he wants to tell. He does 30mins of Gangster film, 30 of Father/Son bonding, 25 of chase across the Midwest, etc. Even the title isn't immune from this kind of inability to focus. Road to Perdition has a clever, and draining, double-meaning since that's where the Aunt lives, in someplace called "Perdition." Uh-huh. God, that's dumb. Lame "symbolic" names are the nadir of poor writing.And the message in this whole mess? "Admire me, son, but don't grow up to be like me." That kid would have needed a whole lotta therapy to even be able to grow up at all.There's no reason to give this piece of ill-conceived garbage more than 2 stars. It looks pretty and it has a great soundtrack. Apparently, that's all you need these days to have critics talking about "Oscars". Hah! Road to Bogus City didn't get more than a few token nominations. It didn't deserve anything more.Hm, maybe the Academy isn't as blind as I thought it was.RstJ Salem, Oregon</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An emotional tale of redemption lifts the genre standards once again - 87%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After gorging myself on a variety of seemingly immature movies purchased on ex-rental DVDs, I figured that the time was right for a little serious drama and who better to provide it than Sam Mendes? For a number of reasons, "American Beauty" doesn't appeal to me as much as this film which is easily the darkest thing that Tom Hanks has ever done and probably one of the most underrated films of the last decade. For this is not a simple gangster tale lifted from its graphic novel origins, and is simply wonderful to watch because of it. And despite my usual allergy to any film with Tom Hanks' name on it (still can't watch "Big" without wanting a cat to kick), I'm glad I gave this a try because this is one of those movies that you'll kick yourself for if you miss it.Normally squeaky-clean Hanks plays Michael Sullivan, a devoted family man and father of two sons growing up during Prohibition in the early 1930's. He is also a professional hit-man to mob boss John Rooney (Paul Newman) but has managed to keep his job a secret from his sons. But after his eldest (Tyler Hoechlin) witnesses his dad involved in a mob killing, the pair are forced to go on the run as John seeks to tidy the matter up. Soon, father and son are pursued to Chicago where a fellow hit-man (a menacing Jude Law) is waiting for them.On the face of it, it reads like a pretty standard gangster film but as I've said, this isn't really about gangsters at all. It's about the relationship between a father and son thrown together in the most tragic of circumstances. Hanks is (*grits teeth*) superb as the tortured man who finds out that everything has its price and little Hoechlin is also good as Sullivan's son. In all honesty, there is not a single performance that I could single out as weaker than the others - the cast is pretty much faultless. As is the cinematography and costumes (and it's not often I praise costumes!) which recreates the 30's with stunning effect. There has been so much effort to get everything right and it pays off in spades. This could easily have looked rubbish - they admit that the early 30's look was difficult to put down - but it doesn't and that deserves every bit of credit. Chicago especially looks fantastic, lined with hundreds of rickety cars from the era and filled with people in monochrome suits and hats. True time-travel, even if a little CGI is needed.The story is also a winner, offering a human face to what is often seen as a stereotypical genre of movie villain. Law is surprisingly menacing as the almost mechanical killer Maguire and proves that you don't have to be Cagney or De Niro or Brando to play a gangster. The film is decidedly noir-ish, driving rain and ill-lit warehouses predominate but at least violence and killing are (finally) seen to have an emotional and psychological impact on those who perpetrate and those who merely witness such acts. The whole thing is evocative of a previous age and previous movies but it sweeps away the old and refreshes with a modern tale of redemption amid the Tommy-Gun shootouts and extortion rackets. It can feel a little slow in places, especially if you're used to masses of gun-play in movies like most modern audiences (like yours truly) but sometimes, words can speak louder than actions. Mendes has delivered a fine follow-up to his Oscar-winning debut, a film which is as intelligent as it is beautiful to watch. "Road To Perdition" may not be to everyone's tastes but this is one DVD I shall not be exchanging anytime soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Road to redemption</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Road to Perdition is one of the few films that tries to recreate the film noir genre, while basking in the modern light. Its use of light, shadow, and water can all be classified as stylistic, and its cinematography could also get it elected into a genre so admirable. The film follows Michael Sullivan Sr. (Hanks), a hit man working for an Irish Mob boss (Newman) in 1930's Illinois. Sullivan has a loving wife (Leigh) and two plucky kids Peter (Aiken) and Michael Jr. (Hoechlin), yet tries to keep his sons oblivious to his involvement in the mobster lifestyle.One day, Michael Jr. sneaks out to see his father and a mentally unstable mob member Connor (Craig) murder a man in a warehouse. Despite assuring Jr. won't tell anyone, Connor goes to Sullivan's house late one night and kills his wife and his youngest son Peter, mistaking him for Jr. While Sullivan and Jr. flee to Chicago, it isn't long before Sullivan's former mob boss sends an assassin (Law) to track him down and kill him. The film becomes a relentless journey of trying to leave behind an old lifestyle and start a brand new one through a child.What must be lauded is the use of dark and grim cinematography; the last work of Conrad L. Hall who died shortly after the film was completed. When the film is dark, it is still beautifully lit by source lighting and little intricate elements such as headlights and streetlights. From what I've seen of the graphic novel, written by Max Allan Collins, it was, like the film, ominous, dark, and very, very serene.Road to Perdition also has a great amount of symbolism, which I favor over ambiguity any day. One of its biggest motifs is in the use of water and rain. The event is woven in when death comes up in the film, sort of commenting on the randomness of humanity and the fact that death, like rain, is instantaneous and sometimes virtually unpredictable. Rather than being blatant, it's woven in the film so naturally and subtly you may miss it.Hanks gives an electrifying performance as a stressed father, focused on achieving redemption through his son. He believes that the sins he committed are unforgivable and irredeemable. All his life he has been involved with complex underground operations, contentious relationships, and secrecy from his loved-ones. He feels he hasn't been a proper father, and believes his son can do way better. On a little side-note, the acting from both Tyler Hoechlin and Jude Law is excellent as well, and audiences should pay attention to little side performances that will likely go unnoticed because of a lot of enigma on screen.This is a cold, bittersweet film for much of its runtime. It's hard to watch and difficult to recommend. It doesn't strive to be so much a gritty, honest mobster tale as it does try to be a parable of father and son relationships and a tragic take on innocence lost. I think many will agree that Road to Perdition is a pretty shameless Hollywood film. From voiceovers, to big name stars, to cinematography, to storytelling, to the hefty budget, to morals, writing, and tone, it's all the components of a straight-forward Hollywood tale. That's not a bad thing. I, for one, would rather see a big budget Hollywood epic than a poorly done, incompetent indie work. It isn't until that indie work has proved itself to be more than meets the eye will I choose it over a Hollywood epic.Starring: Tom Hanks, Paul Newman, Jude Law, Daniel Craig, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Liam Aiken, and Tyler Hoechlin. Directed by: Sam Mendes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"...sons are put on this Earth to trouble their fathers."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this film four or five times now and it never ceases to amaze. There's both power and nuance in the performances of the principal players, totally miscast some would say, with Tom Hanks as a gangster/hit-man, and Paul Newman as an organized crime boss who's been like a father to him. That presumption is totally without merit, as both actors deliver incredible performances in this tale of betrayal and revenge set in the winter of 1931.With each viewing, I'm more and more impressed with the subtleties offered by the actors and director alike. Consider the following scenes - the Sullivan's abandoning their home along with young Michael's innocence as symbolized by the bike left behind to rust in the snow; the bead of sweat meandering down the side of Michael's face in the diner scene opposite his intended assassin (Jude Law); son Michael's negotiating for two hundred dollars as his share of the bank jobs; the hit on Connor (Daniel Craig) as viewed via his reflection in the swinging door of the bathroom in which he died.This is a finely crafted tale that demands close attention. Initially, one would believe that the elder Rooney (Newman) ordered the hit on Michael Sullivan with that visit to Calvino. But it was Connor's doing all the way, then botching the rubout of the remaining family by only taking out the wife and younger son. The senior Rooney's angst is palpable, realizing that his own flesh and blood is inept and unworthy of forgiveness, but unable to reconcile his fatherly instinct to preserve his own. The single fault I find with the characterization of the principals is during the failed attempt on Sullivan in the hotel room. After Maguire (Law) is disabled by the shards of glass, the elder Michael should have put an end to the chase right there.Interestingly, the story makes clever use of placing real life gangsters in the story's plot, naming Mafia kingpin Al Capone as an off screen presence, and using his top henchman Frank Nitti (Stanley Tucci) to bridge an untenable truce between the rival parties. The violence in the picture is never overdone, unless one is squeamish about the up close and personal type of vengeance as administered by professional hit men.With any other film, the ending might have been a tear jerker affair, but there were no clean hands here. All of the principal characters were flawed in their own way, including young Michael, portrayed by Tyler Hoechlin in a stellar role. Narrated from the perspective of a twelve year old son's coming of age, "Road to Perdition" earns it's place as one of the top gangster films of the modern era.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Absolute Masterpiece,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Road to Perdition is a simply amazing movie that was sadly overlooked at the Oscars. The acting was brilliant and I, who am not normally a fan of Tom Hanks, was simply blown away by his performance. Not only Hanks but Paul Newman and Jude Law were also great. Combined with a poignant story and stunning cinematography Road to Perdition is one of the best movies I've seen in ages.The story of a relatively well-off family living during the dark times of depression. 13-year-old Michael Sullivan Jr. has no idea that the family's money comes from his father job as a hit-man for the local mafia and when he begins looking for the truth his life changes forever as he accidentally becomes a witness to a murder.An amazing feat of storytelling and cinematography (not to mention acting), Road to Perdition really is a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really would like to say that this was one of the most beautifully done movies I have every seen. (And I'm not talking about cinematography)The actors were superb, the setting was amazing and The theme behind it was really amazing and there was a message behind it. There was a bond between the father and his son. The movie has heart. It has a real meaning and a real message. And that's hard to find sometimes. The end it stands out in my mind. It has been almost two years since I've seen it, and it still sticks with me. It is a true gem. This is not a movie with the dazzling special effects, but it doesn't have to be... It's the message behind it that counts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bringing it all back home</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although i'm not a great fan of Tom Hanks, for once he manages to reveal a new darker side to his gestalt in this film. This said, there are many aspects of RtP that are very familiar to this particular genre and as with its more genial predecessor "Good Fellas" it brings certain conventions of the genre back home. Paul Newman's performance as a long-in-the-tooth mob boss is menacing in its understatement. The reference to Irish-American gangs is reminiscent of an earlier classic gangster film - "Public Enemy" and this is where much of the films appeal is. The rise and fall of the gangster is a classic theme but seldom has it been done with such elegance as of Sam Mendez' direction. The settings add to this effect with the almost paradoxical swing from city to country as Jude Law's chaplinesque hit-man character pursues Hanks and son to an inevitable ending. Some of these scenes are again familiar, with references to "Bonnie and Clyde". A good if old fashioned story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition is one of the best things that have come out of Hollywood in a while. As he proved before with his great film, American Beauty, he outdoes himself with this story set in the Chicago of the 30s at the height of the Prohibition Era.The story of the relationship between Mike Sullivan and his son, Michael is translated by Mr. Mendes for the screen with a lot of panache, which seems to be his style, and we're never bored by what we are being shown on screen. The writers, Max Allan Collins and Richard Piers Rayner, have done a great job in their treatment of the story. The great cinematography by the American genius photographer, Conrad Hall, should be noted as well. It gives a "look" of the somber days, depicted on this film, by adding another layer of depth in the overall effect the director obviously wanted to create, one in which the dark tones of the sets used, give us a feeling of what it was like being there as silent witnesses to the story.Tom Hanks is very effective as Mike Sullivan, but the revelation here is how a great Paul Newman is with the proper direction and vehicle. He surpasses his past work. Paul Newman, with only a gesture, can convey a richness of emotions. Jude Law was the only principal whose character seems to be a bit far-fetched, and somehow, we just can't believe this man. He's too good to be true.Tyler Hoechlin was excellent as young Michael. He's a natural who can hold his own playing against Hanks and Newman. Let's hope the people behind him steer him in the right direction so that he'll have a great career.Congratulations to Sam Mendes. He's an original who really understands his craft and knows what to do in order to make a film like this stay in our minds. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not about gangsters, but about how ineffectual feeling-centric "new men" fantasize themselves as gangsters.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(NOTE: Certain plot details are given below. It is not crucial to enjoyment of the movie for these to come as surprises, but if you don't want to know anything at all about the plot, please skip this review.)Road to Perdition certainly got me thinking--but not about anything the filmmakers would likely have cared for me to address. The main realization I came away with was how difficult it can be to sit through a movie when what's going on is not convincing.The first signal that something might be awry comes with Tom Hanks' initial appearance. After having read a lot about the "dark side" of him that's revealed in this film, I was shocked to find a lack of anything powerful, ominous, or menacing about his presence. He mainly just looks nervous and uptight.The story itself begins to ring untrue when Hanks' son, the morning after having witnessed a murder, sasses his parents and refuses to attend to his dirty dishes. Hanks and his wife quietly sit there, shooting each knowing glances that say, "Uh oh. Acting out. Wonder what's up here?" This may be a typical enough reaction for contemporary parents, but for 1931? None of the kids I grew up with in the **1950s** would have dared backsass their dads that way. Nor would any credible parents have allowed it--no matter how much they might also have inwardly wondered what was wrong. And for a mob enforcer to be doing this?Hanks later returns home one evening to find his wife and one of his two sons shot to death in his home. The other son is still in the house--extremely vulnerable to a return attack, once the killer realizes he's hit the wrong boy. Hanks makes no immediate effort to get his surviving son out of the house, or otherwise protect him in any way. He simply sits boo-hooing in the hallway. The problem is not with the emotion itself, but with how he deals with it--in a way that rings jarringly false for a man who earns his living by winning life-and-death contests.Shortly after the killing, Hanks' character approaches mob boss Frank Nitti for a job with his Chicago organization. Although he has no idea how he'll be received (he might be summarily killed), he immediately blurts out his need for vengeance. Is this how a powerful and streetwise man behaves in the company of cunning, devious, and ruthless killers?Or consider the behavior of Hanks and his son in their car, on the run, out in farm country. They spot a diner, and Hanks pulls in. Although there's lots of graveled space in back of the diner, Hanks parks right up in front, putting his well-known car on display to the world.Hanks next tries to convince his son that upcoming meals will be few and far between, so he ought to eat something--but calmly accepts his son's demurral. (He's a 1931 father, mind you, and he knows it will be important for their survival to eat when they can; but if he just told his son to eat something, apparently that might be imposing on his delicate feelings, or sense of independence, or whatever.)Not only that, but Hanks agrees to let the boy sit reading by himself **out in the car,** where he can't even see him--but every passing driver can--all the while parked conspicuously in front of a diner, when killers are out scouring the countryside for him. (Hanks is hungry, but his son won't agree to go in. What's a father to do? The more protective options of bringing his son in with him or skipping his own meal apparently never occur to him.)In another scene, following a harrowing brush with a contract killer, in which the boy won't even *duck* when his father tells him to--**while they're being shot at**--Hanks angrily informs his boy that he's got to "start listening" to him, because of all the scary things that people other than Dad might do, if the son keeps on disobeying. Here Hanks' true character is finally revealed. He's not an authority figure; he's not a strong protector; he's not even in any way effectual. He's just a late-1990s mommy-daddy, braying out contemporary "parenting" catchphrases (no doubt learned from his wife) in a Richard Simmons voice: "Now, Justin, stop that! Justin, I'm going to count to ten..."It only gets worse. Not only is Hanks ineffectual at protecting his son from outsiders, he can't even protect him from himself. Hanks unburdens himself of all kinds of details about his work and plans--things that a child of his son's age absolutely does not need to know.Somehow they manage to survive Hanks' passive feeling-centric ineffectuality, despite colossal blunders like failing to ensure that a gunman he's just shot is actually dead.Partly this is because the other mobsters are just as absurdly ineffectual as Hanks is.For example, an entire mob family's command structure is taken out at a place where they've made no provisions for security other than some old guy waiting outside in a car. They emerge from a building to find the driver dead--then just stand there passively, completely exposed and out in the open, thinking about it (or perhaps coming to grips with their feelings about it).Hanks' ineffectuality and lack of basic judgment goes on to assume absolutely epic proportions as the movie reaches its climax. Among other things, he actually asks another guy's permission to *kill his son*--and is **surprised** when the answer is no.All in all, Road to Perdition is an astonishingly unlikely beast: a gangster movie completely devoid of comprehension of what strong men are like, and a tale of fatherhood with no conception that it's possible to be something other than an ineffectual 1990s-style mommy-daddy. Because it is never anything more than a "new man's" groundless fantasy about what it would be like to be a gangster, it is no more convincing than a bad skit.Most of the fault is obviously in the script, but it's disturbing that neither Tom Hanks nor Paul Newman nor director Sam Mercer noticed anything wrong with it.</fullReview>

It is a heart breaking examination about the relationship between fathers and sons and how a bad one can cause tragedy.This is not the comic book, which is fine, since this an excellent movie that takes the story into different thematic realms. The book was a very good tale concerned with telling a very good story first, and a story about sin and redemption second. This is one of the few cases where the source material was altered but not ruined by the film adaptation.See this movie. Its a great film no matter how you look at it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A powerful cinematic achievement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***POSSIBLE SPOILERS*** "Road To Perdition" succeeds brilliantly as a dark, powerful cinematic effort about revenge, reconciliation, and tragic downfall in the ruthless criminal underworld in 1930's Chicago. Tom Hanks plays a reluctant hit-man who has many compunctions about his job, yet tags along for the pay of his family and to pay respect for his son's godfather, John Rooney, who has rendered him practically every material substance in his life. When something goes horribly wrong, and it appears that Hanks has taken to temerity in defying his "boss" and ceasing his dealings, and taking down the sordid system, the tone changes from uneasy to extremely dark and solemn, as we follow Hanks and his son on a grave quest for revenge and survival. Accompanied by a powerful, portentous musical score which really defines the tones well, some of the most brilliant, absorbing cinematography ever produced for film (equally as impressive as Conrad Hall's previous effort in "American Beauty"), and some top quality, personal acting, particularly by the human Paul Newman, who delivers an Oscar-deserving performance as a man caught between love and deception in a dark, ugly world of corruption and greed. The involvement of the son in the story is very important because he provides a personal, eye-witness, innocent (yet understanding) narrative to the events surrounding the film, and it works quite effectively. We see what the son sees, experience what he experiences, and receive an ideal impression of the ways of life during the era of darkness and despair that was the Great Depression. Jude Law's brief screen time disallows his character any major significance in the plot, until the very end, where he plays a very critical role in the outcome of the story; I found it clever, however, and befitting, that his character's portfolio is "taking pictures of the dead": what a vapid character for a vapid time. My only major complaint with this film is that it sometimes becomes too dark and unpleasant to enjoyable, and some of the "shootout" scenes are entirely illogical (e.g. "judgment": Hanks shoots about 50 rounds of bullets into the bodies of underground conspirators, without reloading a single time). Overall, "Road To Perdition" ranks as a worthy, effective, and well-done cinematic triumph with many impressive filmic respects that is sometimes compromised by its own bleak, yet necessary, atmosphere. ***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

Jude Law was of course, brilliant and Paul Newman was fantastic as well. The viewer is kept in constant suspense throughout the whole movie and the rainy atmosphere helps build up the gloomy mood very well. This is one of the movies that after watching stays in you mind for quite a while. Highly recommended. *****/*****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very well told coming of age/father and son/gangster picture, the best of its kind since Bronx Tale...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...although it is very difficult to compare it to the likes of the Godfather, which many critics have talked of following the release of Sam Mendes' (Best Picture of 99 American Beauty Mendes' 2nd effort) Road to Perdition. However in truth, this film takes place in a universe all its own, giving connection to Al Capone here and there and scenes of mid-west life in depression era America, yet the story with its plot and characters are what matter and Mendes and screenwriter Self know this from first frame to last. Tom Hanks gets another challenge this time (after a retard, an AIDS patient, an island survivor and a conflicted World War 2 soldier), in getting a role of the likes of Michael Sullivan Sr, a expertly trained hit-man for boss John Rooney (Paul Newman in one of the years best supporting roles), since his is a life that is cold and ruthless and sometimes compassionate given the circumstances, and Hanks pulls it off in his compelling fashion and it can be seen even in the more subtle scenes, like with his son Michael Jr. They go on the run when Rooney's son Conner shoots Hanks' other son and wife, and the story unfolds from there, which includes a juicy, sinister persona sent on Hanks' tale named Maguire (Jude Law).With photography by Conrad L. Hall that ranks with some of the best so far this decade and performances made to match the edge, this is THE dramatic thriller of the season; one of the best pictures of the year. A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amazing journey every father and son must take on.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen many beautiful movies. There are some deserving Oscars and there are most that aren't really well known to the general public. But no movie is as beautiful as Road to Perdition. It is one of the most beautiful movies of all time, if not THE most. Why do I love it? Well, I'll tell you right now.What's the story? Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) has a normal wife and two sons but has a dangerous job working as a mob boss for Mr. John Rooney (Paul Newman), who raised him ever since he was a baby and loves him more than his real son Connor (Daniel Craig). One night, Michael's son Michael Jr. (Tyler Hocehlin) witnesses an interrogation by Connor and Michael Sr. Connor then proceeds to shoot the suspect, Finn McGovern. After Michael and his son swore to keep it a secret from each other. Connor sneaks into the Sullivan home and kills Michael's wife and other son while planning to kill Michael Sr. Upset about the event, Michael and his son run away from their hometown and they embark on a cross-country journey to find Connor, the man who killed their family, who has been hidden by his father, all while being pursued by the dead people-loving photographer, Maguire (Jude Law) and learning to bond and work together like father and son.Why I love it:1. The characters. One of the underrated trademarks of any director is that they tend to focus their movie on characters. Sam Mendes is one of them. All of his movies are focused more on characters and this film is no exception. The development between Michael and Michael, Jr. is really satisfying. They start out distant from each other, but as the film progresses, they learn to work together and help each other, just like a real father and son. You can feel the emotions between them. They're not one-dimensional stereotypes. They are fully rounded characters who desperately miss &amp; struggle to protect their loved ones while working together to move on and achieve their only goals in life. That's what makes Road to Perdition satisfying. The interplay is the main emotional core of the film. You can watch this film with the sound off and you'll still enjoy the interplay.2. The visuals and music score. They work together like a burger and chips. The cinematography by Conrad Hall (which is his last, sadly. RIP, dude) is beautiful enough. But add the music by the great Thomas Newman and you'll have a film that will almost bring you to tears every second until it all wraps up. It almost feels like an art painting if you decide to play a bit of classical music over it for the next two hours. The framing, the timing of the shots, the volume of the orchestra and the overall tone. When combined together, they're absolutely satisfying. It's the perfect combination. 3. The pacing. The pacing of this movie is perfect. The first 40 minutes set-up the characters and events to come. It is perfectly built and allows the characters to reveal more of their true selves before sending them on their journey. The more we get to know Mr. Rooney and his son &amp; Michael's family, the more I become emotionally invested with these people. I know that less means more, but it's my opinion. 4. The overall direction, performances and writing. Sam Mendes' famous movies are American Beauty and Skyfall. I don't hate these movies. I like them, but what makes this movie superior to the former two is the direction. The decisions he makes along with his actors, cinematographer Conrad Hall and screenwriter David Self such as giving more life to the characters and making it look like an art painting are absolutely well-picked. Mendes knows what he's doing, but he doesn't have a big ego and never gets in the way of his actors, cinematographer and screenwriter. That's what I love about him. The fact that you can do these films as long as you keep out of other people's way. He gives out the best direction I've ever seen. The performances of the actors are also the best, specifically Tom Hanks, Paul Newman, Jude Law and Tyler Hoechlin. The four have chemistry to work with and their personalities progress throughout the movie without breaking their consistency.UPDATE: I recently watched it again in black and white. Now, this was for an experiment to see if colour movies were better in black and white. In the B&amp;W version, I personally got the symbolism and what the characters (such as Michael Sr. and Mr. Rooney) are thinking before they make their decision. The colour is stripped off and reveals the raw emotion inside. But, on the visual style, it gives the film a 1940's film noir feel. At times, it works. Not to say that B&amp;W is better than colour, But I like how it's done in B&amp;W. It makes it more darker and more raw. You know, I wonder if Mendes and Hall thought about shooting the movie in B&amp;W. But I guess they had a reason to shoot in colour. If you want, you could try it out in B&amp;W. Some may prefer it in Colour, but I like both versions. Colour may have beautiful visuals but B&amp;W makes the story more personal and raw. Either way, take your pick on which is the best. Overall, a beautiful, beautiful movie with fully relatable characters, wonderful cinematography and music, a poignant story and a moving message to end it all. It's a beautiful and emotional film which is sure to provoke father's and son's thoughts and pull their heartstrings and is a breath-taking journey well worth taking on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a gangster movie with a difference as although it does deal with the shadier elements of gang life it really is a tale of one man's relationship with his son.Once you get past the fact that Tom Hanks is an assassin ( and this takes some doing) this is a wonderful film. Tom Hanks has never been better and there is great support from Paul Newman, Jude Law ( his best performance) and Daniel Craig. Special mention must also go to Tyler Hoechlin as Hanks son who puts in a well measured and very believable performance as he tries to gain the love and respect of his father.The film is beautifully filmed and there is a real brooding atmosphere throughout with highly stylised bouts of gun fights adding to the well paced drama.What really elevates this film to brilliance though is the portrayal of the relationship between father and son. Rarely have I seen such a realistic and honest portrayal of the bond between father and son. The ending is heartbreaking and uplifting at the same time and I am not ashamed to say that it brings a tear to my eye every time I watch it.I can't praise this film highly enough. A true classic and a score of 7.7 on here, high score that it is, does not do it justice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Those Who Live by the Sword</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since Coppola's "The Godfather" came out in 1972, just about every auteur director working in America seems to have cherished the ambition to produce his own "Godfather", hence crime epics like Scorsese's "Goodfellas", Leone's "Once Upon a Time in America", De Palma's remake of "Scarface", the Coen brothers' "Miller's Crossing" and Tarantino's "Pulp Fiction". Following his acclaimed first film "American Beauty", Sam Mendes obviously decided that the it was time to make his own "Godfather", because his second film, "Road to Perdition" is a gangster drama in this tradition. Michael Sullivan junior is a twelve-year-old schoolboy from Rock Island, Illinois. Although it is the early 1930s, the time of the Great Depression, the Irish-American Sullivan family enjoys a comfortable upper-middle-class existence. Young Michael, however, is puzzled about what his father, Michael senior, actually does for a living; all he knows is that he works for John Rooney, a seemingly respectable elderly gentleman who treats the boy like an adopted grandson. The truth, however, is that Rooney is an organised crime boss and Michael senior his "enforcer" When young Michael stumbles on the truth, after witnessing Rooney's unstable son Connor killing another gang member, he inadvertently puts himself and his family in danger. In an attempt to eliminate the boy, Connor murders his mother Annie and younger brother Peter, forcing Michael and his father to flee for their lives. The rest of the film deals with Michael senior's search for revenge for the deaths of Annie and Peter.The title can be understood on a number of levels. On the most literal, Perdition is a town to which some of the characters travel at the end of the film. On another level, "perdition" can be interpreted as meaning "death" or "destruction", and on a third "eternal damnation". Perhaps the film's bleakest moment comes when Rooney says to Michael senior that "none of us have any hope of getting to Heaven". This is not just a figure of speech. Rooney is a practising Catholic who has nevertheless embarked upon a way of life which he believes can only result in his damnation to Hell. The film's emphasis on the futility and sterility of the criminal lifestyle is reminiscent of that great British gangster movie, "Get Carter". The bleakness of the film's moral message is emphasised by its visual style, dominated by a muted palette with dark backgrounds and dull greens and greys. Filming took place in winter and early spring, often against a backdrop of snow and rain; Mendes intended the cold, bleak look of the film to reflect the characters' emotional states. Water, snow and ice are recurrent visual images throughout, from the snowy opening funeral scene with a corpse on ice to the closing scenes by Lake Michigan. The film's emotional impact is also heightened by Thomas Newman's evocative, elegiac musical score. The film's two most important characters are Michael senior and Rooney, who loves Michael like a son, and yet tries to kill him to save his biological son Connor. In some ways the audience can sympathise with Michael, a man who has suffered unjustly through the deaths of two innocent family members, and this sense of identification is strengthened by the casting of Tom Hanks, an actor normally seen as sympathetic characters. On another level, however, we recognise Michael's moral responsibility for his own predicament as one of those who live by the sword and are therefore doomed to die by the sword as each killing fuels the cycle of revenge and leads to yet more bloodshed. This is one of Hanks's most accomplished performances as he is able to show both these sides of Michael's personality. One of his redeeming characteristics is his love for his son, who he hopes will be able to lead a better life than the one he himself has led, and the film ends on a note of hope in this regard. This was to be Paul Newman's last appearance in a feature film, and it was to be a fine end to his distinguished career. Although Rooney is a lifelong villain, he is not wholly evil, but a tired, disillusioned old man, in Wilfred Owen's phrase a "devil sick of sin", who retains enough moral awareness to realise that his false system of values has blighted his life and the lives of others. The other notable performance comes from an almost unrecognisable Jude Law as Harlen Maguire, the hit-man sent by Rooney to kill Sullivan. Maguire also works as a crime-scene photographer, and the relish with which he photographs murder victims reveals a macabre fascination with death. In his remorselessness Maguire recalls Anton Chigurh, the hit-man played by Javier Bardem in "No Country for Old Men", although to my mind Law gives a better performance than Bardem. Maguire, for all his evil, is a recognisable human being whereas the one-dimensional Chigurh seems more like a personification of some abstraction such as "death" or "fate". The "my own Godfather" syndrome means that the organised crime epic has become something of an overcrowded field in the last forty years, but I must say that "Road to Perdition" is one of the most impressive entries in that field. I was impressed by Conrad Hall's breathtaking cinematography, by the standards of acting and by an intelligent script with its themes of father-son relationships, of the ethics of revenge and of the consequences of violence. Above all I was impressed by Mendes's ability to weave all these elements into a mythic whole, an epic which manages to say something new in the otherwise clichéd gangster genre. When I reviewed "American Beauty" I said that Mendes had joined that elite group of directors (Orson Wells, Sidney Lumet, Bryan Forbes, Stuart Rosenberg) who had made a masterpiece with their first film. With "Road to Perdition" he has joined that even smaller group who have made masterpieces with their first two films. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By which I don't mean to say that it's non-stop action or a thriller, only that it was a thrilling experience for me. I went into the movie knowing really nothing about except that a trusted friend recommended it. I have even more trust in his opinion now.Many have questioned the casting of Tom Hanks as a gangster and I can see why, but as a fugitive, a family man and a human being, I can't imagine a better fit for the movie. Tyler Hoechlin is also to be commended for his wonderful performance. I found the entire movie amazingly well-cast, actually, everyone a good fit. And kudos to Jude Law also for going so very much against type and embodying such a repellent character.The best interactions are between Michael Sullivan's Sr. and Jr, but much credit has to be given to the contrast between their relationship and John and Connor Rooney's (acted to perfection by Paul Newman and Daniel Craig).I found that one of the film's greatest strengths was it's decision to depict so much of the violence barely in frame or viewed through an opening. It was a a nice way of establishing how Sullivan tried to put up a barrier between his job and his family.Which, essentially, is what the whole film is about. Family, perspective and who we are versus what we do. Beautiful, stylish and wonderfully executed.</fullReview>

Well Like the 2009 film Watchmen it was much better than the novel but the novel is really good.The film is about Michael Sullivan played by Tom Hanks who is a gangster and works for John Looney played by the legendary Paul Newman who has a sick twisted psychopathic son Connor Rooney played by Daniel Craig who after going on job just to get information from someone shoots and kills him. Little does Michael know his son played by Tyler Hoechlin witnesses what happens. But Conner doesn't let that go and kills Michaels wife and youngest son peter. Now him and his older son are on the Road To Perdition to try and find a better life.This is an amazing film with excellent pacing, it takes its' time, it has a great cast, excellent story with great lighting and cinematography and has its' share of emotions. Definitely see this because one thing it is not is boring.Rated R For Violence And Language.1hr 57min/117min.9 uses of the F-word.****/****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though this movie stared one of the most touted actors of all-time in Tom Hanks, i hadn't really heard of it. When I did my background check on the movie before seeing it, it became apparent that people had very different opinions about this movie, and that led me to believe that it might not be worth a peek, but since it was Tom Hanks I decided to so anyway.And I have to say that I was blown away. Perhaps the most beautiful film I have ever seen visually, a very original script and some stellar performances. That was NOT at all what I expected, if you compared that to my impression when I did my background check on the movie.The dialog was sharp all the way through, and the characters were very convincing, even though I have heard other arguments and opinions to the contrary. The music was used perfectly in this movie and certainly added another layer of emotion to the movie.The actor that impressed me the most was Paul Newman and that is saying something if you consider just how talented this cast was.I can certainly recommend it to anyone who wants to see a masterpiece hiding in plain sight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tom Hanks And Paul Newman Combine In A Gangster Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Road to Perdition is a gangster film that stars Tom Hanks, Paul Newman in his last film feature,Jude Law together with Daniel Craig,Jennifer Jason Leigh and Tyler Hoechlin.The plot of the movie,taking place during the Great Depression,follows a mob enforcer and his son as they seek vengeance against a mobster who murdered the rest of their family.The screenplay was adapted by David Self, from the graphic novel of the same name by Max Allan Collins.It was directed by Sam Mendes.Road to Perdition has Michael Sullivan,who is a morally conflicted Depression-era gangster hit man committing murder in the name of his employer, John Rooney. A kindly, aging Irish crime boss who raised Sullivan as his surrogate son, Rooney is affiliated with Al Capone in Chicago. Curious about his father's mysterious profession, Sullivan's son, Michael Jr., stows away in his father's automobile one night and witnesses the execution of a man at the hands of Sullivan and Rooney's biological son, Connor.Although Michael keeps his promise to remain silent about what he's seen, the paranoid and unstable Connor tries to wipe out the entire Sullivan clan anyway, succeeding only in killing Sullivan's wife, Annie, and youngest son, Peter. Enraged at this and another surprise betrayal by the Rooneys, Sullivan embarks on a path of bloody retribution, Michael in tow. Although he intends to leave his boy with relatives in the rural town of Perdition once the coast is clear, he ends up exposing Michael to the goriest aspects of his talents, slaughtering former associates as he dodges contract assassin Maguire and cripples the cash flow of the Rooney and Capone organizations through a series of bank robberies, attempting to force either mob family to offer up the sequestered Connor as a sacrifice.After successfully killing John Rooney and his son Connor,Sullivan decides to drive Michael Jr. to a relative's beach house in Perdition, a town on the shore of Lake Michigan. Here he is ambushed and shot by a disfigured Maguire, who has survived the hotel shootout. Michael Jr. shows up and points a gun at Maguire, but cannot bring himself to fire. The standoff ends when Sullivan draws a hidden gun and kills Maguire before dying in his son's arms. The film ends with Michael Jr. mourning his father's death as finds his way back to the elderly farm couple that looked after them.Road to Perdition works surprisingly well for so simple a story as it involves the viewer in its story and action from beginning to end.Also,it is an enjoyable,well-acted,well-written, and superbly directed masterpiece.It also explores fully well the boding between fathers and sons.The talented cast delivers especially Hanks with his resonant reserve and Newman in conveying Rooney's failed attempt to live up to his self-image as the ultimate just and loving mob patriarch.Finally,it is a a gripping, touching and absorbing work from Sam Mendes.Overall,Road to Perdition is truly a gangster classic piece of cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seeing how IMDB is definitely a great source for movie reviews which are well grounded and opinionated, I was sadly disappointed in this film. How viewers of this film were able to get this on the top 250 is beyond me. Strictly seen as a cinematic piece; taking into account the filming, the direction, sytle and of course acting one could easily argue towards the great value of this film. But, one should not forget that movies are meant as a means of entertainment (in most cases for the masses). Rarely have I personally felt the need to move about just to stay awake. The odd "meaningless" shooting, that would tend to wake the average viewer, had little effect on me nor others I have spoken with. One point I could stress in the positive light was the musical score. Although it was nearly identical to that of "American beauty", a surround sound certainly does give goose bumps. All in all the shear length of this slow moving film with no real plot or point for that matter, should receive a failing grade.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very beautiful, but ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an exquisite film to watch. Each scene is so meticulously designed, it almost takes your breath away. But where it has surface in spades, it lacks real substance. It's very difficult to get involved in any of the relationships, despite some excellent individual performances: Tom Hanks is fine as the honourable hit-man, Paul Newman typically on the button as his boss, grappling with a quandary of loyalty over business and self-preservation, Jude Law suitably menacing as a very seedy mercenary.But something on the human side doesn't click. Maybe it's a case of aesthetic getting in the way: one example that did it for me was a car being stopped a couple of hundred metres from a farmhouse just so that the camera would be able to track the characters running through the field that separates the road from the house. There was a drive, and the car could have driven up it, but having the characters run through the field, well that would look much prettier (thought the director). It's that kind of thing that jars and detracts from the human drama unfolding.As for the motifs of the story - well, things like loyalty, devotion, treachery, revenge were dealt with with much more aplomb, and more convincingly, in 'Millers Crossing'. In that film, the characters were all pawns in a giant game of chess, and we weren't supposed to necessarily 'feel' anything for them. Sam Mendes' film wants us to feel, but I for one didn't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure why they chose the huge cast they did. This movie would have still been wonderful if Paulie Shore had been in it. The screenplay is so meticulously perfect, that it would be almost impossible to ruin it. The cinematography is breathtaking. The music is chilling. This full circle movie actually makes you think. The lines and actions of the characters are not forced, they just happen in a way that lets you feel how you must. Your interpretation is required. You fall in love, not with Tom Hanks or the cute little boy, but you fall in love with their decisions. Emotions are universal, making this movie timeless and meaningful to all who open their hearts to it. I held up a barrier to this movie through the most traumatic points but, right before the end, suddenly I was crying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do not put much faith in the Hollywood movie system anymore. You might get 1, maybe 2 good big studio Hollywood movies a year. But what I do put faith in is Mr. Tom Hanks. The man never fails to disapoint in a movie, and he gets better with age. Road to Perdition is the best movie of the year by far. It rivals such gangster films as The Godfather I, II, and III; and Goodfellas. It has more heart than all those put together. I am a big gangster movie fan, and I am a big Tom Hanks fan. So the thought of seeing a gangster movie with Hanks was a real treat. Then, before I saw the movie I started thinking "this is too good to be true, There is no way I am going to get 2 for the price of 1 with this movie. But I was wrong. I got 5 for the price of 1. Do yourself a favor and go see this movie RIGHT NOW! One word of warning though, don't expect a "happily ever after" type of movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A magnificent coming-of-age story ... transcended by superb performances and a dazzling cinematography ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is finally the movie that the gangster genre needed, and the one who made this masterpiece is not Quentin Tarantino, not Martin Scorsese, and certainly not Francis Ford Coppola. All the directors I mentioned, lost their touch, with all my respects, letting crime films reduced to a bunch of entertaining 'kiss-kiss bang-bang' flicks with no other purpose than entertaining younger masses before sinking into oblivion, as if all the emotionality and meaningfulness introduced by "The Godfather" had vanished in the wind of action mania forever ? until Sam Mendes saved the genre through one of the greatest crime films of the last decade, and probably, one of the greatest ever made, a movie named "Road to Perdition"."Road to Perdition" is a darkly stylish noir film telling an engaging revenge story, driven by a beautiful father-and-son relationship between Tom Hanks and Tyler Hoechlin, as Michael Sullivan, Sr. and Jr. This is why the parallelism with 'The Godfather" is more than a simple compliment, it's a cinematic accuracy as if the beauty of Coppola's masterpiece traveled thirty years forth to inhabit Sam Mendes' film, one of the few that managed to bring an extra sentimental dimension to a genre where the protagonists are generally despised. And one of the achievement of this film is to reconcile between both the gangster fans and the haters.The movie respects the intelligence of the viewer, and talks to his heart through the soul of this story, the father-and-son relationship, which in fact, is not just a reminiscence of "The Godfather", but also such epics as "The Godfather Part II" or "Once Upon a Time in America" as if the crime genre was the likeliest setting to explore the fascinating flaws and inspiring strengths of the human spirit. This is why "Road to Perdition" is a movie the genre needed, and I used the word "masterpiece" knowingly and deservedly, and the achievement is not just in the story, but also in its absolutely dazzling cinematography.Conrad Hall's cinematography is so extraordinary it 'sublimated' the film, and embodied the cold and dark feeling of the heavy presence of an imminent death. It transcended the story into something so absolutely hypnotic it absorbed me in every single scene. I won't even try to describe it, letting to the viewer the pleasure to discover the beauty. But all I can say is that Conrad Hall is indeed the greatest cinematographer and after "Cool Hand Luke", it's an immense pleasure to know his last work was for a Paul Newman film, and God, how sad it is to see the veteran actor, knowing he's not with us anymore. And out of all the great films he made, "I'm glad THIS was the last" .This movie doesn't glorify crime but portrays it as a cruel and dirty business practiced by regular men who were also fathers who literally 'killed for a living'. A business that condemned their soul forever, but it didn't matter, since it was all for the purpose of Family. Like in "The Godfather", Family is a redundant theme, which makes the characters even more sympathetic, whether it's Tom Hanks or Paul Newman in his last heart-breaking performance as John Rooney, they're totally devoted to the their sons. It's all about law of survival and a deep and profound relationship between men trying to protect their blood, with a significant difference, for Michael Sullivan.And this is the element structuring the film, there are basically two roads, and Michael Sullivan Sr. doesn't want his son to take the titular one? It's not just self but soul preservation ... Where Michael Corleone lost his soul even by protecting his family, Michael Sullivan's soul had to survive; this was his father's victory. The movie portrays crime as an indeed ruthless world that would corrupt even the purest soul. This is a cold, rigid, corrupt world, where absolutely no one is innocent, and even the loyalty has no merit whatsoever. And when the problems start, then you realize how worthless people are. I mentioned Coppola several times, but the approach to the gangster's world is also very Scorsesian.The story is about a boy who has a profound admiration to his father, until he discovers that his hero is a criminal. It raises two simple but important, questions, what would someone do if the person he loved the most was a criminal? And more than that, how would a criminal react if he knew his beloved son admired him ? for the wrong reasons. And a third one, how far would you go protecting people you love if they're threatened ? this film gives some answers through a fascinating coming-of-age story, that helps you understand that there's absolutely no black and white, no glorification of crime, no demonization, either.No demonization, but the road to perdition is still a road to hell paved with the noblest instincts like protecting a soul. It's an extraordinary inspiring film served by unforgettable performance, from Tom Hanks and Paul Newman to Daniel Craig as Rooney's psychopathic son, and Jude Law, the professional killer. No words are powerful enough to describe how these interactions will provoke some horrifying scenes while evoking emotions through a cinematography, which makes you enjoy the "sadness".This is a major picture that needed to existed to show that gangster film genre is not dead. A road to perfection every movie fan should take ?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A enforcer for a gangster in the liquor business finds the tables turned on him and goes on the run with his son in "Road to Perdition," a 2002 film directed by Sam Mendes.Tom Hanks plays Michael Sullivan, a quiet, remote father of two who works for a crooked liquor dealer, John Rooney (Paul Newman) who took him in and treats him as his son. His two boys aren't clear about what he does, and one night, when he goes out on a job, his older son, Michael Jr. (Tyler Hoechlin) hides in the car and follows his dad and Connor Rooney (Daniel Craig) as they go to "talk" to someone. As the young boy watches, Connor loses his temper and starts shooting up the place, and Michael joins in. Connor sees Michael Jr. when he exits. Michael Sr. of course promises that his boy won't say anything. On his next job, Connor gives him a note for the man Michael is to see, who is in heavy debt to John Rooney. Michael is forced to kill the man when he sees that the man is about to kill him. On looking at the note Connor asked him to deliver, it says, "Kill Sullivan and all debts are paid." Several hours later, Michael's life is devastated, and he and his older son are on the run, Michael determined to destroy Connor.I saw this film without being aware of anyone liking or disliking it or of it being overlooked by the Oscars - I only had heard of it and actually rented it because I am a huge fan of Paul Newman's. Let me say that I was astounded by the brilliance of this film in every aspect. It possibly captured the time period of the early '30s better than any film I've ever seen, right down to the Doeskin tissues I used to see piled up in my grandparents' basement. The cinematography is staggering.The gangster story in "Road to Perdition" actually wraps around a more important one, that of the bonding of father and son, which is beautifully told. Hanks is magnificent as a closed off man who gets to know his boy during their life on the run, and vice versa. "He dotes on you," a woman on a farm tells Michael. The two Michaels are alike, but Senior never wants Junior to follow in his footsteps. Paul Newman is, as usual, terrific as John Rooney, a tough gangster who goes to Communion but knows "none of us will ever see heaven." He was around 77 at the time of the filming and as handsome and dynamic as ever. Daniel Craig does a phenomenal job as the vicious Connor. Amid so many brilliant performances, Jude Law plays one of the most disturbing, frightening characters in film history, Harlen Maguire, a hit man who makes money not only by killing, but by photographing the dead victims and selling the photos, which adorn his wall. He's absolutely nauseating, and Law doesn't miss a beat. The always wonderful Stanley Tucci is Frank Nitti, and Jennifer Jason Leigh has a small role as Michael's wife. As Michael Jr., Tyler Hoechlin perfectly embodies all the emotions necessary for the role: the fear, anger, love, and loyalty. He and Hanks have the film's biggest roles, and they carry it, making it look easy.This is a suspenseful, poignant, sad and violent masterpiece. One of the comments warns against comparing it to The Godfather - I hope nobody did this. It stands on its own, and one has nothing to do with the other. A great artistic achievement by Sam Mendes who worked with a beautifully realized script and top cast. Now that I've seen it, I can't believe it was so overlooked at the Oscars, but when I think of all the Oscars Newman has been cheated out of, I guess I'm not only surprised, but I've about had it with the Oscars.I almost gave "Road to Perdition" a 9 instead of a 10 only because I'm not big on lots of blood. If you are, too, I suggest you watch it anyway. You won't be sorry. A powerful experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>But where's the heart?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Mendes would probably make a great used car salesman. He puts such a glossy sheen on his product that it's easy to overlook the fact that there's nothing under the hood. Not until the drive home do you start to notice there's something awfully wrong. American Beauty repeatedly told us that it was a film about finding beauty in the little details, but just saying it doesn't make it so. Likewise, Road to Perdition hits us again and again with the complexities of fatherhood and the unbreakable bond between father and son, even when one or the other is a nogoodnik. Yet I can not identify one moment in the film where I felt that any of love and devotion heaped on the father figures was deserved, let alone genuine. And to present that old saw of the kid acting as a father to his dad as if it's something clever? Give us a little credit. That said, the packaging is indeed almost enough to distract us from the shallowness of the whole endeavour. Mendes makes some truly inventive directorial decisions, just as he did in American Beauty but with a distinctively different style. Hall's cinematography is exquisite, especially his mastery of the uniquely bleak landscape of rural Illinois. The acting holds up pretty well, but the best performances are not from Newman and Hanks as might be expected, but from Daniel Craig and Stanley Tucci. These two take more or less stock characters (hot-headed heir apparent and tough but benevolent mob boss) and invest them with something a little special. Plus, it's always great to see Dylan Baker doing anything. Jude Law's character, however, is made so quirky and creepy that he could only exist inside a movie. Overall, it's a generally watchable film with with nothing in its soul but misguided good intentions.P.S. Why would an actress of Jennifer Jason Leigh's caliber and profile take a role with ten minutes of screen time where she has nothing to do but alternately smile and frown at her sons?</fullReview>

Conrad L. Hall's Oscar winning cinematography, together with a memorable score from Thomas Newman, set up a perfect atmosphere for the film. The set design and costumes are flawless and with notably good sound editing too, the film is immaculate in technical terms. The acting also admirable, in particular from Paul Newman, giving off one of the greatest performances of his career as an aging crime boss, and Jude Law, who is able to make his character frighteningly sinister. And in terms of substance, the film cannot be faulted either, presenting an interesting change to the ontological tale ? this one of the most polished and still highly enjoyable films that I've ever seen.</fullReview>

I'm very surprised that I didn't like this movie - Hanks was good against type, Jude Law was creepy, and the kid was creepier. With about 20 minutes to go, however, it was obvious what was going to happen.

		<fullReview>Given this film's mixed reviews, I'd put off viewing it, despite several friends having recommended it. I finally watched the Blu-ray yesterday. I wasn't blown away, but was definitely impressed."Road" is the model of a "show us, don't tell us" story. Dialog is kept to a minimum. The actors are allowed to act, rather than interpret the writer's dialog. In principle, the less the audience is told, and the more work it has to do to understand what's going on, the greater its involvement should be.One IMDb reviewer described it as "toothless". I'm curious as to how a story in which a mob killer running from people who want to kill him and his son could be anything but toothed. My heavens, the man mows down seven gangsters before taking out the boss.More significant is Roger Ebert's objection to the film's coolness. He tended to dislike films that didn't make a strong emotional connection. Frankly, "Road" is one of the few films that have moved me in a long time. Though a consciously "stylish" film, the style (for me) only enhances the storytelling. It does not detract.Recommended, unless you're afraid to disagree with Roger Ebert. He was a great critic, but not always "right".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Very Enjoyable Gangster/Mob Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you enjoy films that are lacking in story but are pure action; films that move at 100mph; films where the camera work is so fast you can't see what's going on; films that have a stereotypical cast, then chances are you won't enjoy Road to Perdition as this film is the exact opposite of those examples mentioned. If you DO enjoy the opposite, however, then chances are this movie will be for you.Road to Perdition is a very decent gangster/mob film that sees Tom Hanks playing the role of Michael Sullivan, a family man who's grown up in the world of organised crime, and is the adopted son of mob boss John Rooney (played excellently by Paul Newman). However, when Sullivan's eldest son, Michael, sees something he shouldn't, family ties are forgotten and both father and son end up on the run fighting for their survival.I enjoy a good gangster/mob film myself, and while Road to Perdition isn't anywhere near the same level as The Godfather, A Bronx Tale, or Casino, it's still a very good film to watch &amp; enjoy. The story is structured well, the cinematography &amp; direction are excellent, there's a nice amount of tension at just the right moments, and the acting is 1st class. There are even a few moments of humour as well just to break up the seriousness of the film.Speaking of the acting...Paul Newman, Jude Law, and Tom Hanks are all excellent in their roles here, and Hanks once again shows just how versatile an actor he really is when it comes to the different roles he plays as you'd never think that Forrest Gump could play a 1930s American gangster.However, even with all the pluses that this film has, it does lack a certain something to stop it from taking it to that next level for me. What that certain something is, though, I can't quite pinpoint.Anyway, regardless of that certain something, Road to Perdition is still a very enjoyable flick, and if you've not seen it yet...where the Hell have you been for the last 13 years?? Watch it...you won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Brilliant Performance from Tom Hanks. Road to Perdition (2002) Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Academy Award winner* Tom Hanks is back in Road to Perdition, the epic tale of father and son, on the run from hit-men. Hanks gives yet another brilliant performance here, as Michael Sullivan. He is a very mysterious character for the first half and hour or so. His sons don't even know what he does for a living.But one fay when Sullivan sets out on a "mission" for his employer and father figure Mr Rooney (Paul Newman)his young son Michael Jr. sneaks in the back of the back of the car and witnesses his father murder someone. Rooney soon finds out about this and puts a hit out on young Sullivan. And so the perilous journey to Perdition begins as father and son travel across the country to reach Sullivan's sister-in-law's house on the beach. The on-screen chemistry between father and son is visible throughout the whole movie, as they learn more and more about each other and become closer as the film goes on.Backed up with some brilliant visuals, a beautiful soundtrack and a brilliant screenplay, Road to Perdition is a film not to be missed. Not to mention, director Sam Mendes who's given us a true masterpiece and the brilliant acting from Hanks, Newman and Daniel Craig. And finally one of the most unexpected endings I've ever seen, leaves your jaw dropped and your heart racing. This is a film I'll definitely re-watch in the future.Verdict: While not Hanks' best film to date, this is definitely one of his most enjoyable. It'll keep you on the edge of your seat throughout and is definitely worthy a place in my Top 20 Movies. Very underrated and well worth a watch.Four and a half stars.*Tom Hanks won the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role in 1993 for "Philadelphia" and in 1994 for "Forrest Gump".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bonds of loyalty are put to the test when a hit-man's son witnesses what his father does for a living. 1931. Mike Sullivan and Connor Rooney are two henchmen of elderly Chicago-based Irish-American mobster John Rooney, Connor's father. In many respects, John treats Mike more as his son, who he raised as his own after Mike was orphaned, than the volatile Connor, who nonetheless sees himself as the heir apparent to the family business. One evening, Mike's eldest son, twelve year old Michael Sullivan Jr., who has no idea what his father does for a living, witnesses Connor and his father gun down an associate and his men, the situation gone wrong initiated from an action by Connor. Caught witnessing the incident, Michael is sworn to secrecy about what he saw. Regardless, Connor, not wanting any loose ends, makes an attempt to kill Mike, his wife and their two sons. Mike and the surviving members of his family know that they need to go on the run as Connor, who has gone into hiding, will be protected through mob loyalty, especially by John, who cannot turn on his own flesh and blood. Roger Ebert wrote "After I saw "Road to Perdition," I knew I admired it, but I didn't know if I liked it. I am still not sure. It is cold and holds us outside. Yes, there is the love of Hanks for his son, but how sadly he is forced to express it. The troubles of the mob seem caused because Rooney prefers family to good management, but Michael Sullivan's tragedy surely comes because he has put it the other way around--placing Rooney above his family. The movie shares with "The Godfather" the useful tactic of keeping the actual victims out of view. There are no civilians here, destroyed by mob activities. All of the characters, good and bad, are supplied from within the mob. But there is never the sense that any of these characters will tear loose, think laterally, break the chains of their fate. Choice, a luxury of the Corleones, is denied to the Sullivans and Rooneys, and choice or its absence is the difference between Sophocles and Shakespeare. I prefer Shakespeare." Road to Perdition is a masterpiece that will endure the test of time.</fullReview>

From many aspects, Godfather which is grossly overrated for no apparent reason, is a dwarf to this movie which has been highly underrated by critics. This is the perfect mafia movie! Every scene is meticulously crafted by Sam Mendes with the solicitous camera work of Conrad Hall; sadly his last. It is amazing how Mendes turned a simple cartoon book in to an epic movie with lots of cinematic values added! This movie goes well with the likes of 'Shawshank Redemption' and be treated as a wine movie ? the older it gets, the better it becomes and appreciated! Not surprisingly dumb as they are usually, Academy has missed this movie in 2002! It is not about showing how to manage gangs or gangster work as boringly done in Godfather. This movie is all about the futility of gang work and the illusions it brings in to the very minds of those who are involved. Michael Sullivan never wanted his sons to follow his gangster career so he took all steps to protect his family from the status quo of his work. However, it fails and he loses his family but his one and only hope was his remaining son Michael Jr., will not kill a man in his lifetime and he sees to that even in his death. As the story unrolls and knitted tightly holding you to the seat, you will be treated with the best cinematography and poignant musical renditions all the way. Late Paul Newman playing the Mafia boss John Rooney, does a great job to a role that you will never forget. I saw Tom Hank's best performance in this movie who exceptionally performs and leaves eternal memories in your mind. Overall, the movie is a very fine, rare example of best things happening together, bringing an amazing cinematic experience to the audience. Simply brilliant and deserves 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sam Mandes gives proof again of his extraordinary capabilities as a director. Moreover,Tom Hanks makes a very good performance in the role of a father who makes a bad job for a good reason. A very well-made movie,it commemorates the old fascinating landscapes of the New York of the 30s. But it is not a story of Gangster. The point of the film is the relationship between a father and his son. Emblematic is the last sentence of the film,in which the son says that when they asked him whether his father was a good or a bad man,he always answered the same way:"he was my father". The final question is Machiavelliana: is it true that the means justify the end? However, if so,What does justify the end?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Humanity and fraternity examined with great ambition and film-making.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's strange to think of someone as an evil man, but what criteria meets the credentials of someone that is in fact evil? Sam Mendes shows the path of one's transformation of redemption and fraternal relationships that leaves you torn of the goodness anyone is capable of exerting. Tom Hanks gives another excellent performance as hit-man Michael Sullivan. His boss Mr.Rooney is played by Paul Newmann in an ever so good performance. Mr.Rooney took good care of Micheal and his two sons and wife. When Micheal's son Michael Sullivan Jr. witnesses his father and partner execute a fellow criminal, he is shocked by the violence his father created. After Michael's partner mistakes Michael's other son for Michael Jr., the boy and his wife are killed causing Michael and his son to go on the run from the criminals, and drive Michael to get revenge. Whats's fascinating about this crime drama is that is examines what truly makes an evil man. With brilliant and minimal narration that could have been a tad longer, Michael Sullivan Jr. analyzes what his father was truly like and if he were evil or not. There has never been a more powerful father-son relationship in cinema than the one David Self has written for us. Michael Sullivan and his son face hard times and often quarrel, but realize how important they are to each other and manage to form a healthy relationship. The two discuss going to Perdition, a beautiful location that represents the goodness the two follow when they form a strong relationship and try and stay safe and avoid crime anymore. We really see world-class film-making with gorgeous cinematography, beautiful music, spectacular art direction and tremendous editing. The film is unlike any crime film you've ever seen due to focusing on how crime affects families and how one person is examined greatly after influenced by crime. With Sam Mendes guiding the cast and crew, you see a strong story that will leave you wondering if the people you feel are evil have a second side to them, and will make you forgive others and appreciate your family. This is a beautiful work of cinematic art, and a great cinematic experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie, it was more about what was beneath the surface in many ways. The acting was fine, but the subject matter made it more memorable, there aren't many good films I know of that deal with father/son relationships too well. The impact of violence is also well represented, and how people deal with violent actions. The film, due to the subject matter, isn't very happy, but more realistic and so sad at many parts. That's the nature of reality though, it isn't always pleasant, and the film tackles human nature quite well. And who could forget the score, it was a shame it didn't win an Oscar, it's one of the better soundtracks made, truly a beautiful soundtrack that makes you feel the Sullivan family's pain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tom Hanks is perfect at Mike Sullivan, enforcer for Paul Newman, playing an Irish American crime boss in an Illinois town during the Great Depression. This film has great atmosphere. It is not easily classified as either a thriller or a crime drama.When Newman's son, Conner, murders his wife and younger son, Sullivan takes off with his older son Michael in a determined quest to avenge his family's death.Michael Sr. and his 12 year old son are on road for six weeks. Sullivan teaches his son to drive. Michael Jr. loves his father very much.The direction by Sam Mendes is very good. The low key music in the background, the rain, the midwest landscape, all contribute to an unforgettable film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Today i became pleasant surprised by this film from 2002 named Roadto Perdition. I had heard it was a comic book adaptation of a supposed very good,i story, so it quickly catch my interest. After finally watching the film, i must say that it's indeed a very entertaining film, with everything you can expect from a revenge story. It is full of twists that may catch the distracted viewer. The performances are great, specifically by Paul Newman. Jude Law was also surprisingly good as the creepy and nasty assassin. Hanks also did a good job. The cinematography was particularly beautiful. Full of wide panoramic views which sometimes are stunning. The art direction could've been as well won an Oscar. Very good work in the lightning. The darken tones are used more than often. The soundtrack also played a big part in the film, and i simply loved the suspenseful score. The editing also was done very well. The film never gets confusing or boring; everything is done in a clever way and makes perfect sense.It obviously has a few flaws, mostly to do with 'minor' things. Why Mullivan didn't kill the assassin when the aforementioned was totally incapable in the floor, for example. Anyways, i think it's a good film and worth a watch. 7.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Credit IMDb) Mike Sullivan works as a hit man for crime boss John Rooney. Sullivan views Rooney as a father figure. However after his son is witness to a killing he has done Mike Sullivan finds him self on the run trying to save the life of his son and at the same time looking for revenge on those who wronged him. Jude Law co stars as a hit man hired to kill Sullivan.This is my second time watching this movie. I saw this when it was first released, and remember that it was a powerful movie. I gave it another whirl last night, and it still holds up. This movie is set in the 1930's, and I felt the atmosphere mirrored the time period precisely, from the cars, the houses, the style of clothing, and just how everything was done. It has a very rich atmosphere that was very hard to resist. The patient storytelling serves this movie well. It's deliberately paced, and better for it. I felt the deliberate pacing gave us a chance to get to know the characters a little more, especially in the second half, watching Tom Hanks &amp; Tyler Hoechlin (Michael Sullivan Jr.) get to know each other a little more. As their relationship grows, the movie really begins to heat up. Tom Hanks is fantastic in the lead; Hanks has consistently proved for many years how good he is, and he delivers one of his best performances here. His character is cold &amp; tough in the first half, before opening up a bit more in the second half when he becomes a bit more humane. He conveyed his emotions to perfection. He's not completely ruthless, and he has a heart, so sympathy was automatic from me. Tyler Hoechlin impresses as the kid. Not only was his narration terrific, but so was his acting. Jude Law is effectively smarmy as the hit-man. Paul Newman can peel potatoes for an hour, and I'd call it a good performance. He doesn't have a ton of screen time, but he was excellent and classy. Jennifer Jason Leigh doesn't have much to do as the wife, whilst Daniel Craig is great as a weaselFinal Thoughts: If you can handle the deliberate pace, you will be rewarded with great storytelling. The acting is top notch, and it will definitely make you think for a bit after it's over. I highly recommend it8.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Serene Of All Mob Films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most serene of all mob films, Road to Perdition is a beautifully crafted, finely composed &amp; calmly narrated tale that not only succeeds as an effective crime thriller but also paints a touching portrait of father-son relationship over the course of its runtime and is equally notable for marking the final on-screen appearance of the legendary actor, Paul Newman.Set in the early 1930s during the Great Depression, the story of Road to Perdition concerns Michael Sullivan Sr.; an enforcer for the Irish mobster John Rooney who share a father-son like relationship. But these bonds of loyalty are soon put to test when Rooney's son murders Sullivan's family after Sullivan Jr. ends up witnessing what his father does for a living.Directed by Sam Mendes, Road to Perdition employs a very relaxed &amp; peaceful atmosphere from its opening moments and manages to keep that ambiance alive even when it goes a bit violent. Cinematography patiently captures the unfolding events &amp; makes excellent use of cold colour temperatures, Editing steadily paces the narrative while Thomas Newman's score is truly mesmerising.Coming to the performances, Road to Perdition features a star-studded cast in Tom Hanks, Paul Newman, Jude Law, Daniel Craig &amp; Tyler Hoechlin. Delivering an assured performance like he has all his career, Hanks adds another impressive work to his résumé, Law does fine with what he's provided, Hoechlin's chemistry with Hanks simply works, Craig is good while Newman steals every scene he's in &amp; bows out on a high note.On an overall scale, Road to Perdition is a masterwork of its genre that nicely demonstrates the consequences of following the path of violence, covers the father-son dynamics with soothing grace, and benefits greatly from its polished direction, sophisticated screenplay, gorgeous photography, controlled pace, heartwarming score &amp; sensational performances. Defying the usual blueprint of a mob film, Road to Perdition is an engaging, entertaining &amp; elegantly told cinema that's definitely worth your time n money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than gangster epic, this is one of the great films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a big fan of gangster films, and the star-studded cast of Perdition should have made this a must-see, without all my loved ones' persuasions! Yet I had allowed a sense of apathy towards this film develop over the years, as I had seen several snippets at various times and had been left underwhelmed.Road to Perdition is the story of Michael Sullivan, a hit-man working for John Rooney, the local mob boss. Sullivan is a cold-blooded killer who appears more loyal to his boss than his family; his sons begin to question his job when they see him with a gun. Michael Junior (MJ), the eldest of the brothers, stows himself away in his dad's car and witnesses Sullivan gun down some men. MJ seeing this crime sets in motion a series of terrible events that leads to Sullivan being victim to the most cruel of betrayals, but at the same time provides him with a chance to become a better father to his son. It is a tale of loyalty, betrayal, revenge, and two fathers who want the best for their sons.The first 30 minutes only served to reinforce my earlier thoughts: I couldn't believe that these English and American actors were really Prohibition-era Irish gangsters, and the pace was way too slow. Any film that carries with it the tag 'gangster' is doomed by the laws of comparison, and the near-absent characterisation and lethargic plot didn't compare well to The Untouchables, for example.However, my cynicism was laid to waste as soon as the first shots were fired, and the first bodies hit the ground. Yes, I am THAT easy to please! On a serious note, the first killings represented more than just gore to please a blood-thirsty audience. Our perception of Hanks' Sullivan changed at the moment MJ's innocence and naivety towards his father's identity was shattered: here is a boy who fantasised his dad was some kind of cool, wild-west cowboy. We also see the confirmation of our early fears that Craig's Connor Rooney (son of Newman's John) is a tad unhinged, as he executes an underling for no apparent reason. The first on-screen killings are key thematically, in that Sam Mendes does not give us a bloody scene for the sake of it, they are a plot device to further our understanding of a character or advance the plot. No grisly massacres here. Finally, the murders mark the turning-point (for me at least) in this film.From this point the plot flourishes to take take us on a road trip, an adventure that we share with the surviving Sullivans as they flee the hit-man put to task by Sullivan's former boss. Perhaps as a a further testament to the strength of the directing by Sam Mendes, I was actually thrilled by Jude Law's idiosyncratic and merciless hired-gun. Law had disappointed me in previous roles, so it was a joy to see him play to his apparent strengths, blending chilling killer with dark humour: his side-business is that he sells the photographs he takes of his victims.I felt a sense of foreboding and anxiety as Sullivan and his son barely evade this assassin, never fully knowing what will happen next, as so many movies signpost plot developments. It is in this game of cat and mouse that I realised my folly at dismissing the early characterisation of Hanks' character; his early silence and abruptness towards his confused son is now laid bare as a desire to protect him from his world, and in the moment that their lives are shattered by the murder of their family, Sullivan has to bring him into that world in order to survive, MJ holds guns and is his father's getaway driver - not bad for a 12 year old! The progression of this father-son dynamic is perversely reflected in John Rooney's struggle to choose between his psychotic son, Connor, and his 'adopted' son, Sullivan. Newman brilliantly portrays a man's conflicted emotions as he realises the horror of his son's actions and the consequences they have.Yet the film's coup-de-grace is also a desperately sad ending for Sullivan; he has gained his revenge, banished his demons, and now father and son walk on the beach outside their new house. Yet something in the air doesn't feel right, even now I can't put my finger on how the director infects you with this sense that all is not well, and I am intrigued to see if other viewers felt this creeping dread as Sullivan looks out of his window. We remember that Law's killer is still at large, has he been called off by his masters we wonder? To the right of the screen, behind Hanks, we see the shadow of something flickering, surely not, a happy ending, please!! And like a punch to the gut, 2 gunshots, Sullivan crumples like papier mache in the rain, revealing a scarred Law seated, smoking gun in hand. I am filled with admiration at how Mendes constructed this scene, it is fitting that the greatest scene is the end, despite its sadness. But there is more. As Law takes his pictures and cruelly taunts the dying Sullivan, MJ appears with a gun. We will him to shoot, the tension rises as Law talks him down, then BANG! Hanks guns him down: "I couldn't do it" says MJ, "I know", his father says, smiling.Road to Perdition is more than a gangster film, there is enough there to satisfy those film-goers who wouldn't enjoy, say, a Scarface or a Goodfellas. It is a heart-warming story about fathers and sons, revenge and redemption, despicable acts and heroic deeds that propels it from a potentially ponderous, mob movie wannabe to that rarest of films: an extraordinary tale that earns its place in the pantheon of gangster greats.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Upon reflection this film seemed fairly realistic when it came to gun fighting, the shooting fights were not extended longer than necessary and there was no messing about with long monologues. When Sullivan shoots a group of men he does so from the dark with a machine gun and overcomes them since they have pistols, this is much more realistic to me than many films where the hero beats pretty much impossible odds. Many of the killing are done before the others have time to react which seems like the approach an experienced hit-man would take. The film didn't rush and took its time with some interesting parts especially with regards to the character played by Jude Law. I thought that the emotional distance Sullivan kept from his family was also fairly realistic of someone who kills for a living whilst doesn't enjoy killing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I passed up a chance to view this in theaters with my my dad when he asked and I felt terrible after I saw it. This is, without a doubt, one of the best father and son movies ever made. The connection between Micheal Sullivan and his boy is so deep and involving that their relationship could seriously carry the film on its own. There is a decent amount of action to help out the emotionally driven plot, and all of the side characters give just as good a performance as Hanks. Jude Law, in particular, surprised me with his most haunting character to date. His face still gives me chills to this day in "Perdition." Don't pass this film up. It was one of the best of 2002 (if not, the best) and has not aged a bit.</fullReview>

Also the use of sound was very refreshing; somehow gunshots have more impact when you don't hear them. All the performances were excellent; particularly Tom Hanks, who is so skilled in this type of role. I also thought the young Tyler Hoechlin did a good job and Paul Newman and Daniel Craig were also excellent. I also enjoyed seeing Jude Law as a hit man, Harlen Maguire, sent out after the pair.

The score is dramatic and perfect for the film. The simple script had being shaped with great dialogues and was turned very unique. In addition, the acting was quiet and marvellous: Tom Hanks had a very rare role for him, although he still showed his great ability to act; Jude Law had a linking role and he performed it with much cruelty; Newcomer Tyler Hoechlin was great as the helpless child, coming up at the end with sobriety; And the absolute great acting was by Paul Newman. So quiet and modest, he presented a good-hearted and warm person, even though his job was tough and bloody.Mendes' second work is much better and is more mature, complicated and polished than "American Beauty".</fullReview>

And for those who say "well, it's not really plot-driven, it's really a character study", well, I do not really feel I know much ABOUT these guys.I also got the strong sense that had Hanks been sent by the American Army ALONE to fight the Kaiser in World War I, he would of course have killed all the German soldiers in Europe - while being slightly wounded (his son could drive the tank). I hated the sentimentality, the occasionally feeble attempts at humor, the to heavy music, the enormous plot holes (just how DOES one person foil the entire Mob and police force week after week after week throughout the Midwest? HUH? How's it done?). The dialogue was almost deliberately flat and unmemorable, and only one scene sticks out (I liked the scene of Newman and Hanks in the church basement).I certainly wanted the protagonist vanquished as he came close to quarrying his foe. And that's certainly not something the screenwriter wants us to hope.For those who praise the cinematography - well, it was quite good - but then so are Bound for Glory, Ironweed, Dillinger, The Godfather II, Storyville, Little Caesar, Places in the Heart, The Grapes of Wrath, Double Indemnity, FIST, Hard Times, The Postman Always Rings Twice (both versions), and dozens on dozens on dozens of other gritty movies set in the Depression era (even those produced during the era). A very bad script led to a bad movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comic Book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I've been a fan of comic books (and even "graphic novels") for many years, I feel that this movie's downfall is based on its source as a long-form comic book. Starting in the mid-80s with "The Dark Knight" (the hugely-influential reworking of Batman as a bitter, vengeful old man), certain comic books started to take themselves more "seriously" and attempt storylines and thematic elements that were previously only found in "serious" literature. Unfortunately, even many of the best "graphic novels" suffer from oversimplification of human emotions and motivations, seemingly because they're *still* comic books. This story is a good example of that. For all the gorgeous photography (although we've seen it all before in Miller's Crossing, 12 years earlier) and great acting, the emotional core of this film just doesn't have enough impact to support all the artifice. In the end it comes down to a hit man whose life of killing makes it hard for him to to connect emotionally to his son, but neither the hit man nor his son are ever drawn with enough character depth for their struggles to affect us much more powerfully than, say, Spider-man's struggles with Doc Ock. The authors may be addressing more "serious" subject matter than your "typical" comic book, but they're still not bringing any substantial amount of depth to the story.Combine that with some mystifyingly obvious directorial "flourishes" -- e.g., a lingering shot of Jude Law's hands with blood on them; get it? He's an assassin and he has BLOOD ON HIS HANDS! -- and what we're left with is a beautifully-shot, well-acted movie with very little substance at its core. In the end it doesn't seem to come down to anything more than "Killing people is a bad job that deadens your emotions and endangers your family." There never seems to be any kind of real emotional connection between Hanks' character and his son. Compared to a movie like, Goodfellas -- portraying a different era, certainly, but a movie that examines the dichotomy between gangsters' jobs and their family lives with insight, emotion and sheer directorial brilliance -- this movie can't help but come up a little shallow. I have to blame the source material, as, in the end, Hanks' struggles to reconcile his family life with his professional life don't seem to have any more emotional resonance than Superman's struggles over whether or not to reveal his secret identity to Lois Lane.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unremarkable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Mendes' second directorial work, "Road to Perdition," is a rather unremarkable film that suffers from an often troubled, mediocre screenplay. Ironically, everything else in the film is oh so perfect--brilliant performances by Tom Hanks and Jude Law are coupled with a wonderfully stylized depiction of 1930s Chicago (one that surpasses "The Untouchables," which says a lot). Sam Mendes recycles several directoral techniques that he used in the fading gem, "American Beauty," and for the most part, his strategies work. Naturally, the late Conrad Hall's hand is well felt in the cinematography department--especially during the captivating gun fight between Hanks and Law at a Chicago hotel.While the film scores well for its visceral appeal, the screenplay is often tepid; the run-time is more than a bit too long. Much of the dialogue feels dry and even cliched at times. The plot-line is sincere enough, however, it simply packs in too many themes at once--development of a father/son relationship, hit-man on the run, revenge for murdering one's family, a road-trip during the great depression, a father preventing one's son from becoming like himself when he grows up, and so on. The generally morose tone of the film, emulated by Randy Newmnan's scores, makes "Road to Perdition" feel lethargic at times.Also, you can't help but notice the not-so-clever parallels between "Road to Perdition" and "American Beauty," which takes away from the former's uniqueness and independent temporal existence.One should go see "Road to Perdition" because its a beautiful display of technical craftsmanship and solid acting. However, just be wary that the plotline isn't all that its cracked up to me. *** (out of four).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too long and misses the mark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To see Sam Mendes team up once again with Conrad Hall is see and hope for the same excellent result in filmmaking which was accomplished with American Beauty. Somehow though, it did not happen. Road to Perdition is too long and misses the mark, the idea of fathers and sons and redemption vs. perdition, is one that could have been used with a much more poignant and visceral message and deliverance. What's more, the right actors were all there for Mr. Mendes. Finding oneself in the company of Paul Newman, Tom Hanks and Jude Law certainly gives one room for superior performances, but there is no punch to the story and the actors all seem somewhat misused (not to be mistaken with miscast) by the slow pace of the film and the lack of a definitive or strong arc in story.Mr. Hall, as per usual, shoots the film with beauty and style, yet it is frustrating to watch the camera not come in close at moments that could have been so much more if we were allowed closer to the faces in frame. But it is the director's picture, so I find Mr. Mendes to be the one at fault for this oversight. I also thought the editors could have done a better job in the cutting room. While I have no problem with movies that run long, I do have a problem with movies that run long due to not being trimmed down to the essence of the story. The film, in that sense, was somewhat vague and rambling.All of the above being said, both Paul Newman and Tom Hanks were right on the money. So also was Jude Law, although it seemed as if his part in the film was not maximized to what it could have been. Close ups or no, Conrad Hall hits paydirt with his cinematography and given that this was his last film, it is a consoling thought to think that he left at the top of his game. One of the best, he weaves a dark tapestry with careful use of light to convey the world of his subjects.Certainly not a bad film but a little disappointing given the expectations going into it. And for $80 million dollars, I believe they could have done a much better job than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bloody box of chocolate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is life another box of chocolate? Perhaps this times a rather bloody and morally reprehensible one. Is this road leading anywhere worth going? Road to Perdition tries so hard to be something that ultimately it can not accomplished that all its efforts seems so prefabricated, so full of mannerisms, so contrived that there is no room for reality or even true feelings to influence or penetrate neither the story narrative or its delivery.The film feels totally empty at its core, empty of those same values that in spite of the bloodshed and violence of the gangster world it portraits it pretends to highlight: love between father and son, filial trust, honesty. It plays with the audience natural alliance to its main character and its moral ambiguity by casting Tom Hanks as a distasteful hero but giving him an aura of respectability by focusing in his caring fatherly love.The film's contrived cinematography, the soft focus brown and sepia tones of the photography, the immaculate new repro-sets, the constant intrusion of a highly sentimental sound track that feels the need to emphasise every little nuance of the plot seems to try to make the audience an accomplice in hiding the true nature of the film's main character: a merciless gangster and a miserable b****rd. This is not The Sopranos territory where moral ambiguities and soul searching dilemmas constantly mark the plot neither The Godfather's world where character development and a genuine sense of realism prevails through the questionable characters that inhabits it.I found the film so incredible distasteful, so sickening in its Hollywood sugary levels of story telling that it makes me seriously doubt about the future abilities to mix popular culture with subtle touches of sensitivity that Sam Mendes so clearly demonstrated in his first film. Let's hope he still has something to say and he is yet not totally lost, at such a tender age, to that road leading to vacuous and meaningless success.and with another Oscar waiting at the end of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thankfully, a quiet gangster film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved the Godfather and Godfather Part II, but to be honest, old gangster movies and film noir have a way of fading out over the course of time. However, I did enjoy Road to Perdition. There was something extremely gentle about this film, from its opening soothing ocean waves, despite the extreme violence.  It's also real simple in that the plot follows one primal necessity: Michael Sullivan needs Connor Rooney dead. The journey that occurs is all perfectly attuned to the efforts and the consequences involved in that need. And there is a shot no one has mentioned here that captures the mood of the film perfectly (It's in the posters as well.)  (SPOILERS) Sullivan has appealed to John Rooney that he wants him to hand over his son Connor. Rooney refuses. Sullivan appeals to Nitti (Stanley Tucci) that he wants to be given access to Connor. Nitti refuses, because it's in his interest to maintain a good relationship with Rooney. Sullivan therefore realizes the only way to get to the son is to kill the father, who is actually more or less his own father.  The SHOT is prepped by a long shot of Newman standing outside his car in the rain surrounded by his entourage of bodyguards. There's a MS from the outside as Newman tries to enter his car and sees the driver fall onto the wheel. Then, the MCU from inside the cab shows Newman's reaction. CU outside the cab on Newman as he turns to the side, away from the open road. LS of the open road, as gunfire begins to spill out anonymously. A bodyguard fires back but is slain.  And then THE SHOT: a PAN from Newman's back to front, standing holding onto the side of his car, as his bodyguards are all slain. There is no noise of bullets, no fiery music, just a melancholy score as the camera follows the falling bodies of the entourage, until we arrive into another CU on Newman's face, perfectly aware of what is happening. Michael comes up to him, looks him in the face, and Newman says, "I'm glad it was you." The acting, the lighting, the set, the music, the camerawork, the whole damn MOMENT is so good, effortless, and understated that you almost take it for granted.  Anyways, everything else about the movie is great, although to be honest, Jude Law's character seemed kind of a wrong move. The real villain here is Connor Rooney, and he's the one that needed greater fleshing out. Besides that though, this is a stark, gentle, and excellently done gangster film that both accepts the stereotypes of the genre and moves beyond them. </fullReview>

The story of the repentance of Mike Sullivan and his only remaining son Michael is unfolds with action, humor, and heartfelt drama. The ending, don't worry no spoilers here, was the perfect conclusion to the story.

		<shortDescription>A profound film about Fathers and Sons, Perdition and Salvation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frankly, this movie has gone over the heads of most of its detractors.The opposite of perdition (being lost) is salvation (being saved) and this movie is one of a very few to deal with those two concepts. The movie also explores the love and disappointments that attend the father-son relationship. It should be noted at the outset that none of these are currently fashionable themes.The premise is that the fathers in the move, hitman Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) and his crime boss John Rooney (Paul Newman), love their sons and will do anything to protect them. But Rooney's son Connor is even more evil than the rest. He kills one of Rooney's loyal soldiers to cover up his own stealing from his father. When Connor learns that Sullivan's son Michael witnessed it, he mistakenly kills Sullivan's other son (and Sullivan's wife) in an attempt to silence witnesses.Sullivan decides he wants revenge at any price, even at the terribly high price of perdition. Rooney, who in one scene curses the day Connor was born, refuses to give up his son Connor to Sullivan, and hires a contract killer named Maguire (Jude Law) to kill Sullivan and his son. So Rooney joins his son Connor on the Road to Perdition.For the rest of the movie, accompanied by his surviving son young Michael, Sullivan pursues Connor Rooney down the Road to Perdition, and Maguire pursues Sullivan. When Sullivan confronts Rooney in a Church basement, and demands that he give up Connor because Connor murdered his family, Rooney says - "Michael, there are only murderers in this room,.., and there's only one guarantee, none of us will see Heaven."As the movie ends, somewhat predictably, one character is saved and one character repents.I'm not a big Tom Hanks fan, but he does step out of character to play hitman Sullivan convincingly, giving a subtle and laconic performance. Newman does well as the old Irish gangster Rooney, showing a hard edge in his face and manner, his eyes haunted by Connor's misdeeds. Jude Law plays Maguire in a suitably creepy way. Tyler Hoechlin plays Young Michael naturally and without affectation.The cinematography constantly played light off from darkness, echoing the themes of salvation and perdition. The camera drew from a palette of greens and greys. The greys belonged to the fathers and the urban landscapes of Depression era Illinois. The greens belonged to the younger sons and that State's rural flatlands. Thomas Newman's lush, sonorous and haunting music had faint Irish overtones and was played out in Copland-like arrangements. The sets were authentic mid-Western urban - factories, churches. The homes shone with gleaming woodwork.The excellence of the movie lies in its generation of a unique feeling out of its profound themes, distinctive acting, and enveloping music and cinematography. The only negative was a slight anti-gun message slipped into the screenpla y, the movie's only nod to political correctness.I give this movie a10 out of 10; in time it will be acknowledged as a great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some people would say that this was a dull and borish film, but I would have to disagree. This film didn't live up to expectation as "The Greatest Gangster film since The Godfather" but how can anything be ever put up against "The Godfather". Road to Perdition was just an epic story about survival. Tom Hanks played an outstanding role and Paul Newman was excellent like he has been for as long as anyone can remember. Jude Law brought that magic to the screen as he does with so many films he has stared in such as GATTACA. The film is really defined in the street scene where I think that it shows us one thing and that is that nobody can escape there destiny and those last words will sick in the back of my head for an age "I'm glad it's you" that line made the whole movie worth wild. This film should be remembered not for the floors in it and the over expectations everybody had for it, this movie should be remembered for a masterpiece of writing, Directing and Acting. It respects more than the public give it and the public should look over the floors instead of stepping straight into the holes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hideously underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERSOk, I don't get it. For a long time I've always meant to watch this film and finally getting round to it, I loved it. This film is amazing. I won't pretend I have an enourmous ammount to say, but in this film Hanks is superb in a different style of character to his usual choices.In "Road To Perdition" Hanks plays Michael Sullivan, a born and bred gangsters in the 1930's, who is forced to abandon his lifestyle when his wife and one of his sons are killed and he is forced to protect the elder son, a witness of a killing. The son is played by Tyler Hoechlin who I'm sure I've never seen before but whom probably has an excellent future in film ahead of him.I won't deny that a lot of people comment that this film is slow, at times I sympathise and come close to agreeing. The key defining feature however is that this film is how period gangster films should be made. Too often are modern day films revolving around crime underworlds being based on the Italian Mafia. These mafia spin offs are normally crude and weak, the exceptions obviously of the Godfather Trilogy and Goodfellas. With this in mind, it's a nice change to see the crime underworld of a different era featuring normal hardworking americans with families and with everyday activities and pursuits.This film, which I really can't praise enough, is outstanding. Hanks is definately worthy of another award and I fail to see why he was totally overlooked. Also Newman is superb as the elderly leader of the gangsters who can't bring himself to sacrifice his son, this notion of father son relationship being the key to the entire movie."Road To Perdition" shows us an almost honourable view of a criminal underworld in a time when life was by no means simple, but when the notions of loyalty and trust seemed to mean something. This film is a sad reminder of the disappearance of these moral necessities in the world today. Watch this film and enjoy, Hanks proves once again that he is still one of the finest actors in the world today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had high hopes for this movie, as I am a big fan of Tom Hanks. Unfortunately the film did not deliver. I felt the film lacked any emotion by any of the characters, and thus contributed to my not getting attached to the story.I was initially wanting to blame bad casting as the major problem in the film, but instead I think the problem lies with the script. There were no interesting sub-plots to draw me into the film which might make up for me not caring about the Tom Hanks character.There were two bright spots: The cinematography was excellent, and I particularly enjoyed the scene in the rain. The biggest joy in the movie was Jude Law. He was the only character with any depth.I give it five stars.</fullReview>

Sam Mendes does it again in an astounding sophomoric follow up to his excellent feature debut in American Beauty. Although this movie is an entirely different direction for Mendes he has made the transition with an amount of ease, and Conrad Hall's cinematography is some of the best to date and deservant of the Academy award. Tom Hanks, Jude Law, and particularly Paul Newman are excellent as always in this tale of fathers and sons, as an epic story unwinds. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A haunting symphony for the mind, and soul!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers[He prays at dinner and kills at dawn. Do you love such a man? This man is your father...]This is only one of the themes that "Road to Perdition" explores in each thought-provoking scene. With its poetic cinematography, haunting story and intriguing characters, "Road to Perdition" is, from start to finish, a spectacular filmmaking effort by everyone involved.In Depression-era Chicago, Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) is a hit man, working for crime boss John Rooney (Paul Newman), a man who is like a father to Sullivan. This is to the great dismay of Connor (Daniel Craig), Rooney's real son. Michael's family consists of a loyal wife, Anne (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and two young sons. The eldest, 12 year-old Michael Jr. (Tyler Hoechlin) has a rather "different" relationship with his dad and feels that his father loves his younger brother more.One night, Michael Jr., curious what his father does for Mr. Rooney, sneaks into his dad's car and witnesses a man's murder. To make sure that the boy keeps his mouth shut, a hit man targets the family killing Annie and the youngest son. He succeeds in causing chaos and grief, but misses his main targets, Michael Sr. and Jr. To protect his son and to revenge the deaths of his youngest son and wife, Michael Sr. hits the road to Perdition, a word with two meanings. On the surface Perdition is a small town where the boy's aunt resides, but perdition also means the utter loss of the soul, eternal damnation and hell. When a perverted hitman/photographer (Jude Law) is unleashed on the father/son duo, the safety of their trip is jeopardized.David Self's screenplay is based on Max Allan Collin's graphic novel. The screenplay contains dark knots, breathtaking dialogue and chilling portraits of crime figures. Perhaps inspired by the graphic nature of the novel, master cinematographer Conrad Hall scrupulously designed each shot to look like a painting. The palette is muted with a monochromatic look, and characters are dressed in dull, grave clothes (designed by Albert Wolsky) to echo the dark period of the 1931 depression. Thomas Newman's music is also effective in underlining the themes.One of the film's greatest virtues is its cast. Tom Hanks does an amazing job, playing Michael as dark and complex as possible. You can feel his moral struggle which he expresses quite often without words. It's impossible to look at Tom Hanks without having a "nice-guy" image flash (simply because that's the kind of a guy that he is), however despite this, we never doubt that Michael Sullivan has killed. Hank's oldest son, newcomer Hoechlin, proves to be a match on-screen. Hoechlin gives a subtle and refreshingly natural performance. During one scene when his character finds his mother and brother dead, his reaction is distinct, he does not cry. Only later does he allow tears to roll mercilessly.Another father/son duo is composed of Paul Newman and Daniel Craig. Newman dominates scenes physically as well as verbally. Newman plays Looney with power, extensive detail and with a subtle hint of vulnerability. In Newman's own words, "A nice guy, who's a killer." His onscreen son, played by Craig, portrays Connor as sly, devilish, charming, sad and hurt in a very memorable, very real performance.One actor that doesn't seem capable of giving a poor performance is Oscar Nominee Jude Law (The Talented Mr. Ripley, Enemy of the Gates, AI). Without exception Law take another strong turn here. Director Sam Mendes exploits Law's unique qualities, creating an extremely creepy vision of a hit man who "photographs" his victims. Jennifer Jason Leigh as Annie Sullivan and Stanley Tucci as Frank Nitti also add much oomph to the supporting cast.Mendes makes sure to make the film as visually dynamic as possible. While some of the scenes may go on for some time without action, the images pose a somewhat poetic dialogue. As a director Mendes had to make many choices. He does a good job of surrounding the incredible performances with jarring scenery. As for deciding the moral fate of his tale, it is the scenes that invoke a response. The scenes are vivid and sincere. They challenge the audience from one moment to the next.What is also nice about this film is that it does not glorify gangsters in any way. And although "Road to Perdition" is rated R, it doesn't use unnecessary violence. It is only shown when such blood-shed contributes to the plot or emotional impact."Road to Perdition," essentially a film about a man whose soul is beyond saving, but still has a chance to save his son's, could very well be the fourth Best Picture in a row for Dreamworks. The entire piece blends in as a haunting symphony and it haunts the mind, as well as the soul.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unbelievable cast and crew make this film a timeless piece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mendes is turning out to be in the class of Peter Weir in that he bides his time and takes a script with depth, meaning, and weight. This is refreshing. His grasp of visual story telling is uniquely superb. Nothing is wasted and every element: writing, casting, set decor, acting, cinematography is integrated masterfully by Mendes (as it was in American Beauty). If you enjoy story 1st and have no patience for gratuitous gangland violence, then this is a film for you. Its gangland Chicago during the depression and the local mob boss Rooney (played by Paul Newman) has two sons: a surrogate son, Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) and a natural born son, Conner(played beautifully by Daniel Craig). Connor inflicts atrocities (out of jealousy) on Sullivan, who is an ingenious hit man with supernatural excellence. Sullivan, driven by revenge, seeks to save his son Michael from the same "Road" that he has taken. The visual imagery was amazing. It takes a person to the era and Conrad Hall did such a great job of capturing Mendes' vision without lighting too much "on the nose". Editing was brilliant, this movie doesn't get slow, or needlessly 'cut around'. The editing is invisible and the pacing is perfect to the story. This is a DVD worth owning.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every scene is lit, shot and acted as though it's the most important scene in the whole film. But they can't ALL be the most important scene in the whole film. The implied equal weight placed on every single little thing makes the whole film, and one's eyelids, feel heavy and sluggish.It's not a bad story - it was the story, presumably, that was responsible for the film getting made in the first place - and with a lighter, less pompous and more varied touch, it could have been far more than it is: a mildly enjoyable, perfectly realised evocation of nothing very much. The people who make gangster films need to realise that the mere fact gangsters break the law and commit murder doesn't make their personal lives and concerns any more interesting or pregnant with meaning than those of, say, bakers.Tom Hanks is as good here as he is anywhere else ... which is to say, professional, unremarkable, and uncharismatic. Actually he turns in one of the best performances of his career. It's not his fault that that being a hitman made to seem a trifle dull.The photography is striking, and it's certainly the film's strongest point. But it IS possible, you know, to have equally striking photography without leaving the impression that the director is navigating his way from one self-consciously impressive shot to the next.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some films you should watch only once.R to P is a good example. A combination of Tom Hanks, Jude Law, Sam Mendes and clever enticing trailers persuaded me I should watch it at the cinema. I did so and came away reasonably entertained. A decent atmospheric movie, captured the times wonderfully, it looked so good on a big screen.Having just seen it again for a second time on TV I can't believe I was so taken in. What is it all about? American fealgood?A ruthless, psychopathic, low life, gangster hit man? Hang on a bit now, we are talking Tom Hanks here. We can't have that! We all know Tom is a good guy. A family man. An all American guy but in this case, a tad emotionally suppressed, not unlike the crew cut nutter in American Beauty. In true Hollywood style there is an excruciatingly sentimental attempt to re-write a violent era of American history. Sullivan, a perpetrator of violence for profit, is portrayed as a victim. OK, in the past, he has had to murder lots of low life's to keep his family in fried chicken but, deep down, all he wants to do is help the poor dirt farmers? He's Robin Hood at heart. Good old Tom. The solid Irish guy Rooney does the decent thing by holding his hands up and saying "I'm glad it's you". I ask you, how on earth could any decent Irish American expect Paul Newman to endure anything less than such a dignified death. What a great guy! Even Nitti, the top anti social degenerate, is portrayed as a kindly sage. Come off it! What a load of (expletive).The ending, reminiscent of the Superman orphan scenario, goes a little way to redeeming the film, but a high price is paid for getting there.I like Tom Hanks. He's a fine actor, never less so than in the Green mile, but if he carries on like this he will go down as some kind of John Wayne. Perhaps he's happy with that?It's a five because it looks good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Beautiful Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILER WARNING!!!! A stunningly beautiful film in spite of its unpleasant subject matter, Road To Perdition with its all star dream cast and incredible photography makes all the right moves and the effect is breathtaking. Tom Hanks casts away his good guy image in favor of a reluctant hit man for the mob and Paul Newman near the end of one of the greatest film careers in history, were simply born to play off each other, whether in scenes discussing their uneasy relationship or gently touching the keys on a piano. And fifteen year old newcomer, Tyler Hoechlin who according to this web site beat out two thousand child actors for this part, more than holds his own against actors far more experienced than he. One of my favorite scenes in this film... Michael Sullivan sits and eats in a diner while his son waits in the car during their run for revenge. In comes the evil killer for hire and photographer to the dead, McGuire who sits directly across from Sullivan. Watch Tom Hanks as he says little and acts only with his eyes while he sizes him up quickly, not even blinking for what seems like an eternity. When McGuire puts film in his camera and sits it on the table pointed directly at Sullivan, Michael knows he's about to become the latest poster boy in a murderous gallery of death. Don't even dare to blink or you'll miss the micro-second as Sullivan grabs a knife off the table to use outside in order to buy some time to escape with his son.A brilliant scene of understated acting, Hanks has simply never been better. While not nearly as good or as epic in scope as The Godfather, Road To Perdition does what that classic did so well. It gives us basically unpleasant characters involved in a dirty and sordid business and makes us care about them in spite of what we see. Michael Sullivan may be the first hit man with a heart, but he's still basically a killer, never hesitating to put a gun to someone's head and blow them away. That he only kills other mob members who have gone astray is of little comfort. But his reluctance to involve his son is still touching and Hanks brilliantly brings just a touch of humanity to the inhumane.In the end, this is a film not so much about the sins of the father, but the salvation of the son. But aside from all of this. if you don't like the actors or the story, you can just sit and look at this incredibly beautiful film. Every moment in every scene, whether one of violence or just someone walking away from the camera, is so lovingly and carefully created, you can only wonder how one cinematographer could be so talented. That would be the late Conrad Hall. Anyone unfamiliar with what this man has done for decades, needs to go back to the early part of his career, and the memorable film, In Cold Blood.At the very beginning of that movie, while the opening credits are just begining to roll, we see a bus speeding down a highway. Inside the darkened bus, a little girl walks up the aisle, as she hears someone strumming a guitar and investigates. She runs up against the guitar player and says, "excuse me." Robert Blake, playing Perry Smith, one of the killers to be, says nothing as he lights a match and holds it so that the light just barely illuminates his face. This one simple scene strikes fear in the viewer's heart right from the outset and it never lets up. Conrad Hall recreated that kind of scene for decades and this, his last and perhaps greatest overall effort is filled with them. From the acting, to the scenery, music, costumes and its amazing sense of time and place, Road To Perdition travels on a highway to perfection. On a scale of 1 to 10... easily a 10 Bobbynear &nbsp;</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Four and a Half Artists and Two Dupes.This director understands a secret of casting and how to exploit the weaknesses and strengths of an actor. The story here is framed in terms of two men who know what they are doing, played by Newman and Law. Both are extremely self-aware actors that are able to create a separate whole being beside which they stand and control. In the story, Newman's character has charisma and control. Law's is the surrogate for the filmmaker -- he is gifted, seems to know more than any character, and is concerned with photographing the violent end of people. This is already a signature of Mendez, this newscamera is just like the videojournal of `Beauty.' Look at how Law has adjusted his posture and walk. (Compare it to how Jennifer Leigh has not and presumably cannot.)Mendez uses these two as puppeteers who dimly are aware that they themselves are puppets of Hall and Mendez, currently the best pairing of director and cinematographer we have. Below them we have the two hapless characters: Sullivan and son. The genius of this film is that they are played by actors who are not in control, who themselves don't know what Mendez is doing to them. They are victims as actors as well as characters. Many have noted Hanks' limits as an actor here and consider that a flaw. No indeed.In between the two is the Tucci/Nitti character who is nominally powerful, but himself is subject to forces beyond his control. Look at how his body language is ambiguous, and ambiguously staged.So I find three things of interest here: -- how Mendez understands his actors and passes that information to the actors, -- how Conrad is able to take that information and create Tarkovsky-like tone poems that leverage the narrative (watch how Conrad understands Newman's face. Two previous collaborations between this face and camera are in the iMDb top films.and-- how this is served back to the viewer as explicit voyeurism in terms of a skulking character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Road To Pretension</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No miracle can save a film based on a bad script. An all-star cast may help its box-office opening, but will surely not add soul to a dead skeleton. Participation of an acting legend will add nothing other than diminish his own stature. A reputable editor will lack pieces for putting together an attractive mosaic. A hot-shot director can only do one thing with it - refuse to film it. With mediocre screenplay the things will go from bad to worse. When a movie is mainly praised for its cinematography and its acting, its a smoking gun something's fishy. A producer attempting to film a flat script is on a creative suicide mission. It's somewhat like bluffing high stakes with a badly dealt hand. Things are rotten in this sanctimonious depiction of 30's Irish mob. To be like my father or not to be? That is a puzzle confronting Michael Jr., a son of a dour mafia hit-man. Tom Hanks, emulating in turn Clint Eastwood's cool and Michael Madsen's brute, plays Micheal Sullivan, an enforcer for Chicago's alcohol mob boss John Rooney (Looney). The film is supposed to be about family and vengeance. About a mobster not wanting his son to follow in his father's footsteps. Hey, what about 'Godfather'? Couldn't Don Corleone's saga be titled, less imaginativly,'Road to Perdition'. Isn't Perdition all Micheal Corlone has left at the end of the road? Choosing a theme and milieu for their movie identical to a recognized Hollywood landmark was certainly not a creative challenge for its producers (another father and son - the Zanucks). The monetary potentials of producing a popular graphic novel with expectations of a built-in teenage audience are more likely reason.'Road to Perdition' has frustration and lameness leaking from all its sides. Its a downpour folks, take your umbrellas along! Hardly anything seems to work here. Mediocre opening and cheesy closing narration add insult to injury. Uninspired editing raises level of boredom to annoyance. No character development undermines credibility of relationships and caricatures some of its protagonists (Jude Law's Maguire, a psychotic hit man whom Capone's mob hires to take Sullivan out). An engaging yet unstoppable tidal wave of a musical score overwhelms nearly every scene, to an extent that, by the end of the movie, you wish you had a remote in your hand to turn the damn music off. Inconsistencies in plot twists and characterization demand unreasonable suspension of disbelief (Sullivan and Rooney together on a piano - come on, what is this, a period French costume drama!?). The film's major story thrust is in defiance with logic and gangster etiquette. (Connor, Rooneys son, decides to protect himself by exterminating Sullivan's wife and a kid!? It is quite unlikely that even a psycho would think Sullivan's son would blow the whistle on his own father.). Director's slippery thematic grasp muddles already turbulent waters. Infusing protagonists' interplay with late twenties sensitivities is another fatal flaw. Proclaiming Sam Mandes an interesting director after his 'American Beauty' turns out a bit too premature. A sampling of the hype bestowed on the movie is revealing of the corrupted state of mainstream movie criticism. Kenneth Turan of Los Angeles Times praises the movie as "resonant story with the potent, unrelenting fatalism of a previously unknown Greek myth".New York Times Stephen Holden: "a period gangster film that achieves the grandeur of a classic Hollywood western". Peter Travers of Rolling Stone Magazine says the movie "...reveals something elemental about fathers and sons and the bloodlust that seems hard-wired into the American character...the passion and precision of 'Road to Perdition' is staggering".One can't help but feel they all sound a little like corrupted Wall Street investment analysts praising WorldCom or Enron stocks right before their catastrophic collapse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Graphic Novel Conversion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Road To Perdition is an excellent film. It's a prohibition era, coming of age,crime noir based on the graphic novel of the same name, which incidentally, is based on the Lone Wolf and Cub manga series, one of Japan's longest running and most beloved Manga's and inspiration for my all time personal favourite film, Shogun Assassin. Sam Mendes has crafted his best film to date here. For the last few years Mr Mendes has been making DC Bond movies, and is highly praised by critics, but to me, R.T.P is his best work, by far. It's perfectly executed, and almost flawless in every regard.First, the script. The script is tight. A very faithful recreation of the novel. It's more or less pitch perfect, and all the actors play their parts with zeal, it goes without saying that Tom Hanks, cast against type, is the stand out performer, every word, nuance of a mob hit-man is played perfectly by Hanks. He is 100% believable as a mob enforcer, Tom is able to push forth the menace and dangerousness of Michael Sullivan, without skipping a beat. I always enjoy Tom's performances, and even though he subtly underplays this character, it works to great effect. Also the repertoire between Hanks and his young son, played by Tyler Hoechlin, is the highlight of the film. It plays out kind of like a road buddy movie, in parts. And I especially enjoyed the scenes of Michael SR teaching Michael JR how to drive before they pull off a bank job. It's a great moment of humour after all the tragedy and bloodshed. Which brings me to the pacing, it's done well. The film follows the style, tone, and pacing of the novel expertly. I'm amazed Mendes was able to pull off such a perfect recreation without having to make any concessions, or changing things up too much, which seems to be what happens to every comic book film that comes out now. R.T.P is in a league of it's own in that regard. It's the best comic/novel conversion done in recent years. Aside from Kick Ass. The other actors are all superb in their performances. Paul Newman shines, as always, as does Daniel Craig, who plays Mr Rooney's simpering, psychotic son with slimy relish. The visuals are lush and gorgeous, taken directly from the book, but made real. The way Mendes recreates the aesthetics from the novel, but in colour, is outstanding. Every scene is gorgeous. I'm already a prohibition film fan so I'm already predisposed to like what I saw in R.T.P. But even if you aren't a fan of those type of films, this film is still worth a watch, just for the beauty of the visuals alone. The story closely follows the plot of the book, albeit with a few minor tweaks and changes, which make the story a bit smoother for the viewer. But there is nothing of importance omitted or changed so much it's unrecognisable. If you enjoy the novel, then you'll certainly enjoy the film which recreates it flawlessly. And would be hard pressed to find any scene or line of dialogue that isn't in the book. What I loved about this film is the way, as with the novel, it ties in the fictional Rooney family with real world mobsters like Capone. One particular highlight is when the Sullivan's rob banks, but only take Capones dirty money. I bet not even the legendary Al would want to tangle with Tom Hank's, Michael Sullivan. The eccentric hit-man the mob employ to take out Sullivan is also played well by Jude Law, also cast against type. The final showdown, and when the pair meet for the first time are both fantastic scenes.The sound design is great. The musical styling of Thomas Newman fits perfectly in this film. And all the lovingly recreated sounds of the 1930's are spot on. Not a tone out of place. It's like you are really inserted back into that time. The sound design alone should have won some awards. So authentic it is. So what's left to say other than this is one of the better big budget films to come out of Hollywood in recent years. Another great aspect is the fact it's not bogged down with political correctness or political subtext, which seemingly, every single film is filled with, recently. It's just a well made, well acted, straight up revenge story and that's it's strength. Is this my fave prohibition era film? No, but it's up there with the greats like White Heat. A rip roaring 2 hours of good movie, which is an accolade in and of itself in this day and age.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tale of revenge and redemption</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Sullivan Jr doesn't know what his father does for a living; he just knows he works for John Rooney; a wealthy man who looks on Michael's father as a son. Then one day Michael Jnr hides in his father's car as he goes to work with Rooney's real son Connor. Rooney is a gangster and Michael Sullivan (senior) is his enforcer; on this day Michael and Connor are just meant to 'have a word' with somebody but Connor kills him and realises that they have been seen. Sullivan assures him that his son won't tell anybody but that isn't enough for Connor; he is determined to ensure his safety even if it means eliminating the entire Sullivan family! He kills Sullivan's wife and younger son but Sullivan and Michael Jnr survive and are forced to go on the run. Knowing Sullivan will want revenge on his real son Rooney sends a killer after the two. On the road together the father and son get to know each other better than they ever did before.It isn't surprising that this film is pretty good given those involved with it. Director Sam Mendes does a fine job keeping the pace relatively slow without things getting boring; this gives us a chance to get to know the characters and actually care about them rather than just enjoying the action. The cast is full of well-known actors; Tom Hanks, Paul Newman, Jude Law, Daniel Craig, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Ciarán Hinds most notably and some of these are in relatively small parts. These and the rest of the cast do a fine job although some may find Hanks a bit too nice for somebody who is a killer. The less well known Tyler Hoechlin does well as twelve year-old Michael Jnr.Given the subject matter it won't be surprising to learn that there is a fair amount of violence although it doesn't feel gratuitous and is sometimes more shocking than exciting. There may be no real twists in the story; indeed the ending had more than a degree of inevitability about it but that is one of the films strengths; the Road to Perdition is a journey without detours and unexpected turns. Overall a film that is well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All Roads Lead To Hell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Sullivan, the man played by Tom Hanks, hardly ever smiles in this movie. And it's easy to see why. He works for a crime family led by Mr Rooney ( Paul Newman) where killing is an everyday activity. Michael has a wife and two sons, all of which owe their livelihood to Mr Rooney, but is it worth the human cost? Rooney himself has a screw-up son called Connor (Daniel Craig, pre James Bond) who he doesn't seem to like very much... he prefers Michael.This creates friction between Michael and the useless offspring of Rooney... a fact that is highlighted one day when Sullivan's eldest son secretly follows his father during one of his 'jobs'... And witnesses cold blooded murder in action. Sworn to secrecy by his dad, Connor secretly goes behind everyone's back and tries to wipe out Sullivan and his family under the false pretense that the kid might snitch ( the real reason is jealousy)... He succeeds in killing only Michael's wife and younger child. On the run now in Chicago with his only surviving son, Sullivan swears revenge. But he doesn't count on Rooney to hire a psychopathic hit-man/photographer (Jude Law) to track him down...Road To Perdition is mostly about the relationship between a boy and his father. We see this in the contrast between Michael's undying love for his children (the only strong emotion we see him display is when he discovers the corpses of his deceased spouse and younger son) and Rooney's contemptuous treatment of Connor. The message seems to be: Nurture your child, and give them the love and discipline they need, and you'll have someone to cherish like Sullivan's kids. Ignore them, and spoil them rotten and may just end up with a pampered idiot like Connor. The choice is yours...Brilliantly directed by Sam Mendes, each scene is shot with precision to create just the right amount of tension and atmosphere. Each actor inhabits their role bringing pathos or menace as required, and there isn't a single wasted moment where you think a scene could have jettisoned. Of note particularly is the chemistry between Hanks and the young child actor (Tyler Hoechlin), who's by his side for most of the movie. Both are so perfectly in synch with each other, you'd swear they were related in real life. A blood test necessary, perhaps?Basically, just a wonderful film. With amazing rewatchability. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A bloody gangster story which takes place in the years of Great Depression. It tells us about another notorious hit-man, Michael (Mike) Salliwan. Somehow, this time the story turns the other way round: Mike fights to save his life and his only remaining son, because the rest of his family was killed due to dirty game of his own boss. He succeeds in his revenge and secures honorable future to his son, but gets killed in the end. Such stories never have happy end after all.The role of Mike Salliwan senior was wonderfully played by Tom Hanks, and the part of Mr. Rooney (the Mafia boss) was performed by Paul Newman. The film makes a great impression, and we hear the well-known phrase "we rob banks". This film is still worth watching although you could have expected something bigger from Sam Mendes after his American Beauty.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie. American gangster flicks have been done so more times before, with such a tried and tested formula, that I had readied myself for more of the same.By focusing on one, conflicted character, Michael Sullivan played by Tom Hanks, Road to Perdition avoided this pitfall. Sullivan is someone who wants to do the right thing but puts his family first and is prepared to kill to defend them. Someone who sees clearly the problems and contradictions of the shadowy world he's caught up in, but is obsessed with the thought of dealing out revenge. Hanks plays it very well.It's worth watching. A feel good movie. But also a movie that is careful to apply a dose of realism to proceedings and not to glorify wrongdoing. I very much enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sweet Surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've heard about it for years, but it was never on TV, and I finally got it from the library. Amid the pile of rentals I'd gotten, the tommy gun that Hanks is carrying on the cover intrigued me more than the others because I generally enjoy mobster flicks. However, after reading the back of the DVD, the last thing I expected was a mob film. It sounded like a drama of some sort with a core relationship between a father and son. I thought Paul Newman was the father, and Tom Hanks was the son, who later had a son of his own. Boy, was I wrong.The plot boils down to simplicity, but the artful presentation elevates it. Sam Mendes, I presume, was responsible for this elegance. Before long I realized that I was privy to the song and dance that cloaked the bloodstained secrecy of the mob world. One boy's mistake later, and the charade started crumbling apart.What was left was a revenge story built on family and consequence. I liked how the movie was told by looking into Sullivan's eyes during a chilling car ride, using few words to move the story along in favor of action and tension. As the boy narrator sees it, it could be seen as bonding time between father and son in the face of danger, contrition and ire. There is an enviable moment when the son sticks his head out of the car window as his hair blows in the wind. He is enjoying time with his father that he had never gotten before, even whilst they are on traveling down a path of vengeance. His father isn't a hero, but they both love and need the same things. When those comforts are taken away, the father has his guilt and the boy has a lesson to learn.Before watching this film, I'd never seen a silent shootout in a rainstorm. The musical score is delicate, and the usage of misdirection (although I have seen it before in Carlito's Way) was done with the same muted brilliance. By its wholesome themes and morals, Road to Perdition was a sweet surprise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on the same-titled graphic novel by Max Allan Collins and Richard Piers Rayner, "Road to Perdition" thrusts us back into the age of tommy-guns, depression economics and romanticised mafia. In all essence a coming-of-age story of Michael Sullivan Jr (Tyler Hoechlin), named after his father, an orphan and professional mob enforcer (Tom Hanks). A delicate and caring father does his utmost to detach the family life from his brutal devotion to Irish mob boss John Rooney (Paul Newman). Inclined to discover the truth behind his father's work, Michael stows away in his car and concurrently witnesses the gunning down of local unionists by the unstable son of Ronney, Connor (Daniel Craig). This ultimately results in the psychotic Connor murdering Michael's mother and younger brother, leaving him and his father no option but to seek refuge in his aunt's home in Perdition. Despite practically raising Michael Sullivan and proclaiming fatherly love to him, John Rooney seeks to protect his biological son from vengeance and sends out crime scene photographer and part-time contract killer Harlen Maguire (Jude Law) to dispose of him...Never a great fan of Tom Hanks, the Oscar-winning actor manages to bestow his character with a rigid warmth, which brings a surprising hearty ambiguity to the ruthless enforcer with a well-placed soft side. Still best intentions will never make him seem fitting for a role of a ruthless crime enforcer. Despite the unrelenting brutality of "Road to Perdition" it is in all essence a delicate ode to father-son relationships and the depths of sacrifice. Urges of vengeance rear to the forefront, but the underlying motives are always governed by necessity and fatherly care. To some extent issues portrayed and their dramatic conclusions are fairly predictable - a father longing for his son to lead a better life and not replicate his life, a story of the limits and cost of vengeance. Symbolism is therefore pretty rough and easily read, but still nonetheless a strong compelling story dominates over such flaws. Of special note are cinematographic framings, managing to instill a sense of artistry, whilst capturing outtakes from comic scenes. The story itself is told in cohorts with the outside world, setting the mood, shifting from rain, murkiness and confined spaces to light, spacious discovery, when drifting from the dark tone to its more optimistic moments. Visually "The Road to Perdition" is absolutely stunning, hence despite the flaws in plot obviousness or miscast actors Sam Mendes comes out a big winner, with several spectacular moments of genius, where he chooses to opt out of the obvious and focus on the emotional backdrop of the situation. Killing and vengeance are not the main themes, but simply outcomes of what happens to our protagonists. Therefore their reaction is key, not the mindless murders.A shout out for Jude Law and his creepy photograph assassin, one of the entirely memorable and downright despicable baddies in contemporary cinema, bringing out ecstatic satisfaction, whenever the tables get turned and instead of being the harbinger of doom, becomes the recipient of pain.</fullReview>

The master stroke is casting Jude Law as an assassin on Hank's trail. Law scorches the screen and will make your hair stand on end by his totally awesome performance.

		<shortDescription>Gangster-Era Revenge Drama.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not to be dismissed too lightly. Conrad Hall's photography won an Academy Award, for one thing, and as little as one might think of these honors, it was deserved, and not just for Hall's work on this film.It's 1931 in the upper Midwest and Mob Master Rooney (Newman) is holding a wake for one of his dead henchmen. It's a lively affair with jigs and reels and plenty of hootch and whatnot -- these being Irish gangsters and not Italians -- and Newman delivers an encomium to the deceased before turning the floor over the the cadaver's brother. The brother appears to have imbibed a dram too much because, after mentioning the many virtues of the departed, he turns on Newman and begins what sounds like the beginning of an insult -- "You say one thing and then you turn around and...." He's hustled out the door before he gets himself in a jam.Newman and two of his henchman watch the drunken brother being driven home. One of the henchmen, Tom Hanks, explains that the guy simply had too much to drink. "Sure," says Newman with genuine understanding, and then tells the two goons to go to the drunken brother's home and make sure everything is okay -- "Just talk to him." They talk to him, as instructed, but when the guy gets truculent, the second goon, Daniel Craig in a good performance, pulls out a gun and shoots him through the head.This leaves Newman outraged but Craig is Newman's son and there's nothing he can do, not even when Craig eliminates Hanks' wife and son at their home. Now Hanks and his remaining little boy are intent on killing Craig, but Newman can't allow that so he calls in an assassin from out of town and sets him in pursuit of Hanks and son. The imported gunslinger is an evil-looking Jude Law.It's already a little complicated and I don't want to go on with the plot in any detail. The eponymous "Perdition" has a double meaning; it's the name of a rural town somewhere north of Chicago and, of course, it also suggests the hell that Hanks -- a murderer himself -- is headed towards. There's a second theme, the connection between Hanks and his surviving son, that's handled quietly and without sentiment, only one and a half hugs, and neither ever smiles at the other.As you can tell, this is not a gay romp through the Springtime park. Most scenes are shot at night. There's not an abundance of blood but there's enough. There are few pleasantries among the several characters -- including one from Frank Nitti, played by Stanley Tucci -- but they are as sincere as the happy grins of synchronized swimmers. Some of the scenes are almost hair-raisingly suspenseful. One takes place in a diner, and you aren't likely to miss it.In the end, these Depression gangster movies have their limits. When did they begin to become so popular? "The Godfather"? That was forty years ago. How much steam can be left in that chugging donkey engine?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After his immense Oscar winning success with American Beauty, Sam Mendes went back a few decades to make the 1930's gangster period piece Road To Perdition. Tom Hanks stars as Michael Sullivan, a hit-man whose son finds out what he does for a living on one fateful night. This stirs up more trouble than Sullivan and his son could have expected, and they are forced to go on the run from Sullivan's employer who is now trying to have him killed. The film is more emotional and moving than it is exciting, but it tells an excellent story.American Beauty boasted a sprawling cast of huge actors like Kevin Spacey, Anette Benning, Chris Cooper, and Peter Gallagher, and Road to Perdition is no different. Tom Hanks stars in a rigidly brilliant performance as Michael Sullivan. Behind him is a cavalcade of big stars like Jude Law, Daniel Craig, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and also the legendary Paul Newman. All of these actors sincerely own their roles and each character in this film is unforgettable.Road to Perdition was originally a graphic novel. I've never read this graphic novel so I can't say if the movie does it justice or not. However, you can see some of the stylization of a graphic novel translated into the look and feel of the film. There are lots of still shots, excellently framed and beautifully shot. Sam Mendes shows off some fantastic camera work in this film along with cinematographer Conrad L. Hall.The whole design of the film is superb. There are great set pieces that range from bustling cities to sweeping countrysides. Each set is decorated beautifully and sucks you right in to the time period in which the film is set.As far as story and script goes for Road to Perdition, it's all very well done. The story is full of ambiguity and it can be a little difficult to keep up at times, but by the end it all comes together to make enough sense, and the climactic payoff rounds the story off to be excellent. Nothing in particular stands out as far as dialogue is concerned, but there's certainly nothing wrong with it. Really there's not much wrong with this film at all. It periodically leans toward melodrama, but that more or less comes with the territory. Road to Perdition is a fantastic film that shouldn't be missed. It's nowhere near as impressive as Mendes' previous film but, then again, few films are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Per·di·tion (noun) - Loss of the soul; eternal damnation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not a Tom Hanks fan, and usually I avoid his movies, as they tend to be overrated and too feel-goody for me. Road To Perdition, however, is neither a feel good nor a horror movie. It is a mob movie, but not the kind you'd expect. The story is about Michael Sullivan (Hanks), ideal father by day, mob hit man by night. He is doesn't kill out of pleasure, but out of duty and gratitude to his boss, John Rooney (Paul Newman), for providing him with a secure and comfortable life. One dark and stormy night, Sullivan's older son Michael Jr. (Tyler Hoechlin) goes on a secret ride-a-long and witnesses dad in action. He is sworn to secrecy, but Rooney's son (Daniel Craig), won't take any chances and wacks Sullivan's wife and younger child. Bent on revenge and protecting his Jr's life, Sullivan goes on the road, but on his heels is wetboy/photographer Harlen Maguire (Jude Law).You are transported to Capone's depression-era Chicago via stunning photography, which is authentically representational. The set and costume design are formidable and arguably the best the industry has seen for some time. Additionally, the use of shadows and darkness in this film are deftly and potently used, underscoring mood. Many characters hide, emerge, and live in the shadows -- rain and sun are used at key moments within the film. Conjointly there is a superb score by composer Thomas Newman that permeates each scene, but during the climatic scene of a machine gun massacre in the pouring rain, the arias fall mute. It is very powerful.There are biblical references here in the movie, as Sullivan is on both a literal and spiritual road to perdition. There is of course the primary plot of father and sons, blood being thicker than water, and loyalties and the ties that bind. Each father in the story want to protect his son, and each son in the story only wants his father's approval.The movie was well acted and none of the actors were over-beautified; even the handsome Jude Law managed to look ghoulish to appear true to his part. Tom Hank's upper-lip seemed a nesting ground for a butterfly's larval stage, and that nose putty he was forced to use was equally goofy. Paul Newman looked distinguished and there is no reason that we should expect anything less.I applaud this effort by Sam Mendes (American Beauty), who shows that it is indeed possible to still make an extraordinary movie, perhaps pointing out the bar that the big studios seem to be ignoring. As I stated before, I am not a Tom Hanks enthusiast (actually he annoys me), and this film somehow wound up in my Netflix queue, but regardless of my feelings towards Hanks, this is a film is to be seen, discussed, and appreciated for the terrific work it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over-cooked but under-prepared</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The translation of my summary is this: lots of casting, production costs, and post-prod went into it, but it was so full of filming glitches, set errors, and technical mistakes that discerning cinephiles will feel cheated at the lack of proper preparation, editing, and re-shooting that would have warranted a devoted audience. Is this the legacy of CG, that traditional cinematic art and skill is rapidly evaporating? Just read through the list of a dozen goofs. It's appalling, and there are lots more. Night street scenes in a big, tumultuous city, but the only people visible are the actors - the good guys and bad guys - no "civilians" anywhere on the street. Jude Law puts a bullet through the back window of Hanks's car, from directly behind, and the bullet hits no one but never comes through the front window; it just vanishes. The film-maker insults the viewer by assuming he won't see the errors or doesn't care enough about cinema to think it's important. Cinema isn't watching television - it's creating art on film, playing actors like stunning instruments, and giving the viewer a riveting, absorbing, transporting experience, one that suspends disbelief in a larger, more deeply colored, more enthralling world. RTP is just a long, expensive comic book at the pictures, and a mediocre one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sombre And Sometimes Even Gloomy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The highlight of this movie for me was without doubt Tom Hanks. As Mike Sullivan, he was definitely cast against type and showed that he can handle an untraditional (for him) role. Hanks is usually the good guy in a movie - the one you like, admire and root for. Sullivan was definitely not a good guy. It's true that in the context of this movie he came across as somewhat noble - his purpose being to avenge the murders of his wife and youngest son. Even so, he was already a gangster and murderer before those killings. So Hanks took a role I wouldn't have expected him in, and he pulled it off well.Hanks' good performance aside, though, I certainly couldn't call this an enjoyable movie. After an opening that I would best describe as enigmatic (it wasn't entirely clear to me for a while where this was going) it turns into a very sombre movie, about the complicated relationships Sullivan has developed as a gangster - largely raised by Rooney (Paul Newman), who's a sort of mob boss, and trying to raise his own two sons and to keep them "clean" so to speak; isolated from his business. After the older son witnesses a murder, the gang tries to kill him to keep him quiet, gets the wrong son (and the mother), and leaves Sullivan and his older son (Mike, Jr.) on the run. It becomes a weird sort of father/son bonding movie.Although it ends on a somewhat hopeful note (at least in the overall context of the story) it's really very dark throughout, that mood being reinforced with many of the scenes being shot in darkness and torrential rainfall. I have to confess that while I appreciated Hanks' performance, the movie as a whole just didn't pull me in. 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gotta love Tom Hanks.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Honestly i only watched this movie because of Tom Hanks. He is among one of the greatest and my favourite actors.The originality of the plot was impressing. It was particularly interesting to see how Tom hanks' son was very cold blooded when he saw his dead mother and brother. Also i liked the fact that this movie had a whole different dimension to it with the character that Jude Law plays. Very different and interesting.However i do feel that the movie had a little more potential than it delivered considering that it had great actors and original story line. It's got a lot of dialogue and not so much action, but despite all of that, i enjoyed the movie and i think that it's definitely worth watching. It's perfect lengthwise and the twist at the end is unexpected and touching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen Road to Perdition twice, and I've had about the same experience as when I watched American Beauty multiple times: The first time, I thought, "This is a beautiful film with so many symbolic scenes and deeper interpretations to think about." But when I saw it again, I was like, "Good lord, can you make the symbolism any more obvious?!" Road to Perdition holds up better over time than American Beauty, but even still, a consistent trait is emerging with Sam Mendes' films: The film will have a star-studded cast, solid screen writing, innovative cinematography, and so on--all the elements needed for a great, Oscar-caliber film. The problem is, Mendes seemingly can't just let these elements naturally carry the movie to the upper echelons of film-making. Instead, he floods the film with an avalanche of visual and verbal symbols, so that the audience staggers out of the theater overwhelmed by the film's portentous importance. (There's Michael Sullivan and Michael, Jr. racing across the Illinois plains to escape the crime syndicate and look, they just drove through a crossroad! Oooh, the symbolic crossroads of Sullivan's decision to exact revenge. . . .) In the end, you actually have an oddly hollow film with tons of glitter but not a lot of gold.Road to Perdition is certainly not in the realm of The Godfather, the definitive American movie about organized crime in which the plot unfolds with unassuming immediacy and the powerful deeper meanings subtly seep through. But it is a good movie, and probably the most re-watchable of Mendes' major films so far (I have a feeling that Jarhead would grate on my nerves the second time around too).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Liked the characters and dialog's, but "Plot points" were contrived</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I agree with all the boulder sized accolades that have been hurled at this movie, however, despite the fine performances of Hanks and Newman, I cannot feel comfortable with a story line that jumps out and exclaims that "I am a contrived "Plot Point".Please believe me" A plot point should move the story line in a believable direction rather than simply finding a way for the end to justify the means.Assuming that the Hanks character is a world class hit man and knows the rules under which hit men must operate, "Plot Point" number one occurs as a contrivance, showing Hanks' disregarding the rules of hit-man-ship and their terminal consequences, when his son stows away under the back seat (Contrived)to accompany his father and Newman's dumb as a shovel son on a warning mission to a fellow mobster. Instead of a warning, Newman's son kills the mobster. Hanks' son becomes a witness, and the rules dictate that Hanks' family be eliminated. They are, except for the stowaway who is now on the run with Hanks.As a amateur hit man, this is what I would have done.I would have placed my son under the seat from whence he emerged, walked back into the crime scene with Newman's son, while in soothing tones explaining how everything could be smoothed over. When close to the dead mobster, I would have shot Newman's son, placed a gun in the mobster's hand, drove back to Paul and pleaded, " Sorry sir, it just happened so fast I couldn't stop it" I would have saved my family, and placed only myself in jeopardy. If Newman shot me, the movie might have ended prematurely.The cadaverous photographer placed on Hank's tail got a contrived "Plot point" break when Hanks failed to kill him when he was wounded behind a sofa. This allowed Hanks to get wounded, recovered at the home of a caring older couple, and to an ending that was sadly predictable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Please God, let it be over soon (a rant, with minor spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I have to admit that I haven't watched the whole thing yet. The final reel is playing, but I've already given up any hope of finding redeeming qualities in this piece of drivel. I had the same problem with Sam Mendes' other 'masterpiece', American Beauty, which a similarly paint-by-numbers piece of film-making. Hang on, the final scene...Ah, it's finally over, and I can turn the lights on again (God, I wish I could touch-type. I was deleting three letters for every one I got right, but it was still less painful than actually watching RtP.)Tom Hanks is not a great actor. I repeat: Tom Hanks is not a great actor. He's not even a terribly good actor. 'Big' was the last role I liked him in. (Perhaps he should stop making these terribly worthy films from Oscar-hungry studios, and find Penny Marshall's number in his phone book.)The main problem I have with Sam Mendes style is that it's the epitome of Hollywood hand-holding. Not once throughout an entire Sam Mendes two-hour experience (I'm reluctant to use the word 'film', for much the same reason that I don't refer to McDonalds as a 'chain of restaurants') will you be required to use your brain, as the story is told with the film equivalent of slow, carefully pronounced monosyllables.Incidentally, every incidental character is introduced with the most heavy-handed slab of characterisation I can ever remember seeing. Look out for the 'fleshing out' monologue, delivered by every actor who's name never appeared on the poster. "Hi, m'name's bill. I used train greyhounds for racing, but none o' ma dogs has ever finished better'n third place, so now I make pastries" kind of thing, except without the strong sense of conviction that (obviously) comes across in my writing.Aside from all the problems I had with the directing and acting, this has a pretty questionable set of ethics behind it. The good guys may now be wearing white hats, but it's always made clear who they really are. I'm familiar with the term 'justifiable homicide', but 'justifiable mass-murder'?. I want the other guy's version, because this one doesn't quite cut it.On the plus side, the cinematography was nice.My recommended alternatives? 'Sonatine', 'Le Samourai', 'Godfather', 'Paris, Texas' (for the Father/Son thing).</fullReview>

How purely saccharine and awful is that? It was the first moment in the film I just didn't care for. I'd also refer you to the highly stylized nature of the picture, and how the ending on the idyllic beach just calls attention to itself because of everything but the story being told. I expected more from Sam Mendes, but alas...That's all though, the film is what it is, and it is pretty good. But I do feel, unfairly, it has been awarded the kudos of the film-going sheep, who wanted to latch onto a movie that looked and sounded like it was good, smart, and artistic.

		<fullReview>Hopelessly drunk minor league baseball manager, aids victim, death row prison guard, a castaway, war hero, astronaut, and now a ruthless thug. Need I say more about Tom Hanks? You know something? I'm just an ordinary viewer; not a critic, nor expert in cinema art. But in my humble opinion, Tom Hanks keeps on setting his own 'bar' higher and higher, and as good as he is in 'The Road to Perdition', he doesn't quite clear that bar and Paul Newman 'steals' the show, as the Chicago-Irish mob boss. Newman's supporting role is one of the best I've seen. Tyler Hoechlin, Daniel Craig and Jude Law round off this quintet of mob 'Fathers and Sons' . I could stop here and just say that this is a terrific action drama and well worth seeing. However, if you're a movie buff, you'll have to see it more than once. I'm no expert, but I know great when I see it and technically, this must be one of the best cinema works I've ever seen. You've got to pay attention to the extraordinary use of focus and depth. Your attention is taken from foreground to background, through windows, mirrors, (a-la Dr Zhivago) and fantastic, changes of angle, without the slightest loss of scene continuity. The use of colors and vista are straight out of the school of Stanley Kubrick. The entire composition borders on the thin line of reality and surrealism, and will tilt you one way or the other in the same way that the camera will move your perception from close to far. Although I don't recall this film creating screaming headlines, it is well worth your while to make it the main feature, on your favorite movie night.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i've noticed many people have criticized this film as overrated, and that tom hanks was miscast....you are all missing the point of this film. this is not a gangster movie, this is a movie about fathers and sons. about tom hanks and his boy and paul newman and his real son in the film, tom hanks. on the technical side, there is not a flaw. Mendes has proved that he is truly a film maker, and that films like American Beauty weren't just a one time thing. he is among the greats now. the cinematography and effects in this film was just...beautiful, and the score...newman has really outdone himself. i have not seen a film in a long time that has touched me like this, that truly grabs you with it's story and sucks you in. yes, the story has been done before, but what film doesn't have a story that's been done before? it's in the way that's made, that's what counts. tom hanks was amazing, i was so happy to see him finally take on such a dark, bleek role. he really brought out the fact that though sulivan was a cold blooded killer, he was also a father, and he was human. that's what too many people seem to forget, that a hitman isn't just a machine, and hanks brought that out perfectly. and i'm so disappointed that while gangs of new york gets 10 oscar nominations, road to perdition is not even nominated for best picture, and probally only because it came out so early in the year. the academy needs to remember that its best picture of the year not of december...if you haven't seen this, don't go in expecting the godfather, go in ready to see a story about fathers and sons...best film of the year, along with the two towers, and quite frankly you may criticize it now, but in time while the hours and gangs all drift from our minds, road to perdition, will remain as a classic, a film ahead of it's time.</fullReview>

The casting of Hanks in this role has been questioned, but I thought he gave the role a more human and rounded performance than others might have been able to, especially the scenes with his son.Mendes directs effortlessly with the action scenes and more reflective scenes wonderfully balanced together. As with American Beauty, Thomas Newman's score is the icing on the cake and gives the film a haunting and evocative colour that enriches the images on screen. (8 out of 10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did enjoy American Beauty, but then I think Kevin Spacey is god's gift so... Luckily I managed to go to the theater without having seen any trailer, not having the smallest clue what the story was all about, I simply went because it was a Sam Mendes film. Bad idea ! To me the film is worth max 7/10, and I'm being generous here. And most of the points would come thanks to the young actor playing Michael Sullivan Jr, he was really good and I hope he'll have along career ahead of him. Jude Law's character was really annoying or was it just a wrong casting , what happened to his hair BTW? Once you're told in the film that Perdition is a location you know what's going to follow as you know the title of the movie. The end is so predictable and the film starts to become boring as soon as T. Hanks goes back to meet Paul Newman in the church (if not B4). I also found that the quick view of Chicago, we get when father and son arrive to the city, looks so fake. Sean, my Irish hubby, called the movie a pale Irish godfather. I must join the view of another viewer about the refreshing fact of not having to watch a movie with SFX, that the money was put on the acting instead, and in this case sadly not enough on the script writing. It was well directed, but next time I won't rush to the cinema just because it's a Sam Mendes picture...Especially if he casts Kate Winslet !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visual Poetry, Emotional Ice Box</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you want to see a film where true craftsmanship and art are extolled on every single frame, then "Road to Perdition" is the film to see. It's not so much a gangster movie as it is tragic poetry, visualized and presented in a way that dazzles the eyes and cools the heart. "Perdition" is the tale of two families. First is John Rooney (Paul Newman) and his son Connor (Daniel Craig), two old-time gangsters selling booze, drugs and sex to the working class of the Midwestern United States. John is warm-hearted, caring, and truly wants everyone, even outsiders, to live and work as one big happy family. It is clear that the elder Rooney loves his "godfather" image, and enjoys his chosen profession immensely. His son Connor, however, is a complete schmuck. He loves the glamour and power of the gangster life, but is incapable of mimicking his father's considerable people skills. Everyone who comes in contact with Connor sooner or later becomes his enemy.The other family is headed by Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks), a nice, conservative family man with an attractive two story home and a Buick in the garage. He has a beautiful wife, two lovely boys who go to the local parochial school, and a job he'd rather not talk about. He does not like what he does, nor is he proud of it. All the two boys know about their father is that he works for the Rooney family, and carries a Colt 1911 .45 pistol wherever he goes. His stoic, professional demeanor is a stark contrast to that of the jovial John Rooney, and the spoiled brat Connor. In a scene that's awesome in its visualization, Michael Sullivan's older son, Mike Jr. (Tyler Hoechlin), decides that he wants to find out more about what pop does for a living, so one night he stowes away under the back seat of dad's Buick. But it just happens to be the night when dad and Connor have to pay a visit to an unsatisfied business associate for a little chat. Connor is not happy with the way the conversation is going, and in a fit of pure stupidity, takes out his .45 pistol and dispatches the unhappy business partner. Sullivan then quickly guns down the man's employees with his Thompson machine gun, before the employees can shoot back. Unfortunately, Mike Jr. is watching this whole affair through a literal "crack in the wall," (as we in the audience do...) and suddenly realizes his father kills people for a living. The discovery of the voyeurism of Mike Jr. by his dad and Connor create the hinge upon which these two very different families, the Sullivans and the Rooneys, swing into conflict. Mike Sr. and Connor have VERY different ideas how the trespass of the son should be handled. Sadly, it's Connor's solution that prevails.And so the war between the Rooneys and the Sullivans begin, a powerful mob boss and his son versus their very own virtuoso hit man. It's a war where there will be only one winner, or maybe none, depending upon how you look at it. "The Road to Perdition" is an absolute, in your face, morality play of Greek tragedy dimensions. We know within the first minute of the film that Michael Sr. is going to die, but we just aren't sure exactly how it's going to come about. An atmosphere of sadness, despair and detachment is established from the very first scene. Sam Mendes constantly uses night shots, darkness, rain, and very subdued colors to make sure you get the POINT that this is not a warm-fuzzy film. It is not meant to make you feel good, nor give you a sense that all is well in the world. Rather, this is a film that demonstrates in the short space of two hours how encompassing is the embrace of evil; and how very difficult it is for one to break free of it's grip. This is also a tale concerning the consequences of making poor life decisions. No, we don't live in a vacuum where we can "do it" if it feels good and then think that it won't impact anyone else. Nor can we continue to do something if it feels bad, and think we will be the only ones who have to bear that burden. Like it or not, others are impacted by the choices we make, whether for good or for evil. This film is filled with some of the most fantastic camera work and some of the most excellent performances as any film that has yet come out in 2002. Almost every scene is a wonder to behold, and the director does a fantastic job making you feel as if you live in the 1930's right along side the gangsters on the screen. Of particular note is the exceptional performance of Paul Newman as the elder John Rooney, definitely deserving of an Oscar nomination, if not the award itself. Despite all that this film has going for it in terms of performances and craft, it unfortunately leaves one slightly cold, no doubt due to the cynical and dark subject matter. The theme of evil imploding upon itself is not the sort of thing that leaves one with the desire to come back for a second viewing. Yes, the world of crime and punishment is a cold and unflinching reality, but not one that we really want to spend all that much time contemplating. The story attempts to be a tale of redemption for Michael Sr., but is so obvious and so mechanical that it does little to add warmth to this cold-hearted work of art. But despite these few flaws, "The Road to Perdition" is a must see for anyone who appreciates a finely crafted film.My Rating = 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great pictures come few and far between. I guess I'll have to wait a little longer. Aside from a few compelling scenes, this film was frustrating. It seems director Sam Mendes is incapable of directing the likes of Paul Newman, Tom Hanks, Jude Law and Stanley Tucci.Paul Newman bored me. How is that possible? Tom Hanks... I waited in anticipation for years to see him as a villain of some kind. Instead, his work seemed forced. Jude Law had chemistry with nothing but his camera. Tucci gave the best performance of the bunch, but it looked like he was acting in different movie.I love mob films of any kind. But Road to Perdition has been compared to The Godfather... please. The only similarity is the cars. Evidently, in this mafia story, so long as you're a Tom Hanks kind of mobster, you can steal from Capone and take out mob-leaders and the mob says "hey, it's cool, all is forgiven."I probably wouldn't be so critical if the cast wasn't so talented. It probably could have been a great picture if the script had major changes and Scorsese directed it instead.But it wasn't great. It was average. Like 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you hate spoilers, move along.Sam Mendes blew me away with American Beauty. The acting was fresh and the movie had a lovely immediacy to it. And the most decent, most beautiful character in the whole movie was Kevin Spacey, a foul-mouthed middle-aged man having a raging mid-life crisis.I would love to say the same of The Road to Perdition. While it's not a terrible movie by any means, it also isn't great and pales mightily compared to The Godfather.I don't want to blame Tom Hanks for this film's "lack of greatness." Hanks plays a conflicted Terminator. He plays the character as it was written and probably directed. But, it's very hard to have any sympathy for a Terminator. He kills so automatically that he's a monster, no matter what a wonderful, caring father he is. You know from the opening line of the movie that he's going to be dead and the son will live, so there is surprisingly little dramatic tension in the film.Many reviewers particularly noted Jude Law and Daniel Craig's performances as good, but I didn't like either of them. But Paul Newman was terrific, though the screenwriter should have been shot himself for his final scene. There was nothing in Rooney's character that should have permitted him to behave that way. Rooney would have gone down swinging.The editing/directing choices in this film are quesitionable all over. Why hire the wonderful Anthony LaPaglia to play Capone (a character referenced many times over the last third of the movie) and then not show him at all?? Some of the rain/mist scenes could have been cut for that. Cutting a few seconds here and there of people walking down hallways could have left enough room for what was probably a great cameo. Mendes can't direct an Oscar-winner (or even nominee) each time out, but if he'd gotten a little better script and found a reason to make Tom Hanks behave less like the Terminator while on the job, the movie would have been less disappointing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Style over substance, but still a fine film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll admit I'm a sucker for cinematography. I'll go further and say that if the cinematography includes a well-done rain sequence, the rest of the movie could consist of the cast of Rat Race reprising their least funny scenes and i'd probably give it 5 out of 10 points. That being said, i loved Road to Perdition--8.5 points on a 10 point scale.I won't go into the long details about the plot that you can read in the other 500 reviews this film will get on IMDB. Instead, i'll just say that while i dislike Tom Hanks, he does a decent job in this film, and Paul Newman was spectacular in every scene he graced with his presence. Jude Law was creepy (nice physical bit by him as well, with the slumped posture and nasty smirk). Daniel Craig does a good turn as the violence prone, trying-hard-but-failing-to-prove-to-my-dad-i'm-a-worthy-successor son of Paul Newman's character. Poor Jennifer Jason Leigh's talents are wasted in a bit role and all of 2 minutes on screen time.The script left a little to be desired--i'm not sure i ever really bought the bond between Hanks and his son, and the bank robbery scenes seemed to have existed merely for a bit of comic relief in what is otherwise a well-designed dark, depressing atmosphere that otherwise is pervasive throughout. I'm not sure what Mendes was trying to accomplish with the cheesy opening either--cut it and get right to the story.the bottom line--it's not the Godfather, but it's a film well worth seeing; and if Conrad Hall doesn't get an Oscar nomination for cinematography, may the entire Academy burn in Hell.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A reach for greatness, that just misses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Road to Perdition" seemed to have greatness written all over it before even reaching theaters. The film has more Oscar winners (Tom Hanks, Paul Newman, director Sam Mendes) than you can shake a stick at. And perhaps this is where the film falls just short. Mendes tries his hardest to deliver a gangster film of an epic quality and achieves mixed results. "Road to Perdition" is about family, loyalty and morality. Mendes and screenwriter David Self weave a compelling, but ultimately simplistic and perhaps too easy a story. Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) is a hit-man for John Rooney (Paul Newman). Rooney treats Sullivan like the son he never had, to the obvious envy of his son, Connor Rooney (Daniel Craig). Connor and Michael go on a mission, which goes bad when Connor loses his temper and kills a man. One problem, Michael's son Michael, Jr. (Tyler Hoechlin) snuck along unbeknown to his father and witnesses the whole ordeal. Which eventually leads to tragedy for the Sullivan family because Connor Rooney wants both Sullivans out of the picture after that.The rest of the film follows the father and son Sullivans on their mission of revenge. And this is where the picture never quite could tie the strings together. Mendes spends little time developing the Sullivan family relationships at the beginning, so Sullivan's ultimate goal lacks some of the heart it needs. Plus, a few of the characters seemed be rather one-sided as well, especially Jude Law as hit-man Harlen Maguire. The only side we see of Maguire is of a clumsy killer and a man with a (odd to say the least) photography fetish.Despite some minor flaws though, "Road to Perdition" is very good, with excellent acting, solid directing, wonderful cinematography by Conrad L. Hall and terrific art and set designs. The film takes place in the early 1930s and is as realistic as it gets, from the rainy city streets to the grassy plains."Road to Perdition" seems to have two meanings in this film since the city the Sullivans are headed to is literally called "Perdition". The other, obviously, being Michael's path to hell because he is a hit-man. Which is where the film seems to be too easy and uncertain. The film portrays him as a hit-man, but one who finally is just out to avenge his family, so he is a kind-hearted killer and that is just a little too simplistic. A 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a film that can make you want to see it again. I especially, liked the way it ended. I did not see the end coming, but when Laws was not blown away the first time, one suspects he will be back again.The story is gripping and could have been more psychological, but I understand the story needed to capture the viewer and the action was necessary for that.Hard to believe Michael Jr. could be so apparently unmoved as his younger brother and mother as blown away. But, I can appreciate the scene play couldn't really take our attention there because it had a greater story to tell.Some have complained about Hanks as a gangster. I believe that isn't justified. If his character had been any harder, he would not have cared if his son pulled a trigger or not.Eight Stars for this one. Although it was released in 2002, I just saw it for the first time yesterday on DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw Sam Mendes' first film after American BEAUTY (which is my all-time favorite) I was disappointed. I must have been way too young to get the point. This one is not about gangsters, it's about love and loyalty.I have to say it as boldly as I can: I've never seen such a great and breathtaking depiction of fatherly love as in ROAD TO PERDITION. The subtle acting of Tom Hanks is beyond measure, reflected greatly in his son's character. Paul Newman tops it all. Underlined by a wonderful piano theme that could easily have won an Oscar on its own, this picture is a true masterpiece from beginning to end.All of you able to cry watching a movie: go and watch this one!</fullReview>

This is by far, in my opinion, his best work.I truly think the movie offers plenty of emotions but ends up being really sad and moving.The mob plot is just a part of the whole experience that also deals with parenthood, loyalty, and more.Please watch this beautiful and unforgettable film.

		<fullReview>"Road to Perdition" is a story about the bond between a father and son, and how complicated and 'distant' it may seem to the naked eye. This film shows the journey they take to become closer and less distant.At the beginning of the movie when Michael Jr. (Tyler Hoechlin)sees his father you can feel the distance between them. To show this distance Sullivan (Tom Hanks) is viewed through doorways and through mirrors. However, as the movie progresses the scenes containing Sullivan and Michael Jr. they are progressively viewed closer through the camera. Therefore they are becoming closer and beginning to get to know each other. And in the end Michael Jr. realizes that it wasn't because Sullivan loved Peter more but that he didn't want Michael to live the life that he lived. But of course the 'father and son' theme wasn't the only theme there was also betrayal, revenge, and tragedy.Most people have been saying that the darkness of the movie was a minus. To me that just added more to the movie. Because you can't have the lighting be all light and cheerful while they are killing people. So it has to be kinda dark to get into the 'mood' of the movie.Overall I thought that plot line was solid and didn't have any 'pot holes.' The acting was great and the cinema photography was awesome. I give it 8/10</fullReview>

It didn't have any of those fancy schmancy unrealistic Hollywood adaptations of what people always would HOPE they'd say in those situations, but never really do. You simply understood the story as if you were a character involved in it. The direction was impeccable as well as the cinematography. That was some of the best cinematography I have ever seen.

		<fullReview>'Road to Perdition' would probably have read better on paper (as a book) than as a film. It is a slow-moving story about a son who witnesses his father's involvement with a gang and becomes involved himself. I wanted to see this film when it was first released, but the local cinema was not planning to show it, so I had to wait until it came out on video. When I did finally see it, I was unimpressed. I think I expected a different sort of historical film rather than a gangster film. The film went much too slowly, and I just found the plot completely dull and unimpressive. The cinematogrpahy was good, so it does not lose any points for that, but the story just did not work well as a film. It is no wonder that this film seems to be forgotten today. Dull and slow, and not recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>doesn't have the oomph as "American Beauty" did, but still watchable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw Sam Mendes's name on the billboard poster to this around the time it was released, I thought, "cool! Another 'American Beauty'!" There are some of the elements that mirrored "Beauty"'s: Thomas Newman's haunting score for one, the eerie rainfall in the film's climax (just like Lester's epiphany with Colonel Fits, the kids, Angela), the late Conrad Hall's crisp cinematography, the dysfunctional Sullivan family (need I mention the Burnhams?). Tom Hanks's conflicts of interest regarding employment as well as bosses (Brad at the magazine &amp; Stanley Tucci as a rival crime boss), the corruption of the leading male "children" (Tyler what's-his-name and Wes Bentley), the slaying of the principle protagonist in the end, and the ultimately sad premise of what both films had.I guess with all of these ingredients, it should be an outstanding replication of "American Beauty"! Well, not really. For one thing, Tom Hanks doesn't command the screen as well as Kevin Spacey does (and that pencil-thin mustache makes him look like John Waters on steroids), and Jennifer Jason Leigh is NOT Annette Bening. But veteran Paul Newman gives this an interesting angle and seems like a sweet grandpa to Hanks and his family. At first. But then you realize just how manipulating and calice he is and with his loose-cannon bastard of a son (Daniel Craig), it shows this just runs in the family. There are good moments and powerful scenes like the awkward conversation between Hanks &amp; Tucci- in which Tucci completely patronizes him, or any scene with Harlan Maguire (Jude Law), and even the ending. But the film left me feeling a little more hollowed-out and unable to empathize with the characters as much as "Beauty" did. That was probably because "Beauty" was a comtemporary piece where this one wasn't.Regardless, the film was still well made and wouldn't be if it wasn't for this pedigree of actors and filmmakers to pull this off.The film begins at a wake sometime in the early 30s, and we see the principle cast of characters celebrating, which seems to remind the viewer of the impending doom from "The Deer Hunter". That later leads to Hanks's 12-year-old witnessing a hit while stowing away in Tom's car beforehand. It's not long before Paul Newman discovers this, warns the kid that he knows, but intends to kill him anyway. Only Hanks's wife (played by the career-stunted-actress Jennifer Jason Leigh) and the youngest are murdered, so that leaves Hanks and older son (Tyler what's-his-name) to become fugitives of Newman's.With that exposition out of the way, you can only think now the film will get better. A little- it's definitely gone into a different direction, and Jude Law's character's cool, but it never seems to get to fourth gear. And it seems that that's where "American Beauty" excelled. This film suffers from "middle-child syndrome" (as a lot of second films from directors do). I also listened to Sam Mendes's commentary about this film and it's clearly missing Alan Ball's magic, although Mendes seems very passionate about this movie as he was with "Beauty".I'm just hoping that the magic as well as the passion will return in a third Mendes film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tom Hanks at the top of his game</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've followed Tom Hanks and his career in movies more closely than any other actor I've watched, ever since "Big". I've seen them all from Forrest Gump to Saving Private Ryan. I never expected it to grow to the level it has and become the most prominent in Hollywood not because I didn't believe he was a terrific actor but because few stars including the leading stars possess staying power of any duration. They lose mass appeal and fade out, they make poor acting career choices, or they OD on coke. Not Hanks (thankfully). But what surprises me even more than that is my favorite performance is him playing an Irish hit-man. I never saw that coming. Ever.He's run the gambit when it comes to playing different characters in all kinds of different movies. But I never for a moment thought of him as a mob killer. Not his style, not his kind of character he's too nice. But somehow he pulled it off and convincingly to boot. He passed the ultimate acting test for a leading man, he can be heroic or he can be evil. When this film was being released the newspaper writers took odds on whether he could do it and compared his switch from protagonist to antagonist to that of Jimmy Stewart, another great actor who took a chance with his audience when he played bad men in several films. As for Mendes I was not a hardcore fan of his pictures as a matter of fact I hadn't taken an interest in anything he had done so he got some respect from me after I left the theater that day. Several critics called Road to Perdition "The New Godfather". I see where they get their connection and there are some themes reminiscent of Coppola's classic but it is not the Godfather because it didn't try to be. The gangster aspect of this film was not what Mendes was emphasizing. It was the story of a father and son who were reuniting with one another and dealing with sin and redemption along the way just as the Godfather's main theme was family. Boring and weak? Nope. Overrated? No way no how. Hanks and Newman were perfect and the cinematography, costumes, and musical score were astounding and I was enraptured by how tremendous this film was. Best movie of 2002.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A different kind of gangster movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you say gangster movie, you immediately think about movies like "The Godfather" and "Goodfellas". "Road to Perdition" is also a gangster movie but it's different. It's more stylish and focuses even more and goes deeper in on the characters.Visually this movie is absolutely wonderful! The atmosphere is brilliant thanks to the likewise brilliant cinematography by Conrad L. Hall who won a well deserved Oscar for it. Unfortunately the brilliant Mr. Hall died 11 weeks before he could collect his second Oscar. "Road to Perdition" was a worthy last movie for him. Also the sets and costumes and last but not least the subtle and soft music by Thomas Newman all add further to the atmosphere.Tom Hanks is absolutely wonderful in this film. At first he plays a strict father and tough gangsters but as the movie progresses his character becomes more and more loose and open. The way the father/son story is told is brilliant and almost touching. Not only the Sullivan/Sullivan Jr. story but also the Sullivan/Rooney father/son story. I can't say that I'm always happy the way Jude Law's character is used throughout the movie and about the character in general. Veteran Paul Newman of course is a wonderful addition to the solid cast.The story is told in a wonderful way by director Sam Mendes with lot's of visual beauty. Result is a unique gangster film with some unforgettable scene's such as the rain shootout, which is absolutely a brilliant scene thanks to the cinematography, music and the sound or better said the lack of sound.A wonderful character driven, crime drama.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

A top notch performance by him as the 'hit man with morals' trying to seek revenge for the murder of his wife and youngest son, Peter. Jude Law gives a chilling performance as the sadistic killer McGuire, and I don't know about other viewers, but I just KNEW he wasn't finished with at that hotel. As for the actor who played Mike Sullivan Junior, it was a pleasure to watch such young talent. I shed tears during the final scenes at the beach house.

		<shortDescription>Lavish hit man gangster drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The mob hit man has certainly arrived as a genre in this movie. Here we have the esteemed Tom Hanks and Paul Newman starring in a very nice production. At the end it is dedicated to a Conrad L. Hall who was a brilliant cinematographer and certainly this movie deserves an audience on the cinematography alone. The endlessly beautiful low light shots give the film life that easily surpasses the story itself. And the story is a fatal weakness in this film. It is not that the story is badly told, just that it is told at all.Tom Hanks plays Mike Sulliven, a hit man -- "muscle" -- for a suburban mobster during the Prohibition. Yet, he is posed as a sympathetic character, a nice middle class family man. He keeps his machine gun in a nice case in the garage out of the site of the kids. The son of the gangster is screwing up his dad's business and Mike is forced to kill some of the opposition. One of Mike's kids is a witness, the gangster's son finds out and so the drama begins as Mike is forced on the road with his boy.This kind of false dignity worked pretty well in the Godfather, but remember what a lowlife the hit man was in that lavish production. This is more typical of reality and audiences are much more sophisticated now then they were then on the subject.</fullReview>

I couldn't seem to remember Tom Hanks from anything else than Sleepless In Seattle and You've Got Mail. Suddenly Philadelphia and Forrest Gump sprung to mind. Combined with Paul Newman and Jude Law I decided to give it a try, keeping less positive reviews in mind.And how wrong can critics be? Very much, judging by the silence that ruled when the credits started rolling. Don't know how it goes in your country, but in Belgium it appears to be a tradition to leave as soon as the movie's ended. With this one, it took about five minutes for everyone to get out of trance. But what did the trick?It could be the magnificent photography. This is one of those movies where everything is in place and even just the look of a street can make you shiver. Awards for art direction. Could be the script as well. It isn't very original but very consistent. Could be the music, though it was overdone at some point. Still, the song that rolled when credits started almost got us to tears. But most of all the actors were overwhelming. Mister Hanks could go alongside the big Nicholson with his third Academy Award. Mister Newman breaths new life into the term Godfather. But most of all Mister Law was fabulous. His role isn't big but he comes out magnificent. Awards for all three of them.But of course, it would be even better if it got none. Because true genius never gets acknowledged...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After having made a career out of playing every kind of good guy character imaginable, Tom Hanks finally gets to strut his stuff as a bad guy ? of sorts ? in `The Road to Perdition,' Sam Mendes' excellent follow-up to his Oscar-winning `American Beauty' from 1999. Of course, no one is ever going to believe Hanks as a TOTAL villain and this fact works perfectly for the role he has been called upon to play here ? that of Michael Sullivan, a family man with two young boys who also happens to work as a hit man for crime boss John Rooney, an aging father figure who raised Michael as one of his own. Sullivan's children, Michael Jr. and Peter, are in the dark as to just what it is their father does for a living, but when the older boy, Michael, witnesses one of his dad's on-the-job hits one night, he ends up putting both his and his father's lives at risk. Suddenly, the two become fugitives, trying to stay one step ahead of the mob while Michael Sr. works on exacting revenge from Rooney's son, Connor, who both tried to have both Michaels rubbed out and succeeded in killing Michael's wife and younger son in the process. `The Road to Perdition' deserves immense praise for featuring a less-than-savory figure as its central character. Apart from the Hanks persona, which confers a certain automatic likeability factor onto this gangster protagonist, the film also builds the case in Michael's favor by having him be so much better than anyone else around him. With the exception of the crime boss himself, Michael is the only one of the killers who seems to have even an iota of redeeming value to his character. However, the film does not flinch from showing us the brutal harshness of the life fate has chosen for Michael, nor does it absolve Michael of the guilt he obviously must accept for the actions he performs. Unlike many films, `The Road to Perdition' does not shy away from acknowledging the moral complexities of the character with which it is asking us to identify. Our identification is, however, instantaneous with Michael Jr. who witnesses all this first hand and who, as events unfold, comes to understand a little something about the universal nature of father/son relationships, about the teaching and learning that takes place in the course of filial bonding, about a father's hope for a better life for his son, and about a father's instinctive need to fight for and protect his own flesh and blood even at the risk of his own life. And Michael Sr. learns a thing or two as well about what fatherhood is really all about. Ironically, these truths are also reflected to a certain extent in the chilling relationship between John and his own ruthless son, Connor. These two relationships provide some intriguing parallels and contrasts which help to enrich the overall theme of the work.Despite the fact that the film focuses on the growing relationship between a father and a son, Mendes never allows sentiment to take over. The few scenes charting the growing bond between the two Michaels are kept low-keyed and subtle and the movie erupts frequently into shocking displays of graphic violence. One scene, in particular, in which the older Michael is ambushed in a hotel room, is extraordinarily suspenseful, executed with assured, split-second timing by director Mendes and editor, Jill Bilcock. Mendes shows himself to be a master of the subtle moment as well, since the other great scene in the film involves a late night chat between father and son, a near-wordless encounter that underlines the growing love and respect that father and son are developing for one another. The quiet, hushed tone of the scene provides an effective counterpoint to all the rat-a-tat-tat moments that might otherwise have come to dominate the proceedings.The performances could not be improved upon. Hanks manages to be both stolid and emotionally vulnerable as the father who realizes that, although it may be too late to keep himself from going to `perdition,' it is not too late to keep his son from making the same mistake. Newman creates a stunning portrait of an old man who can seemingly operate on two contradictory levels at the same time: one as a man capable of immense warmth and filial devotion to those he cares for and the other as a man ruthless enough to maintain his grasp on the life he's made and the position of power he's attained at any and all costs. Jude Law achieves a perfect creepiness as the steely-eyed, sadistic and psychotic hit man sent out to dispatch both Michael and his son. But the real acting honors go to young Tyler Hoechlin who manages to upstage even these seasoned professionals as Michael Jr., conveying in his every move, gesture and facial expression the innate innocence, warmth and intelligence of this 12-year old boy. Hoechlin understands the quiet power that can be achieved through a look and a glance. Wisely, the film's writer, David Self, makes young Michael an almost completely reticent character. Most of the learning and recognition that comes to Michael over the course of the film is reflected not in his words but in his face. As a result, little Michael is a character who lingers long in one's memory, for he ends up making an indelible mark on one's heart. Mendes does an exquisite job capturing the bleak nature of the film's early-?30's setting, although one could probably do without some of the rather improbable Bonnie and Clyde parallels that the story unfortunately wanders into. Still, that is a minor complaint about a film that works on so many different levels simultaneously. Beautifully crafted and brilliantly acted, `The Road to Perdition' is a quietly powerful film that draws us into its world in a most interesting and persuasive way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dour, turgid Lone Wolf &amp; Cub ripoff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best way to disparage Tom Hanks' dour, turgid turn in Road to Perdition is through a contrast with the 1972-3 film adaptation of the acknowledged Japanese inspiration of the original graphic novel version of this tale of Great Depression-era hit man fatherhood. The American film is devoid of even the minimal moral consideration manifest in the Tomisaburo Wakayama serial Kozure Okami. Unlike the wrongfully ostracized executioner Ogami Itto, who presents Daigoro with the choice between a rattle and a sword, Michael Sullivan evinces no concern over enlisting his son in his vengeful mission. And as the 2002 Lone Wolf and Cub movie replaces the insular totalitarian conditions of the Japanese Shogunate with the democratic transcontinental vistas of XXth century America, its story makes no accommodation for the vast range of options open to Michael Sullivan in effecting his revenge. Knowing full well that his enemy is destined for eventual execution by the mob, the widowed hit man declines every opportunity to accommodate his responsibility for single parenthood by forming alliances and biding his time. Nor is Tom Hanks plausible as the Western incarnation of the faithful samurai wronged by his treacherous master. Lacking the stylish detachment of Alain Delon's Jef Costello in Jean-Pierre Melville's 1967 Le Samoura??, or the soulful self-effacement of Forest Whitaker's Ghost Dog in Jim Jarmush's eponymous 1999 pastiche of the bushido ethos, Tom Hanks as directed in his stealthy mustachioed guise by the smarmy, saponaceous Sam Mendes, unthreateningly alternates between line delivery ostensibly retarded by mainlining major opiates and pained facial scrunching pandering to the multiplex audience. As a whole, this film's ostentatious thoughtlessness epitomizes the worst of focus group worship that infests present-day Hollywood productions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ROAD TO PERDITION is a remarkably good movie, and for my money much better then Mendes' AMERICAN BEAUTY (that shopping-bag-in-the-breeze thing has now been lampooned EVERYWHERE, and justifiably so).I found Hanks and Newman gave outstanding performances, and this might just be my favorite of Hanks'. His read of the character, I think, is pretty good, and he plays with a nice level of understatement.The characters in this movie present me with the most trouble, though; I don't think you ever really connect with them. That may have been the intent. The story could easily have been sentimentalized more, but that wouldn't have necessarily have made it better.As a piece of film craft, RtP shines. The visuals convey a certain Depression-era drabness without being overwhelmed by it. Conrad Hall's final film before his death is a spectacular way to finish a career, and the art direction is wonderful. Few movies use vintage cars as well as this one does.The movie worked for me, even if I wasn't as emotionally connected to it as I might have liked.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story told thru the eyes of Michael Sullivan,jr is easy to follow. His dad was a hit man for the mob in the early 1930s who got cross with the "family." Tylor Hoechlin played the part of junior and did a superb job. Tom Hanks as the father/hit-man did what he could to protect his son. Much violence and gun play. You find your self rooting for Hanks character even knowing he is an outlaw and a murderer. The action is good, the scenes well done and the period well portrayed. If there was a central figure it would be a toss up between Hanks and Hoechlin. Both did outstanding jobs portraying their characters. Well worth the time to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ROAD TO PERDITION (2002) **** Tom Hanks, Paul Newman, Jude Law, Tyler Hoechlin, Daniel Craig, Stanley Tucci, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Liam Aiken, Dylan Baker, Kevin Chamberlain, Ciaran Hinds, Harry Groener. Filmmaker Sam Mendes proves to be no one-hit wonder in this wonderfully conceived sophomore follow-up to his Oscar-winning `American Beauty' with a smartly realized adaptation of the cult graphic novel by Max Allan Collins and Richard Piers Rayner (who co-wrote the efficiently lean screenplay with David Self) about a family of Chicago gangsters circa 1931 and cracking the old chestnut of honor among thieves with a bitter aftertaste: Hanks stars as loyal hit-man Michael `The Angel of Death' Sullivan and faces a challenging feat of self-discipline cum righteous vengeance when his wife and younger child (Leigh and Aiken) are assassinated by his benefactor's son. Newman (in one of his best roles) is John Rooney the head of the ?family' whose sense of right is only betrayed by his sense of what is right for his organization and also faces a baptism of fire in deciding on the fate of his adopted son and natural born ne'er do well Connor (Craig equally adept at being a hypocritical prodigal son). Law gives a creepy turn as the gun-for-hire cum crime scene shutterbug (who will send shudders up your spine to boot) that is one step behind Hanks' implosive killer. The film excels in its top-drawer production design and handsomely exquisite cinematography by ace lenser Conrad Hall (an Oscar shoo-in) transports you into a lurid Depression era bleak American Dream: providing for your family for a better future than your own rings true in heartbreaking design.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tom Hanks like you've never seen him before. Hanks plays Michael Sullivan, "The Angel of Death". He is a hitman for his surrogate father John Rooney(Paul Newman)an elderly Irish mob boss. Sullivan's young son(Tyler Hoechlin)witnesses what his father does for a living and both are soon on the road for seven weeks robbing banks to avenge the murder of Sullivan's wife and other son. Enter Jude Law as a reporter/photographer willing to kill Sullivan himself for the chance to add to his collection of photos of dead mobsters. Filmed beautifully catching the drama of life in the 30's. Sometimes the pace bogs down, but then a burst of graphic violence sustains the story. Director Sam Mendes directs this powerful drama about loyalty, responsibility, betrayal and the bonding of a secretive man and his young son. Other notable cast members are: Dylan Baker, Stanley Tucci, Daniel Craig and Jennifer Jason Leigh. Hanks again proves to be excellent in a very memorable movie. Make room for some Oscars!</fullReview>

Road to Perdition has a very accurate and neat portrayal of life in the 1930's as well as style and design.The film had its flaws as mentioned, but was in my mind snubbed at theOscars. Receiving only six nominations, and winning only one award, in thecategory of Cinematography. In my mind, there is no doubt that it should have been nominated for the six it was already nominated for, and should havereceived a few more nominations, especially in the categories of Best Picture and Director.Many elements of this film were just absolutely PERFECT! The score done by Thomas Newman was just too perfect, and should have won the Oscar. The setdesign, sound, editing, and script, were all underrated by the Oscars.Road to Perdition A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sam Mendes delivers another modern day classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ROAD TO PERDITION (2002)THE GOOD:--The killing in this film was very well explored and actually had quite an effect on me. I can't recall another recent film where watching one man killing another man was so terrifying or heart-wrenching. This movie takes murder and killing to this whole new level, not like the action blockbusters where it's cool to see people getting killed. Here, you'll almost want to turn away.--Conrad L Hall's Academy Award cinematography was rather terrific. The boy looking through the peephole was very atmospheric as well as the scene near the end where a certain main character is murdered (there's a window involved). You also gotta love the swooping, wide shots, the zoom in and outs and those simple shots that just looked so good. My favourite of all was the scene where the rain was pouring like hell and all you can see is Tom Hanks' character's tommy gun going off (fire) and men falling to their doom. A very haunting scene indeed, one I'll never forget.--"Road to Perdition" has one of the most entertaining and well-developed father-son stories of recent times. It is shown from so many aspects. There is very heavy drama?the best example being Michael Sullivan Jr's question "why do I duck?" which leads to an enthralling argument between father and son that questions who's fault the happenings of the story are. There are several other dramatic and intense scenes showing these two characters in so many different lights, we really see them transform over the film, which is absolutely fascinating. Also, you gotta love the comic relief?especially with MS Jr trying to drive?very funny!--Sam Mendes (of "American Beauty" fame) pulls some amazing performances out of his cast. Tom Hanks is very subtle and extremely effective as hitman Michael Sullivan. Paul Newman gives an unforgettably terrific performance, he moved me so much. Did anyone else get shivers from simple movements or expressions the actor made? He was a tour-de-force, and it's great to see him back in movies. Tyler Hoechlin is extremely plausible as Michael Sullivan Jr and had injected a lot of emotion into his performance. Hopefully he's not another one of those one-movie-then-disappear child actors.THE BAD:--I don't have solid proof yet, but I'm not completely sure that "Road to Perdition" will hold up as brilliantly as it did on first viewing during later viewings.RATING:10/10 - Sam Mendes delivers another masterpiece in "Road to Perdition", easily one of the best films of 2002.IF YOU LIKED THIS MOVIE I RECOMMEND:American Beauty (10/10) Catch Me If You Can (9/10) L.A.

		<fullReview>To see such talent (Paul Newman, Tom Hanks, Stanley Tucci and Jude Law) wasted on this pathetically scripted and edited movie, makes one very sad. Jude Law seems to be the only actor awake in this movie, but his superb acting can not make this Edsel of a film go anywhere. For those who have commented as to whether this is the "perfect film", I can only say "you don't get out much." The Editor used a hatchet and pasted the film back together with bubble gum. If this movie aspired to be an epic then it needed an additional hour and a half of character development so that we care about the relationship between Hanks and Newman's characters. The 15 minutes of the film which culminated into the tommy gun spaying in the raining streets scene, is one of the worse examples of film editing in decades. Paul Newman, Tom Hanks and Stanley Tucci just sleep walk thought this film.And the writing - what writing? If you can afford big name stars please leave enough money in the budget to pay for a good script writer that understands that unless he's writing for Terrance Malik, he might need to include a plot! I hated this movie, its underdeveloped characters, its plotless and trudging story line. But by reading the reviews and commentaries submitted, I can see that the cotton candy fluff crowd loves this movie (just like they did for that dreadful "Pearl Harbor"). I have not seen a movie this dull since "The Thin Red Line". If your IQ is over 100, don't waste money on this dud.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hated it!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, what a flat, toothless, sterile movie!!!There are so many things I didn't like about it that I don't know where to start. From the painfully uninvolved script to the completely wrong choice of main protagonist (Tom Hanks proves to be a one trick pony). From sappy voiceovers ("People ask if Michael Sullivan was a good man or there was just no good in him at all and I always give the same answer - he was my father.") to underdeveloped characters - "Road to Perdition" offers so little.Yes, I hate Hollywood for putting out crap like "Spiderman", "Daredevil", "Men in Black", etc. but I loathe it even more for gutless pieces of garbage disguised as highbrow movie-making, as is the case here. When will people stop mistaking sad music and soft colours for true and genuine emotion.The very beginning still holds some promise but once Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) and Michael Sullivan Jr. (Tyler Hoechlin) hit that road - it's straight downhill. The cheese level increases dramatically and it seems that every couple of scenes there's an abrupt plot interruption so father and son on the run can share some artificially poignant moments.Crackpot named Maguire (Jude Law), a completely farcical and out-of-place character, is introduced as a hit man sent to kill Sullivan. This guy is one part Hanibal Lecter and two parts Curly from 'Three Stooges'.To that end I point out the diner scene where he finally catches up to them and instead of swiftly finishing what he came in to do (at this point Sullivan doesn't know who Maguire is or why he's there) what does this seasoned professional murderer do? Why of course, he sits down, makes an order and starts up a creepy conversation with his target which tips-off our hero to excuse himself to the bathroom and figure out a way to get himself and his son, sleeping in the car outside, the hell outta there. OK, you may say Maguire didn't want to kill him right then and there because other people including a cop were eating in the diner but that reasoning didn't stop him 2 minutes later from shooting at Sullivan's fleeing car even if chance of getting him from that distance would be slim even for a sharpshooter. Furthermore those shots prompted the above cop to confront him, a move that resulted in Maguire killing the policeman. Scene ends there so we don't get to see what Maguire did with other people at the diner who were now witnesses to a murder. Even if you buy this guy's strange way of handling his business it's hard to believe someone like Frank Nitti (Stanley Tucci) working directly under Al Capone would ever hire such a nutcase to carry out an important task like this. But anyway.....just one of many parts of "Road to Perdition" that irked meLater towards the end, there's a 'break in action' scene (reminiscent of "Heat") between Sullivan Sr. and his former mob boss employer John Rooney (Paul Newman). Two of them share kind of a surrogate father &amp; son relationship and have now through circumstance rather than choice become adversaries. But even that sequence somehow manages to come off fake setting the stage for an even schmaltzier epilogue.Like a bland meal this film just sits there and you really have to force yourself to eat it. And thinking about it, I definitely should have anticipated this. All the signs were there. A Fox/Dreamworks $80 million production (2 major studio collaboration) with a major star, an aging legend and a summer release, so you know this HAS to make money AND if possible get some Oscar buzz. Unfortunately in today's America that means lowest pandering to the great unwashed so it isn't too improbable that a conversation similar to the following took place as the movie was about to go in production.Q: So, how do we get our money back?---------------------------------------A: Make the movie accessible to everybody.Q: And how do we do that?-------------------------------------------------------A: First, we make the story reeeeally simple. We'll have it take place in the 1930s Chicago area gangster milieu, but these guys have feelings and quite profound &amp; complicated ones at that. There are things that tear them up inside. We'll particularly concentrate on three of them while others will just look unhappy and miserable without much explanation. To further drive this point we'll use haunting, evocative music and damp, aquarelle colours throughout. It will give the audience a feeling they're watching something important. And as icing on the cake, we get Tom Hanks to play the main guy who's kinda bad but not really. You know, it will sound good in the promos - America's sweetheart playing a gangster - but in fact he'll just be doing a guy he's done before only he'll look a bit angrier. And voila...lIn closing, you know you're in trouble when the part of your movie getting the most praise is cinematography. I guess we're to overlook that every other aspect of this picture sucks and simply enjoy the scenery.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Road to Perdition Is a movie that chronicles the relationship between a father and a son, that go on the run after a betrayal. And It's fantastic. Tom Hanks, gives one of his best performances in this movie alongside his on screen son Tyler Hoechlin, and tackles the likes of Paul Newman, Daniel Craig and the slimy sinister Jude Law as an assassin that uses a camera. The plot is perfectly adapted from the pages of the comic book novella, with the star studded cast filling the roles perfectly. And to be honest I have to confess that Jude Law's character of Maguire is probably one of my favorite movie villains of all time. He just oozes with that creepy nature that only a man who takes pictures of corpses for a living could give. Also to talk about is some of the brilliant acting Newman gives in a supporting role but overall the best thing to talk about for Road to Perdition has to be the wonderfully done cinematography. Honestly, It's no wonder at all that it won said Oscar.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Personally I think the movie was okay,but could have been very good.My main problem with the movie is that Tom Hanks isn't threatening. The main character needs to be caring,but serious at other times. While Tom Hanks is caring,he just can't be threatening,his voice doesn't fit,his face doesn't,and those scenes just really don't work. Because of that it undermines the other good scenes as you start to see him as just,Tom Hanks,nothing else.Now to the other main problem,the kid in this movie is one of the dumbest I've ever seen,like surprisingly so. There are so many times when he puts himself in danger just for some undeserved and pointless tension. The actor who plays him is good,but the lines and direction he's given is awful for his age making it look like the director changed the age of the character at the last minute.Jude Law was great,very well cast and one of the best parts of the film easily,it's just a shame he isn't explored much for such an interesting character. The writing in this movie is also very generic ,some points it's alright and at others it's surprisingly bad,the interaction with Tom Hanks and his kid are interesting,but end up being forgettable and boring due to the writing. The other cast are average and forgettable,nothing great but nothing bad either,the gangsters you expect.Overall,very average with a good premise and wasted potential that could be redone much better.A different lead,a better script,more Jude Law and a more realistic kid could have made this great,but currently it's just average. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Y'know, for a movie that's as dark as "Road to Perdition", it sure does look damn good (especially Hanks in a coat and Fedora). The sets, wardrobe and period details really immerse you in the mob atmosphere. And the camera work is stunning. But it's a father-son story at heart and that's exactly what makes it resonate. That's when the movie starts to loosen up and the relationship really starts to develop. For me, it's when the movie really comes alive.Watching this after so many years (and knowing where the shocking moments were) I still flinched. Very easy to get caught up in this movie - it's just that engrossing. None of the impact or lustre has worn off.This is a cold but beautiful movie.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes, you watch films that were not necessarily loved by everyone, but you think that they should be. For me, There Will Be Blood or Southpaw come to mind. Now, after seeing this, Road to Perdition is an immediate addition to this list. Any of Sam Mendes' films I have seen have been well worth a watch, but this is his first that has truly blown me away. Tom Hanks is as good as he has ever been as Michael Sullivan. Tyler Hoechlin gives a performance well beyond his years. Daniel Craig gives an excellent performance that we rarely see and Paul Newman, well, there isn't much I can say about him that hasn't been said already. Cinema's famous blue eyes took on an uncharacteristic villainous role and absolutely crushed it in what I would consider his finest performance of an outstanding career. Thomas Newman's score lifts the film to an incredibly high standard and Conrad Hall's cinematography captures the Prohibition-era like it rarely has been caught before. All in all, this was a team effort where some of the best in the business were as good as they ever will be. You will regret waiting to see if this film if you haven't, and your life will be better for it. There are few films that you like because of the feeling that they evoke in you.

		<shortDescription>A Wonderful Drama!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Road To Perdition is undoubtedly a wonderful drama that follows the experiences of a man who engages in crime for his living. When his son figures out what his father does for a living, Michael Sullivan, the father,by murder and robbing, tries to save his son and himself from the other criminals who want to kill him and his family. The ending of the movie and the last lines by the boy leave the moral of the movie open for interpretation.Michael Sullivan is played by Tom Hanks, a brilliant actor who plays his role so well and delivers an excellent performance. And there's one actor in this movie who delivered one of the best performances I have ever seen from a male actor: Jude Law. His role as a psychopathic killer was driven right through his expressions in this movie. And all the other stars in this movie, such as Paul Newman, Tyler Hoechlin, and Stanley Tucci, also performed wonderfully. Overall, the acting in this movie is phenomenal!The movie is definitely not boring, and keeps you awake with all the suspense and action. The background is dark most of the time, which is expected for a movie about such a dark subject. The violence was not as bad as I thought it would be, but at times, it could be considered a little gruesome. I think that this movie definitely deserves the Oscar it won for Best Cinematography, but I also feel that it should have won Best Actor in a Supporting Role for Jude Law. Overall, I love this movie. 9 out of 10!</fullReview>

Tom Hanks, Paul Newman &amp; Daniel Craig deliver so wonderfully, that they indeed grab you into the narrative.Adapted by David Self, from the graphic novel of the same name by Max Allan Collins, 'Road to Perdition' follows the story of an enforcer for the mob and his young son, who becomes a witness to a hit-gone-wrong. When a higher-ranking mobster decides that the child must be killed to keep the hit men's identities a secret, the father and son try to flee town, beginning the road trip that frames most of the film. During this trip they face escalating violence and respond with escalating violence of their own.The film works in parts. Though the Cinematography by Conrad L. Hall, is absolutely stunning and makes each frame look worth-while, the writing material and the overall execution, could've been better. The tone is uneven, the pacing, at places, is snail-pace. But, in the second-hour, the pacing picks up dramatically and leaves an impact. Even the culmination for that matter, is hard &amp; tough.Sam Mendes Directs this Period-Drama, Efficiently, but the Writing Material definitely could've been better. Editing is fair. Coming to the performances: Paul Newman plays his part like a God. Tom Hanks is superb. Daniel Craig leaves a lasting impression. Jude Law is passable. Tyler Hoechlin is nice. Stanley Tucci is dependable, as always. Others lend support.On the whole, At best, A Decent Effort, that works in parts. However, a must see if your looking for nothing, but Great Acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story takes place in 1930's America, which was a period of classical gangster culture, if I may call it that way. By that I mean the time when America's underground was controlled by Mafioso's like Al Capone. This is what makes this a "must watch" for all the gangster movie lovers out there. Or maybe not, since I wouldn't call it a classical gangster movie. It's something else, that you can't quite put your finger on.Basically it is a story about retaliation. Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) has his child and wife killed by Connor Rooney (Daniel Craig), who is a son of Irish mob boss called John Rooney (Paul Newman). One of Sullivan's older sons survives and they set out to a road of vengeance. Acting is mostly good. Tom Hanks delivers his role just fine although there could have been some dispute about him playing that part in the movie. I myself wouldn't have picked him for this role, but nonetheless he was actually quite good. Same goes with Daniel Craig who delivered his role with all of his skills. Tyler Hoechlin, who was playing Michael Sullivan Jr. seemed to fit in his role perfectly, although he certainly wasn't 12 years old like they wanted to make us believe in the movie. What I liked most about this movie was its attention to details. Although some things seemed off, like the large amount of cars and people in Chicago at that time. But I guess it was made by Hollywood, so it's inevitable. But all in all there's actually no reason to moan about such minor niceties, for the reason that you won't feel like you've wasted an hour and a half of your life after watching this picture.</fullReview>

The film tells the story of mafia hit-man Michael Sullivan and his son, who are on the trail of the men responsible for the death of their family. The movie cohesively blends together very deep and moving themes that explore the repercussions of violence, the relationships between fathers and sons, and the path to vengeance. With incredible performances from Tom Hanks and Paul Newman, an awesome soundtrack by Thomas Newman, and incredible camera-work by Conrad L.

The two Michaels character-development is interesting and dramatic.Though it may sound like an old, conservative ideology, or moral view, actually it make sense to me. Son, respect your father, and father, love your son! (Not exact citation.) As the days passes, the Sullivans learns more and more important parts about t'others feelings, emotions, motivations.This surely will be a lifetime experience for young Michael. These interactions between the father and son, which comes from their bizarre situation causes the sync. The abnormal conditions does not exclude the chances of a boy to understand his father and a father to understand his son. Young Michael has to understand death too. Although I don't like Tom Hanks at all, the main characters are well played by the actors. The Bad Guys are OK too, they all have their typical role in the gangster "community".

Either that or the characters should have inner lives.The end is so obvious that I guesses the exact words, which was fun.Truly unbelievable!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best gangster movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Mendes at his best, and without any doubt in my mind, the best gangster movie ever made. There may be an argument as to whether this is in fact a gangster movie, but I hold it as one, because it has many of the tropes of the genre. It may be a slightly different take on it to the norm, but that is partly what I believe makes it so fresh.The adaption is superb, and the cinematography is absolutely perfect, sucking you right into that world. The Director Of Photography, Conrad L. Hall, passed away after making this one, and what a movie to go out on! Look no further than Paul Newman's final scene in the film for proof of how valuable he was; the scene on its own is moving, but rarely is the majesty of the photography so incredible as to be emotional in itself! Mendes himself said, as frustrating as it can be waiting for him to be ready to shoot, when you're cutting that film together, you're glad he was there. I believe it.Paul Newman's last great performance, and again, what a suitable finale to a great career. Tom Hanks playing against type, Daniel Craig being tremendously devious and loving it; acting of the highest calibre in this film.Quite simply the most unique, best looking and most moving film to deal with gangsters, ever put on the screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beautiful film.Chiaroscuro masterpiece.Conrad's Hall Magnum Opus .The scene with the silent shootout reminds me of another great film noir "The Big Combo " ,and another great cinematographer John Alton .There are scene where Mr.Brown says to a guy with a hearing problem "- I feel sorry for you Joe.So I am going to do you a favor.You won't hear the bullets!" , and he removes his hearing aid . Then the Thompson's start shooting silently !!! The visual technique of low key lighting in film noir is very similar to the dramatic technique of "less is more" .The viewer must not see it all , must not knew it all.The covered is more interesting.Why we need so much "light" over the story and so much light over the scene .You tell something and you hide something - it is a binary opposition ! Black and white , good and evil , Ying and Yang ,zero and one .We live in a relative universe , a thing is a thing only related to something else. Light is light only because of Light.The great movies speaks between themselves !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A richly told, nearly perfect film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Mendes is a film director with talent. He's only directed 4 films. His first one won him the best picture Oscar. I myself have only seen 3. His second film, Road to perdition, doesn't quite live up to American beauty, but it's still a very good movie.Michael Sullivan Jr. and his brother are curious about what their dad,Michael(Tom Hanks) does for a profession. So one night, Michael Jr. witnesses his father and uncle(Daniel Craig) murder somebody. This is a mistake. Following this, both his mother and younger brother are murdered. So Michael Jr. and his father are forced to go on the run.The film turns into a film about bonding. Michael teaches his son how to drive, and the two of them have to look after each other. Michael also plans out his revenge. And the two of them have a run in with a photographer(Jude Law) who takes pictures of dead bodies... sometimes killing the people before he shoots the picture. He is hired to kill them.The Road to Perdition is very grim. It is a great looking film. The acting from everyone is powerful. The film is very entertaining,very interesting. The characters aren't that interesting though. I mean after seeing Mendes come up with somebody as interesting as Lester you's really expect much in character development.The film is never boring. It's pretty thrilling. I wish it would've been more of a mystery. Because you know who the killers are the whole time. That's not a problem though. I liked the ending too. Because I personally didn't see it coming. Overall, Road to perdition looks great, has a richly told, original story, with great acting. One of Mendes's finest.A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After viewing this movie in Blu -ray,words fail to express the beauty of this very violent film.Tom Hanks is perfectly cast as a world weary hit man on the run with his son after his remaining family is murdered. The film opens with a funeral of one of crime tzars Paul Newman 's victims. Visions of a Godfather era spring to mind as we view Newman as both a fatherly figure and coldblooded killer. Hanks playing Michael Sullivan, respects Newman because of favors received and an oath of loyality is forged between the two men. Daniel Craig plays Conner Rooney,Newmans hot headed son. Sullivan and Conner Rooney are sent on a mission in which the brother of the victim shown earlier is murdered by Conner.Michael Jr. ,brillantly played by Tyler Hoechlin,has stowed away in his fathers car and witnesses the brutal crime.The story escalates with tragic results.Strangely, the violence never seems excessive,but rather commonplace.A strong supporting cast headed by Jude Law makes this film engrossing from start to finish. Beautifully lensed by Academy Award winner Conrad Hall, and a lush score by Thomas Newman. Paul Newman and Tom Hanks are letter perfect in bringing their characters to life.A must see movie !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If Public Enemies had drama...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like a lot of films these days, (or so it seems to be) Road to Perdition is based upon a graphic novel of the same name and story. That story follows Michael Sullivan's journey during the Great Depression of protecting his son after being betrayed by the people he had trusted, during his time of being a hit man.Michael wears the reticent treatment for his family and fellows, until he finally lets the demeanour slip somewhat when he tries to connect to his son. A beautiful but short sequence which shows some of the humanity of a person who has lost so much, by simply asking his son what his favourite lesson is.If the film could have done this longer or even more frequently it could have gotten Hanks an Oscar nominations for his inexperienced yet sympathetically drawn attempts, to try make his relationship with his son partially normal. Partially normal because of his appetite for killing his way up the food chain till he gets to the man responsible, all out of revenge; not to mention his added complication of Jude Law constantly intercepting his footsteps.Its not that's its hard to understand the inconceivable drive a person must have when they have sustained the losses of family members but to have some go as far as to compare it to The Godfather when the films vaguely match the same par is slightly unrealistic.It scarcely touches American Beauty's impressive shadow, never mind what is considered the greatest gangster film ever made. All that put on the self for a moment though, it remains a firmly impressive offspring from Mendes even if his debut was, and will always be, his best, not that him and Hanks (not to mention the other superb cast members) lack a struggle to maintain an air of freshness in a genre so ridden with clichés.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is similar to The Godfather, but only thirty years later. Paul Newman has many similarities to Marlon Brando in these two movies. But, that's a good thing. I enjoyed this movie possibly even more than The Godfather. I think that's because Tom Hanks is one of my favorite actors.This movie is about how Hank's son reacts and how he deals with it when he sees his father commit a murder.The acting was very good. I mentioned Paul Newman and Tom Hanks above. I also thought the two kids were fantastic. Too bad the Academy Awards doesn't have a category for Best Young Actor.Thomas Newman is one heck of a composer. He composed a great score here.Overall, this is a great gangster drama film.

		<fullReview>Road to Perdition was certainly a brilliant movie that scores in every aspect. Sam Mendes directed another great movie after American Beauty which completely took my breath away. The cast chosen was also very great which had big names like Tom Hanks, Paul Newman, Daniel Craig, Jude Law, Jennifer Jason Leigh etc. The story was written in a brilliant manner and not to forget the beautiful cinematography for which the movie bagged an Academy award. The music was very soothing to the ears and Sam used the score properly at the right places which really turned out to be perfect. Tom Hanks played the role of Michael Sullivan who happens to be a hit-man and who along side his son Michael Sullivan Jr. avenges the murder of his wife and kid. He doesn't want his son to become like him although in order to take revenge he teaches his son to drive and robs off the banks with the black money of his enemy. The scenes wherein Tom enters the bank serenely and offers the bank manager a part the plundered amount was a joy to watch. Paul Newman was really good as he always is in his acts. He tries to protect his son Daniel Craig and pays the price eventually. Jude Law is hired to kill Tom Hanks. He gets to taste the wrath from Hanks par as his face gets mutilated in a cross fire. However in the end all the murderers die without Sullivan Jr.'s hands getting dirty. The story was wonderful and the direction was even more brilliant. Overall I liked the movie very much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Of Fathers and Sons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Road to Perdition is a movie that brings you in with the strong performances of its acting cast and keeps your interest with cinematography that is some of the finest ever seen in Hollywood. It is a tale of fathers, their sons, and the gangster era of Al Capone. It pits hit man Michael Sulivan (Hanks) against a bounty hunter (Jude Law) who has been hired by his boss, and father figure John Rooney (Paul Newman) as Sulivan attempts to kill Rooney's trigger happy son (Daniel Craig). At the same time Sulivan must teach and protect his son (Tyler Hoechlin).Without spoiling anymore plot points of the film I can say that the center of this film is the bonds forged by fatherhood. Sulivan seeing John Rooney as a father figure gives this movie an entirely new depth that wasn't seen in Max Allan Collins' graphic novel. Don't get me wrong, the movie also loses several aspects of its source material; I would have liked them to use the ending from the graphic novel that shows what type of man Michael Sulivan Jr. grows up to be. Road to Perdition is a stylish movie adaption of a great graphic novel that knows what to change without ruining the store. In many ways this makes it similar to 1994's The Crow, where the story is drastically changed, but through visuals and music the film not only feels like the graphic novel, but manages to reach greatness all its own.Acting from Hanks and Newman is absolutely phenomenal. Both actors really give it their best and give off a strong sense of emotional attachment and care. Hanks turns in a great performance as an anti-hero proving that he is one of the greatest actors currently living and Paul Newman makes sure his final performance is a great one. The rest of the cast is good too, but this pair is absolutely dynamite! Sam Mendes and cinematographer Conrad L. Hall (who would win the Academy award for his work in this film) create an awesome visual experience. Sam Mendes said that after the Best Picture winning American Beauty he wanted to make a film that focused more on telling its story through visuals instead of dialogue and he succeeds. This is a well crafted drama that lets its images do all the talking that is needed to tell the story.The somber score by Thomas Newman captures the mood of this period piece. It doesn't have much excitement in it, but it has a quiet, eerie tune that helps the mood. A song entitled 'Ghosts' which appears in one of the climatic scenes is one of the most beautiful, haunting pieces of music I've ever heard.Road to Perdition's father and son element is probably the main hook for me as a viewer, and there are imperfections in the film, but for the emotional response it received from me I can't help but give it high-marks. It is stylish, taught, emotional, and a blast to watch as Tom Hanks finds his inner-gangster!</fullReview>

A soul filling music by Thomas Newman, the likes of Hans Zimmer,James Howard, simple yet strong dialogs,brilliant cinematography and cast of Tom Hanks, Daniel Craig,Jude Law, Paul Newman- is what has made this movie watchable over and over again. This movie is in the league of The Godfather, The untouchables and anyone who has liked these movies sure would have enjoyed this one too. One of the best part is the slow bonding between a father and a son. I have always liked Tom Hanks movies, but watching him emotionless in the first half was a surprise. Jude Law's gestures and postures were as usual amazing. I request anyone who hasn't seen this movie and wants to see how beautiful a movie can be, to go for this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Road to perdition is quite impressive in a way regarding the tale of a father who is at the wrong side of law , trying to hide his way of living from his family but his son witnesses him as accomplice in a murder , he loses all respect for him. Tom hanks who is the father is brought up by the very same crime boss , in whom he sees a father and a benefactor.But now his family is in great risk because of his son as a witness he has to make choices , the crime boss John Rooney(Paul Newman) although loves and prefers Michael Sullivan(Tom Hanks) even more than his son but when it comes to his own son as his life is in danger by committing the murder of Sullivan's wife and other son, he is compelled to protect him rather unwillingly while Michael relentless to avenge is also very fearful inside his heart that his son will follow his foot steps. My most favorite scene was when Paul Newman says to Tom Hanks , Wake up Michael , open your eyes there are only murderers in this room and there s one guarantee none of us is going to see heaven for what we do. This is very good inspiring film especially in terms of a father son point of view , as most fathers and big brothers are role models for a boy when he is turning into a man , its like a great responsibility on the elders regarding their young ones. Also good to see was Jude Law as a hit man and Daniel Craig.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very well done and beautiful film about a gangster and his son.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this film when it came out in the summer of 2002. I very much enjoyed this movie as it had great acting, a rather good story and a very nice design to it. By that I mean it looked really good up on the big screen. The story follows a man who has a wonderful family. What separates this man from most people with wonderful families is that he happens to be a gangster. One day one of his sons sees him at his job where he guns down some people with a tommy-gun. Well another man with Hanks' character is a bit rattled that the boy witnessed this, but Sullivan (Hanks' character) assures him that his son will not be telling anyone what he saw. The other guy, played by a then virtually unknown Daniel Craig, however decides to try and take out Sullivan and his entire family. Sullivan and the boy who witnessed the crime get away and Sullivan then is out trying to find a way to get back at Craig's character. The movie is just great with wonderful performances all around. Not only does this one have Tom Hanks and Daniel Craig, it also has Paul Newman and Jude Law as a creepy hit-man. There is good action in the movie here and there, but it is less about action than it is about visuals and such. I am surprised this movie never won any major awards as it was a very good movie all around. The story could have used a bit of work, but overall it was good too. The ending was interesting too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Cruel Work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was hard to relate to Tom Hanks in this film. I think that his positive image makes it hard to see him as a cold blooded killer. But this is more a film about a machine that exists all too much in our culture, that of the powerful going to any means to keep that power. Hanks' character has basked in the protection of a sort of godfather who keeps the family together. Unfortunately, he has a loose cannon son in the form of Daniel Craig (Jame Bond) who can't control his impulses (he is an incurable sociopath). Once Hanks crosses his people, he must go about surviving. His wife and little boy have been savagely murdered by Craig because he now has become the target. Also, there is another psychotic reporter/hit man played by Jude Law who has been hired by the Capone mob to kill Hanks and his remaining son. It all plays out well. It's a bit of a morality play, a "you can't go home again" film. It's slick and well done. I love Tom Hanks, however, and I'm not sure he was the right choice for this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is no denying the power behind this script, its acting and the powerful lighting. The directors choice of camera layout (particulaly the scene where the bathroom door mirror is used) should be noted. However that being said, WHAT IS WITH THE WALL TO WALL MUSIC?? Certainly the music was beautiful, but often misplaced. I found the music to be distracting from the core of the acting and the story telling. Unlike a Scorses film, where the music carries us through the story, this score stumbled and mislead us through the plot. I agree, that Hanks seemed unsure at times, but Newman and Law were as good as it gets. I fail to see how this film could ever be compared to the "Godfather". Maybe, "Millers Crossing" at times. This didn't have the character development nor dialog worthy of a "Godfather" comp.After watching the deleted scenes, I took off a point for the choice to remove the Capone scene from the final cut. I feel this scene added more depth to the Nitty and Maguire characters.I can't say that I don't recommend this film because I have and will.</fullReview>

But I was also disappointed because the critics raved about like it was the best of the summer of 2002 and the best of the year, it was neither. What also disappointed me was Sam Mendes directed it, and I was disappointed because it was the follow up to his masterpiece American Beauty. Road to Perdition does have something to offer. It has fantastic Cinematography, Very nice Sets, and a wonderful Original Score. Visually, Road To Perdition is quite well made. The movie has good acting. The Kid who played Michael Jr. was very good, he showed real potential for a good career. Paul Newman is also Very Good. Jude Law gives a quite good performance too. Tom Hanks is miscast though, he just wasnt convincing as a gangster. Jennifer Jason Leigh was wasted.Overall, Road to Perdition has some memorable scenes and other good things too.

		<shortDescription>This is a great movie (Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers ------------Road to Perdition is a great movie, when i saw this movie i don't realize any serious flaw. The storyline is solid and consistent. The basic plot is about Mike Sullivan(Tom Hanks) that works as a hitman to John Rooney (Paul Newman). The Paul Newman's character is almost a father for Sullivan but this relationship star to break, when Sullivan and Rooney's son going to talk with a man. The result of this "visit" is Connor Rooney murder this man and worst Michell Sullivan's son see everything. Despite Sullivan said that your son don't talk Connor try to kill Michell Sullivan but this attempt fail. However, Connor himself attempt and kill Sullivan's wife and Peter (his other son). In response Sullivan going on to revenge and try to kill Connor. John, try to fix this situation sending a man to talk with Sullivan, but he refuse for two motives he want his revenge, and don't trust in Connor.Spoilers ------------Tom Hanks is great and his role, Hanks looks like a ordinary man and never resemble a hitman, but he is. I think that the most hitman, doesn't resemble a hitman but i simple man. Sullivan is cold man and always ready to kill someone. The only fear of Sullivan is that his son choose the same destiny that he choose. Paul Newman, is almost a typical mob, sweet and gentle but is hard when necessary. John Rooney has only one flaw, his son Connor and try to protect the best that he can. Also, Mendes directed this movie very well and the pictures are great.My vote for this movie is 8</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How do messes like this get made? I guess the book was probably pretty good and Mendes thought he could bring it to life on the screen. WRONGO! SPOILERS. The kid sneaking in the back seat was just too contrived. How many banks does Hanks' character have to hit before the mob gets wise and places some hitman to whack him? (That was just plain silly). The forced comic relief of the driving lessons was bad. If Newman's character loved Mike Sullivan's family that much we need much more turmoil to justify his protection of Connor. Much more time/effort/character development was needed to buy into that. And though I could have overlooked it if the film had been better overall, Hanks is simply unconvincing as a mobster.</fullReview>

Cinematography was amazing, casting was impecable, the script must've been revised and edited a thousand times to be this good as a final product. Tom Hanks definitely gave his most commanding performance to date. I don't think he'll ever beat himself in any movie for the rest of his career. As for Paul Newman, I couldn't think of a better nemesis. He plays opposite Tom Hanks so well, it's just pure genious. As for the young man who plays Michael Sullivan Jr., he's definitely going to have a good career ahead of him. The one character who I didn't think fit into the perfection of the movie though was Jude Law. I think they could've found a better person to play the assassin. He definitely makes us see the insanity of the character, but he's a little too nutty.That's a small factor in the movie though, and doesn't really detract from the success of it. Best movie I've ever seen, or probably will ever see.</fullReview>

I'm afraid I don't see it.****POSSIBLE SPOILERS, BUT UNLIKELY!****First things first...playing a role against type may make you a little daring, but it doesn't mean that you're believable in the role. This was just not a role for Hanks. Sorry!Second, I actually spoke Rooney's last words before he did. The dialogue had been so cliched up to that point, that I simply picked the most over-used and trite phrase I could think of at that moment. And I was right!! Believe me, nobody was more surprised than I was. If I were Newman, I would have asked for a re-write of that scene.Third, Sullivan (Sr.) has been in the "family business" for years, yet he appears to be totally shocked that Nitti (or anyone else) might act in their own best interests. Fourth, there is nothing in the plot that we haven't seen a dozen times before. There's little doubt in our mind about what the ultimate fate of each character will be. When we see a scene carefully setup (for example, at the diner) we know almost instantly where it is going and what the outcome will be. There is zero tension and even less moral ambiguity.This is not a bad movie, but it cost over $80M to make and it ended up a cross between A Christmas Story and The Godfather.See the Coen brothers' Miller's Crossing if you want an exciting gangster film with some subtlety and a few loose ends in the morality department.</fullReview>

"Road To Perdition" delivers on all aspects of the movie experience and belongs in the last category for this genre.The acting is absolutely superb (go figure with Hanks and Newman). Throw in an engaging and believable storyline with memorable dialogue ("There are only murderers in this room."). To flesh out the film add gorgeous music, beautiful cinematography, and superb editing: what do you get? Arguably the best movie of 2002.The only detraction of the story is the dark and deeply disturbing nature of the material (mob life).This movie is guaranteed to do what great movies and plays are supposed to do: draw you in and make you forget you are watching actors. But don't take your kids is my recommendation. 9 out of 10 only because of the morbidity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You can almost feel the leather soles on bare floorboards and smell the flash powder. Yet this film was marred by a couple of small details, perhaps a couple out of many that I missed;(a) In the scene when Hanks is nearly eliminated by Jude Law at the hotel, Hanks "fires" (bang on the soundtrack) an empty (slide retracted) 1911 pistol from his prone position. This wouldn't matter so much if it hadn't been the one shot that shatters a glass table lamp purportedly scarring Jude Law's face.(b) When Hanks has a .45 bullet dug out of his shoulder it falls into the (obligatory) tin dish without any deformation or scoring to show that it travelled down a barrel and into flesh; the audience would still have known it was a bullet if these details had been correct. (Also, the gun that Jude Law used to fire the shoulder wounding shot at Hanks looked a lot like a pea-shooter (small calibre) not a .45 ACP but I'll stand correction)These undoubtedly tiny little details unfortunately distracted me at a time in the film when I should have been looking at other things, and so led me to wonder what else had been fudged or missed.Road To Perdition is still a nice film to while away time waiting for the Sunday roast to cook. The performance by the cast was very good to watch and the sets were otherwise excellent though the camera work was only quite good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was my favourite film of last year. Amazing cinematography, mesmerizing direction and good old fashioned storytelling. What more can you ask for? It made for a superb experience. I like to keep my reviews short so I'll merely add I'd recommend it to anyone who appreciates true film making for this truly is class on every level. Oh, if you're expecting a big dumb action packed gangster flick don't bother, this is a slow burner which oozes style and sophistication. Isn't that nice?Niz</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do not know the work of Mendes and Hill but after seeing this film last night I will definitely look for any other films that Mendes directs and the work that Hill completed before his death this year-I thought the visuals of this film were what I took with me after the movie ended.The other commentators have been able to express far better than I the artistic aspects of how these visuals were given to the screen; I can only say the camera angles, shot selection and lighting made a visual feast of memorable proportions.I would urge any person that has not seen this film to see it immediately and see it several times over: the script, the acting and the visuals make this film an exception in the body of films-not just in this century but taking in a considerably longer period.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before seeing Road to Perdition, I was almost put off by the critical consensus that it was "self- indulgent". Certainly, it was a little at times but it must be hard not to be with such talent behind it.Tom Hanks continues to "darken" following his rather stern prison guard in The Green Mile (also very good, by the way) with his performance as hitman Michael Sullivan. Ironically, his imposing presence is undermined to a degree by a flaw that was also seen in this film's closest contemporary rival, Gangs of New York: a rather silly moustache.The performances from (particularly)Paul Newman, Stanley Tucci, Tyler Hoechlin and Daniel Craig are all superb. Jude Law is chilling as Harlem Maguire, even if he is a little bit of a caricature at times.Sam Mendes was robbed of a best director nomination, as was Hanks and the film itself. After this and American Beauty, I can't wait to see what Mendes will do next.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another strong performance by Mendes and a winning role for Hanks. This film is a powerful and moving betrayal of a father's desire for revenge and redemption for his son. A brialliant ensemble cast makes this movie a must see and one of the top flicks of 2002. My vote - a strong 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Love Between A Father And A Son</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit, I was skeptical upon hearing Tom Hanks starring in a film in which he played a hit man. Yet what appealed to me, other than this fact, was the amount of Oscar nominees and winners who were involved in the project. This is what motivated me to go to theaters and watch this. I was stunned by what I saw.I should have learned by now to not ever doubt Tom Hanks. He is a character actor, and plays the part of Michael Sullivan with pain, grace, and even a tad of humor. He was amazing, and after all these months, I'm surprised he was not at least nominated for an Oscar this year. Paul Newman was extraordinary as usual, playing the part of a tired mob boss who loves a surrogate son more than his own blood son to the part of perfection. Jude Law, as the photographer sent out to murder Sullivan and his son Michael, has done his best work so far in his young career. I mean, when someone recedes his hairline to play a more convincing hit man for a movie, you know that you've found someone special. He was spectacular. Finally, newcomer Tyler Hoechlin, who makes a beautiful debut as Michael Sullivan's son, witness to his job and ultimately the starter of a journey he and his father take to protect themselves. Every one of these actors became their parts, bringing innocence, humor, pain, guilt, and revenge to their characters.Yet the acting was not the only factor in this film. Following up on his award winning film American Beauty, Sam Mendes proves he's not just a one time hit director. With this film he again brings his vision to the big screen. Cinematographer Conrad Hall brings stunning shots and a dreamlike feel to the movie, adding to its mystery. The score by Thomas Newman is haunting and appropriate. An amazing group of men that the film industry was able to put together for this movie.This movie shows the a father and son bonding and grieving over the loss of Michael Jr's mother and brother. At first, they are perfect strangers, yet little by little, they grow to love each other. Not just the type of love that comes with being family. But the kind of love in which both connect on a different level that goes beyond being father and son. When they embrace at the end, it's one of the most moving scenes I've ever seen. This movie will move you, and stay with you for days. I highly recommend this picture.MJR</fullReview>

The plot reminds me old Mafia movies and the cast is wonderful. The direction was good enough to put the love of father and son in the middle of a story that combines hate, fear, revenge, adventure, violence (in its extreme) and...art!

		<shortDescription>Extraordinary second film by Mendes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sophomore efforts are an interesting phenomenon. A lot is expected of the filmmaker if their debut film was even a moderate success, and the director can go several different ways. The filmmaker can either try too hard to please a commercial viewership, thus alienating his or her core audience if the genre has changed. They can rest on their laurels and bank on reputation alone to draw an audience, or they can opt to take the opportunity their debut effort allowed them to make a project the way they want to.The latter option is the most exciting, and most uncommon. The filmmaker that comes to mind who embraced his fame and turned it into a non-commercial project is Steven Soderbergh and his film "Kafka." "Kafka" is the film that followed the immensely popular art house film "Sex Lies and Videotape", and was a fictional account of a segment of Franz Kafka's life. Although this movie was relatively forgotten and mostly went unseen, I found this movie to be one of the best I had ever experienced until then, and when I see the commercial yet adequate films that Soderbergh is turning out now, I remember that incredible movie.I bring up Kafka because I feel the same way about Road To Perdition. American Beauty, Mendes' debut film was an amazing study of the american family. I remember leaving the theater and thinking, "wow" and then sat down to drinks with a friend that turned into a 3 hour discussion of the film. I ached for the same thing watching Perdition. There are so many specific points to address, but to prevent spoilers, the technical respects of the film will have to do.With the attention to set detail, one can see that Sam Mendes is a prolific theater director. There isn't a detail missed in regard to costuming and outdoor as well as indoor sets. There is an abundance of greens, navy blues and browns that could have given the film a drab feel but instead was photographed in such a lush manner by the late Conrad L. Hall that some scenes could have been straight out of a Thomas Hart Benton painting. Mendes' use of rain as a symbol to signal death is repeated in this film as well, and these scenes are filmed beautifully - not an easy task. Rain scenes can be awkward or they can be elegant, and these were filmed in perfection. Mendes isn't completely about spectacle however, some of his scenes are very substantial and tension riddled. One brilliant example is the scene after the tragedy in the Sullivan household, when Connor is at the front door of the house. Michael Jr., in danger, is frozen in fear on the porch as Connor looks right at him. What we see when we view Connor's perspective, is that he is looking at a reflection in the window. This moment was extremely suspenseful and choreographed to an outstanding effect.The film is based on a graphic novel that I have not had a chance to read yet, so I cannot compare the screenplay to the original story. The storyline of a hitman avenging the death of loved ones is not a new one, but I did not consider this retelling to be trite. The ending was fairly predictable, but not offensively so. This screenplay is not as full as American Beauty's but it is also a different kind of movie and therefore cannot be compared.I realize that Tom Hanks has grown immensely over the years as an actor. However, his role as a hitman in this film is a revelation. His performance was brilliantly understated, and slightly frightening yet sympathetic at the same time. You could physically see his sorrow throughout the film without the obvious signs of tears, simply by the way he carried himself. There are only a couple of roles that I truly respect Tom Hanks for above his regular "average guy" persona, namely his role in "Philadelphia", and this is one of them. He plays against type and it works. I never doubted his performance at any time during the film.Paul Newman contributed his usual good peformance as Hanks' boss and father figure, but it was Jude Law whose supporting performance I most respected. Like Johnny Depp, Jude Law could have banked on his looks and played the role of the "heartthrob" to successful results. However, following in Depp's footsteps, Law has overwhelmingly chosen more offbeat roles, even if they are in commercial releases. I had appreciated his performances in "A.I." and "The Talented Mr. Ripley", but his character as a hitman/photographer in Perdition is inspired. The photographer aspect of his role was loosely based on Weegee, the extraordinary crime and human interest photographer whose photographs were almost always tinged with irony. In this case, Law played a photographer who only photographed the dead, whether it was his victim or someone else's. I thoroughly enjoyed every scene in which he was featured. Mendes was brilliant to not overuse Law in this film, which added an additional air of mystery to his character.I definitely count this as one of the best movies I've seen in the last year. In addition to the musings above, I saw correlations between this film and two other favorites. As a huge fan of the Coen brothers, I cannot pick their best film, but one of my favorites is "Miller's Crossing". Perdition and Miller's Crossing both deal with the Irish mafia, take place in the 1930's and explore the conflict between a mafia patriarch and his fallen "son". When I first saw Miller's Crossing about 15 years ago, I remember thinking that it was lyrical in its filming and almost symphonic in the way it lays out its story. I felt the same watching Perdition. I can also see a connection between Perdition and "Citizen Kane" in that they both used a simple object to symbolize the loss of childhood ideals. Like Kane's sled, Michael Jr.'s bicycle effectively portrays his last grasp on the childhood he will not realize anymore. This is evidenced by the opening scenes in both films, Kane sliding down a snowy hill and Michael Jr. riding his bicycle down his own snow covered hill. Whether this is an homage or not, I don't know. Perhaps I'm reading too much into it, but what I can state affirmatively is that this is not a movie to be missed if you appreciate films that pay as much attention to their direction and cinematography as they do their storytelling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An slightly above average film, never boring but not always interesting. Once I'd got over the surprise &amp; disappointment of how old Paul Newman had got, he &amp; Law were brilliant in their roles, Hanks acts well too, but is dreadfully miscast as a hitman. He wouldn't frighten the birds in some scenes. The authenticity of the 20's location shots were the highlight of the film &amp; outstanding in the main. On the negative side, there was an assumption that overseas viewers would be clued up on US geography where infact knowing where Chicago &amp; New York are is probably the limit of that knowledge, consequently a lot of the time you're not sure exactly which city they're in or if they were somewhere between the two. Overall, 2 hours was a little too long to donate to a story where not a great deal actually occurred.A low 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gangster movie, that promised much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Road to Perdition7/10The Road to Perdition is a gangster tale, that tells the story of Tom Hanks' character (O' Sullivan) working for a mob, and finally succumbing to the fact that his child sees what he does for a living. O' Sullivans' son through sheer curiosity decides one night to sneak into the back of his fathers car and there the film starts to spiral into a direction that O' Sullivan couldn't possibly foresee.What makes the entire situation a little more emotional, is that O' Sullivans father figure, who is the head of this mob, is also the father of a man who's jealousy of the relationship leads into rage and a quest to murder the O' Sullivans. The film is indeed one of the better gangster movies in recent memory, and the dark grey setting seems to add a dullness to the whole set, which therefore gives the impression of a tiresome life that all mob members lead. Hanks is okay as the lead character, but it is Paul Newman as the head of the mob and Jude Law, who's character is very eerie and strange, who give the film a well needed boost.Ultimately the film centres around the father and son relationships and also the need to find some salvation from the dirty lives they've been leading. Throughout the film, the setting becomes lighter showing that O'Sullivan and his son, ironically come closer together because of the unfortunate events, with O' Sullivan soon realising that his greatest gift to his son due to the uncontrollable events, is to ward him away from the gangster life. It sometimes seems a little slow, and it doesn't have the sense of total dramatic climax like Goodfella's for example. But because the issues it engages are not those portrayed in Goodfella's it is definitely worth taking seriously. A very good film, but not the blockbuster that the hype wanted us to believe.</fullReview>

A drama set in the thirties about Mike Sullivan(Hanks) a mob-like hitman who finds himself running from everyone and everything he held dear to save his son from ultimate tradjedy.Paul Newman's academy award nominated role as the rich boss of Mike Sullivan is played flawlessly. Hanks gives a first rate performance along with his acclaimed supporting cast. I loved every bit of this movie so much I had trouble returning it to the videostore! I applaud this film but mourn the unjustice of it's Academy Award passover only being nominated for 4 or so awards. Not including Best Picture unfortunately, it would have fared much better there than that Boring, flawed, just plain annoying mistake of a film Chicago.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh so professional</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If for no other reason, any budding cinematographer should see the movie for Conrad Hall's painterly images. There's also Paul Newman, but I'll get to him later. The usually excellent Jude Law? A caricature. Jennifer Jason Leigh? Non-existent. Tom Hanks? Well, it's one of those times when a sometimes sublime actor ("Forrest Gump," any number of his honest-to-goodness funny comedies) takes himself too seriously, or tries to spread his wings into an area he doesn't normally touch (in this case, a bad guy -- don't worry he's not that bad), and ends up forfeiting the reasons we like him best.Hanks isn't wrong for the role necessarily, but he brings with him a sense of pedigree that isn't always beneficial -- it seems like his presence stamps a movie as Very Important. Imagine Gabriel Byrne in his place, and you'd get a sense of someone with an edge that could have raised the movie above the level of admirable professionalism. Well, not quite, since the movie's real problem lies with Mendes.The movie offers an annoyingly idealized version of life, even more so when we consider the subject matter -- no one has blood on their hands. The violence is all off-screen, as if to make it all perfectly acceptable to those in the audience who might be offended. After all, who goes to see a gangster movie to see blood or be at all emotionally conflicted? Whether or not Mendes thought that this approach would make his film more artistic or more acceptable to some unnamed highbrow viewer is just a part of the emotional remoteness of the film. I don't have a problem with an observational approach as a rule -- many of my favorite movies could be called "cold" -- but in a film that's theme is fathers and sons (and you better believe it's hammered home) you'd expect a little more heart.The comparisons to "The Godfather" are ludicrous. That film had one of the most amazing casts ever assembled and was treated as a bloody soap opera. It was tense and exciting and, above all, involving -- it took us along for the ride. "Road to Perdition" (just compare the titles of the two films and you'll get a sense of the difference) stands back from its subject and its characters. The only other real criticism I have is that we know Hank's future, as well as Newman's. There are no real surprises.The two Newmans bring something extra to the movie. Thomas Newman's score is very similar to his for "The Shawshank Redemption" and it gives a touch of feeling that Mendes has left out. Paul Newman is what gives the film all of its (little) emotional impact. His raspy voice argues with his natural dignity, and he comes away with the most complex character in the film. In the most memorable scene in the movie, the look on Newman's face is heartbreaking.Jude Law is very eager -- not ridiculously over-the-top, but somewhat cartoonish (and in the end, he's more memorable than Hanks and his mustache made to make him look -- I guess -- Irish).Technically, the film is beautiful. The pastel cinematography is lovely -- I just wish Mendes would have wanted a story, some characters and an overall mood as rich as the colors.***</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Road to Perdition is a fine film, but for a film of such cinematic beauty, it feels very hollow in the center of it. Tom Hanks is always a great screen presence as well as Paul Newman, but even with their combine star power, the movie falls flat with out some kind of internal dialog. It's a great artistic achievement in the sense of mood and setting but lacks the conviction to put the story it had into focus. Which is a shame because the story trying to be told here is a fine one but it needed to be focus a pond more instead of just focusing on set pieces to fit a certain mood.It's by no means a bad film, but it's pretty shallow for what it's trying to put a cross.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although nowhere near the delicious quality of situations ordialogue that Sam Mendes served up with his first offering,AMERICAN BEAUTY, his sophomore effort, ROAD TO PERDITION,is well worth the viewing.&lt;p&gt; Tom Hanks gives a wonderfully low-key performance as MikeSullivan, the man who "goes on missions" for his boss and father- figure, Paul Newman (who performs with perfection as always). Ireally appreciated NOT seeing Hanks slipping into his now nearlytrademark sweaty, red-faced, over-emoting, or handing-off smart- ass remarks as his past performances in CASTAWAY or SAVINGPRIVATE RYAN have highlighted. With this film we are given analmost non-expressive character (which also could be said to beone of the picture's flaws), played straight, and played right; so thatalmost none of "Tom Hanks: Movie Star" shows through.&lt;p&gt; Of course, Newman is flawless in his torn, paternal role as JohnRooney. Jude Law is also wonderfully creepy as the balding, oral- hygiene-challenged photographer with the fetish for death-shots(and more...). And Tyler Hoechlin, as Michael, Jr., is also a fineyoung actor I'm certain we'll only be seeing more of (and may wellgrow into one of the future "hunks" of future cinema I'd wager).&lt;p&gt; The film is well cast, nicely performed, beautifully shot, andadeptly directed (it's nice to see a director that enjoys subtlety andpacing these days). The soundtrack and the cinematography werestunning though; major contributors to setting the darkenedatmosphere. The only flaws I had with ROAD TO PERDITION werethe incredible lack of emotion (mainly from Hanks and his on- screen son, Hoechlin; which I can't explain without revealingdetails, but seemed exceptionally unrealistic given certaincircumstances), and the simple fact that the plotline wasn't all thatcompelling. I enjoyed watching it, followed it through earnestly, buttruly wasn't pulled-in at any point with the story's unfolding. I cansee where many viewers could become bored or restless Isuppose. Over-all, I'd still recommend it and would surely watch itagain sometime.&lt;p&gt; 7/10. A nice change of pace from the fast and furious cinematicschlock normally produced these days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong film, but not a masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILER WARNING-MULTIPLE SPOILERS FOLLOWTom Hanks has gotten to a stage in his career where he is so uniformly excellent in everything he does that it's beginning to diminish his impact. He gives a great performance in every single movie he does, and at this point his consistent brilliance is causing us to become complacent and not truly pay attention to the fact that he is one of THE great actors of our generation. "Road to Perdition" is a film that is hampered by this fact. While the finished product is nothing to cough at, a lot of it feels remote, not grabbing our attention as much as it should. This is mostly because the two characters we should care about most-Michael Sullivan (Hanks) and his son (Tyler Hoechlin)-do not engage our emotions as they should. The character development of this father and son, a crucial point in the film, is neither as deep or expansive as the other characters in the movie.The film's plot involves hitman Michael Sullivan being propelled on a quest for revenge after his wife and youngest son are murdered by Connor Rooney (Daniel Craig), the loathsome, greedy, and ultimately pathetic son of Irish mob boss John Rooney (a brilliant Paul Newman). With Sullivan after his son's life, Rooney, who is in principle a fair and decent man despite his unlawful business practices, is forced to order a hit on the man he loves like a son. Actually, he loves him more than his own son, which is why this whole situation got started in the first place. The hitman they call to kill Sullivan is a odd-looking photographer of the dead named Maguire (Jude Law). The first time you see this guy, he notices that one of the dead he's shooting (camera, not gun) is not exactly dead-only wounded. Instead of alerting the authorities, however, Maguire finishes the wounded man off-smothering him with an ammonium-soaked handkerchief. From this point on it is clear that Maguire is completely psychotic. Jude Law is very impressive, playing the character as a subdued, quiet loner instead of a raving maniac-thus making the character all the more frightening and monstrous. The film is filled with powerful moments. Most of these moments belong to Newman, who in his twilight years gives one of his finest performances as a man confronted with an impossible situation, quite aware that he will probably not come out of it alive. The scene where Rooney beats his son after the murder of Sullivan's family, then embraces him saying "God help us", is effective, but it's just the beginning. There is also the incredible scene where Rooney has to order the hit to Frank Nitti (Stanley Tucci). Newman truly embodies the terrible conflict that faces his character-he doesn't want to order death on his spiritual son, but he just can't let his actual son die either. "God help me" he whispers as he does the deed. "Nothing happens to the kid" is another order, even after Frank warns him that the kid will come for revenge-does Rooney want the son's vengeance? There is a tense scene in a diner between Maguire and Sullivan, a fatalistic speech in a church basement by Rooney that highlights the entire situation, and a brilliantly shot (this film deserved its cinematography credit-wow Conrad Hall was truly great) slow-motion segment where Hanks guns down all of Rooney's men, then (with a look of infinite sadness and pain-Sullivan doesn't want to kill his spiritual father any more than Rooney wants to kill his spiritual son)Rooney himself. Newman's final line, "I'm glad it was you", is heartbreaking and illuminating-he has been aware of the inevitability of his violent death for many years-but he is glad he dies by his "son's" hand. The one moment, however, that should be most powerful has barely any emotional weight at all. The moment where Tom Hanks is shot down from behind by a vengeful Maguire should be shocking and tragic, but it just feels tacked-on. Maybe the director, Sam Mendes, is trying to show how, in Sullivan's world, everyone is just waiting for the bullet with their name on it. But in this case it seems like the film is just being sad for no other reason than to be sad. Hanks' remote character is also at fault (but that is to be blamed on the script, not Hanks, who is brilliant as always). Hoechlin's pretentious monologues at the beginning and end of the film don't help either. Nevertheless, "Road to Perdition" is a very good movie. Great performances, a truly compelling plot, and excellent production values (let me again stress that the cinematography is INCREDIBLE) make this film a keeper. Just a few small flaws keep it from being a follow up masterpiece to Mendes' previous film, the perfect "American Beauty". But those flaws do not diminish its amazing strengths.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh boy. I'd like to write a good review for a movie, I really would. The problem is I keep seeing these movies being hailed as works of art and someone has to put a stop to it. Might as well be me. I had high expectations for this movie having heard it was a great depression-era gangster film. Add to that the fact that it was directed by Sam Mendes. Talk about backfires. This movie is only slightly okay at best and that is based solely on Paul Newman's performance. If only he had been the star. As good as he was, his appearance was too brief to carry the picture. Jude Law is equally outstanding as a hitman who takes pictures of his victims but again, he wasn't used enough to make this movie worth watching. While Tom Hanks is a tremendous actor, he was sadly miscast as the hitman working for Paul Newman. There were a few(sadly very few) scenes that I enjoyed but since they are key to the story I won't spoil them. As I've said before though, you'll wish I had rather than watch this movie. I would have expected much better from the guy who directed a masterpiece like American Beauty, but everyone knows that not every director can consistently make spectacular movies....except for David Fincher, or Kevin Smith, or Alex Proyas for that matter but now I'm getting off topic. A disappointing movie plain and simple. If there had been a more original story(and yes, I'm aware it's loosely based on truth) and a more convincing actor in the role of the hitman, this movie may have even deserved the nominations it received. Take from this what you will. I only have the viewing public's interests at heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Father/son relationship struggle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Theme: A central insight. The Road To Perdition shows the love between father and son can be tested in a fathers' attempt to protect his son, even if it means risking his own life. The telling of lies, untold truths and deception will try their relationship, all which could lead to murderous circumstances. Michael Sullivan, played by Tom Hanks, is a father trying to raise his son to not repeat the mistakes and life he made. While John Rooney (Paul Newman), raised his son to takeover the family business and follow in his footsteps. As a hit man for Newman, Hanks looks to him as a father figure. Newman is torn between the love of his natural son Connor (Daniel Craig) and the man he sees as his son (Hanks).Hanks son Michael Jr. witnesses a killing involving his father and Craig. Craig prepares to have the boy silenced when overtaken by envy, he makes a decision that will prove to be the beginning of all ruins for both the good and the bad alike. Directed by Sam Mendes and written by David Self, Mendes uses several techniques typical for gangster films. Dark colors and shadows throughout this movie depict gloom and tragedy, yet there are some not-so dismal scenes. The apparent use of the color green would suggest envy, status or power, and tranquility. Green has always been associated with envy and of course money (status or power), yet cinematographer Conrad Hall shows us scenes of green farmland along the road to Perdition to give a sense of peace, calmness and tranquility. You will also notice the use of water in much of the film. From the beginning scene where you see a child standing in front of a large body of water to the rain during the first climatic scene. Water or rain sets the tone for quite a few of the scenes whether it involved any killings or not. Mendes draws his audience into the film with some very good long shot and extreme close-up sequences. The camera shots switching between Newman and Hanks in the climatic scene not only draws the audience into the scene, it also makes you feel for the decisions of the characters. The premise of the father/son relationship being tested is also seen in the film Gladiators. It too tells a story of a fathers' love for his son and to what extent he will go to protect him. A father wanting so much for his natural son to be more like him identifies the struggle of deciding which man he wants to protect versus which man he has to protect. In addition to the use of dark colors red, orange and black again suggesting gloom and tragedy, the camera shot sequences draws the audience into the story. Everyday somewhere there's men struggling to raise their sons to try and teach them that in order for you to live a life better or different life than my own, I will do whatever it takes so that you don't make the same mistakes I've made. If you like gangster movies as much as I do, you too will enjoy this film. You may get out of it what I did, or at least, have a better understanding of the struggle fathers' have raising their son's.</fullReview>

Spectacular cinematography and set design that puts you into the times of the Great Depression. Classily acted, with Tom Hanks playing a welcome anti-hero. Especially noteworthy is the typically great Paul Newman and a chilling Jude Law.</fullReview>

The plot itself is just above average. Acting is great, for the most part.Recommended mainly to those that have a special interest in films.

		<shortDescription>A modern-day film noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing that came to mind while viewing Road to Perdition was, some scenes in particular, the film's dark cinematography and theme are very similar to old film noir movies. The way it was shot, I wouldn't be surprised if someone like Tim Burton was the cinematographer. Even in the more light-hearted scenes, there's always a sense of heaviness, and many of the scenes have a dark mood and feel as well as a look. The musical score in the film is excellent, and accents the action and drama perfectly.That about sums up the style, but as for the story, while somewhat predictable at times, it's still rather gripping and a compelling tale. It's not all dark and dreary, however. There are plenty of lighter, and even funny scenes throughout, mostly focusing on the bond growing between Hanks' character and his son. The acting is superb, and while at first I wasn't sure about Tom Hanks playing a cold-hearted hitman, his talent made me warm up to it very quickly, particularly in showing that Sullivan was compassionate as well. Paul Newman performs in one of the best supporting roles I've seen him in. Jude Law's character is unique and portrayed very well, and I see him strengthening his grasp on what makes a good actor with every film I see him in. Tyler Hoechlin, a new young actor on the scene, is sure to receive more roles after a solid performance as Sullivan's son.This film, while containing some action, is not for the gunfights-and-explosions crowd that most modern action films appeal to. It is heavy in dialogue and character interaction, but that's what made it worth watching for me; the fact that through every event you see each main character grow. The loose ends are tied up in the denouement, and while the ending is not your typical "good guy wins, rescues the girl, kills the bad guys" ending, is satisfying and fits the theme of the movie wonderfully. Another comment about the way it was shot, the final scenes contain bright background and colors, which is a brilliant juxtaposition to the content of the scenes. I'd say the only downside were a few brief, slow moments throughout the movie, but it seems that those feelings are taken away just as quickly as they set in. An all-around good film, especially those with a longing to see what film noir might look like if the genre were to become popular in cinema again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm one of those who try to see all the best movies on their opening day, and then tell others either to stay away or see it immediatly. Unfortunatly, i never got to see Perdition on the big screen, and the movie didn't work on the plane I was on. Finally watched it a week ago, and absolutly loved it. Tom Hanks and Paul Newman were brilliant as usual, as was Jude Law as the bounty hunter assigned to kill Hanks as his son. The film has a great storyline with a powerful message, all backed up with composer Thomas Newman's best music since Green Mile. Top ten on my list for best in 2002.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Upon discovering his son has witnessed his line of work, gangster Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks, good acting as always) must run from the crime family that he is a part of. Together with his son, they go on an exciting adventure that involves cat and mouse situations, violence and money. Everyone's performance was nicely done, Jude Law was nicely casted as the hired assassin. Over all this movie delivers a good time, but this movie should be intercepted as a drama, as it will be better enjoyed. Yes there is the action/ violence, but if somebaody is going to rent this expecting that mob-type action then they should rather go with something like Goodfellas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nicely crafted gangster story, from a comic-book source, featuring a welcome, subdued performance by the normally sappy Hanks.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This one is as visually striking as Leone's epic masterpiece, ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA, but is as simplistic as Leone's film was complex and intricate. The basic, lackluster story of a father and son seeking retribution while fleeing from double-crossing mob bosses is made compelling by the superb craftsmenship both behind and in front of the camera. The obligatory sentimentality associated with the father/son relationship is subdued (particularly welcomed in Hanks' case), while the one-note storyline is carried by the sinister atmosphere and moody cinematography of Conrad Hall. This film is an improvement over Mendes more popular work, AMERICAN BEAUTY.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>sam mendes's follow up to his superb debut 'american beauty' is a brilliant, tender story about a father and son on the run. It takes awhile to kick into gear, but once it does, it becomes fascinatingly enjoyable. Tom hanks is as good as always, and the child puts in a performance that seems to assure us that child actors are actually quite good. Again, as in 'american beauty' thomas newmans score plays a big part, and he doesn't fail. His music almost becomes a character. The cinematography and direction are the main stand outs. Sam's use of images, against specific backgrounds, never fail to amaze. He's every bit an artist, and it shows in almost every frame.As the film drew to it's climax, i was so into it, i thought i was going to throw up due to nerves for a character. And when the end credits rolled, i walked out shaking. And that has never happened to me before. And it probably won't for a long long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>NOT your typical Tom Hanks film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Hanks goes way, way out of character on this one. Tom plays a bad guy - a role that we've not seen from him before (at least I haven't!) and he does it very, very well. This proves that Hanks is truly a great actor and versatility is something that many actors just don't have. Hanks seems to have it in abundance. It seemed that he would become typecast in the "You've Got Mail" cute romantic comedic roles. But then he breaks out with an achievement like this one! I truly enjoyed this film. Paul Newman can still act, too! As I said, Tom plays a bad guy - in this case, a hit man for a syndicate boss (played by Newman). Tom's wife and one of his two sons are killed by another hit man and Tom and his remaining son go after the mob. This is a good film to rent! Lots of violence, so not for kids, but it shows what Hanks can do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>50% of this movie is pure sentimental dross.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(** out of *****)If you hate films that play sentimental for the sake of tugging heart strings then give this film a miss. If you hate sentimental films that don't do the sentimental part so well then give this is a miss. If you hate DREAMWORKS for stuffing loads of sentimentality into an excellent idea for a film so that it plays well to masses then give this one a miss. The point being that this film had enough sentimentality from the outset, plot and premise to carry it throughout without MORE sentimentality being added to it which quite frankly is what kills this film dead. I mean COME ON!!! This is a gangster flick!!! The sentimentality is already there in the premise. Advice to Spielberg et al on sentimentality.... go watch MILLER'S CROSSING and please stop shoving sentimentality down our throats like we need it as much as we do oxygen. Sure a little sentimentality is important in a movie of this stature... and our daily lives.... but Mendes whacks layers of sentimentality on as if Spielberg is behind going .... MAKE ME CRY.... TUG MY HEART STRINGS!!!... I NEED SENTIMENTALITY TO LIVE!!! all the time.In short - edit 50% of the movie..... i.e. the sentimentality scenes and you got a classic! Wait for Newman's - `A room full or murderers' speech. WOW!! Now that is worth a thousand sentimental scenes. This film does keep you glued to the screen... waiting for the big one... but the moment Tom Hanks leaves a bag of money at the house he just appeared out of nowhere from to get a gun shot removed is where you just have to go.... PLEASE... SOMEONE QUIT WITH ALL THE SENTIMENTALITY!!!!... This was meant to be a MOB flick! Sure it is sad in many ways more than one but the lashings of sentimentality is what makes this film so brutally hard to endure. Maybe the Oscars should be blamed for films going to trash like one. Hell... maybe what I just watched was the most violent chick flick ever made!!!! SERIOUSLY!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's Wrong with Making Every Shot Count?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't believe the folks who tell you this is one of those films that is very good but not great. There's nothing `not great' about it. This is one of those films that is so meticulously crafted and wonderfully acted that it's damn hard to find something wrong with it. I eventually had to concede that the voice-overs that bookend the film were not necessary, though they didn't hurt the overall film experience. This is by far the most lovingly photographed and beautifully scored period gangster film since the Coen Brother's `Miller's Crossing' (which was also about Depression-era Irish gangsters), but unlike that film, you never get the uneasy feeling here that you may have been duped into watching a slick parody of the beloved genre. The cinematography in this film is mind-numbingly gorgeous. Conrad Hall (who also teamed up with Mendes on `American Beauty') out-does himself here. Words can't describe how beautiful this movie is to look at. Almost every scene comes across as a postcard or painting.The acting is top-notch. Tom Hanks, for the first time in years, reminded me of how great an actor he is. He plays against type here as a cold hit-man and distant yet still loving father. This is the first film of his in a long time where I didn't feel like punching his character in the face for being so damn goody-goody and morally upright. The kid actors aren't great, but they take direction well and deliver their lines effectively. Paul Newman is fantastic as the Irish `Godfather,' and Jude Law is wonderfully quirky as a for-hire killer who likes to take pictures of the dead for art's sake. Jennifer Jason Leigh is the only one left with the thankless role of Hank's wife, and one wonders why they didn't cast some nice-looking nobody instead of someone of such talent who deserves a bigger role.The real star of this film, though, is Sam Mendes, the director. Like all the greats, he shows a great attention to detail. I loved watching the single bead of sweat form on Tom Hank's brow whilst realizing he just met the man hired to kill him in a quaint road-side diner. He also shows great restraint. All of the gory violence is either shown off-screen or from unique and interesting angles (i.e. the son watching his dad shoot a man from a hole in the wall). Similarly, this could have easily been a three-hour epic, but Mendes keeps it lean and poignant at an expertly paced just under two-hour clip. He also makes great use of sound in innovative ways (i.e. the rain-soaked machine-gun massacre near the film's end) and proves to be an expert at narrative montage (the bank robbing montage was nothing short of brilliant) to keep things moving in the middle. He also knows how to get to the heart of the story without making things overly-sentimental. Directors with similar artistic styles, like Spielberg of Frank Darabont, may have overstated the underlying themes of father/son relationships and loyalty and betrayal amongst criminal families, but Mendes uses them to their full effect without ever allowing them to weigh down the story like sap.Had this film been released in December instead of last summer, I suspect it would have garnered a Best Picture and Best Director nomination instead of literary hogwash like `The Hours.' The fact that it still garnered six nominations in mostly technical categories is a testament to the craft that went into it. Alas, movies shouldn't be made to win Oscars, but to stand the test of time. In due time, I wouldn't be surprised if this film rests comfortably under the likes of `The Godfather' Trilogy and `Goodfellas' as one of the best gangster films of the modern era, and if not one of the best, at least be renowned as the most artistic. Meanwhile, if Sam Mendes keeps this up (I can't think of any other current director, except perhaps Anthony Minghella, who makes such heavy-handed and artistic direction seem restrained and effortless) he will undoubtedly be hailed as one of the all-time greats, and this will be viewed as one of his early `classics.'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SPOILERS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most interesting thing about this movie is Tom Hanks as a killer. I didn't buy it at first, but after seeing it I was thoroughly impressed. He really does make a good hitman. I would like to see him in the same character but ten years before, such as the story about how he got in the life. But other than that, be careful, this was just a flick, with inexplainable loopholes and things that just made no sense. A bizarro world of sorts, where mobster hitmen cry and their children do not.The kid, Sullivan Jr., was robotic. They should have used Agent Cody Banks or the "I see dead people" kid from Sixth Sense. The kid sees his mother and little brother slaughtered, but is able to sleep that night, and never seems too broke up about either of them during the rest of the film, not in the least. Learning how to drive, getting $200, going on a road trip...all just happy go lucky things as with all families who have recently been cut in half by a maniacal killer. There's a major shootout in downtown Chicago in broad daylight, no cops, nothing.And when Tom Hanks shoots at Jude Law, hitting a glass which sprays Law's face, Law is moaning and obviously not dead. WHY THE HELL DOESN'T HANKS FINISH HIM OFF? WHY? WHY? WHY? WHAT THE HELL, MAN? Hanks goes out of his way to get all kinds of people and money, but when he obviously knows a f***in' hitman is AFTER his ass, STALKING him, he wounds the guy and leaves him. That made no damn sense whatsoever other than they needed Law for the ending. Based on a true story or not, that made no sense. Hanks deserves to get killed at the end. At least show him ATTEMPT to go over and finish him off, only to be interupted by shouts from his son or something. SOMETHING. But to leave Law only wounded. What mobster hitman does that!?And the country diner scene, what kind of cop sees someone shooting at a fleeing automobile and just says "Hey" without drawing his sidearm. That cop deserved to be shot also...And twice. That's why movies like this, while entertaining, are so far fetched from what the average person would be expected to do they're not that good.This could have been a serious flick, but it was just entertainment. Parts that struck a chord in me did not for long because the director had people doing/not doing things that made no f***ing sense.</fullReview>

This is a brilliant comic-adaptation. It's a beautiful hommage to the gangster aera. Just think about it: there is no real depth, there's a tight revenge story in which persons behave as in old gangsterfilms or as in old comics. Mendes even refers to it a couple of times in the film it self. Hanks' family is murdered and cries, but immediately goes on, just looking bitter and acting cool. The lack of emotions is on purpose. The relationships are drawn in broad strokes. Just watch it as a gangsterpicture, a very beautiful one as it is. Every single shot can be framed and it's a piece of art. Newman is brilliant, Hanks very good, but it's Mendes who's the real star and he, his cinematographer and productiondesigner should win every award available. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>(spoilers)Gonna say the bad news first. Which isn't much, but prevents it from becoming a masterpiece. The movie is choppy in parts. Which from all the deleted scene's, becomes rather obvious. (assuming your watching the dvd of course) And the child going off to live with the grandparents seemed like it was lifted from the original Firestarter.But other than those noticable problems, it's a great movie. My brother won't watch it because Tom Hanks dies in the movie, but I can tolerate it because he's not the main character. To me, the main character is the kid. Michael Sullivan. Anything the "Angel of Death" does in the movie is relavant to getting Michael to live a good life. And proves it at the end by shooting Jude Law before the kid does. Which is the best thing.It's funny though, I found out about the movie in early 2002 while going to a meeting with some folks. The host that day (only 7-9 people showed up) knew someone who'd written this graphic novel and had finally gotten someone to make the movie. Who knew it would become such a popular movie. I certainly hope it goes places at the award shows.9/10Quality: 9/10 Entertainment: 10/10 Replayable: 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark and Somber 30s Gangster Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Road to Perdition" could almost be called "film noire". It uses authentic looking sets, clothes and oh those vintage cars, to give the audience the look and feel of 1931, when the story takes place. The colors are purposely kept dark and it seems to be raining most of the time. Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) is a mob hit man who works for Irish mob boss John Rooney (Paul Newman) who is also his surrogate father. On rainy night, Sullivan's 12 year old son Michael Jr. (Tyler Hoechlin) hides inside his father's car and fllows his father and Rooney's loose cannon of a son Connor (Daniel Craig on a "job". He witnesses the gangland hit by the two men. Sullivan immediately senses the danger to his son and family. Connor decides to take matters into his own hands and eliminate the witnesses. He murders Sullivan's wife (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and younger son Peter (Liam Aiken). Although the senior Rooney was against this action, he nevertheless supports his son.  Sullivan then takes Michael Jr. and takes flight. In Chicago, he seeks the help of Frank Nitti (Stanley Tucci) to avenge his loss. However Nitti and Rooney hire grim faced assassin Maguire (Jude Law) to finish the job. The rest of the film involves the cat and mouse games involving hunter and hunted. Director Sam Mendes gives us an all too serious film. Nobody smiles except Newman throughout the whole film. Given the somber subject matter this is somewhat understandable, however, it does leave one with the impression that the characters are almost "undead" awaiting the inevitable. Hanks is cast against type as a humorless grim faced and cold blooded killer. He fears that his older son wants to emulate him. Newman, even in his late seventies proves he can still steal a film. He portrays Rooney with a coldness befitting of a gangland boss yet maintains a sympathetic outward appearance. Law as the psychopathic killer is positively chilling. Craig is cold and calculating as Connor the over ambitious son of Newman. Young Hoechlin is excellent as the younger Sullivan. Anthony LaPaglia was to have played Al Capone in a cameo but his scenes were deleted. Lara Phillips who plays a waitress in one of the cafe stops is actually Jennifer Jason Leigh's real life sister. Her part was added to show that the Hanks character still grieving, sees his dead wife in almost every woman he meets. A good gangster film with chilling performances and the look and feel of the thirties.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Road To Perdition Exceeds Greatness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Road To Perdition is one of the best movies of 2002. Tom Hanks is Mike Sullivan Sr., a enforcer for the Irish mob, headed up by boss John Rooney (Paul Newman). When his family is killed, he wants revenge. John Rooney is a little scared that Mike might go after him, so he sends out an assassin (Jude Law) to kill Mike. Mike and his son Mike Jr. (Tyler Hoechlin) are on the run from an assassin and on the run for revenge. Road To Perdition is a flashback of what the 1930's was. Tom Hanks is great and Paul Newman is one really good actor. Road To Perdition - "A Cheer" 9 1/2 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is simply one of the best movies of 2002. I think a lot of people were disappointed to see Tom Hanks play an anti-hero, but he does it well. The story was fascinating. Hanks plays a hit-man for the aging Irish mob boss Paul Newman.The guts of the plot revolve around the developing relationship between Hanks and his son, Michael Jr. and the loss of his own father-son relationship with Newman. Meanwhile, it's Hanks only wish that his son not follow in his footsteps and remain true of heart.There is so much going on that's subtle and could be easily overlooked. For instance, did anyone else notice that during every significant death seen the presence of water? Whether it was a bathtub (twice), rain or even the ocean, the plot contains lots of little threads that neatly tie events together throughout the movie. The sound and music were great as well. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sam Mendes' debut, the successful family-flick "American Beauty" was not a big deal for me. I thought that the idea of the film was nice, although it didn't come as I wanted into the screen. However, I had raised great expectations following the second movie by Mendes, so I came to the theater to see "Road To Perdition", while expecting a lot from it.What I saw from the beginning was a phenomenal work by Conrad L Hall, the great lost of the Cinema industry, who brought a very dark and melancholic external view to the film. The score is dramatic and perfect for the film. The simple script had being shaped with great dialogues and was turned very unique. In addition, the acting was quiet and marvelous: Tom Hanks had a very rare role for him, although he still showed his great ability to act; Jude Law had a linking role and he performed it with much cruelty; Newcomer Tyler Hoechlin was great as the helpless child, coming up at the end with sobriety; And the absolute great acting was by Paul Newman. So quiet and modest, he presented a good-hearted and warm person, even though his job was tough and bloody.Mendes' second work is much better and is more mature, complicated and polished than "American Beauty".This exciting film is brought with splendid aesthetics and is absolutely one of the best movies of all times.Grade: 10/10</fullReview>

My only reservation about it the fact that Tom Hanks, that's our lovable Tom Hanks, plays a guy who goes around killing people like most folks stop for coffee. Yeah, yeah, sure, sure, he dies in the end, but the whole idea of ruthless killing still permeates the film. I'm not some wuss. I'm a 48 year old man who has been around and is wise in the ways of the world. I'd just like to see some more creative thinking on the part of film makers to produce a product less relied on gunfire and blood. It has been done to death, over and over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Tale of Fathers and Sons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Sullivan is a hard working man who provides for his wife and sons . John Rooney raised Michael as a surrogate son and gave him a position in the family business. Michael ,Jr. is a head strong youth who traveling the same road as his father and when his younger brother asks him what their father does for Mr. Rooney he sets put to discover the truth on his own. One night while spying on his father he learns the dark nature of his fathers work. And their lives soon head down the road to Perdition?with a vengeance. In a film like this where exposition is sparse and the visuals tell the brunt of the story a quality cast is a given. Luckily the cast is more than up to the task with all the principals turning in excellent performances. Each one made their characters memorable through expression and movement. The only thing is that Jennifer Jason Leigh (an excellent actress in her own right) could have had more to do. Based on the Max Alan Collins graphic novel the screenplay is the tale of fathers and sons and the power of that bond. The direction by Sam Mendes (in his follow-up to his debut American Beauty) is outstanding. The images he creates make lasting impressions that haunt you until the end. The late Conrad Hall's photography is a testament to a impressive career and the screen will surely miss him. All the technical aspects of the film are dead on. The production and costume designs are excellent emphasizing the overall dark atmosphere of the film. And of particular note is Thomas Newman's hauntingly beautiful score. n his sophomore Hollywood effort Mendes has established himself as a filmmaker to watch. This tale brings into focus the importance of a father's role in all our lives . The visual potency of Road to Perdition is its' greatest accomplishment. We are given a treat that harkens back to old school filmmaking where images an d action were as integral to a picture as the screenplay and bankable stars. This proves that you can have a film with style and substance along with expert filmmakers and a well placed casting choices to create a modern film that takes its' place among the best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow! I was blown away by the alternate tenderness/sadness of this fine film. Hit man Mike Sullivan, devoted family man, is part of John Rooney's organization. Rooney, played by Paul Newman, is a boss in the Al Capone gang in 1931 depression era Chicago. The Sullivans, as do the rest of Rooney's gang, live outside of Chicago in a small town, semi rural atmosphere. They attend wakes, family celebrations and church together. Underneath this seemingly idyllic existence lurk resentments and potentially explosive rivalries.Mike Sullivan excellently played by Tom Hanks, loves his wife (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and two sons Michael 12, and Peter 9. His children know nothing about his work as a professional hit man for John Rooney. When Michael accidentally witnesses a hit, Mike's wife and son Peter are murdered. It is then that Mike Sullivan makes the decision to avenge his family's murder and protect his son Michael.The sepia-tones of the movie, the accurately depicted atmosphere of the depression, the costumes, the cars, the dialogue are all top notch--not a false note.Tom Hanks has never been better. He is a tortured man, who knows he is on the Left Hand of God. He desperately wants to save his son Michael from his own fate. Somehow, I think God was listening.Rent it. Watch it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misuse of cast and lack of character progression quell talk of similarities to `The Godfather'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In his review of `Road to Perdition' Roger Ebert took issue with the fact that Michael Sullivan and John Rooney lack the ability towards choice that was so vital to the success of the `Godfather' trilogy. `Road to Perdition' essentially sends the message that these characters have chosen this life of crime and have no way out of their bleak fates. Initially, I didn't exactly heed Ebert's warning that I was about to witness Sophocles rather than Shakespeare but now I see his point. A film where the individual still has some ability to develop his own destiny is much more interesting than one where he does not. Possible SpoilersThe issues I have with `Road to Perdition' go deeper than Ebert's feelings about why this wasn't `The Godfather.' My biggest concern was the apparent misuse of the entire cast. This is not a habit one usually connects with Sam Mendes after the brilliance he displayed with 'American Beauty' and hopefully this won't become a pattern. I especially felt that Paul Newman (John Rooney) was wasted. Rooney is a mob boss who can be very kind or amazingly evil depending on how his day is going. He spends a huge chunk of the film spouting out Corleone style proverbs like 'Sons were put on this Earth to be trouble for their fathers.' I was impressed with his character development in the beginning until inexplicably, we discover that he's more concerned with keeping his son Conner Rooney alive and well than with the fact that he's been stealing from John for years. Essentially, everything we knew about Rooney is discredited and he becomes a laughingstock rather than the dark and dangerous mobster we long to see. It was hard to believe that a man who developed his empire in such a tricky business could go from seemingly not allowing anyone to stand in his way to his ultimate fate in which Michael (Tom Hanks) simply walks up and pulls the trigger just after Rooney asserts that he's glad it had to be him doing the deed.Initially, I was thrilled to see Tom Hanks playing against type as the clever and daring Michael Sullivan. But Sam Mendes and his team didn't give Hanks much to work with. Sullivan doesn't shed a tear for his murdered wife and son and develops a relationship with lone survivor Michael Jr. out of necessity rather than desire. Scenes in which some character development is allowed where Michael Jr. complains of not being the favorite son and he learns to drive with daddy's input at the tender age of 12 are fine but are needed in bulk. I desperately wanted to hear Michael Jr. yell at his father for allowing the deaths of his mother and sibling to occur, for preventing him from attending school, for basically not allowing him to have a normal life, but they never came. You also never hear Sullivan apologize to his son for everything he's done, even after he tells the boy not to feel guilty about his mother and little Peter. It's as though Sullivan feels no remorse. Tom Hanks does what he can which is much more than what the average actor would have brought to the role, but is not able to provide a revelation with what little he has to work with.When Jude Law (Maguire) is brought out midway into the film to wipe out Michael Sullivan, it feels as though Sam Mendes simply begged his team to bring him in to add some needed spark. You can just picture him saying Jude Law was so good in `Artificial Intelligence' and we may as well give him a whirl even though it feels like Law is tacked on to aid in the predictable ending. I enjoyed the cat-and-mouse game in the diner where Sullivan and Maguire are trying to out-wit one another but wasn't so impressed with Maguire's extra income from the pictures of his victims. I've never really gotten the impression that the typical mobster adores the act of killing. My feeling has always been that they do it out of necessity as the dirty part of a dangerous but lucrative line of work. Jude Law's character seems to refute this notion and I simply couldn't buy it.`Road to Perdition' is something I admired but I don't have much desire to see it again and it didn't produce any new breakthroughs into the gangster genre. Conrad Hall's cinematography was thrilling though my heart is still with Todd Haynes beautiful 1957 in 2002 piece `Far From Heaven.' If Sam Mendes had used his brilliant cast more effectively, this could have been the best film of 2002. After awhile though, the constant rain and lack of character development created the downfall of the film. I didn't come away feeling that Michael Sullivan had learned anything new before his tragic end. He was essentially the same man at the end as the beginning, not really wanting a regular job and not really responding properly to the needs of his young son. Still a noble effort and a good follow-up to 'American Beauty.'8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not partial to movies that are potential "downers" or have a favorite actor playing "the bad guy" or against type. However, friends wanted to see it, so I went...wondering how the portrayals by Tom Hanks and Paul Newman would affect me. As we walked out of the theater, the first thing I said was that it was a beautifully shot movie. I was deeply moved by the acting (especially that of Tom Hanks and Paul Newman)but was even more dazzled by the cinematography. When it came time for Oscar nominations, I feared the movie might be overlooked because of its release "early" in the year. I was actually thrilled to see the nomination for Best Cinematography and was happy for Newman's nomination in the Supporting Actor category. Am I the only person who was shocked by the omission of Tom Hanks from the nominations? Don't avoid seeing this movie because of its dark and, at times, violent nature. It is, indeed, beautiful.</fullReview>

Tom Hanks playsMichael Sullivan, a mobster who has chosen his path in life andcannot turn back- but he can save his son. And that's what thisstory is about. Is Sullivan a good guy, or is he evil? Who can say.Jude Law steals his scenes as a truly creepy hitman/ photographer named Maguire. Paul Newman's performance asHanks' boss Mr. Rooney, is more subtle but equally brilliant.Hanks is also great when he plays against type. No more Mr. NiceGuy! I give this film a nine out of ten- the year's second best film,behind only that other great mob movie, Gangs of New York.Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There has been a real mixed response to Road to Perdition and I can see why, but I am annoyed by some of the comments I have read.First of all, Tom Hanks was definitely NOT miscast. Hanks is one of the finest actors in Hollywood at the moment, being unable to put a foot wrong, and it is no different here. His stoic, brutal, near emotionless portrayal of Michael Sullivan is certainly unique in his career (I think!) and perhaps some people have just simply misunderstood why he would do such a thing. I on the other hand think his performance complements the tone and style of the film as a whole perfectly. Road to Perdition is a film that purposefully distances itself from emotion and as a result actually heightens emotion whenever there is any and Hanks' distant cry of anguish upon discovering his dead wife and child is exactly what I'm talking about. The quiver of his lips when he attempts to fend off any feelings and emotions at the critical moment in the breathtaking shootout sequence is perhaps my favourite moment of the film.Some believe that Paul Newman wasn't that good either. That's just ridiculous! His performance is central to the whole movie, having what I believe are the key lines; for example, "natural law: sons are put on this earth to trouble their fathers". Newman is as good an actor now as he has ever been; you really feel for him, having to choose between his real and adopted sons, to come to the reality that blood IS thicker than water. You can sense the anguish that is brooding up within him. It is a performance that really pulls the heart-strings, and in a film that in my opinion mostly aims to make you think rather than feel, I believe it is quite simply awesome, particularly since his final line is a stunner.Most agree that the peripheral performances, and that of Sullivan Jr, are great, and I am no different in that respect. Mendes has brought out from every actor a performance of which they can be proud. I say actor, because there basically are almost no female characters and some people take offence at that. I don't. The film focuses on the father/son relationship and to highlight this issue the script removes nearly all traces of femininity. It is an inspired decision and I have absolutely no problems with it.Road to Perdition itself is a fine movie. It is short on emotion, perhaps a little short on dialogue as well, but all this in no way detracts from the quality of the film. In fact, all this is what makes this such a great movie.While watching the film I thought it was just a little better than average, but nothing spectacular, but like I said, it is a film that makes you think, and the more I think about it, the better it becomes.Visually stunning, brilliantly acted, and mercurially directed, I think Road to Perdition is fantastic. Is it better than The Godfather 1 and 2 or Mendes' American Beauty though? You'll have to decide for yourself, I'm afraid, but I think it's a travesty that it has been ignored by the Oscars, Globes, et al, that it hasn't yet got the recognition which it so rightly deserves. Watch it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, this movie is not bad. The problem is that it is directed by THAT guy (Sam Mendes) who achieved such a success with American Beauty. And the way the things are portrayed in the movie, the atmosphere, even the music resemble his first flick so much that one cannot avoid the comparison. And here it all comes to an conclusion that this movie lacks the ONE thing that makes the American Beauty one of the best movies ever: Clever, strong and realistic story. The story of Road to Perdition is weak and illogical in some points, in other words it is always bad when it is apparent that the things in the movie happen just because otherwise the movie would not make sense at all. The unbelievable characters do not add any points in favor of the movie either. The strength of American Beauty was in its believability, the movie was so stunningly real it made me shiver. I did not have this feeling when watching Road to Perdition, it was replaced by questions like why? and really?I was convinced the whole movie through that I will rate it at 6, however finally I chose to upgrade to 7, for two reasons: First, the music. Thomas Newman, who was also one of the writers of music to American Beauty did a wonderful job here as well. And second was the ending. Although it was quite predictable at least the ending did not screw up the whole movie like it is quite common in Hollywood made movies nowadays.Final word: 7/10 but the story is very weak 5.</fullReview>

As to the artwork part, even it is very different film, but i still enjoy the similarity from Mandes, as in "American beauty": stylish(kind of combination of coldness and emotion), great mise-en-scene and score, even though "Road to Perdition" is more realistic.I also love one of the themes of this movie: the connection between the crime and family value. Some compare this film with the classic Godfather trilogy, of course, Road to Perdition can not be the better one(at least on the story side), but they have the same spirit and idea: the so-called bad guys, the gangsters, are still human, they love, they hate, but actually, they live more harder then the others. they can do most things they want, but they still can do nothing to the fate. You can realize this subject very well through a good movie this this and the Godfather series. i enjoy this when it comes to the ending.8/10 one finest work of Mendes</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply One Of The Finest Films Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is easy to dismiss this film as just another gangster movie. in a way, it is. The plot seems basic enough. However, this is Sam Mendes. This is not a moviewhere the plot is as significant as the message or the presentation.No other gangster movie in history, not even The Untouchables, is ascinematicly perfect as Road To Perdition. Sam Mendes is one of the finestdirectors in the game, and he has only made two feature films. His direction is smooth, giving the effect of curiosity or fear. It is impossible to deny that the technical work is above average. As for the message, this is a movie with quite a few underlying themes. There is the blatant father-son relationship theme, which can be traced back throughgreat literature to the Greek epic Odyssey. Here, it is more potent than in any other gangster movie, save The Godfather. Even the title hints to the theme hints to the theme of a destructive life leading toward a tragic downfall. Sure, that means this will be a dark movie. But the film manages to affect the audience in a dramatic way while also giving them the eye candy and some comedy. In myopinion, that makes this the one fully loaded picture of the year.Of course, a movie this good will inevitably be overlooked by the Academy, like it was by the Globes. Fickle critics have forgotten movies that aren't still right in front of their faces. Regardless of its lost chances, I will not stop expressing how much I believe that this is the one film of the year. this is the Best Picture. I haven't even mentioned how great Tom Hanks is in this role change. Its abouttime he took on a darker role. He, along with a stellar supporting cast, makes this movie work. Hands down, this is the number one movie of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Year's Best!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Mendes, the director of American Beauty, brings us one of the year's finest motion pictures. Starring Tom Hanks, Paul Newman, and Jude Law. Tom Hanks plays a hit-man named Michael Sullivan, Sr., who works for Paul Newman's character, named John Rooney, who heads up an Irish Mafia in Rock Island, Illinois during the depression/prohibition era. One night, Sullivan's oldest son witnesses his father commit murder, and Sullivan makes his son keep it a secret. However, Rooney's son, Connor, who was with Sullivan at the time of the murder, and who is jealous of Rooney's affection for Sullivan, kills Sullivan's wife and youngest son. Michael Sullivan must now take his oldest son, and run away before the mob tries to murder the father and son duo. A deeply moving motion picture about the conflicts between fathers and sons, and about loyalty, Road To Perdition is certainly one of the best movies of 2002. I also have to complement Thomas Newman's score for the film, which really strikes an emotion key at times. It is based on the graphic novel by Max Allan Collins and Richard Piers Rayner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sam Mendes, best directing ***spoiler*** kind of</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I absolutely adored the directing of Sam Mendes. I believe that he will win many awards for making this movie. The acting was superb, Tom Hanks and Paul Newman exquisitely displayed the conflict between each other. This movie was a great story about loyalty. Tom Hanks is torn between the loyalty of his major father-figure Paul Newman, and his son. This flim did not at all exploit the lifestyle of a hitman as most movies do, and the main plot was original, and powerful. This movies questions morality and is very thought-provoking, as morality and loyalty are its major themes. I enjoyed that acting of newcomer Tyler Hoechlin. The conclusion took me completely by surprise..I comepletely about Jude Law being hired as a hitman. I did find the movie very explicit in its graphic nature, however this was necessary in order to display the conflict of Tom Hanks' character. Overall, this was a unique and original film with the classic themes of morality, loyalty, and father and son. I feel that this movie will be underappreciated in the awards category for reasons I do not know..just a feeling</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an excellent gangster film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is much to be said of this film **SPOILERS**The performances are all excelent though jennifer jason liegh is severely underused. Tom Hanks performance will likley be looked upon as one of the most unique and understated of his career and hopefully oscar-nominated. This is one of the emotionally coldest characters he has ever played. Jude Law is amazing as the hired gun, the makeup enhances his just how evil his character is. Paul Newman has one of the most difficult roles as a father torn between his son and his "son". Some of the most powerful scenes belong to him and Hanks. (Spoiler) Tyler Hoechlin plays the most important role as his fate and soul are at the heart of the film. Daniel Craig brings sympathy and depth to a deeply troubled character.(spoilers) Though he is the films chief villian, he is also a man plauged with inner demons as shown at the funeral and his confrontation with Newman after having killed Hanks wife and youngest son.The cinematography blends elements of film noir and gangster drama. The deep shadows splendidly add to the atmosphere of the film. Conrad L Hall has never been better, he and Mendes are the equals of Spielberg and Kaminski in terms of visuals.The adaptation is simply amazing. Having read the graphic novel, i can say that the changes add to the film and detract from the cartoonish violence of the novel though I feel that both are equals in terms of dramatic power and must read by anyone who is a fan of the film. David Self will surly get an oscar nomination and hopefully, the award itself.Mendes directs the film with the confidence of a newly minted oscar winner. His sense of pacecing and atmosphere add to the well written characters of Self's adaptation. Though not as indepth as American Beauty mainly because this film is more plot driven, he perfectly stylizes the film without glorifying it.(Spoilers) The silent shootout involving Paul Newman and Tom Hanks and death of Connor Rooney are perfect examples. He perfectly captures the moody tone of the novel and Self's screenplay. He and Hall have visualized the story perfectly.This film will hopefully join the ranks of "The Godfather" and "Goodfellas" as a classic of the genre.In the end though, dont listen to me, go and see this wonderful film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I give Road to Perdition 2 thumbs up. I read a few reviews on IMDB about this movie, some people were saying Hanks wasn't the actor for this role and that this movie was being over rated. I for one thought Tom Hanks was brilliant in this movie. People have type casted Tom Hanks and now can not see through it. I don't think Robert De Niro or Al Pacino could have played the role better. I really enjoyed Road to Perdition and I highly recommend it. It's the best movie I've seen in a long time. One last thing, to the person who was wondering why Hanks let himself get shot at the end by Jude. It's quit simple, If you had Al Capone after you, you know you're going to die sooner rather than later also Jude was supposedly very good at what he did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great cinematography and great acting from Michael Sullivan Jr</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Road to the PerditionIt's been a long time ago since I saw a Tom Hanks' movie, I believe the last one was "You've got Mail" , but it wasn't that great. I haven't seen "Cast Away" yet. It's also been a long time since Tom Hanks has made movies, but finally thid movie is featuring him as main character. Sam Mendes has honored many times because of "American Beauty", I've ever seen that film either,but I will do after seeing this.I choose this film because of old golden boy, Paul Newman. One of the greatest actors of the 20th century and you don't often get the opportunity to see a movie with these two great actors together. So I thought, what could I lose?, so the adventure of "The Perdition" began.Cast: 1. Tom Hanks: Michael Sullivan, 2. Jude Law: Harlen Maguire, 3. Paul Newman: John Rooney, 4. Jennifer Jason Leigh: Annie Sullivan...Story: This story took place around 30's in the USA. A time of corruption and money... Corruption, money and murder are also the main subjects in this film. John Rooney, an old "Don Corleone", Mafia man is the head of a corrupt family. His "son" Michael Sullivan helps him to murder people who want to endanger the plans of the family. But ONCE it goes totally wrong. Annie (Michael's wife) and Peter (his son) are murdered by companions of John Rooney. He has to get away with his son Michael Jr. You get two hours of the love that a father could have for his son, the danger to stay alive, the suspense of every step they make and the wonderful screen images, which were extraordinary. I loved every scene, it was rather predictable, but it was a good movie... the greatest actor was Tyler H. (Michael Sullivan) he did a wonderful job.Oscars: would I give Oscars to this movie? Yes, I would for best cinematography and for best supporting actor, Paul Newman... But I think two Oscars are enough for this movie... This movie is a mixture of 70S' movies.. there are a lot of scenes referring to other filmmakers, especially John Ford. Rating: 9/10 or *** 1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A family killed by mafia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Hanks have always been very convincingly actor and Paul Newman too, but never seen any of them as mafia men. "Road to perdition" gives the opportunity to see both acting together in a very tough and bloody film. Too much blood shed in such a film, which shows something that may have happened during In depression-Era in Chicago, when alcohol was a real business. The plot has nothing new, except good acting of Hanks, Newman and the boy Tyler Hoechlin in the role of Hanks'son. But the lesson of the film is interesting and useful, the boy was always with his father during the prosecution by mafia groups and once his father was killed he learned that violence and hate do not bring you to the right track. It was interesting when Newman said to Hanks that mafia is a business, and naturally some may die, i.e. be killed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Bad, but Predictable!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers: "Road to perdition" is a portrait of a killing. More than the confrontation between two generations separated by honor and truth - The movie is a look at the relationship between parents and children. It was nice to see Tom Hanks and Paul Newman together because they're both good actors. This movie takes place in Chicago, 1931, and is narrated by a 12-year-old boy who finds out that the true work of his father, Michael Sullivan, is a mob hitman. Orphaned and poor, Sullivan is sheltered by Rooney, the head of the mob, as if he were another of his children. But it is Rooney's true son, Conner, who becomes a bloody beast; he is the one who unleashes one of the most dangerous scenes in the film.As a father, despite his work, he struggles until the end to make his son happy and not follow his steps, because he wants the best for him. While the movie may be slow-paced; it still has some unforgettable characters like the psychopathic photographer (played by Jude Law) who is hired to find and kill Tom Hanks. When you hear a plot like the one for this film, it can be easy for a person to guess the ending. The ending was a disappointment, and I was expecting something more from it. Overall, it's not a bad movie and it can be very enjoyable, but the predictability of the story may ruin the experience. 6/10</fullReview>

The plot is Gladiator-esque: A trusted lieutenant finds himself hunted and entails to take down the system that he once was a part of. On a deeper level, there is supposed to be a story about a boy learning to love his estranged father, but this never really gels. Nevertheless, relatively solid film making,although this is definitely a s-l-o-w movie. Don't go in sleepy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sam Mendes surpasses all my expectations with this film. American Beauty was a spectacular "feast" of visuals and emotions yet IMHO Perdition surpasses it. The cinematography is stunning and makes simple things like cars into luscious eye candy. Mendes also does an incredible job with setting up some truely unique shots. The scene in which we get the perspective of young sullivan watching his father kill is very intense and captures an amazing sense of fear which the child would be experiencing. The shootout in the rain is a scene I don't feel I even have to explain to you how beautiful and creative it is. The acting is great and Hanks does a good job pulling off a difficult role of a very emotionless man. A few plot points seem a bit weak but with Mendes directing these are easily ignored. The plot also has a nice depth to it as it is one of the movies you can discuss a lot latter with all of it's side stories and elements, such as Sullivan and Rooney being more father/son then Rooney was with his bio son. All in all this is an amazingly orchaestrated movie and I believe anyone who considers themself a movie fan can appreciate it. ****/****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Powerful, poignant movie is sort of like "Unforgiven" mob version. One minor but glaring fault is the scene of shootout between Sullivan and Maguire. When Maguire was down holding his face, Sullivan did not finish him off. Sullivan was a merciless killer and always "cleaned up" throughout the film. There is NO WAY he would leave Maguire alive to be a threat to him and his son. I know the director needs Maguire to tie up the loose ends (Sullivan) at the end, but he should come up with a better sequence.</fullReview>

This may not be the best mob film ever made, if that is the marketing claim, but it's certainly in a different league from the rest of the dreck we are served in 2002 and is well worth your admission price! 6 out of 10----but hey, I'm the guy who gives the first installment of "Lord of the Rings" 3 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pray for Michael Sullivan. Pray he gets a better script next time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`Road to Perdition' is a gangster movie. Tom Hanks is Michael Sullivan, a gangster working for John Rooney (Paul Newman). He has a nice little family where the kids are unaware of what daddy does for a living, despite some homely moments where they question him. Unfortunately one of his sons, Michael Jr. (Tyler Hoechlin), sees him on the job. Rooney is worried what this might do if Michael Jr. spills the beans. what happens next! Go see the movie!Firstly credit to Hanks. About time he tried a character with more grit as opposed to the lily-livered roles he normally adopts. He works quite well as an efficient murderer whose only true love is his family (whom he has grown distant from - what do you think the chances are that he gets closer over the movie as he learns a valuable moral lesson?) He's not 100% convincing - he looks too charming - but he almost gets there. Hoechlin, as the young frightened son, is quite good and Newman fits into his role as sad, old, man with aplomb. No problems with the cast here..However Mr. Script has a lot to answer for. How are you doing Mr. Script? You're a bit obvious and cliché ridden aren't you? Perhaps this is because of the movie's graphic novel roots, but I felt let down here. The ending, for example, is heavy-handed and extremely obvious to any casual viewers of cinema. The moralising and family values segments are too limp and uninspired - there's only one inevitable course of action and that's the root the film takes. There's also the anvil-subtlety of the dual meaning of the film's title. While the actors do good jobs with their parts, their characters are often feeling a bit flat, trying to add depth solely through a tenuous `family' thread that runs in the movie. It means there's a lack of suspense in the movie and that's not good.What is good is Mendes direction. In fact it's very good. There's one particular scene, towards the end of the movie (so I can't reveal it), where there is a superb use of lighting and sound to highlight a particularly eventful moment. The movie - it's a periodical - looks the part throughout, with good costumes and scenery. There's some nice directorial touches in the movie (corridor viewpoints, etc.) and Mendes once more has a beautiful score that recalls his work on `American Beauty' (well it would - same composer). The pacing is generally spot on, and there's no real flaws here that I could detect that upset me from a production point of view.So `Road to Perdition' stands out because it's made nicely. If it had had a better script than it did, it would have been a very good movie. As it is, the forced characters and thin plotting lets it down. Still one of the best of the crop in a very weak year for movies. 7.0/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS***Okay, am I one of only 20 people in the world that love this movie?I have nothing bad to say about this movie. Mendes has done it again, this time even more movingly and compellingly. I give kudos to all the actors! Hanks does a splendid job portraying Michael Sullivan, a hit man for gangster John Rooney, played by Newman, who also does a wonderful job. Sullivan's son is played by Tyler Hoechlin, whom I believe has made an amazing breakthrough appearance, and this is not the last time we will be seeing him.*SPOILERS* This movie has many intricate details which I believe should be taken to heart in order to fully appreciate this film. In the opening scene, Michael Sullivan, Jr. is seen riding his bike in a crowd of people - only, if you notice (and its hard not to), he's riding against the flow. This detail may seem minor, but it foreshadows the fact that he will have to face many issues and events head on, some of which he will have to deal with completely by himself, even without his father. Also to take into consideration: when Maguire (Jude Law) gets sliced and diced by the broken vase, one can only assume that he is NOT invincible and will eventually reach his downfall. Film noir is also a key element in this film, with the car driving off in the dark, the dark bicycle in the snow, dimly lit up only for a second, and the tommy-gun surrounded by the shadows and rain. No, this isn't a light movie, and much of the elements used to make this film have not been used for a long, long time, and they are all worth noticing and fully appreciating, which only adds to the glamour of this movie. That is, if you have the guts to get over your superficial visions that this is a "horrible, boring movie" and see it as one of the greatest movies of all time.IMHO, everyone needs to stop bashing Hanks for playing his role "heartlessly". Excuse me, the man was just given the AFI LIfe Achievement Award!!! He's got to have a little heart in everything he does, don't you think? He also should have the ability to act his roles beyond the level of any he has ever attemted to portray... I applaud him at his wonderful performance of playing a cold, dark, evil hit man, only to be mirrored by his unconditional love for his son. The fact that he does *yes, he really does* portray a murderous gangster who must fight outer battles as well as inner battles proves that the man can't be typecast - something that as a fellow Actor I understand!!! It can only help to prove that you are well rounded enough to play any role, no matter what you've done in the past. His superb balance of coldness, fury, humor, and love deserves nothing than a nomination from the Academy.The story itself is wonderful - a hit man gets in too deep when his son sees him doing his job, only to come home one night and find he has lost his wife and a son. Father and son then set out to save themselves, which ultimately becomes a bonding experience, with or without the bank robberies or running. Being able to see a "heartless" gangster character with so much love and emotion for his family and closest friends is a stirring, gut-wrenching balance that is fresh and new, and should be noticed by all who watch this movie.I recommend this movie to everyone who wants a fresh change. I found it simply marvelous, and I will go see it again. If you pay attention to the story and the details that make it so wonderful, you won't go home dissapointed and you will find that its some of the best money spent in a while. 10/10</fullReview>

This is a tragedy, not a rollercoaster ride or a twists-a-plenty thriller. It's not what happens but why and how that's important here Shakespeare is also predictable. Would you come out and say his Works are unworthy too? If yes, perhaps you walked in the wrong movie.

		<fullReview>I guess, most of you have seen some gangster movies...at least "The Godfather". This movie is quite original, as in I haven't seen one like it...maybe there is, but for me it was original. All children usually have as models their parents, especially the father...but what if he is a gangster...what then? Tom Hanks is one of the best actors of our days, so this was actually the main reason why I went to the movie. Of course, more great actors play in the movie: Paul Newman, Jude Law and Stanley Tucci. Michael Sullivan(Tom Hanks) is the gangster I was talking about above. He works for John Rooney(Paul Newman), who has actually been like a father for him. One night, as he goes to do "some business", his son, also named Michael, hides in the car, and spies on his father. He sees something no one would like to see, and so he has to swear he won't talk to anyone about it. Some people are more suspicious than others, and so it comes that Sullivan's family gets murdered, but, luckily, the murderer doesn't kill the right son. After this Michael and his father drive away from their former home, and Sullivan starts thinking about revenge. The rest of the movie is quite logically, the fight for revenge. As I said, the actors are very, very good...Jude Law, who is assigned to kill Sullivan and his son, acts very good, and he certainly was "the man for the job". Michael Jr.(Tyler Hoechlin) is also a great actor, and surely one who might become a well known actor in show business. Certainly, this movie is different, and in a good way. It displays a very serious "problem", but, unfortunately, the action develops pretty slow. If "Road to Perdition" would've been more exciting, it could've been a perfect contender for an Academy Award. Still, I believe this movie will be nominated at some categories, so we'll have to keep our eyes peeled at the nominees list. I think everyone should see the movie, because it is worth it and it deserves more attention than it has received. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SLIGHT SPOILERS*** This movie is like a beautiful scenery painting. Beautiful but nothing out of ordinary. This movie was well directed and acted... It had some irrelevant scenes but it didn't matter. The biggest problem of this movie is the lack of personality. SPOILERS Tom Hanks is a killer whose son sees him killing a guy. Tom's son needs to be killed so they massacre the family but the boy survives. They need to get rid of Tom. Since the beginning you could foresee what was going to happen. There were no surprises in the movie. Not even the ending which I think was quite over soppy. Actually the only reason why I didn't walk out of the theatre was the fact that Jude Law was pretty amusing. I study arts and photographing is my favourite subject. So I kinda started to feel sympathy for him.This movie was beatiful but nothing more than a one drop in the pool of forgettable movies 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great movie. This is a film that doesn't have any bad screenplay scenes nor bad acting. Tom Hanks should get his third oscar for this role. I just watched Forrest Gump few days before I saw Road To Perdition and it just made me smile how good actor is Hanks. Of course this motion picture isn't made for everyone and people should know do they like movies like Charlies Angels or movies like Road To Perdition. 10/10 a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Road To Perdition is a gripping story about choices and their sometimes terrible consequences.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is the dark story of how Michael Sullivan, a mafia boss's hitman played superbly by Tom Hanks, is found out by his young son, played masterfully by Tyler Hoechlin. Before the boy, also called Michael, witnesses a hit carried out by his father he knows little about his father's work. In the mafia backlash that follows both are forced to leave their home and go on the run. The film uses the mafia backdrop to spin an incredible, sometimes funny and always tragic story, about the choices father and son make. In accepting the charity of crime boss John Rooney, played by Hollywood legend Paul Newman, Sullivan chose a life of bloodshed and inevitable guilt, all justified by the fact that he can keep his family in the way they are accustomed. Sullivan's twisted morality means that his work is not personal, just what he has to do to keep his family. But what is evident throughout the enthralling film is how Sullivan is adamant that his son is not going to be sucked into the same lifestyle ? a fast track on the road to hell. Rooney's choices, too, have their deadly consequences. His love obviously lies for his adopted son, Sullivan, and not his real life son, Connor, played by a jealous Daniel Craig. Jude Law is well-used as the contract killer Harlan `The Reporter' Maguire who, despite not being introduced until half-way through the film is used effectively as Sullivan's nemesis. While killing is a necessity for Sullivan, it's a joy for Maguire. The film opens, and closes, with the boy standing on the beach and assessing whether his father was one of the best men to have lived, in his unswerving loyalty to his family, or one of the most evil, in his effective work aptitude. The decision has to be made by the audience. Director Sam Mendes deserves an Oscar for the sombre mood pulled off as raindrops bounce of fedora rims during the film's climactic showdown. A film full of unexpected surprises.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For all of you who have been taken in by the hype, this is by no means a masterpiece, not even a particularly good film. It looks good, granted, stage is magnificent (and costly), loads of extras in first class costumes, but it feels very superficial and never once touches the viewer (at least not this particular one). Hanks is about as credible as Woody Allen would be playing James Bond, to quote an Icelandic reviewer this week. Paul Newman gets very little screen time, although he is used to flog this to the audience. The story is pointless to relate here, for starters everybody already knows it (Tom Hanks' first time as bad guy... etc.) and besides, you couldnt care less about the characters and what happens to them.For me, it's a flop.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never saw a better Tom Hanks!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew that Tom Hanks was a good actor, which is the main reason I decided to watch the movie. I could not really identify neither with the time the movie was set nor with the topic of it. Inspite of this and because my boyfriend dragged me to I went to the movies to watch it and to my surprise I liked it! Of course, Tom Hanks and Paul Newman were the main factors why I changed my mind, I have never seen a better Tom Hanks in my life. Michael Sullivan alias Tom Hanks moved me deeply. He touched me in a way only a few characters in a movie were able to touch me. The atmosphere of the movie is as unique as its actors. It is melancholic, depressive and nevertheless it is beautiful and very romantic. If you are interested in either Tom Hanks or the theme of the movie I can only recommend it to you. It is worth the time. Sam Mendes is an extremely talented director. He shows us feelings and emotions of people who are thought to be emotionless. We feel with the characters and they touch us in a way, which is unbelievable. Even Michael Sullivan Jr. character, played by Tyler Hoechlin, is very convincing and the young actor does a very good job in this movie. I can only advise you to judge for yourself. Take Your time and enjoy the unique atmosphere of this movie and the genial performance of Tom Hanks!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without being melodramatic, this harrowing tale of a father-and-song sharply touches audiences' heart. Without too many action scenes, this revenge plot delivers high tension. "Road To Perdition" is dark but beautiful, simple but haunting, and masculine but emotional. The scene where Michael Sullivan Jr. suddenly hugs his senior after they have a conversation is very real and heart-wrenching. Tom Hanks shows his greatest performance here without too much of an action. He delivers the persona of Michael Sullivan successfully. Paul Newman as John Rooney is the great ... as usual. But the very important performance to notice is Tyler Hoechlin's. Perfect script, and perfect cinematography by the great Conrad Hall. More than just an Oscar-grabber ... it's an all-time classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The scene in the trailer showing a busy street scene in 1930s Chicago is what tempted me to see this film and from that point of view I wasn't disappointed. Those who designed and built the sets deserve 10 out 10 for their work. Apart from the Chicago street scenes, I also loved the roadside diner and the hotel interiors. The casting is also good, with the exception of Tom Hanks who is fairly wooden (not that that is unusual). But there are big problems with the story line which is highly predictable and full of cliches (the ending is one of the worst). However, for me the visuals fully compensate for the groans and tedium of the script.</fullReview>

And all in a quest to get permission to kill another guy? Also, Jude Law seems to be able to track him down at diners in the middle of nowhere, but they don't check on his wife's sister's house? The scene where he mows down John Rooney (Paul Newman) and his entourage is beautifully shot, but it was as unbelievable as the ending was predictable. I gave it a 6/10.

		<shortDescription>The first good gangstermovie in ages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the better '30's gangster movies in ages. Paul Newman, with his beautiful "old man" blue eyes give you just a creepy feeling. Tom Hanks gives you a great feeling of "I'm doing this, but god knows why cause I hate it." as Mike Sullivan. Every sentence that comes out of his mouth just let's you know he doesn't like his job with mister Rooney. (This isn't a spoiler is it?) Paul Newman really fills the screen with authority and I really liked Jude Law with his strange quirk. Even the "feel" of the film is perfect as everything makes you believe your looking at the 1930's The problem is, it's been done, and probably better. Old black and white movies just have an edge that you can't duplicate. Maybe if we didn't have so much "Chicago gangster" movies already (and I've seen a lot of them) I would appreciate the picture more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great Irish mob movie plus tragic father-son story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After many years of Italian mob movies by great directors like Scorcese and TV series like the Sopranos (all of which are very popular in Ireland) it is interesting to see an irish perspective on the depression-era mob scene. It is about this time that the powerful Irish mob families who had been operating since the Irish arrived in the US in the 1840's gave way to the more newly arrived Italian Mafia. Paul Newman and Tom Hanks both perform magnificantly as the Crime Boss and his righthand man respectively.The story shows how the closely knit relationships between the members of the crime family become strained against the blood relationships of the gang members to their own families. In particular the adopted father-son relationship between the Michael Sullivan (Hanks) and John Rooney (Newman) versus the blood relationship between Rooney and his son Connor. Loyalty, insecurity, jealousy, greed and the old stalwort of the mob movies - extreme violence - all come into play to make a fascinating examination of a the strengths and weaknesses of the lead characters and how they are lead down the road to perdition ("perdition" meaning total destruction).Well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An American Classic Waiting to Happen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an American classic waiting to happen. I'm sure it will gather a number of Oscars when the time comes, and I would have to say Best Cinematography is obvious. The strength of this film is its look. Every shot, every frame is a picture postcard, beautiful in its own grim, dark way. Not a weak performance in the entire film. I haven't seen a film in a long time that so perfectly captures old style movie-making as this film did. There was no music-video styled editing, it felt so much like a drama that had been produced in the 1970s, the decade when Hollywood truly tackled the grim reality of consequence. I'm writing this in October 2002, and although the year is nearly at an end, this is by far the only film I've seen this year, thus far, that feels like a 'Best Picture'. Wonderful, wonderful atmosphere. As I said, it's a classic waiting to happen, the only thing that needs to happen to it now is the passage of time for people to look back and remember it.</fullReview>

This wasn't a slick action movie but rather a work of substance portraying how easy it is to commit one's loyalty to another for reasons of survival. Sooner or later corruption erodes, then destroys the soul.The ending was masterful. It would have been easy to make it sentimental or the boy's character vengeful.

		<fullReview>Ignore all reviews telling you this film is inferior toMendes' 'American Beauty'. It is superior! In my opinion 'The Simpsons' is a far more ascerbic commentary of your 'average' middle-class, Middle-West American family (seriously!). 'Road To Perdition', on the other hand, is a stunningly lensed, powerfully acted tale of complex human relationships. Tom Hanks gives a wonderfully physical performance. Our first view of him, a shot through the doorway of his home, wearily removing his jacket and watch as he prepares to join his family for dinner, movingly conveys from the outset the inner sadness of this compromised man. Paul Newman, in what doesn't add up to much more than a cameo role, magnetically holds your attention in every scene in which he appears. An unashamed Mob boss, he nevertheless elicits our sympathy in his fatherly love for Michael Sullivan This remarkable actor has now surely joined the ranks of the very finest that Hollywood has ever produced. The photography has been universally praised; each shot is breath-taking. Most memorable is the scene where Hanks guns down Newman and his co-horts. The sillhouetted figures seem to float ghost-like amidst the gray misty spray sent up by torrential rain. Mendes brilliantly chooses to shoot this scene in complete silence adding immeasurably to the effect of doom-ridden inevitability. All-in-all, one of the most satisfying cinematic experiences I have had for a very long time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant, believable and a strong plot makes this the best movie this millennium. Another Gold Oscar for Hanks coming up again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With such actors as Tom Hanks and Paul Newman, this movie met with all expectations and then some. Brilliant acting, marvellous photography, a strong plot line and period costumes, makes this the best movie in a heck of a long time.The story takes place in 1931, when Al Capone and Frank Nitty ruled the gangsters in Chicago during the depression. Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) is a hitman for a top crime boss, one level below that of the enforcer, Frank Nitty. Known as the Angel Of Death, Sullivan is a perfect husband and provider for his wife and family, yet is a true and loyal employee for his boss John Rooney (Paul Newman). After a wake for a dead member of Rooney's gang, the dead man was wrongfully blamed for siphoning off money from the mob and his brother threatened to tell all. John Rooney had his son Connor Rooney(Daniel Craig) and Michael Sullivan to go around and talk some sense into the dead man's brother but no harm was to befall him. Connor Rooney who had aspirations of taking over Chicago after his aging father John was gone, was responsible for an unauthorised killing. This killing was witnessed by Michael Sullivan Jnr who was all but 12 years old. Fearing that the boy might talk, Connor Rooney took it upon himself to make sure that no witnesses were left alive. He went around to the Sullivan house and killed Michael's wife and younger son. Fearing for his life, Sullivan contacted Frank Nitty for advice and protection. Loyalty and power then became the prime force in the direction of the movie and what ensued. Nitty sent another hired hitman, Harlen Maguire (Jude Law) to kill Michael Sullivan Snr and Jnr. In the meantime revenge for his family's murder, Sullivan and his son went on a six week spree, fleecing payoff money from the mob and killing all those responsible for the killings. Sullivan also revealed to John Rooney, that it was in fact his son Connor, that was ripping off the mob and building a future empire for himself. What happened in those six weeks was quite graphic with several poignant scenes between Michael Sullivan and his surviving son.Definitely a story not to be missed as it will keep you guessing all the time as to who will betray who next, who is loyal to whom and who will be next to die. Solid and believable characters with a strong plot makes for a gripping movie with another Oscar awaiting Tom Hanks for his role as Michael Sullivan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although the audience maybe expected a different kind of style from Sam Mendes, the methods he adapted for this classical gangster movie were successfully used. The narration worked fine, and the movie runs smoothly and doesn't make the viewer wish anything else than it to be longer. Although the ending was predictable, it was the natural consequence of the life of Tom Hanks' character, and seems reasonable considering the rest of the story. Some people maybe a somewhat more original and surprising ending, but it wouldn't work in this kind of movie, and therefore I disagree with the users criticizing it.My personal expectation of the story was that it would be more similar to that of the Godfather movies. But in The Road to Perdition the focus is based entirely on the themes of revenge and the ties between a father and his son. It is not a romantic mob movie with big family parties and dinners in mansions in Sicilly, but a different kind of movie that I would dare say hasn't been made before. I found it interesting to make parallel portrayals of father/son relationships, with such crucial consequences as in The Road to Perdition.Several unforgettable scenes are still printed in my mind, even though I write this three weeks after watching the movies. Some great ideas and interesting cinematographic techniques went into creating the great atmosphere and special tempo found in the many violent scenes of the movie. This makes it a special experience and is reason enough to see it.The only thing I missed was a better portrayal of the relationship between Conner and John Rooney as this is an important element of the movie, and lacks some depth. But apart from that the movie is a gem and a MUST-SEE. Definitely an Oscar candidate and deserves its spot in the Top 250 list here at IMDB. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like so many other really great movies, there are so many who simply cannot SEE the greatness. I disagree that this is a gangster movie. THE GODFATHER is a gangster movie, this is a psychological profile of gangsters. In no way comparable to the epic nature of THE GODFATHER, it is as good a film in its own right. That Mendes in his second attempt could have come up with a piece of sheer brilliance like this is quite extraordinary. I actually preferred this to AMERICAN BEAUTY, great though THAT was!I would venture to suggest that this is one of Hanks' most memorable and intense performances. As stand-over man Frank Sullivan his position with Irish crime boss John Rooney is severely compromised when his son finds himself in the exact right place at the total wrong time. Newman, also playing against his conventional role-type is mesmerising. At times he is chilling. It is quite his best performance from his latter-day period. Jude Law as serially disturbed hit-man Maguire just about steals the show and one is left wishing he had had more screen time. The scene with Hanks in the diner especially is just one of those magic moments in cinema.But where the film is propelled into greatness is in the direction itself, the attention to detail and the simply stunning cinematography and art-direction. Mendes chooses settings of dark solitude, sombre countryside and bleak precipitation. I don't believe I have ever seen a film so powerfully directed and envisioned. I can however well understand why some may find it "slow going" and "unenthralling" Obviously, it wasn't made for you people was it? A user-rating of 8.2 would suggest however that maybe you missed something? I feel impelled to comment additionally on the complete idiot who wrote in all seriousness that "despite the weak dialog it was an alright film." That is tantamount to writing that the Cistine chapel has a few good wall paintings!This is the best film I have seen for a long long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Firstly, what a great title this movie has. ?Road to Perdition' sounds cool and in this film has both a literal meaning, as it's a town near Chicago that some of the characters head towards, and a metaphorical meaning, as some of the characters are indeed on the road to Hell.A great title and a great movie: this will be one of the big nominees at next year's award ceremonies. It is a gangster movie, but, like all the best gangster movies, it is more of a story about family and friends than crime itself. Tom Hanks plays Michael Sullivan, an enforcer for his surrogate father John Rooney (Paul Newman), the head of an Irish-American crime syndicate during the Great Depression. His eldest son Michael junior (Tyler Hoechlin), curious to see what his father does for a living, sneaks along on a job and witnesses John Rooney's vicious son Connor (Ian Craig) kill a man. As a result the Sullivans go on the run, with hired hitman Harlen Maguire on their trail.This is a movie dominated by quiet, character-building moments punctuated by sudden violence. It is full of atmosphere and tension, and does require an attention span, though there are also a surprising amount of funny moments in the middle. The acting is top-notch throughout: Craig is truly nasty, the 78 year old Newman is still an acting legend and Hanks, though I am not as big a fan as the Academy, is a master of playing a good man going through tough times. His Michael Sullivan is more than a reprise of his character in ?Saving Private Ryan' though, as Hanks gives Sullivan an aura of menace that reminds you that though this man a good father, he is also a very good killer. And then there is Jude Law, who is one of the finest and most versatile actors on the planet. I've seen him play a spoilt gay aristocrat, a moody playboy, an android gigolo, a heroic Russian sniper and now a psychotic assassin with thinning hair, a gangly walk and bad teeth. In each role he has been excellent. He's almost worth the price of admission to a movie by himself, even if you're not female.?Road to Perdition' ?s greatest asset though is the cinematography. The movie was based on a graphic novel, which may have helped cinematographer Conrad L. Hall and director Sam Mendes (?American Beauty') compose such an exquisite series of images. A room full of people in dark clothes barricaded behind pale grey newspapers. A bike illuminated by headlights, lying like a black skeleton in the snow. An old man standing perfectly still in the middle of a road as other men die around him. Without exaggeration, this is one of the best looking movies I have ever seen. As a whole the movie is not quite as great as it tries to be and the final quarter is not up to the standard of what has gone before, but the cinematography alone would make it one of the outstanding films of the year. It has been said that it is the best gangster film since the first two ?Godfather' movies and, while I would not say it is a better movie than ?Once Upon A Time in America' or ?GoodFellas', it is excellent.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than Beauty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The latest film from Sam Mendes, Road To Perdition, at its core, is a story of relationships between fathers and sons, whether by blood or by choice. It's a story of what men do, why they do what they do, and how it affects those around them, particularly those that they love.Sam Mendes made a big splash in 1999 with his first film, American Beauty. That film was a story of modern, dysfunctional relationships and how we deal with the world that's presented to us. This looks at that same concept through the 1920's. Tom Hanks' character, Michael Sullivan, has been forced to become a heavy for Paul Newman's mob boss, John Rooney. When his son witnesses the killing of a bootlegger who's supposedly been skimming off the top, he's forced to make a decision about his choice of profession and how it affects those around him.Road To Perdition started its life as a graphic novel by Max Allan Collins and Richard Piers Rayner. The great cinematographer, Conrad L. Hall (who won an Oscar for the cinematography on American Beauty), chose to keep the picture very similar to this style. There is very little camera movement throughout the picture. There's the occasional dolly move, just to liven things up, but for the most part, it's a series of stationary shots. In addition to preserving the graphic novel look of the film, it ties it to those great gangster movies of the period. They couldn't move the camera, because it shook too much. For Conrad Hall, this shows off his gift for framing and storytelling with a single shot. It becomes a series of moving photographs, one of those classic portraits from the era that's eerily sprung to life.Road To Perdition's best surprises are left unspoiled. That's not to say that there's not a definite road that the story is taking. It's always heading to a specific point, in a bookend method similar to American Beauty. And like its older brother, this doesn't spoil your enjoyment.My sister saw this movie the same night I did and had a very opposite reaction. It's not surprising. This isn't a movie made for women to enjoy. (Not to say that women can't enjoy Road To Perdition, lest I scare all my readers away.) This is a movie like Field of Dreams, that all men can identify with. All men have been Michael Sullivan, Jr. at one point or another. We've all had our hero's picture of our father tarnished. We find that our fathers are merely human. We can only hope the consequences of this revelation don't affect the rest of our lives, as it did to Michael's son.</fullReview>

Tom is Tom- Very good at what he does. The boy is great. You really get under his skin and see his turmoil. Jude is probably the best and most under-used actor in the film. His role is fleshed out by a genuine character actor's performance, whereas Tom and Paul play different angles of themselves. Even Jude's gait and stance are unique from any of his previous roles. The score is unmistakably Tom Newman. How can a man use mandolins in every movie and still get away with it? The film is shot very well and totally transports you to 1930's rural America. It is darkly shot and moody. The father and son bond is dealt with compassion and humour- A great balance. The diner scene with Jude and Tom is excellent and way too short. Just like Al and Bob in Heat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WHEN PAUL MET TOM</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film that deserves praise indeed. From the opening reel, as a viewer, you become engaged with the whole ride as all thesps surpass their normal performances to produce what maybe argued the best movie of 2002. The story, which is very simple and age old, is a tale of slightly bad man (Michael Sullivan/Tom Hanks), works for badder man (John Rooney/Paul Newman), gets involved in a chain of events involving son (Michael Jnr./Tyler Hoechlin), which culminates in the former losing his wife and younger son in the bargain. Our Tom becomes the proverbial loose cannon and hits the titled road with junior, escaping the clutches of vile hit man, Harlen Maguire (a very impressive Jude Law). The film is very well directed, as the pace of the movie is just right and it serves a welcome reminder to Hollywood that Mr. Mendes is not a flash in the pan with this follow up to the great American Beauty. Tom Hanks underplays Sullivan to perfection (no Forrest Gump here), Paul Newman is probably due a Best Supporting Oscar, come what March '03 to go along side his Lifetime Award and the Best Actor for Color of Money (1986). Enjoy the film and if anybody and I mean anybody, tells you that it's like The Godfather, then he/she has seen a very different version of Copolla's classic that I know and love. Get on the Road!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The biggest problem with the Road to Perdition is the film makers attitude. They convinced themselves that this was a classic film even before the cameras rolled. Also, the success of it relies on two things: good cinematography and star power. By star power, I don't mean acting talent, because I thought that very little acting talent was on display here.The direction was, "OK guys, take as much time you want saying your lines. We're making a serious movie here, dammit!"Cliche after cliche. And the biggest one was the most damning: the last scene where everyone thinks the movie's over with a happy ending. Then bang. Good Lord, couldn't they have staged it differently?With that said, there's nothing more to do but sit back and wait for the Oscar campaign. Because we all know, there's no bigger Oscar beggar than Tom Hanks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No way can Sam Mendes be as good as this.... He has done two movies, both mind blowing (American Beauty and now Road to Perdition). I am amazed! This movie deserves quite a few Oscars- Best Actor (Hanks), Best Supporting Actor (Newman), Best Screenplay, Best Direction.... so many! Even the boy who plays Michael Sullivan Jr (I forget his name) should get a nod for his fabulous performance. This movie is 100% mind blowing. I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since I saw it. Honestly, in my opinion it is better than the Godfather when it comes to gangster films, and certainly one of my top five movies ever!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A small point in passing.There are lots of comments on here about Tom Hanks being miscast. He isn't. He's cast against type.It's an important distinction. A director should never miscast an actor. But casting against type is a good way of helping the audience understand a character: casting Tom Hanks against type shows that Mike Sullivan isn't naturally the man his job requires him to be.Overall, a great cinema experience. Sure it's depressing and bloody, but it's beautifully and thought-provokingly depressing and bloody.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It should be up for an Oscar but not a great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Road to Perdition is not the normal Tom Hanks movie. If anything this is kind of like an anti-Hanks role.The cast is good to outstanding. Jude Law leads the way which is as of now a for sure runner in Best Supporting Actor. Paul Newman also handles his lines well although his most powerful scene is probably the one he speaks the least in. Jennifer Jason Leigh is kind of wasted here. Her character doesn't really do anything. And Tom Hanks is good but not at his best but still very good.The movie follows Mike Sullivan (Hanks) and his oldest boy as they seek revenge against John Rooney's (Newman) son for what he did to the wife and young son. Sullivan is not the type of mob guy who thinks he is somehow just in a biz like anyone else, he just uses bullets once and a while. No, Sullivan and Rooney realize that they are the bad guys. The difference is Rooney is doing it because it is what gives him money and power. Sullivan character does it more because he feels loyal to Rooney from what Rooney had and is giving him. Well, it becomes a sort of cat and mouse game with the bounty hunter played by Jude Law out to get Sullivan before he gets the younger Rooney.The problem I have with the movie is that I never feel any closeness to the characters. They all feel far away. What keeps this movie from just sinking into a puddle of coldness from which there would be no return is Conrad L. Hall. The cinematographer. Wow, he is just amazing. His shots give us coldness when we need but the beauty of his work keeps, at least me, from getting to pushed away from just disliking this movie.So, I think Hall &amp; Law should be up for Oscars and I think the movie is decent but the script and acting create a distance from the viewer and made me sort of lose interest towards the end. 7 out of 10.Also, check out the silent rain scene. You'll know what I'm talking about once you see it. Now that is a classic scene.</fullReview>

This is definately in the brilliant Hanks film bracket as so many of his film are but what strikes me about Road to Perdition is that apart from the great acting from all the cast the direction is fantastic. Without going into what the film is about this film look so fantastic. Some would say it is a little dark and maybe even depressing but i would say forget that. If you like a film with a brilliant story, fantastic acting, brilliant direction and heartbreaking then this is for you. Its not all action in fact the first half hour could be described as a little slow but this can be forgiven because this without doubt will be one of the best films you will see all year. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow what can i say about this film? Well its a nice simple straightforward film. Its about a mafia enforcer Mike Sullivan (Tom Hanks) who goes on the run with his surviving son after the people he works for, kills off his family. The film follows us thru to how about he plans to dish out revenge and his relationship with his son on the road. It did good to show the natural inquisitiveness of a young boy and to justify the way things went. Tom Hanks does superbly in portraying Michael Sullivan, i was skeptical that he would be able to pull it off but he did it and it has cemented for me that hes a fantastic actor who can play any role he wants. His kid in the film also does a great job. Paul Newman was suberb in it also, bringing to the film his years of honed experience into this film, and those eyes. The film has a nice Irish/mafia theme to it and brings all the trimmings. Jude Law does good to portray a evil quirky bounty hunter. Forget what others say so they dont overhype it for u or put u off seeing it, its a must see. Forget what people say and see it for yourself.&lt;-------------------------------&lt;Spoilers&gt;------------------------- ----&gt;Wow what a fantastic film, Id go so far as to say its one of the best movies ive seen in a long time, to think this came out of hollywood without a bit of hollywood in it, is amazing. Sam Mendez did a great job, at first i didnt believe he directed it because i thought American beauty was good but quirky. The Cinematography was fantastic, many times i was stunned by the scenes, particulary the sea ending. The sound was also great, the way they cut out the bullet sounds sumtimes made me extremely tense for the ending, when i was expecting a loud gunshot or maybe not for tom hanks. A Masterpiece truly. The ending was fantastic also, i was so tense expecting that bullit, i thought the scene was done really well what with the sea etc and i felt it was tainted by evil Jude Law's character the bounty killer. The way he pulled out a camera and actually set up to shoot Tom on film, it made me see red. I wanted revenge. I knew Tom would have to die in the end, theres no way out of it and the ending line, i say hes my father, it brought a tear in my eye. All thru the film i found myself reflecting on my own relationships with my father. I agree its a film about fathers and sons.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth the wait</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We've waited three years for British director Sam Mendes to follow up his Oscar-laden debut "American Beauty"; we've waited his whole career to see Tom Hanks play an immoral guy (although we're still rooting for him from the beginning); and, so far as I can determine, we've waited the history of the cinema for an English-language movie with the word 'perdition' in the title. Was it worth the wait? Most certainly - Mendes has triumphed again with totally different subject material - Irish-American gangsterism of 1931 - but the same consummate composure and craftmanship of every scene.Mendes is well-served by a fine cast. Besides Hanks, Paul Newman comes out of retirement to give an excellent performance as the gang leader who is a father figure to the Hanks character (indeed the whole film is about the father-son relationship), Daniel Craig and Jude Law are impressive as psychotic killers of different kinds, and young Tyler Hoechlin is convincing as Hanks' son and the narrator of the story. As with "American Beauty", Mendes has used veteran cinematographer Conrad Hall, who creates wonderful visual images, and an atmospheric score from Thomas Newman which, together with the production design of Dennis Gassner (who makes the Depression era so live) adds up to a real class act.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Breaks down early on the road to greatness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unsurprisingly, this has already reached #133 of the IMdB's Top 250, which goes to prove that Sam Mendes has succeeded in pulling the wool over many people's eyes. Road To Perdition has been snowed under with style-over-substance accusations ? and they're all completely fair.Granted, it looks fantastic and isn't short on atmosphere, but this is no classic. Key relationships in it are handled clumsily; the scene where Hanks asks his son what subjects he likes in school is about as subtle as a gunshot - yeah, yeah, we know he's been a distant father, so why labour the point? Too many scenes are staged just to look pretty (why would gun-savvy gangsters line up like tenpins to be picked off one-by-one by a guy with a tommy gun ? are they too tough to duck for cover?), and there is no memorable dialogue. And, yes, that includes Paul Newman's "this is the life we lead" claptrap. Hanks, like James Stewart, can display a dark streak, but I'm too familiar and comfortable with his everyman niceness to buy his seasoned killer act. Versatile, yes; menacing, not in the least. Miscasting is one thing, but casting an actress as good as Jennifer Jason Leigh and then giving her nothing to do is just criminal. This is a good film, it's just not as good as it thinks it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Cinematography is perfect!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Comparisons with De Palma and The Coen Brothers (`The Untouchables' and `Miller's Crossing') are inevitable, but this film is unmistakably a Sam Mendes film.There are themes, which were explored in his debut `American Beauty' which are also explored in this film. Both films have a central male character who may initially appear to blend into his surroundings perfectly but on closer inspection it becomes clear that there is a disparity between the outer and inner persona.In American beauty the central character was the narrator, in Road to Perdition it is the child who guides the story. This does serve to add a certain sense of sentimentality but only at certain stages of the film - thankfully not throughout!Tom Hanks give an impressive performance as the tormented father struggling to cope with increasing pressure around him. This isn't done in the usual way through taut dialogue - Mendes uses the camera itself to do the talking instead. We have huge sweeping shots, tracking shots, off kilter shots, close ups - all the tricks of the trade to tell his story. As well as astonishing uses of colour to create effect.The score also serves as an excellent way to build tension throughout. It has an Irish theme at the start of the film - to set the tone of the Irish/American family - but this becomes less apparent throughout - as the music takes on a similar kind of feel as the American Beauty score.Jude Law is fantastic as the Weegie - like press photographer who metaphorically `shoots the dead'. Without giving too much away - look out for the Diner scene - the tension builds with Hitchcock precision!Paul Newman is also excellent as Tom Hanks's 'father by proxy' - in a role that seems to be have custom made!Whether or not it was intentional or not I don't know, but it seems as if, if the film was paused at any point throughout - it could be taken for a painting by either Edward Hopper, Jack Vettriano or even Norman Rockwell! My point being that the cinematic value of the film is immense.Overall, a great piece of filmmaking - in my opinion only let down by small sections that are a tad sentimental. Also if you like to be "involved" with the characters- I think that you may be disappointed - like American Beauty before it - it keeps the audience at a distance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Picture, 2002</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A gangster film which focuses on father/son relationships, and also on revenge and the implications of murder. Tom Hanks plays Michael Sullivan, a hitman who is forced to go on the run after his son witnesses him doing his job. As with Signs, it's hard to describe the plot too much without spoiling it. Suffice to say that it provides an adept commentary on the morality of organised crime and revenge killing, and also explores (less thoroughly, I felt) the relationship between father and son and how it is sometimes neglected. The tone and direction of the film are very dark, but this fits the era (1930s prohibition-period America) and subject matter (death, and lots of it), very well. The direction is wonderful. One scene towards the film's conclusion, shot in the rain and with surprisingly little emphasis on sound, is hands-down one of my favourite scenes of all time; beautifully directed and as touching as it is shocking. The plot drags slightly towards the middle of the film, and isn't really suited to people without a considerable amount of patience, but the resolution fits the rest of the film perfectly, and is a brilliant emotional climax. This has to be the best film I've seen this year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dear Sam</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, first things first. I love "Alice in Wonderland", I mean "American Beauty", as much as the next guy. And like most people, I was all set to herald Sam Mendes as the new crown prince of American film making. I mean, "Beauty" is so friggin' great that I was literally salivating in anticipation of his latest offering. Had my bib on and everything, ready to dig in. They really had us chomping at the bit for this one, didn't they? So after finally viewing this long-awaited opus, I just gotta ask one question: what gives, man? There's something seriously wrong with this picture. Not horribly wrong, mind you, but wrong enough to be disturbing. It seems to me, and this is only an opinion, but it seems to me that there WAS an actual vision here once, a true, golden vision, but somewhere along the line it became corrupted and was sold down the river. And it's a pity.For starters, Mr. Mendes, you could have had anybody, and I mean ANYBODY for the lead role here and you chose Tom Hanks. Pray tell, why? Tom Hanks as a hard-nosed yet tender gangster? That's a tough sell, any way you look at it. Plus, the guy's got more friggin' money than God at this point, so I don't think he really needs to be doing "art" flicks, an obvious early intention here. And like I said, it's such a blatant Hollywood miscast. Tom "King Midas" Hanks is like the curly-haired Jimmy Stewart of our day. You're just not going to buy him in this role. You're just not.Secondly, you go to all the trouble of creating Maguire, a character not found in the original body of work. Then you get the always hypnotic Jude Law to play him. But then you give him so precious little to do! You treat him like a minor character (read: little development) when, in the context of the story, it's readily apparent that he's so much more. Metaphorically, Maguire represents all of the past (literally and figuratively) chasing all fathers and sons (literally and figuratively) down the road to perdition. And I know I'm not the only one who saw this, so for such a symbolism-happy director like yourself, this appears to be a misstep of sorts.Beyond that, "Perdition" just feels like a movie that was supposed to make a grand statement of some kind, but got bogged down in its' journey towards relevance. The whole thing reeks of the worst kind of feel-good, dumbed-down Hollywood storytelling. Some of the devices employed here feel a bit forced and often artificial. It's kind of insulting, actually. Which begs the question, Mr. Mendes, are you going to be our genius director or a whore for the Company? Road to Perdition? More like Road to Hollywood Babylon. And who compared this piece of mediocrity to "The Godfather", of all things? Who'd they pay to say that nonsense?I suppose I should say some nice things. There are SOME nice symbolic touches here, excellent cinematography and art direction throughout, and another outstanding score. And Paul Newman is great. You can never, ever go wrong with Newman. Especially the older, icily dignified version we get here. But again, the storytelling is the real downfall here. The pacing is SO forced. It's alternately slow (without being evocative) and then it's rushed and then it goes nowhere. But I'm sure you'll all be remembered come Oscar time, which is all that really counts, isn't it? Better to make a film that is well-received by the masses than an important, risk-taking one, I guess. So it seems we'll have to wait for Part 3 of Sam's Great American Novel to see if he redeems himself. Maybe he'll wise up and give us what we deserve. In the meantime, give me Fincher or P.T. Anderson even. At least disco calls itself disco. And smartly keeps its' heart where it belongs, on its' sleeve.By the way, this is Kevin Spacey. Take care.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a very interesting movie. The plot was very weel-thought. A kid who discovers that his father was a murderer, and the father was afraid that his son would end up just like him. The acting was great, Tom Hanks pulls the dark side role pretty well, Paul Newman does a pretty good mob boss, Jude Law's character was very original, a photographer who takes pictures of killed people, and young Tyler Hoechin does a great role as the son of a killer. The Art Direction was very well designed, and the Cinematography made it look very realistic.I do have some negative comments though. To start, only about two to three characters, maybe four, stay alive. Everybody else in the movie dies, and everybody who dies is murdered, by a gun for crying out loud. Every ten minutes or so, somebody is shot. And if they were going to kill nearly everybody, couldn't they think of a more original way to kill them, gun shots tire you after a while, and in most movies I've seen, the villain, and the main character, die in a more original way, if they die. But this just proves that Sam Mendes just loves gun shots (watch American Beauty and you'll see what I mean.The gun shots and too much killing is my only negative argument, apart from that, way to go. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>dark metaphor for the passed torch of evil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well done. I found myself quite completely caught up in the metaphor of the intergenerational perpetuation of bad karma. Time and time again, I found myself realizing that I had, in my own way, experienced the situations depicted. For example, in our household we had a neighbor family around the block who provided more experiences of love and compassion than we were able to find at home. This is like the farm family in the movie.An interesting genre comparison: This movie is like opera. It has a very simple plot. The trick of good opera is to sustain through artistry the emotional profundity of a rather simple idea or situation or claim. That is what this movie tries to do, and I think it rather succeeds; high praise, coming from a person who's has yet to be really impressed by an opera!So. What's the moral? The name of the game is to find forgiveness, and the elements of that kind of forgiveness envisioned are laid out gracefully by the movie. It's rarely I get to say this in one of my "user comment" minitreatises, but I can say it here: What more do you want? When artists have real insights and ply them through any medium, it's a blessing to the community. When they do so through film, it's a repudiation of the claim that film is an intrinsically corrupt medium, essentially incapable of imparting real wisdom.Wait a minute; there is a qualifier. How do you reconcile this with another interesting message in the movie; delineating between "good" bad guys and "bad" bad guys? Is this a refined slicing/dicing of the moral universe, or just more misbegotten heroizing of outlaw elements? You be the judge. I thought it did a good job of showing that things are morally complex even in the world of organized crime. And don't let it escape your notice that one plot element is lifted directly from the story of David and Bathsheba. So this slicing/dicing is firmly rooted in Judeo-Christian tradition!I think my "opera" comparison says everything about the technical execution. The technology of opera must make things emotionally palpable in an honest, usable way. This movie does that, so it says everything that needs to be said about the script, the sets, the costuming, the directing, the cinematography.I'll mention one small technical flaw in the script. At one point the "tracker" (Law) picks up the phone at the sister-in-law's house after the wake, and says to the operator "I've been cut off." Supposedly, he uses this trick to find out where Michael (Hanks) is calling from. Reasonably assuming that a number of trunks (interoffice lines) were involved in the call under old manual and perhaps electromechanical control, this would get you nowhere. But this is a forgivable oversight/indulgence on behalf of the spare-but-adequate plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>American Ugly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't seen Sam Mendes' Oscar-winning movie, but this must be the follow-up: 'American Ugly'. Not just Jude Law's make-up, but the ugliness of the mood. I have to disagree with nearly every other reviewer and say that I thought the cinematography was too overdone. It even made Tom Hanks look ugly, and everybody knows he's a nice guy. He is the main letdown here. Both miscast and off-form, this movie could not have succeeded without him, and yet doesn't really deliver with him, either. The pace is far too slow; it never totally grips your attention; and the overall mood is so depressing, it leaves no room for any surprises or moments of sustained tension. There are a couple of good tense scenes, but the grip is soon lost, until the next good scene, by which time the audience has lost interest. Jude Law, whom I have always disliked, is actually the best part of this film, but without his villainous gangsters-in-panto entrances, the whole thing would be worthless. It's not all that bad, but it's not the movie which I had been built up to expect. It's another instance whereby the trailer is the movie. How often does that happen nowadays? It's just as satisfying to watch the trailer a few times because all the best bits are contained therein. 6/10, but disappointing. One reviewer likened this to 'Unforgiven'. He will be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but old</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had read Entertainment Weekly before I went to the movie, so I didn't expect too much from the first. And as it turns out, EW is right: the movie is good, but it's not going to be an Oscar movie. The problem is the story is all too familiar. Built on a father-and-son framework, the movie could have been infiltrated by twists and surprises. However, none came! I would say Sullivan's killing Rooney is by far the biggest surprise. Other things are pretty predictable. It's quite a pity, you know? The music is so fine, the cinematography is pretty well done, the cast is attractive and the director is great. Yet, the story is just too weak! Seeing this movie is a pleasure, but it won't be any movies like 'Talk to Her' or Mendes' old work 'American Beauty' which can lead to hours of discussion and make us remember. A decent picture which is worth a look.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A predictable film with outstanding production values.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The buzz about "Road to Perdition" being a front-runner for year end awards reflects two undeniable facts: The year has been an extraordinarily poor one for films, and a film with an undistinguished story can be made to seem better by impressive production values."Road to Perdition" tells the story of a gangster who wants to keep his son safe from the life which has befallen him after it has led to disaster for the rest of his family. There is certainly drama to be mined from such a scenario, and the film sustains interest throughout, but it is predictable nearly every step of the way and fails to distinguish itself dramatically. Other than the protagonist, well played by Tom Hanks, most of the actors are given sketchy characters to flesh out, and no one really makes much of an impression. Paul Newman and Jude Law allow an Irish accent and bad teeth to do their work for them and Jennifer Jason Leigh is barely on screen long enough to not be considered an extra. The ever-reliable Stanley Tucci and Dylan Baker succeed in making their characters interesting, but they aren't relevant enough to the story for that to matter much.The biggest problem with the film is how easy it is to remain a step ahead of. I saw nearly every event coming before it occurred. There is simply no surprise anywhere to be found. Even when Hanks is revealed to have been a step ahead of Law, or vice-versa, the impact is muted by the fact that we are a step ahead of both of them. I even knew the last line of the film well before it was uttered.Director Mendes and the Dreamworks production machine spared no expense in trying to bring the story to life visually, and it is one of the more magnificent looking films to have been released recently. However, these production values work more as production values than as a legitimate recreation of any particular era. They may even in some way undermine whatever impact the slight story may hold. For example, we watch a magnificent looking shootout in awe of the display of bullets and light, but there is never any question that this scene will mark the end for one of the lead characters, and when his end occurs it does so without dramatic impact. The style has muted the subtance."Road to Perdition" isn't a bad film, exactly, but despite it's surface shine it pales mercilessly in comparison to the well-written gangster films it would like to recall.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Breath-Takingly beautiful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While this film treads a well worn path already made by films of this genre before,it does so without question very beautifully. The grand feel and grasping richness of this film is so in evidence you can not help but be swept in. It would be a lie to say the theme of the movie is a completely new one and as the viewer you can guess where this story will lead. But you cannot tear your eyes away from the stunning Cinematography, for a second of the time. The performances from all concerned are faultless, Tom Hanks is completely and utterly believable in the role of Michael Sullivan, it will take some performance from a leading man this year to better his. Paul Newman although on screen for a relatively short time, is unforgettable and in a one on one with Hanks draws goose-pimples with his speech "This is the life we chose..." Although as a viewer we do have an inclination as to how this will all end, it makes it no less easy to swallow. The combination of heavy rainfall and a Thompson Machine Gun make one of the finest sequences of Cinema I've ever witnessed, and this precedes a truly moving climax.A film to truly savour</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Enjoyable, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie a while ago, so I've had more than enough time to chew on it. Since it has kept me thinking about it all this time, I guess that means the movie's pretty good. Sam Mendes has created a film of true beauty. It is visually stunning. Tom Hanks can add this one to his list of great performances, and Paul Newman, my gosh!, there's one particular scene he has with Tom in the church basement, in which he proves why he is considered one of the greatest. I wanted to give him an Oscar right there. Although I enjoyed it very much, I have a few minor complaints: First, the director's visual techniques, like catching people's reflections on mirrors, glasses, windows, etc., as well as the focus-the-background-blur-the-foreground an vice versa thing, worked for me the first couple of times. It's a nice touch, but eventually it got over-used. It came to the point where we were waiting for these effects to show up instead of being surprised by them.(Mild spoilers)Second, maybe Tom wanted this character to look different, or memorable, or something, but really, that thing on his nose, his double-chin and his cheeks were very distracting. All I could think of every time he's on screen was how chubby he looked. It just didn't fit the character. How was he supposed to run for his life carrying all that weight? Third, Jennifer Jason Leigh, such a talented girl and so little to work with. She was barely given a couple of lines and hardly any screen time. Finally, Jude Law tries too hard to look ugly. (a la Brad Pitt in ?Snatch') , in my opinion, a more regular appearance would've made his character more believable and even creepier.Apart from those minor details, I found the movie to be very enjoyable and totally worth of spending time watching it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Road to Perdition" is beautifully made: lovely to look at, well-cast, with fine performances, excellent music... and an inescapable air of deja vu. It's "Lone Wolf and Cub" in Depression-era gangland. As mob hit man Tom Hanks takes it on the lam with his son in tow, always just ahead of the mob's other gunsels, all I could think of was the voice-over narration by the boy, Daigoro, in "Shogun Assassin," the Americanized version of Lone Wolf's adventures: "That was when my father left his samurai life and became a demon. He became an assassin who walks the road of vengeance. And he took me with him." In that same version, Lone Wolf tells his son, "Today I begin walking the road to Hell." "Perdition" is a theological term meaning lostness, damnation... or hell. I picked up on the similarities just by watching the trailers."Road to Perdition" was presented with such a double-whammy of hype --an aura of promotion that says "Oscar contender!" to the critics, and "I DARE you not to like this!" to the rest of us--that I went in with a show-me attitude. It showed me about what I figured it would: that samurai movies can be remade, not only as Westerns, but as gangster flicks. But then, "Last Man Standing" had already proved that point six years earlier.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good and evil all mixed up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where is the line that separates good from evil? Can a gangster have good feelings and even be a good father and a good husband? This movie may have the answer to these questions because it's a story of love after all, of love of a father for his son despite that father is a hatchet man working for a top gangster of the Irish mafia of the thirties in USA. That same top gangster has got a fatherly love for his hitman whom he adopted as a son which doesn't prevent him of trying to have him killed when he thinks that he's staying alive can endanger his (the top gangster's) safety. And we can see how sorrowful he is because he's got to do it. The plot has got a few flaws maybe not exactly flaws but things that are not well explained and if they are not coincidences are a bit doubtful. For instance how did the hitman played by Hanks found out that the man sitting before him in the road restaurant was there to kill him? And how did it happen that that same killer knew that Hanks would go to the hotel where the accountant was whose books he wanted to see? Anyway these small unexplained scenes don't impair the good quality of a movie directed with firm hand by Sam Mendes and whose main actors perform their roles with high efficiency and convincing acting including the little boy. The sound track gives the movie its appropriate atmosphere and the scenery does the same. All the scenes where there is danger, threat and suspense take place at night and with heavy raining. The only scenes taking place in open daylight are almost only those taken in the farm of that old couple who at a given moment give shelter to the runaway hatchet man and his son in an atmosphere of friendship and peace.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Road To Perdition (15)Road to Perdition is a dark tale of revenge, based upon a graphic novel, starring Tom Hanks as Michael Connor, A family man and unbeknownst to his sons, hit man for crime boss, Mr Connor (Wonderfully played by Paul Newman).When one of his sons witnesses him murdering someone, a tragic series of events unfold, starting with the murder of his wife and one of his children. He quickly finds himself on the run with his surviving son and bent on revenge.As expected from director, Sam Mendez, there is some terrific and stylish photography, the use of sound is extremely well used and the performances are all thoroughly solid (especially Paul Newman's).However, I was expecting an awful lot more. After all, American Beauty was a profound piece of work. So it is a shame that Road To Perdition comes across as sometimes lazy and at times, ill conceived. It is still a very good film but sadly it is full of wasted opportunities and in some ways ruined by the typical trappings of being a Hollywood product. It could have been a dark, gritty masterpiece but instead, ends up as being dark with some fluffy moments. 7/10 - Recommended as a solid film that could have been a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Road to Perdition **** directed by Sam Mendes with Tom Hanks, Paul Newman, Jude Law, Tyler Hoechlin, Stanley Tucci and Jennifer Jason Leigh Problem is... what do we say when the only flaw we can see in a movie is that the obvious willing is not art or money, but Oscar?When a movie has flawless direction, acting, a wonderful screenplay, amazing cinematography, a delightful score, perfect art direction... when it is perfect in every single detail... but it doesn't have soul?This is my problem with Road to Perdition. I don't see the soul beneath the skin. It's - like many other films that usually show up at Oscar night - a skilled brilliant exercise that doesn't last. A great movie, for sure, but not in the same league as this year's Minority Report, One Hour Photo, Talk to Her or even Powerpuff Girls: The Movie.What's the difference between one and the others? Well, it's quite easy. The four others are made by people who was able to give soul to their stories. Maybe the best example is to compare the two Toms performances in Perdition and Report... Tom Hanks gives his usual I-want-my-nod tone to skillfully portrait a hit-man who happens to be a caring and loving father, and of course, despite that little fact, he's the good guy. Tom Cruise, in exchange, gives it all as the Kafkanian character trapped in his own trap... there are multiple layers in his "hero", and good Cruise show them all, making us CARE for him. There are several times in which both Cruise and Spielberg made me forget I was actually watching a movie. This is not happening in Road to Perdition. The movie uses so showy techniques, it's SO beautiful that you really can't get trapped in it. Sam Mendes should see "lesser" movies as "The Rocky Horror Picture Show", "Raising Arizona", "All about my mother" or even "Battle Royale" to understand what is energy in a movie, what is SOUL.Of course it is not that "Road to Perdition" is a bad movie. It is great. But not one to treasure. Regretfully I can see now this people scoring 10 Oscars and being lauded as one of the bests of the year... technically, it deserves it, but my guts claim for other picks.In the acting, Paul Newman is the stand out. He's on his way for a well deserved third Oscar (the first was an HONORARY! one, and the second for "The Color of Money"), this time as supporting. A pity, because he would kill all chances to reward the subtlety of newcomer Tyler Hoechlin, in one of the best child performances of the last years (just behind Osment's A.I. and The Sixth Sense) which has gone unnoticed by critics and audiences.Jude Law, as usual gives a mesmerizing performance and is well deserving praise. Hanks, in exchange is good but not great. Tucci and Leigh take profit of their limited screen time, and give life to two undefined characters, which is saying a lot of their talent.Technically, the movie is perfect and in its way to sweeping the nominations at this year's Oscars. But, I can't, with the hand in my heart, praise the movie itself with the adjective "masterpiece". A pity... it was so close...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This thought crossed my mind as I was reading about the new movie. But it all vanished as I finally saw it. He isn´t that bad after all.Mike Sullivan, a killer for the mob, is at days a normal family man. But&gt; when his boss wants him to, he changes into a very silent killer. The movie is not really such a masterpiece as "Forrest Gump" or "The Green Mile" was, but it has its own understanding.In the first quarter, it only is a nice mafia-flick, then changes into a revenge-style movie, then hops to some drama-elements by showing the relationship between Mike Sullivan Sr. and Mike Sullivan Jr..In the last quarter it finally changes into a "Everything is fine"-Movie. The End. Hmmm, if you are not that satisfied, so was I. I have seen B-Movies, that took better care of this plot, but it was something different, to see "Forrest Gump" killing some bad guys. Go to your videostore, when its out, expect no Oscar-Candidate and you will be satisfied with this movie. 6 of 10 points</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WHY should I pray for Michael Sullivan? Any way you slice "Road to Perdition," it's still pulpy, manipulative, pretentious, predictable baloney. I was excited at the prospect of Tom Hanks playing an anti-hero. But I found his performance to be wooden and devoid of any substance. His lines are very nearly monosyllabic; he's not given anything moving or to say! Throughout, I was waiting for the clincher -- some exchange or monologue from Hanks that would allow us to get inside his head. Does he enjoy being forever in debt to his foster father? Does he love or hate being a professional killer? He must be good at his job, or else he wouldn't be doing it... All the meaty emotional lines go to Paul Newman (the only person to escape this train-wreck unscathed), with the exception of the practically animatronic child actor and the furiously-scenery-chewing Jude Law. And Tom Hanks is supposed to be the main character? I think Sam Mendes intended understating his characters and leaving the rest to our respective imaginations. But "Road to Perdition" lacks energy. Even the action scenes seemed listless, whereas they should have had a popping intensity similar to Michael Mann's "Heat." I wanted, I really wanted to care about the characters, but I didn't. After seeing the trailer, a friend predicted the ending: Tom Hanks would kill his adoptive father. And I was hoping against hope that he wasn't right -- and the movie would surprise me. The only surprise was the below-average nature of this scam on the American people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This dark movie (dark in every sense of the word) asks the question, "What is a GOOD man?" On the surface the Hanks' character (Sullivan) is a brooding, nearly evilly cold hitman---almost the stereotype of the "family-man" mobster. But seen through the eyes of his older son who is, acc. to the character, "so much like me", we find ourselves at least partially rooting for this bad guy. Tender but never maudlin, the movie explores the darkest side of the mob while examining the bonds between father and son as they develop through tragedy---a tragedy in good part of Sullivan's own doing. The ending provides a small ray of hope, a bit of literal light on the beach, but the overall tone is disturbing. When asked if you "like" the film, you will probably say no. But is it worth seeing? Absolutely YES, if only for the fine performances of Hanks, Newman and the boy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most inspirational films of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Modern film-making has become an art which is far different than it was thirty or more years ago. This film alone provides us with the most smooth camera movements, most effective angles, and best acting since A Beautiful Mind. Kudos for this true piece of art go to director Sam Mendes, cinematographer Conrad L. Hall, and leading man Tom Hanks. First, Mendes' follow up to his debut American Beauty has out-done himself. Though the basic plot of this film is inferior to that of Beauty, the symbolism and overall production are one step ahead. He manages to paint truly incredible pictures of hate, regret, betrayal, love, and salvation, and much of that is through his creative direction. Part of his success on this film must go to his favorite director of photography, Conrad Hall. Hall, who also worked on Beauty, again uses the slow moving camera movements while showing minimal amounts of violence. His photography is probably the most incredible part of this movie. But, we cannot praise the movie itself without giving an ovation to veteran Tom Hanks. This is his best role ever. I admire how well he came to fit the role of a darker character than he has ever been. But it is done with such careful consideration of his evil that it comes off as a walking paradox. Truly, Tom Hanks deserves multitudes of praise for his work here. Along with Paul Newman and Jude Law, Hanks leads a very effective and talented cast. It is almost incomprehensible how powerful this film is. It doesn't even have to win any awards because we already know it is a spectacle for the ages. This film will live on for years to come as one of the best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So far, my pick for Best Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I encourage anyone who has not seen Road To Perdition to go. I now consider it one of the best films I have seen in a long time. It's not for the weak stomached, as there are some rather intense scenes, but I truly thought it was a masterful piece of film.Tom Hanks commands respect and awe in this performance, a departure from the mealy-mouthed roles has portrayed in the past. A man torn between providing for his family and the tasks he must perform, you see the torment and determination that make this character leap off the screen.Paul Newman, always graceful and elegant, gives a hint of Irish in his accent that I defy native Irishmen not to be impressed with. The character is a perfect and dignified persona for someone of his years, and he handles it with ease. As usual Mr. Newman makes the sublime look easy and the complex look effortless.Tyler Hoechlin, a relative unknown, has a depth that stirs the soul. From innocence to aged wisdom, this young actor finds the absolute perfect balance between wanting to know the truth and defying his fate. His portrayal of the character Michael Sullivan Jr., Hank's son, is filled with an intensity that rivals today's experienced actors.Daniel Craig and Jude Law provide the perfect amount of "creepiness" to balance the film's softer side. If the eyes are the windows to the soul, I do not want to know these two men. Their characters lend themselves easily to the seamier side of early 1930's Chicago, but both Mr. Craig and Mr. Law take it to another level. You see crazed and maniacal far too easily for comfort, making you squirm in your seat unable to look away.However it is this critic's humble opinion that the most pivotal and therefore the most remembered character in this film is the location. Conrad Hall (Director of Photography) and Dennis Gassner (Production Designer) outdid themselves with this project. Their skilled and artful portrayal of 1930's Chicago is nothing short of incredible. I have not see a film shot this well in many years, and if it does not get nominated for at least Best Cinematography, I will eat my hat.</fullReview>

Many people have accused him of being static, but I don't believe that is the case at all! People are used to Tom Hanks playing emotionally bound characters, with the aggressive manner of dealing with those emotions. I think they were put off by his passive nature of sliding emotions to the backseat of his mind.This movie has a great story, plot, dialog, and awesome characters.

		<fullReview>As I sat watching Road TO Perdition on July 28, 2002, I couldn't help but ask myself how could Sam Mendez create one of the greatest crime/dramas since the godfather.Tom Hanks did an excellent job portraying Michael Sullivan. Paul Newman did an excellent job in the supporting role. The movie is just great.Even though it's kinda early to predict the Oscar Winners, Road To Perdition is going to win Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Orginal Score, and Best Visual Effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>7 on a scale of 10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It amazes me how many movies are being made now that run 20-30 minutes longer than they need to. This was a classic example. If this movie had been 20 minutes shorter, it would have been much better. There were several examples - especially at the beginning - where I was bored to tears. For the most part, it was an interesting crime drama. Decent enough, but nowhere near Godfather levels, or even Miller's Crossing levels.I love Newman and Hanks - and they were excellent like always. And, the movie looked great - as most of these movies do. Finally, the whole idea of father/son relationships was intriguing.I'm trying hard not to hold the movie up to the standards of American Beauty (also directed by Mendes), because if I did, I would have to rate this movie as a 100+. I HATED AB!!!!!!!!!!!!!! But, forgetting about that other fiasco, Mendes does a good job here. Just too long.Also, I can almost always criticize some logic problem in a movie. And, there were a couple here. For example, after (SPOILER) Hanks' wife and son get murdered, he drives all night to Chicago to see someone. Now, how in the world would Newman have assumed he would have gone to see him? Yet, Newman is there waiting for him!!! Too ridiculous.But, if you like crime drama and you like these actors, you will hard-pressed not to like the movie. By my count, Hanks guns down 13 people - probably even more than in Saving Private Ryan. So, you have to be prepared for the usual mindless murder sequences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Morality on the `Road to Perdition'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We all (or most of us, anyway) trudge through our lives, one day at a time, doing what we do to make a paycheck, and maybe even doing it very well. We report to our appointed place at the appointed time and do our assigned tasks, all the while wondering what it would be like to do something we enjoy, something that fulfills us, and get paid to do it. After all, we don't say that we rise in the morning to go `play' or `be fulfilled'; we call it going to `work,' as in `toil' and `languish.' We may even hope that our children will have better luck than we did in finding that situation.This isn't going to turn into some thinly veiled cry for psychological help; it's just the thoughts that weigh on my mind after seeing Road to Perdition, the sophomore effort from director Sam Mendes, the man behind 1999's Best Picture Oscar winner, American Beauty. If you find yourself exasperated as you look at the movie listings this summer, wishing for more adult fare, then take heart; although the year is only half over, Road to Perdition is already a contender for several awards at next year's Oscars.In getting Tom Hanks and Paul Newman, two of America's biggest movies stars ever, in a film together, Mendes has achieved a casting coup. Admittedly, Newman's role is the smaller of the two, but as the father-figure mob boss, the role needed some gravitas, and who better than Paul Newman to provide gravitas? Hanks plays Michael Sullivan, an Irish immigrant in the Depression-era 1930s who had nothing when he arrived in America except a willingness to work. Newman's John Rooney gave Sullivan a job, albeit one Sullivan wasn't particularly fond of, and a purpose in life. Rooney comes to admire Sullivan, and even love him as a son. Sullivan starts a family of his own, and does his best to shield his children from what he does to feed and clothe them, in the hopes that they will make an even better life for themselves.Rooney's blood-son, Connor, does not possess Michael's sense of loyalty and morality (`morality' being a relative term for a mobster). He knows that Sullivan is the emotional son that his father always wanted, and is quietly envious. When Sullivan learns Connor is embezzling from the family business, Connor commits an atrocious act and places Rooney in a position where the father must choose between the son he has and the son he wishes he had.One must be warned up front that this is absolutely not your standard summer-movie fare. A line of dialogue uttered by Newman's character, referring to `the life we have chosen' is taken almost verbatim from The Godfather, and the tone throughout is very similar. The sense of doom and foreboding is evident from the opening sequence in the film, and only grows as the story unfolds. The first third of the move takes place almost entirely in darkness, be it the dark of night or the gloom of a rainy, wintery day. It is only after the tragic events that send Sullivan and his eldest son on the run that we begin to see the light, literally and figuratively. Hanks portrays Michael as someone who was probably once a good man, but realizes that he's sacrificed his own soul for his children's chance at a better life. He may be good at what he does, as his reputation in the criminal underworld shows, but he certainly doesn't like it. Newman, of course, is masterful as the tormented father of one man and father-figure of the other, determined to uphold his sense of morality, despite how it breaks his heart. Rounding out the above-the-title roles is Jude Law as the one character who very much likes what he does for a living -- a hit man sent after Michael who supplements his fees by taking photographs of his victims.I'm sure the tragedy of this film is supposed to be the loss we sometimes feel when our morals force us to do something against the wishes of our heart. In this case, it's the disappointment Rooney has in his own son, even cursing the day he was born at one point, versus the loyalty he believes he must have for his own blood. It's also Sullivan's thirst for revenge, even while knowing that such revenge will bring pain to his `father,' Rooney. I saw it on an even bigger scale: how living one's life against his own better judgment can only lead to heartache. Sullivan lived the life he lived, even excelled at it to a degree, because he felt loyal to the man who provided it, despite knowing it to be wrong. He hoped, perhaps foolishly, that by remaining loyal to that life while teaching his children something totally different, his hypocrisy would be rewarded. Even Mr. Rooney's loyalty to his corrupt child is shown by the film's end to be foolishly misplaced.How appropriate it is that `perdition,' meaning `hell,' `loss of one's soul,' or `utter ruin,' is exactly where all of these characters are headed. I'm sure we all feel that way at one time or another.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far better than what I was expecting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Minute Spoilers*Road to Perdition, a movie based on a graphic novel based on the Baby Cart Assassin series of movies based on an epic-length story called Lone Wolf and Cub.This is supposed to be a heartless story, while still being true to itself. Michael Sullivan is supposed to be a heartless but highly intelligent butcher, obligated by his Irish-Catholic/Mobster upbringing, rather than greed or malice. He isn't an emotional goody-goody crybaby or a super-strong man. He's just a guy who happens to want to pay an old man back for helping him out.There is really nothing wrong with this premise. A lot of modern influence affects how this movie is viewed, that it's a movie based on a graphic novel, that this movie is predictable, that this movie is about as good as "watching paint dry." Saying that is simply not allowing this movie any justice.This movie IS good, even great. However, many of the more subtle details should have been explained. Sullivan sweats in the diner because he recognizes who Maguire (Law) is, Sullivan parks the car in front of the diner because he thinks that no one is after him, etc. etc.Tom Hanks, Paul Newman, Jude Law, and Stanley Tucci stand out in this movie. Tyler Hoechlin appears to have been miscast, however. He's WAY too over-eager.All in all, this movie is wonderfully done, and deserves more than to be called "a simple-minded predictable Payback-ripoff shoot-'em-up Gangster movie," it's a road, ironically enough, to redemption for a cold-hearted man and the son he wants to save.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a big deal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed this movie. Its solid movie-making, its never really boring, and its a welcome sight given what passes for movies this summer.However, its also not a profoundly wonderful cinematic experience, as some reviewers would have you think. Some of it is very questionable - and the type of things that, if they went another way, the movie wouldn't exist..the ending is the most suspect. I didn't believe Tom Hanks as a cold-blooded killer for a second. He's indebted to Paul Newman for the life with which he's been provided, so he has to kill, if asked. Doesn't mean he likes it, but he does it to put food on the table. When his son sees his father practicing his craft, the movie takes off and so do father and son. From then on, its part getting-to-know-you, part revenge, part dodging potential killers. Newman doesn't have that much to do and only has a memorable moment or two. Stanley Tucci and Jude Law were underused and for me that was unfortunate since they were my main reason for wanting to see this in the first place. Tyler Hoechlin as the main character is talented enough to carry the movie and he certainly holds his own, but he's also a little too unemotional. When he asks his father if he liked his brother more, you should feel something from the kid, and you don't. But none of it really mattered that much to me. Whoever called this a 'masterwork' is entitled to their opinion, of course, but I couldn't disagree more. 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Father-Son Story in the Depression-Era Mob</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the late show of Road to Perdition and confess to squirming a bit through the first hour. The character development is deliberate and glacially slow. Were it not for the technical virtuosity of this segment of the film, I would have lost interest altogether. The low-light, low-saturation shooting, wonderfully genuine costume design, and austere sets carry the first half.  When the Sullivans turn fugitive, the pace revs up some, though not to fever pitch. Exploration of the father-son relationships is what makes the movie: between the Rooneys; the Sullivans; and John Rooney and surrogate son Sullivan, Sr. What is sacrificed, what is wished, what comes to pass for the love of a son? Law turns in a great bit role as a creepy, voyeuristic, and 'gifted' hitman. Tucci's Frank Nitti deserves an Oscar nomination. Daniel Craig's Connor Rooney is poorly realized. His portrayal is easily surpassed by newcomer Hoechlin's Sullivan, Jr. As for Hanks and Newman--you get what you pay for. Both turn in understated and poignant performances. And--though it sounds odd--I should also give a nod to the Rain. The drenching torrents appearing in key scenes lend much to the film's noir atmosphere. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good movie. Great? No.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that I have the utmost respect for Sam Mendes. His masterpiece, AMERICAN BEAUTY, is my favorite film. To this day, no other film has impacted me like that one.Thank goodness that Mendes's technical and visual talent is still there. Thank goodness he still casts great actors in complicated actors. Unfortunately, ROAD TO PERDITION lacks the emotional punch of BEAUTY.Sam Mendes certainly deserves another Oscar this year for his operatic direction, as does Conrad L. Hall, the cinematographer. However, I hope that the film does not win Best Picture. It probably will (since the Academy loves stuff like this), but I feel that it just doesn't deserve it. Jude Law gave an outstanding performance and I hope he gets a nomination.In my opinion, ROAD TO PERDITION is a beautiful and stylish (if hollow) crime drama.</fullReview>

Raised hard, lived hard but with a Soul deep down and at least some sense of Justice. Not just revenge. A bit of Robin Hood rolled in for good measure. Paul Newman was very good. He always is. Left you wanting to see him hang on but he lead a hard life too.Jude Law was downright evil. You forget all his other parts and stay on edge just watching him track the Sullivans'. Hobbies within Hobbies like you've not seen before. An Artist in some respects but WITH no respect. Surprises along the way right up to a very fitting ending.I would see it again without hesitation. A true 10 all the way to the Oscars.</fullReview>

I was almost nervous to see Tom Hanks in a part like this: he's usually portraying an absolutely loveable character. In this, the character (Michael Sullivan) is a bit darker than, say, Forest Gump, but I really liked seeing him in such a sullen, yet caring part. Jude Law looks completely frightening.

		<shortDescription>A good gangster movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ROAD TO PERDITION is a not great, but quite good crime thriller thanks to a solid story, wonderful sets and costumes, and some pretty decent acting. Basically this is an American version of the Japanese LONE WOLF AND CUB films, and based on a comic book by Max Allan Collins. There are some plot holes along the way. And I'm not convinced Tom Hanks was the best choice for the lead. Plus the ending is predictable and unnecessary. Nevetheless, for those who enjoy an old-fashioned, shoot-em-up gangster flick, this will be the ticket. The kid who plays the older son is amazing, by the way. Daniel "James Bond" Craig and Jude Law lend able support.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had been waiting this movie ever since I knew Tom Hanks was going to play a gangster. Then a few months ago I saw the poster and was captivated by it. As soon as I found out that it was based on a graphic novel I vowed not to see the movie before reading the novel; I'm a big comic book fan.I just saw the movie last night and I say it was worth the waiting. I was afraid I would get disappointed since I didn't like Mendes' "American Beauty", but to my relief I really enjoyed it. It's one great gangster movie, but please, don't compare it to "The Godfather". They have absolutely nothing in common. They are both very good movies by themselves.Tom Hanks does a fine job playing the Rooney family's enforcer Mike Sullivan. He managed to play a tender family man and a dark deadly gangster at the same time. Hanks is just one of those actors who can play just about anything. Paul Newman is great as John Rooney, the local chief gangster. Also, the performances of Jude Law and Daniel Craig give the story it's taste of insanity. I wish I could say the same about Tyler Hoechlin, but child actors will have a hard time surpassing what Haley Joel Osment did in "The sixth sense".The best of all are the visuals. Having being blown away by Episode's II special effects and having seeing almost too much SFX, "Road to perdition" was like classical music for my eyes. Beautiful! I loved every single shot in the movie.I only have one complaint: I wanted it to be more faithful to the original story. I give one big BOO! to David Self for his screenplay adaptation. I mean, the graphic novel had everything; it needed little changes in order to be a fine screenplay. I don't know why they left out some major events like Sullivan talking to Elliot Ness or the burning of the Quinlan.In the graphic novel it's all about O'Sullivan and his son; how they bond together because a tragic moment in their lives. The graphic novel really emphasizes just how deadly and resourceful Michael O'Sullivan was. He could take out a whole gang of mobsters who stood in his way to kill Connor Looney. The movie in turn pays attention to the relationship between Mike Sullivan and John Rooney, and the conflict that Sullivan suffers for having to fight is own mentor. I really missed the "Angel of death" concept worked out through out the novel. Not even once is Sullivan called "Angel" in the movie.I have one big recommendation to everybody who hasn't seen the movie yet (and that should be about three or four people): READ THE NOVEL FIRST. There are many things the movie does not explain and make more sense if you read the graphic novel. You will enjoy both a lot more after that; you will see the movie with Collins' background in mind and you will read the novel with Mendes' images in mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think that Sam Mendes might be one of the most overrated directors of the past five years or so. When all of the praise was heaped upon "American Beauty" I was a little perplexed after seeing it opening weekend.Now I am equally perplexed in regards to his latest venture. I think Tom Hanks is one of the finest actors in my lifetime. Having said that, his performance in Perdition is not bad but certainly not spectacular. The story itself is unbearably slow with some scenarios and situations that are simply too hard to swallow. This is not a bad movie, but it has absolutley no business being nominated for any Oscars. I am not sure why Sam Mendes receives the accolades he does, but for some reason the critics just love his films. This is a disappointing film which leaves alot to be desired.</fullReview>

More and more he is doing dramatic roles in the recent years in which it give Hanks a change from going to comedy to drama. I think this Hanks darkest performance ever in movie with little touches of comedic remarks. Without Hanks and Paul Newman in the film, it would not be the same. The performers make the Road to Perdition work. I am not really into gangster films, but this is worth the performances specially the boy who plays Hanks older son and the plot.

		<fullReview>This movie gets hundreds of high marks.Spectacular cinematography: very artistically doneMagnificent direction: Sam Mendes. 'Nuff saidA terrific score: a taught action soundtrack built on an Irish baseExcellent acting: Tom Hanks leaves his traditional style behind and shows that he can still adapt to new rolesIt's just too bad that the script left the movie predictable and overly deliberate.This happens quite often with American remakes of Chinese and Japanese films. The writer knows too well what he/she wants to say, and therefore takes the straightest path toward that goal. Unfortunately, in this case, that deliberateness left the movie a bit dry.The themes (which they beat you over the head with) run deep, and permeate every intentional move. And while I am normally a huge fan of a movie with a lot of symbolism, here, I felt the symbolism occasionally got in the way of the plot.That all said, as with all Mendes projects, this is a movie that you should definitely see at least once, but I'm not sure that this movie has the re-watchability that was so prevalent in American Beauty.Overall score: 7/10My two cents, BenScoring notes: 0/10 = Muse 5/10 = Zoolander 10/10 = American Beauty</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll be completely honest, I wasn't really interested in seeing this film from the previews, and the fact that Sam Mendes was directing didn't strike my fancy either (he's ok, but nothing great), but the fact that Tom Hanks was in it is what got me into that theater.The story is a rather harsh one, and I'm sure if you're reading this review you already know what the story is about (and if you don't, go read the plot synopsis). Anyhow, this film definitely has it's share of blood and murder throughout the film, but it's all very well done. Personally, I thought the story was a bit slow, but it picks up pretty well near the end of the film and makes the wait worth it.As for the acting, I thought everyone involved did a great job. Tom Hanks is great, as always, you just can't seem to go wrong with this guy. Jude Law pulls off another great performance (although I'm not too fond of the way they made his hair look in this film, and what was with those nasty fingernails?) After watching the film, I realized that I've only seen one other movie with Paul Newman in it, "The Hudsucker Proxy". And to this day, I've only seen the film once, so I guess I ought to remedy that soon. Paul Newman seems to have done a find job with his role. Jennifer Jason Leigh, Stanely Tucci, Daniel Craig, Tyler Hoechlin and Liam Aiken all deserve some notice too, they all did excellent jobs with their roles.I think this is almost without a doubt one of those movies where if you liked what you saw in the preview, then you'll like the film. If you're like me and were a little unsure of the film, then you may still want to see it. If the trailers don't interest you, then I'm not sure what to tell you. When/If you see the film, I really hope that you enjoy it. Thanks for reading,-Chris</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On a blank page, a writer can create his/her universe and we willingly suspend our disbelief, hoping to enter a unique, exciting, incisive new world. Mendes &amp; the writer, David Self, violate their own world numerous times, which severely detracts from the film. Focus on Michael Sullivan's character [Tom Hanks]. He's a loving husband and father of two. When his son hides in the car and witnesses his father kill people, the Sullivan family becomes vulnerable. Gangsters kill the mother and the youngest boy, missing Michael Jr. and the father.Sullivan proves tough, resourceful and intelligent in protecting his son while robbing banks, taking only Capone's dirty money. Sullivan wants to trade this money to Frank Nitty so that he can have permission to kill the man who killed his family. While robbing banks, Sullivan always finds notes, ledgers and documents that incriminate large areas of the mob. [Smart enough to steal these materials, Sullivan could have left them with a newspaper and or with a lawyer for insurance. Sullivan could have - and would have - protected him and his son from further harm by holding those papers over Nitty's head - but a logical ending was not what they wanted.] Sullivan machine guns Paul Newman, his mentor, whose son is responsible for killing Sullivan's wife and son. On the phone, Nitty says, "OK, you can kill Newman's son now but that will be the end of it." So Sullivan kills Newman's son. Prior to the ending, Nitty's main hitman, McGuire, fires away at Sullivan, who was shrewd enough to figure out McGuire's identity at a diner. As Sullivan's car roars off, McGuire is firing at it. A policeman comes out of the diner but doesn't pull his gun, although he heard several shots. The policeman, no policeman is this stupid, doesn't even pull his gun when he sees McGuire with a gun. The policeman says, "What are you doing?", and McGuire kills the policeman [ so the main hitman can keep going, not because it makes any sense]. All Sullivan has ever done is kill for money and live by his wits, surviving because of caution, intelligence and preparation. The next time, Sullivan runs into the hitman in a hotel. They have a gun battle. Sullivan gets the hitman in the side of his face but rolls on his back to kick a door open to get out of the room. No, the true Sullivan, ruthless and smart, would have gone over to the prone hitman and made sure he was dead [ so the hitman keeps going, not because it makes any sense]. Early in the plot, Sullivan has told his boy they can't go to his friend's house by the ocean because the hitman knows where it is. Sullivan, who has never underestimated anyone, suddenly assumes Frank Nitty has called off his hitman? No, the real Sullivan, intelligent and deeply knowledgeable of the mob, would have continued to feel endangered [but the hitman keeps following, not because it makes any sense that Sullivan wouldn't expect him].On the beach, as father and son walk toward the house. A golden retriever comes bounding toward them. I know [without having seen the film], the hitman is waiting in the house. Sullivan walks into the house, calls his friend's name but no one is home. Does he pull his gun? No, the actual Sullivan, having stayed alive for years by his wits, would have pulled his gun but the hitman has to be kept alive [not that it makes any sense]. Sullivan walks further into the house and sees - from ten feet away - an empty living room. There is no furniture, nothing. This red flag, to anyone with any sense, doesn't alert Sullivan who doesn't pull his gun [because the hitman has to be kept alive]. So, without looking left or right, [the hitman is to his right], Sullivan walks to the window and sees his son pet the dog and wave; of course, the hitman shoots him in the back [not that that would have happened to the character that Mendes and Self created but because they wanted Hanks/Sullivan to die]. Hanks/Sullivan finally pulls a gun from an ankle holster and kills the hitman who is threatening the son. The son gets away and lives happily ever after [not that it makes any sense, because Nitty has warned others that the boy will grow up one day and come back for revenge]. But Mendes and Self wanted the boy to be tragically left standing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE WORST MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Actually no, it wasn't. At least I got your attention. In fact, I loved this film and I can not beleive how critical those who have put their comments on this site have been of this cinematic gem. That's right, this film is a film making masterpiece in a quagmire of formulaic, crowdpleasing, blockbuster crap. These days we are lucky to get a cinematic experience of this quality and I am amazed that so many of you negative internet critics cannot appreciate that.Just when you wondered how Tom Hanks could have yet another fantastic performance, he not only gives us one in this film, but he proves - much like Jim Carrey in The Truman Show - that he is capable of inhabiting the least likely of characters and being great. For that alone, he should get another Oscar. I'm not sure exactly why everyone is praising Newman's performance when Jude Law gives a performance that slips under your skin and plays a character that is arguably the most original and compelling of his career.The film is so beautifuly filmed that many of the scenes could be paused and framed - giving them a quality very much like The Godfather, but not imitating it. I'll admit that the relationship between the father and son could perhaps have been more developed, but the raw displays of emotion and a climax that will stick in my head as one of the best in years make you forget about such minor areas of improvement that only the terribly picky would care to dissect.DO NOT LISTEN TO ALL OF THE NEGATIVE FILM GOERS WHO HAVE COMMENTED ON THIS SITE. Because they will be eating their unfortunately published words when this movie enters the oscar race in March.......................................................</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good movie,one of the better movies of 2002</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As far as gangster movies go,"Road To Perdition" is not in the same league as the very top movies of that type,but it is a very good movie from the director of "American Beauty",Sam Mendes.This movie uses a beautiful music score that helps the plot move along at a good pace and lets the scenes in the movie speak better than they would have had they been overburdened with clumsy dialogue.It is as much a study of the relationship between Tom Hanks' character and his son and Paul Newman's character and his son as it is a gangster movie.The use of dualities in this movie is brilliant with the pairs of fathers and sons,the town of Perdition as well as the piece played on the piano by Paul Newman and Tom Hanks,among other things.The acting is very good by the main stars,even with a small part for one of the great actors,Paul Newman.The last few years for movies after 1999 have been somewhat dismal in some ways,but this movie is one of the better ones this year.My rating:9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You get two of the most respected actors of our time, great cinematography and an unlimited budget for special effects and period imagery and what do you have. A silly, unbelievable glorification of a violent anti social subculture, organized crime. I don't like mob movies. I don't like the Sopranos or the Godfathers. If you are set to make a movie about these thugs, if you need to make a buck this way, at least don't glorify them. The Paul Newman character when responding to a suggestion that they infiltrate the unions, "We make enough money with what they do after work, we won't hurt their jobs." Horse Manure- The mafia have infiltrated every union they could. The Hanks character robbing the specific account of Al Capone in the small banks. Are you for real. A bank robber makes a selective withdrawal? But this is part of the white wash. These are the GOOD mob guys. What about his deciding that a good way to send a message to his godfather was to shoot the messenger in the head. Dosn't matter, this was a neccessary device for the writer to show that Hanks was not a wimp.I was really bummed out after seeing this movie. Not so much because the movie was offensivly violent, life demeaning junk, but because this was a hit. This movie should be a souce of shame for both Hanks and Newman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great interpretation of a two-dimensional story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm going to start off by saying that I have always found that Classics have one thing that sets them apart from all other movies: they often don't resort to cliches so much as they create the cliches that get used in the movies that follow them.How does that relate to Road to Perdition (RTP)? Well - RTP makes masterful use of all the existing gangster cliches without redefining them or implementing any new devices. The familial loyalty commentary (Hanks' character is forced to choose between his loyalty to his boss, or his wife and kids) has been explored by so many other gangster films. The crime as business venture is repeatedly explored as well. I could go on, but ultimately, I think my point is clear.Now - that's not to say that the film was poorly done. The cinematography was indeed incredible. The acting was impressive, although I find that Hanks is beginning to exhibit some punchcard mentality with his roles. Jude Law was fearsome, and Newman was certainly good.The storyline wasn't bad. Except, I didn't care. The film failed to draw my emotions in, I've seen the film described as cold, and I would agree. While people suggest that this 'coldness' was a part of the artistic goal, I truly believe that the audience needs to be made to feel. For example, 2001: A Space Odyssey was a cold film, but it drew significant emotional responses from its audience.Aside from that, RTP employs the familiar devices to tell an old story in a different way. It's beautifully rendered, and it carries the torch well. What it doesn't do is give us new insights, new ideas, or new feelings about that life of crime, or life in general. Inevitably, the film is compared to classics such as the Godfather or the Untouchables, and deservedly so. Those films do something though, they changed how we perceived things, altered our outlook, and left an impression on us. RTP is entertaining, it is eye-catching, and is a great effort. Unfortunately, it sticks to the middle of the road. It fails to set new standards, and leaves no impression on the audience. The path chosen was already well worn by the others. A friend suggested that the film could have been re-titled, "Middle of the Road to Perdition", and I'm inclined to agree. My rating? 7.5 of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Godfather, but still very good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into Road to Perdition thinking I was going to see the Godfather. But I can't say I was disappointed because few movies can ever compare to the greatest film of all time. Road to Perdition was a very touching and powerful movie. Some say that they don't care about any of the characters. If you can't feel the love and bond between the father and the son and if you can't care about what happens to them, then perhaps there's something wrong with you. This movie was not intended to be a surprise a minute flick. Even though you know that Michael Sullivan will eventually die, you refuse to give up hope for him. But it's really not the character that you care about, it's the relationship he has with his son. That's the main point Sam Mendes was trying to convey.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, I think that Paul Newman and Tom Hanks were excellent in this movie, even tho (Slight Spoiler) it was obvious who was gonna show up at the end.For a big budget flick like this they really should have done their homework better. First they have a casket with ice around it to show that it's 1931 and their is no embalming. They must've decided that was enough "reality" for one movie. They go to 1931 Chicago with its 4 lanes of traffic and luxurious sky scrapers? Go into Frank Nitti's office where his receptionist has a touch tone phone with lights? And on the old fashioned phone of one of the mobsters, the guy was able to have an operator trace a call back? I figured he was gonna *69!I really liked the story and acting in this movie, but c'mon, nobody caught any of this stuff while they were making the movie? I hope everyone goes to this movie because it is really worth it, but I think it is technically flawed, like winter in Chicago becoming summer farther down shore on Lake Michigan, or what happened to the AUNT?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Visually, Sam Mendes is like an American Adrian Lyne. This is as boring and dull as it sounds. Like a Big Mac without any condiments. It's the same old style v. substance debate. To his credit, a lot of his visual impact does come from the actors in the scenes, but I still think he relies on his penchant for symmetrical-POV-type composition too much- in an attempt to infuse meaning and importance- and, ultimately, feeling for the characters. Rather than letting the characters, their words, or their surroundings tell the story, Mendes forces emotion and drama on us with the images and lighting he uses rather than letting us find it ourselves. *SPOILERS* The ending was just hideously manipulative and last-minute. Who the hell were these people they visited? Ok, so they're good ol' farmers. We need more than that. Why should I even care about these people? The cold and distant father (although he had good reason to be), the crazy guy. The character who let me know this was not going to be a good movie was the mother. Jennifer Jason Leigh projects only a few seconds of tenuous, flickering warmth- and through a windowpane- at the beginning of the film. For the rest of her brief appearance in the film she is cold and off-putting, as usual. Just like you know you can't trust a person who had a bad mother, you can't like a movie where the only mother in it is not likeable.And what about Paul Newman's character's death? Pointlessly violent and shocking. Like much of this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul Newman is PERFECT. The movie should have been about him. Tom Hanks is pretty darn good as a murder. Jude Law is excellent.After seeing The Godfather, though, I don't know how anyone can call this one of the best movies of all time? It was well done and the story was good but very superficial.The on-going theme seems to be that Tom Hanks doesn't want his son to end up like him. Good theme, it was better in GF. Every time Paul Newman's character is on screen this theme is expounded and enlarged and driven into your skull with all the moral anguish and spiritual torment that such a dire conflict should stir in a person.But when it's just Tom Hanks we have a lot of scenes which basicaly amount to, "Daddy's gonna do a buncha cool gangster stuff like shooting people and robbing banks, but don't try this at home!" And the middle part of the story, where the film turns into a wacky buddy movie about a Guy and his kid cruising the countryside robbing banks, really drains the emotion from the film even more.On its own it was a good movie. It was great to see some actors in some very challenging roles and succeeding. However, the script itself was pretty run-of-the-mill as far as I'm concerned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overall this is a good movie. The cinematography was very well done, and the cast did a fairly good job. Hanks portrayed a good mobster, but I can't say that the role took advantage of how good of an actor Hanks is. He really didn't talk all that much, and when he did, there was no real emotion. But, what do you expect from a hitman. He did the best possible job for this role. I actually thought that his son had more emotional scenes that Hanks did. There were actually some funny scenes between them, involving the car driving.The story isn't all that different from other things that have been done before. The "gangster father wanting a different life for his son" has been done before, and the ending was predictable, but it brings closure to the film. I knew what was going to happen, but I didn't mind. There was nothing else that could happen at that point of the movie. It's the way that everything was done that made this a good movie, how they did, what was expected to be done.I enjoyed this movie very much, and recommend it for anyone that likes gangster movies, and good movies in general. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When star power backfires</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Believe it or not, major studios do not intentionally make bad movies. Most of them just end up that way, despite many talented peoples' best efforts. It's conceivable, in fact, that these people are actually trying to make good movies. So what happens when "Road To Perdition," one of these 'intentionally good' films actually has the gall, the lack of humility, the pompousness, to actually (gasp!) be good? Critics stomp all over it.The film didn't have a chance. Any project this highly anticipated, by simply being itself, raises its expectations so unreasonably high that few could possibly be pleased with it. Nearly every review I have read says it is beautifully filmed and crafted but leaves the audience disconnected emotionally. I can see their point, but the film is still getting poorer notices than it deserves.Take "L.A. Confidential," another period crime film. Consider how critics were falling over each other to heap praise on it, much of it deserved. That film was released long before Russell Crowe was a big star or anyone knew who Guy Pearce was. It had a cast of nobodys. The biggest star in it was Kim Basinger. I wonder, what if director Curtis Hanson had cast big stars and paid big money to make it? Wouldn't critics have looked for the slightest imperfections and brought them all out? The lower the expectations, the better the film will seem. So maybe the secret is the element of surprise. "Confidential" came out of nowhere. There were no expectations. Even "Perdition" director Sam Mendes' "American Beauty" came in underneath everyone's radar. "Perdition" on the other hand, has been anticipated for over a year. You couldn't hide from it if you tried. Could it be that audiences and critics have already made up their minds what they want out of it before they've even seen it? The slightest deviation from those expectations will surely yield in a bad review. In short, we're given too much time to think about it before the fact. Over-promotion has that way of working against a picture.There may have been no way to get good press for "Road to Perdition." As for myself, I have no complaints. It's not perfect. Some of what critics said I agree with, like David Ansen of Newsweek's comment on the `town named, a little too portentously, Perdition.' (There is a town named Hell, Michigan, so why not one named Perdition?)Roger Ebert writes, "After I saw 'Road To Perdition,' I knew I admired it, but didn't know if I liked it. I am still not sure." Actually Roger, the definition of 'admire' in Webster's Dictionary is 'to regard with delight or affection.' So I'm happy to report that you DO in fact like this film!Critics should take a step back and think. Big stars with a big director actually make a great film that actually lives up to its expectations, providing some relief amid a mindless summer movie season, and you still can't just be thankful for it? And you wonder why no one listens to critics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Understated performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An interesting switch for Tom Hanks. Usually he's front and centre in films, but in Road to Perdition, his performance as Michael Sullivan was one of the most subdued I've ever seen. For that, perhaps, he deserves to be applauded. It's one thing for an actor to act; it's another for them to avoid over-acting. In the past, Hanks could be accused of the latter, but not here.The story is simple: Sullivan is a hitman in 1931, and crime syndicate patriarch John Rooney's (Paul Newman) right-hand man. When Sullivan's wife and son are murdered by Rooney's jealous son, Connor (Daniel Craig), Sullivan sets out to exact revenge -- all the while hoping his eldest son, Michael (Tyler Hoechlin, holding his ground in the company of some heavyweights) doesn't follow in his murderous footsteps.Don't be surprised to see an Oscar nomination for Newman, who lights up the screen everytime he appears. I would've liked to see more of two characters: Jennifer Jason Leigh (Sullivan's wife,in a role that doesn't explore the depth of her talents), and Daniel Craig, as Connor.An all-around fine film, but for the most part the performances are very much understated. If that's what director Sam Mendes was aiming for, he succeeded.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER---SPOILER----SPOILERRoad to Perdition [R2P] is a 1930's period drama set in Al Capone's Chicago gangster land and environs. The context for this tale is Irish bootlegging during prohibition, but the real story is of fathers and sons, their love for one another, and sacrifices that are made. John Rooney [Paul Newman] is a local Capone boss; his natural son Connor [Daniel Craig] is disrespectful and conniving, while his `adopted' son Michael Sullivan [Ton Hanks] is devoted and honest. Rooney loves both sons. Conner and Michael are mobbed up, but Michael is committed to give his son a better life than his own. A mistake is made and Michael Jr. is put in harm's way when the mob finds out. Both Rooney and Sullivan must take the road to perdition [n. meaning ?utter destruction or ruin'] to salvage young Michael's life. The story is told through the eyes of Michael Jr. as he spends a tumultuous 6-weeks with his father in the winter of 1931. R2P is an artistic masterpiece and a technically perfect film [the professional reviewers got this one right]. Sam Mendes, who has a short but impressive resume to his credit [he did American Beauty [1999]] directs the film. Don't try to compare the two films. This story is both subtle and in your face, and employs parallel situations between Rooney and Sullivan. Set in the world of organized crime two fathers---who themselves are a father and son----desire to nourish and protect their own sons. The films authenticity [characters, scenes, sets, costumes, photography] immediately draws the viewer into the 1930's mob land. R2P successfully casts the leading actors, Hanks and Newman, in uncharacteristic roles as `bad guys', but also as loving fathers. This unlikely casting is a stroke of genius. Although Hanks is excellent, it's the old master Paul Newman who shines, even with less face time. Newman's ice cold eyes sparkle with love, his stone cut face cracks just a hint of a smile, and the deep resonant voice is both warm and menacing at the same time. His character sits on the knife-edge between good and evil. There's a robust supporting cast anchored by Stanley Tucci, Jude Law, and Jennifer Jason Leigh. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was great. Paul Newman proved that he still has what it takes to deliver a great performance. He plays Tom Hank's adopted father. It is clear from the start that they have a business relationship yet Paul holds a dear place in his heart for Tom. What did I like about the movie? Well, since we all know the premise, I will tell you what I liked. I liked the cinematography! It was set in 1931. The entire movie nailed it perfectly. Never before have I seen or felt more authenticity from an earlier time setting. I also liked the Way Tom Hanks played "a tough guy". Yet he was also the loving father. Kind of like Paul Newman who played a ruthless mob boss kind of a character...yet was very loyal to his blood son and Tom Hanks. Actually, his real son in the movie (Connor Rooney) was a stupid and evil son. His character was not developed and neither was the hitman hired to Kill Hanks and his son played by Jude Law. Those are the only negative aspects I can think of in this movie. Stanley Tucci had a small role as well yet he does a good job. So, alas, the best part was the scenary. Not the best movie I have seen this year but definately worth the 8 dollars I spent to see it.</fullReview>

I love really good movies, and I think that these usually on-target reviewers are wrong in calling Road to Perdition a three-star film. Titanic was, maybe a three-star film (or, on rethinking it, two-and-a-half). Road to Perdition is not only a four-star film, it is the best one I've seen since American Beauty, which, not coincidentally, had the same director. Look at it any way you want, from technical details to cinematography to acting to a story that plums the human dilemma, this a remarkable movie.Road to Perdition is a movie about fathers and sons, a topic of eternal and profound importance, whether we're talking about every male's individual story, why ghettoes have endemic problems or why whole nations go to war. Road to Perdition addresses painful questions such as which counts more in a father's heart, blood or loyalty? Or in a son's heart, a father's decency or his simply being a father? It answers these questions with subtle but powerful truth, beautifully unfolded, as befits three wonderful actors, two Oscar-winners (Tom Hanks and Paul Newman) and one who will be (the boy to watch is Tyler Hoechlin).Besides profound, timeless story and brilliant acting, it is a perfect period piece; the factories, homes, roads, signs, clothes, accoutrements are perfect period pieces. They could have been full of anachronisms and I would still have been deeply moved by the story, but the people who did these things got it right, down to the sweat stains on Hanks' collar and the protagonist's bicycle. So did the director and cinematographer; the film has a mood that derives from the darkness and heavy rain outside (reminiscent of Kurasawa's unrelenting rains)and the dark interiors that were once our home and workplace environments.I found yet another thing fascinating. Gangsters, from the 20s onward, whether Italian, Jewish, Irish or Russian, are always depicted as crude and inarticulate. In this film, the Irish mafiosi and Frank Nitti are depicted as far more sophisticated and intelligent than those we see in the canonical fims and television series such as the Godfather, the Sopranos, Ghost Dog, the TV Untouchables, etc. Were they Tony Sopranos or more like the criminals who ran Enron, Arthur Anderson and WorldCom? I don't know, but now I'd like to.Every movie has to have some errors of continuity, and found a few concerning the season. The story occurs in late-winter, but at times in-between, the trees are leafed out in late-Spring or even summer glory. Similarly, the fields are winter-sere in some scenes but the corn is growing to near summer height in others and plants are flowering. Clearly the scenes that made the final cut were not filmed in order, or in the six weeks that the story covered.I don't want to tell the story here; an appropriate rendering (without revealing too much) appears in Steven Holden's NY Times review, which is much more more insightful than Ebert's or Berardinelli's. But I will venture a guess: Road to Perdition will be a strong contender at Oscar time if the Academy has any integrity left in it.The brilliant science fiction writer Theodore Sturgeon said "90% of everything is crap." That is certainly true of movies. But Road to Perdition is a movie that deeply touches the heart and mind. If you don't see any other film this year, see this one. Then, after you've thougth about it, see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great cinematography but an empty, soulless film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Tom Hanks and enjoy the work of Sam Mendes. But there was something so woefully missing from this film that is crucial to the success of a gangster film--it needs to be believable. There needs to be a soul and a spirit in spite of the dastardly deeds that bad guys do to each other. People like gangster films because of that moral ambiguity.Tom Hanks plays an emotionally distant father who has two sons who adore him. The eldest son, Michael, takes after his father. Heck, they even share the same name. The two actors need to be emotionally estranged in the first part of the movie but there still needs to be chemistry in order for this terse relationship to work. After the boy witnesses his hitman father at work, both of their lives are at risk. The emotions in this movie ring false. At no point do I believe that Michael Sullivan is mourning for all that he has lost and I cannot see what binds father and son together. They run away and try to stay alive, avoiding crazy, creepy Jude Law who is this photographer who takes macabre photos of murder victims and then sells them or hangs them in his living room. I wanted to like the film. The cinematography is beautiful and unusual. But overall, this is not a film in the tradition of Miller's Crossing, the Godfather, or Good Fellas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must-see!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>** Possible spoilers **I loved this film and this is the first film I've ever seen that was directed by Sam Mendes. This is one of the few movies that was worth EVERY penny of the six dollars I paid for admission (the other one being "LOTR: Fellowship of the Ring").Bear in mind that this film is NOT for anyone under the age of 13. If they took out a few of those cuss words, they would've narrowed the film down to a PG-13. Aside from vulgarity and extreme violence, there isn't any sex (other than a shot of Michael Sullivan Sr. walking into a brothel).Oh, and if you get emotional at sad endings, bring along the Kleenex box to prepare yourself for the end of the film.Needless to say, this movie has 'Oscar' written ALL OVER it. See this movie, it's worth the money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>(Simply) Brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In truth, I doubt I can add much more to the comments already made. But in the spirit of adding my own two cents, here we go. I adore Tom Hanks. I respect and admire Paul Newman. I enjoy Jude Law immensely. I was fascinated by "American Beauty." What could be better than adding all of these elements together, then? Well, my answer is pretty much nothing. Every aspect of "Road to Perdition," from the stunning cinematography, to the moving (nuanced!!!) acting, to the heart-rending script, to the period costumes and sets, to the mood and feel of the entire film is utterly wonderful. Sam Mendes sets up a series of motifs (POTENTIAL SPOILERS) that range from father/son dichotomies, to (my favorite) religious imagery, (Note: I found it helpful to think of perdition not simply as Hell itself (or the city either) as much as absolute damnation without the hope of redemption/absolution. In light of the Catholic paradox the films presents, that is a pretty strong thought!) which he then plays with in the imagery, the script, the myth/story, etc. The affect is powerful and humbling. I can only imagine the screening Hollywood: hundreds of directors crying in the aisles because they lack the heart, intelligence and daring to create anything half as dark and moving. Yes, it is a pretty dark film. Yes, it is a pretty daring film. Yes, it is a pretty intelligent and challenging film. But most of all, it is a wonderful, entertaining film. It works on countless levels, and truly does fulfill on every promise. One final word about the acting before I close, Tom Hanks performance works and is interesting because he takes the anti-Halle Berry approach (meaning he doesn't feel the need to physical articulate everything. He is nuanced and quiet. He manages to communicate more in a gesture, in a clinched fist and tightly drawn mouth, however, than many actors do in a lifetime because he relies on the audience to do much of the thinking, to translate his actions, to be actively involved in making the meaning.) I like this approach tremendously. I thought it was the more difficult and interesting choice, and it revealed volumes about Tom Hanks to me as an actor and Sam Mendes as a director. Further, I think this commentary can be applied to many others in the film and in other films. This does not, of course, mean that you must agree with me. It was simply my opinion and insight!At any rate, this is an important film that definitely carries on the legacy of the "Godfather" and raises my hopes about summer films in general~</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie Making, Lousy Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off: yes, it was gorgeous; Yes, the music made me swoon; Yes the acting was top-notch. But when you come down to it, it was a movie little different from, say, Pretty Woman... just with a Hitman With A Heart Of Gold instead of a Hooker With A Heart Of Gold and, you have to admit, Tom Hanks looking far less sexy than Julia Roberts.I never believe there's any chemistry between the Tom Hanks and his son other than they occupy the same space for much of the movie and speak words to each other sometimes.Then we're supposed to believe that a man whose occupation is murdering men becomes more human through his work as he really means well. Sure.This is the kind of shallow white bread masquerading as art which just annoys the hell out of me as it suckers people into believing in it when it essentially shows us plenty of glamor and glitz but tells us nothing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie had everything going for it: excellent acting, great writing and brilliant directing. However, my suspicion is that the studio world of Hollywood managed to stop it from being great. Even though this film managed to get away with more than most Hollywood productions, it still suffers from Hollywood doctoring. There is a sickening sentimentality here that obviously doesn't belong in a movie as good as this one. In its best, this film is a cold, hard look into the greed and cruelty of human nature with very little redemption. Mendes even manages to introduce his motive from "American Beauty" of fascination with the beauty of death and stillness - not a small achievement of authoring within a Hollywood system. With all this, the film lets its spectators down when it moves into predictable waters. The 'good' in the movie only exists as a backdrop with a fairy tale quality, yet it is that good that we are left with at the end of the movie. They would have us believe that the fairy tale ending is possible in a story like this, even though the character of the boy is never presented strongly enough to make us believe in the possibility of such an ending. Mendes is subtle and good director enough not to make a major mistake like this, so the only people left to blame are the Hollywood strongmen who obviously insisted the movie ends in a certain way, with a certain 'message.' Have these money men had a little more faith in great artists involved in making this movie, they would have made themselves a classic that would go on making money for them for years to come. This way they managed to dumb down and sugar code one potentially brilliant film. What a pity.</fullReview>

The story, which so desperately wants to escape Hollywood, makes a few pleasant breaks, but in the end succumbs to a less than authentic ending. And they really could have done better than to bookend the film with that tired voiceover. The acting is generally excellent and I wouldn't be surprised to see some of these fellas at Oscar time next year. One aspect of the film that has been well-criticized is it's...coldness, for lack of a better term. This is particularly evident when it comes to the acting. I personally found it highly effective. Rather than melodrama and Mel Gibson-eque heroics, characters here are more likely to respond to pain and tragedy with cold supefication and a nearly numb, that's-life, let's-get-on-with-it mentality. For me, this style of film and acting brings a frightening reality to the movie, BUT at the same time, it plunges me more deeply into the exotic world of the cinema. This coldness is even more significant in the cinematography. I'm a huge fan of Conrad Hall's style, others aren't. Whatever your opinion, the cold richness of the filming is undeniably beautiful to watch. Unbelievable as the scene may be, the final, rain-slicked gunfight is a fantastically gorgeous bit of film-making.In the end, we have a film that does extremely well on its own terms. Watch and enjoy this rich, vivid, and deliciously cold film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally! The first excellent film of the year.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** 1/2Starring: Tom Hanks, Paul Newman, Jude Law, and Tyler HoechlinRoad to perdition really captures the art of such magnificent actors. Tom Hanks and Paul Newman are both Oscar-worthy for their great performances. Hanks captures his hitman-style image, yet also captures a loving father image. Newman captures a very big father-figure and a big backstabber. Jude Law is perfect for his strange and psychotic image of 'The Reporter'. I was surprised by Tyler Hoechlin's performance. I haven't seen such a good performance by a child since Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense. The movie itself is very magnificent. I have to say ,though, that the movie was a little too slow-paced. There were some parts of the movie that weren't necessary. Overall the movie is definitely the year's best, so-far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning cinematography elevates a film that could not bridge the good to excellent gap by itself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Road to Perditon starts slow. Then two big elements happen back to back and the film starts to propel itself to a good pace. The acting in the movie is quite good, but I personally think no actor (save maybe Jude Law for supporting work) really deserves any nomination here, although with the hype I'm sure at least one will. Tom Hanks is not really made for this role and he does a respectable job no more no less. Jude Law's character as the "reporter" is the most cool and original character and left me wanting more =&gt; morbid;)This movie is almost cocky in the way it aspires to greatness, but I felt that in many level it fell short. The characters are not that well developed, or at least the interactions between them feel often stale and fabricated. The many murders are too detached that they seem to lose their importance. There is still plenty of good stuff in this picture. There is a lot of material in the movie, a lot of subtilities and a lot of complex connections. This makes for some elements to think about after the movie is done and that's great. The mood and tension of some scenes are also great (e.g. the dinner stop). The music is also very powerful and appropriate. What really rises above the rest however is the cinematography. The highly decorated Conrad L. Hall simply outdoes himself and shows that there is always space to learn and explore in art. Teamed-up again with Mendes, after winning an oscar for AB, he shows the beauty of the still picture and the beauty of motion picture with his magic camera. The film is majestically shot from beginning to end with more than a few stand-out scenes ***SPOILERS AHEAD***(beginning and end beach, Michael Jr. witness of the murders, Michael Jr. sitting alone at the table after his family was killed, elevator shots, the murder of John Rooney, the murder of Connor Rooney, Michael's death, the final scene,...)The scene when the mother and brother we're killed was well made and we really felt the horror and injustice of the situation. The fact that Mendes didn't show the bodies worked. Talking about Mendes, he definitely lost the feel of his characters, especially contrasted to his mastery of American Beauty's characters. He did however use Michael Jr. narration very well as he did with Kevin Spacey's Lester in AB. The ending scene when Michael is watching his son through the window and the reflection of the beach can be scene beautifully mixed in the composition is great. When Micheal is then shot and the tranquility of the scene is literally shattered, the artistic beauty of that scene just increased even more. It is so beautiful I almost cried. Then when Maguire is setting up to take the photo, I finally understood Maguire's twisted hobby. This IS beautiful. There is beauty in everything; even death. This scene alone saves the movie from unfulfilled promises.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Road to Perdition" is easily one of the five best movies so far this year, along with "Minority Report". It is a violent movie with a anti-violent message. The greatest thing about this movie is the way it uses spactacular cinematography and at the same time graphic violence to pull you in to this world. The performances in this movie are awesome, especially Hanks and Newman. Mendes' direction gives the movie an artistic greatness that dosen't get over-shadowed by the grizzliness of what he is filming. This is not your typical gangster movie, it is more about the double lives lead by these men whom we call mobsters. They are killers and church-goers. Hanks in this film is a loving father and husband, but willingly kills men just because his bosses tell him to. It is a story of a father sacrificing his own happiness, and leading a life in which he has to do horrible things, so that his children could one day be free of the burdens he lives with. This is a great movie, go see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>tom, jude and paul are great but the kid is horrible (he's not at all convincing). i'd prefer haley joel osment (i'm a huge fan). the emotional tone is too dry. ***SPOILER*** following the death of his mother and brother, the kid seems emotionally unaffected. there's simplicity and there's barely-there. road to perdition is of the latter case. also, the plot is very predictable, with a very ordinary and unsurprising ending. the movie is weighed down with its own oscar-bait theme and sequences. however, the cinematography is gorgeously depressing and the movie is technically well done. plus, i love jude law. he's always a delight to watch. overall, an ok movie but not particularly spectacular or engaging.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is like watching a chamber orchestra deliver a perfect performance. Compared to The God Father everything was smaller and less grand in it's telling of "gangster life". Paul Newman and Tom Hanks delivered scaled back and insightful looks at two very strange and mis-shapen characters. I think I can watch this 10 more times and see something new each time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Could have been a great movie. Instead it was so-so. It was an Irish version of the Godfather. Some rave that this was Hanks best performance. I don't share that opinion. Newman, who is a great actor, was also not at his best. Some critics talk of the "duality" of the actors roles. That goes a bit deep for me. That is basic human nature that we see daily in people. Attention to detail sorely lacked. I only hope there isn't Perdition II.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>. ROAD TO PERDITION is not your typical gangster film, rather it is about fathers &amp; sons set in a small town outside Chicago during a six week peroid of a dreary winter in 1931, (the begining of the great depression. Tom Hanks is a mob hit man, &amp; due to the fact that his 12 year old son sees a crime committed, Hanks wife &amp; other son is killed.True to all dramas of this nature Hanks must exact revenge. Simple story superbly directed by Sam Mendes, his prior,film was that dreary bad taste in mouth film AMERICAN BEAUTY.. ROAD TO PERDITION is a trajedy, &amp; can compare to the other great trajedies of stage, books &amp; film. The production is flawless, the acting superb, tight editing &amp; a great music score will be rewarded next Oscar time, 'Tom Hanks &amp; the lad who plays his son are sure to be nominated as well as Mendes &amp; Paul Newman my even get a nomination. Jude Laws role is very short, But he too excells, The cinematography is in shaded tones, similiar to Sepia-tone, a process common to the `30s. Highly recommended for film lovers. Special note, even though there is violence,it is handled so expertlyit comes acrossperfectly, The final big shoot out is done without without sound &amp; is so much more effective..rating **** 98/100 points IMDb 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this film was interesting while I watched it, but afterwards it left a bad taste in my mouth. When I think back on it, the memory is of something very long &amp; boring. Even the many shooting scenes were dull. Tom Hanks is a cold blooded killer so why should viewer's give a fat rat's ass about him? Paul Newman (with those blood shot, weather-beaten blue eyes of his) walks through his role with little effort. Jennifer Jason Leigh has very little to do &amp; looks as though she's wondering, "What am I doing here?" On the plus side, great attention was paid to detail for a very 1931 look &amp; feel. But the storyline is as boring as the day is long. You just sit there waiting for the next character to get knocked off. I didn't find the killings or what happened in between those scenes very entertaining.</fullReview>

When Paul Newman said that none of them were going to get to heaven, he hit the nail on the head.The performances were small and intense (except for Jude Law's which was the only one I did not like).

		<fullReview>To put it simply this is a great movie it has superb acting and an awesome story. The characters are also very well devolped. For example Mike Sulivan even though he is a hitman and is probally giong to hell you still fell that there is some good in him and that he is not the horrible person who he is made out to be. If there is one thing i think could have been better it was the ending. Its a great ending no doubt about it, but i just wanted to see Tom Hanks go up to that cottage and pull out a tommy gun light a cigar and waste every living thing inside of it. Last the acting deserve a whole lot of credit. Tom hanks is awesome like always, Paul Newman makes a perfect crime boss, and Jude Law is a perfect deranged killer. in all this was a great gangster movie that had oscar stamped all over it since the first scence.

		<shortDescription>Lush and refreshing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a summer filled with insincere and oftentimes downright cruel heists of our trust, time, and money, it's refreshing to feel a blast of fresh air as revitalizing and reinvigorating as Road to Perdition. With dirty bombs like Goldmember and Men in Black 2 detonating hither and thither, the value of the American film is rapidly deteriorating as 2002 lumbers greedily on. The first real gangster film to be released since Martin Scorecese's flimsy remake of Goodfellas, Casino, Road to Perdition may lack the constant violence and testosterone of Nicholas Pileggi's somewhat predictable novel, but it replaces all the swearing and hookers and coke with a real sense of style, storytelling and professionalism. Tom Hanks takes a role we needed to see him in, just to assure us that yes, he truly is a fantastic and versatile actor and no, he not will trip and fall into the sappy film rut and market his heartwarming multi-million dollar face cheaply and insincerley like Kevin Spacey has done as of recently. In Road to Perdition we see a new Hanks, a weary assassin in the 1930s, the blood of thousands on his hands. He has traded his soul for the security and safety of his family, which all of which is going to be shattered soon regardless of his loyalty and honesty.Sam Mendes's direction here displays his flourishing, lush and meticulous technical style really yielding some earthshaking artistic progression. Scene after scene screams with style and burnt itself itno my neocortex. Inventive and brooding camerawork finds a chilling union with dark and lavish set design, supported by a sturdy backbone of inspired storytelling. The plotline of the film revolves around the union of Hanks and his eldest son, forced to huddle together and hit the road, surviving as they go, running from evil betrayers, seeking redemption in the unsentimental avenues of Depression era Chicago, roadside diners, delapidated farmhouses and ivory beaches. The story is well crafted and well written. It is subtle, violent, uncompromising and at the same time heartfelt. It beats with heartfelt emotion and resonates with the unapologetic thundeclap of gunfire. It is not afraid to depict graphic violence, but it never goes over the top. Even the bloodiest scenes somehow feel tasteful and necesarry.Paul Newman's character is a stunning example of what an aging craftsman can still produce in this field. There is truly no other word for his performance rather than earthshaking. The anger, the compassion, the emotional turmoil, the regret, the sorrow, the acceptance, the professionalism. Newman sternly gives talentless and arrogant hacks like Mike Myers and David Arquette, who star in films opening opposite Perdition a bloody tommygunning. A truly magnificent performance.Other notable performances come from Jude Law, Stanley Tucci and the WONDERFUL Dylan Baker.Road to Perdition is a powerhouse of emotion and restrained energy. It stains the screen in crimson that will never wash away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Warning: possible spoilers (Sorry, I generally try to avoid spoilers, but I have to vent about this movie, and I don't think I can avoid it)This is a good movie. It is frustrating because it could have been, should have been, a GREAT movie. It fails to move beyond mere goodness by the timidity with which the filmmaker approaches the ultimate destiny of its main characters. You could foretell the ending halfway through. Afterwards, a woman behind me in the theatre said "It ended the way it had to." She intended it as a compliment. I agreed with her, but I saw it as an indictment. Unlike "The Godfather", "The Road to Perdition" tidies everything up in a nice package. The filmmaker lacked the courage to allow moral ambiguity to remain, or for the characters to really change. At the end of the film, we are left with no questions remaining about the characters and their futures. There is no sense of "What happens next?" (This is in contrast to Mendes' "American Beauty," which really *was* a great movie.) Great themes (violence, honor, the relationship between fathers and sons, whether blood is thicker than water) are trotted out, examined, and neatly resolved.So what makes this movie good? Great performances, stellar visuals. Tom Hanks can't really play completely despicable, but he comes pretty close a number of times in this movie. Paul Newman is terrific as an old man with no illusions. And Tyler Hoechlin, as the younger Michael Sullivan, turns in the best performance by a juvenile actor since Haley Joel Osment in "The Sixth Sense." Jude Law brings new meaning to the term creepy as a psychopathic crime photographer. (The makeup people deserve special kudos for making someone as classically handsome as Law so unpleasant to look at.)The movie is an incredibly visual experience. The visual evocation of time and place -- a midwestern winter during the Depression -- is superlative. I only wish that were enough, but the predictability of the ending undermines the movie as a whole. I left the theatre grieving --not for the characters, but for the truly great movie that might have been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not so great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this highly touted film, Paul Newman (at his most geezerish) plays John Rooney, a big-time Midwestern mob boss in 1931 who's a father figure to Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks), his absolutely loyal gunman and collector. Sullivan is a stern, respectable husband and father until Rooney's jealous son Connor (Daniel Craig) sets him up for a fall, in the process killing Sullivan's wife and one of his two sons. Sullivan and Michael Jr. (Tyler Hoechlin) take it on the lam, with father teaching son how to be an accomplice in robbing banks, which he needs in order to get his revenge. This activity attracts the attention of Frank Nitti, boss of the Chicago Outfit (ever-suave Stanley Tucci in a typically fine performance), and a paid assassin, Harlan "The Reporter" Maguire (Jude Law), a most unlikely killer. This film attempts to succeed at several levels, doesn't at any, except for the period design, though it does provide a fair amount of entertainment. Director Sam Mendes simply doesn't spend enough time and caring to develop the many themes--including father/son with Rooney and Sullivan, father/son with Sullivan and Sullivan, guilt/innocence with Sullivan and Sullivan, little guy vs. The Organization, bank robber as Robin Hood, to name a few. Violence is considerable, although the biggest shootout is ridiculously stylized. The big question for everyone is: Is Tom Hanks credible as a mob killer? The answer is Yes, but in a limited way. Hanks deals with this anomaly by maintaining a single expression--sullen, unbending seriousness--for more than half the film. Even when he finds his wife and son murdered, he screams off-screen. Once he and his son take it on the lam, he unbends a little and gets a tiny bit closer to Michael Jr. But it's soon clear that Jr. is really just his accomplice. I won't give away the ending, but you'll soon enough figure it out. Not bad, but I can't see why so many are so leaped up about it. 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well The Road To Perdition was a great movie, the story was great and the charachters were excellent. Like Jude Law, he had that evilness to him, like he looked possesed. Tom Hanks who played Michael Sullivan was great. He was like a pretty nice guy who did very bad things for John Rooney who was played by all time great Paul Newman. Great chemistry right. Paul Newman played John Rooney who was the boss for Micheal who is a family man and a pretty nice guy though he hires people to kill people or talk to them. Again great chemistry. Michael son Michael was great. He went through a lot in the movie well both Michael's did. The cinematography of this film was excellent. The movie had a great story and that Michael didn't want his son to have a hard life like he did, or live a life like he is. That's how i sumed up the moral that dad's don't want thier son's to live a life like they did when they were younger or how thier life is now. The movie was great and you should see the movie i gave it a 9 in the voting. Everybody was great and it is probably going to be a big oscar film. So you should see the movie. It was great. Oh and thier really wasn't really anything wrong with the movie rather then the guys that don't do anything curse all the time and the guys who do a lot barely curse. So again go see the movie it was great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well Made but Not Without its Flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If nothing else, "Road to Perdition" is probably technically the best film made this year. On these merits alone, the film deserves a good rating. However, it excels in other areas, but also falters in some. The acting and the bulk of the plot are fantastic, but a few areas bothered me.The story is about hitman Mike Sullivan (Tom Hanks), who works for local mob boss John Rooney (Paul Newman). Sullivan's son Michael (Tyler Hoechlin) hides in the car when his father goes out "to work", and ends up witnessing what his dad really does for a living. The rest of the movie moves between action, thriller, and drama, with the father-son elements.The lighting and camerawork are beautiful in this movie. The shots of the town in winter, the aerial view of the car driving along the highway - all of these are superb. Some excellent long takes are used, and there are few poorly executed shots in the film at all.Along with this, every actor plays their role perfectly. Hanks manages to pull it off, although it is difficult to accept him as kind of a "bad guy", which is one of my problems with the movie. Newman is superb as usual, as is Hoechlin, Daniel Craig, and Jude Law, who also plays a hitman.The problem is that the film wanders too much into the area of trying to make Hanks a "good guy", although his actions will force the viewer to believe otherwise. Yes, he loves his family and his son, and does everything he can for them. However, he is a cold-blooded killer, and the movie never resolves the fact that he is.The flaw of the mixed signals that the movie sends is overcome by its technical merits, the acting, and most of the story. All of this aside, it does provide a solid two hours of entertainment.*** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WELL-MADE, VISUALLY STUNNING GANSTER FILM</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although "Road to Perdition" didn't have the originality, the shocks, the controversy, or the emotion of "American Beauty," the first film by director Sam Mendes, it was an interesting, somewhat new and captive way of telling a classic American tale of a criminal/father in post-depression America. The highlight of the film for me was the stunning cinematography. Conrad Hall, also the cinematographer for American Beauty, really has a chance to work his magic in this film. Beautiful shots of the ocean and snow covered trees were an artwork, not to mention what may become a very famous cinematic scene where gun shots are only bursts of light seen through the heavy rain fall--bodies fall not with a thump, not as a reaction to a loud tommy-gun, but fall gracefully and in silence. Some critics say this approach was trying to stylize a classic theme, and that only the best films will prove themselves because the film itself will be what's stylistic, not the camera shots. Personally, I liked the new touches on the gangster theme that this film presented. As far as the acting goes, the definite highlight of the film for me was Paul Newman as Rooney, a town crime boss. Jude Law was also great as a determined hitman, although his part in the movie felt minor and understated. Tom Hanks, as the silent, no-emotion gangster errand boy in the beginning of the film was just what it should have been, and the more into the film you get the more he opens up as a father, and as an actor in a theatrical performance--in other words, almost any actor could have pulled off the performance Hanks did for the first part of the film. He was hard faced, hard working, and never showed emotion. But Hanks really only became wonderful once the father side of him opened--that's when the acting became noticeably good. Although the ending of the film was somewhat predictable to some people, it wasn't at all to me--but I'm not the type of person who is constantly guessing the ends of films--I like to just let the story carry me, and I loose myself in the plot, so I usually am surprised with endings, and this one was plenty surprising. By the end of the film I felt that I had been on a unique journey alongside a father and son. I liked the way both Hanks and his son mature during the trip, learn life lessons, and learn about one another--all in the context of a very exciting, action packed, revenge-based plot. For those worried about violence and gore, this film doesn't exaggerate things. The film is violent when it needs to be, and uses the violence to make a point about the life of both Hanks and his son. Yes, it's a violent film, but it's not stomach turning nor is it fit for the Disney channel. I highly recommend this film, but just don't expect "The Godfather". Mendes is a brilliant new director, and American Beauty was incredible, but although this movie is very solid and well made, it won't change your life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I heard one review of the film compare it to the Godfather. Close, but no cigar. The Godfather was actually fairly original, showing gangsters in a family setting. It had a dynamite cast,wonderfully laid out plot elements,and was very entertaining. Road To Perdition had hints of these things, only not done as well. Aside from a few twists, the plot's revenge theme is nothing new-it wasn't new when used in The Crow, another favorite of mine. The cast all did a fine job, with a nod given to Tyler Hoechlin, the kid who played Hanks' son. Also, spoiler here, how many horror movies have you seen where somebody you thought was dead,comes back at the end to take one last shot at the good guy. The same thing happened in Die Hard. So, own it's own, great flick. But no Godfather.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot of people probably went to see "Road to Perdition" simply for the fact that Sam Mendes directed. I know that's why I went to it. The fact that it has Tom Hanks and Paul Newman in it and that it's a gangster movie are pretty attractive too, so I probably would have seen it had it been placed under someone else's direction; but tonight, I had Mendes on the mind.Exposition seems pretty obsolete here on the imdb because loads of other people will have already done that for me and a lot of the people reading this will be reading it because they want to see how many people liked or didn't like a movie they did or didn't. So until I get paid for it, I'll spare myself that aspect of my review.For the most part, the cast is well known and highly respectable and we know that these people are going to do a good job in just about anything. And here they do that, as one might suspect.So much of the scrutiny directed towards the movie will be focused towards Mendes because he made such an assured debut. So does "Road" measure up to "American Beauty"? I don't think so. But the latter was pretty amazing, so I'm no going to begrudge Mendes for following something great with something that's simply good.I liked "Road to Perdition." I liked the story. I liked the cast and its dynamic. I loved how it looked. But something WAS missing. Unlike "American Beauty", "Road to Perdition" lacks identification between audience and film. Not everybody is like gangsters, some might say, so how can one expect one to identify with the plights they face. "The Godfather" got it right. The Corleones were gangsters, yes, but they were isolated in their own sort of world that held many parallels to that of the general population. In "Road" we never forget who's really good or (mostly) bad and that creates a lack of sympathy, I think. Part of what Lester Burnham wanted was wrong but oh, how we identified with him."Road to Perdition" was good and I'm glad I saw it. Its heart was in the right place and it's a respectable production. And I await Mendes next effort as eagerly as this one.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As close to greatness as humanly possible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There have been few movies I have looked forward to as much as Sam Mendes's sophomore follow up to the Oscar-winning American Beauty. In fact, there hasn't been a single movie I have looked forward to with such anticipation and eagerness. When I walked into the theater, I expected greatness; not American Beauty greatness but greatness nonetheless. When I exited the theater, I was as close to absolutely satisfied as one can be without truly experiencing the feeling of absolute satisfaction.With Road to Perdition, Mendes proves he is no one-time fluke like Michael Cimino or Hugh Hudson. He admirably changes distances with quick cuts that synchronize perfectly with the sounds that go on during the scene; and this is only one of the many interesting directorial techniques used by the one-time theater director.The film begins with Michael Sullivan Jr. (Tyler Hoechlin in a performance that seems shaky at first but pulls through in the clutch) standing on a beach in front of a beautiful array of clouds explaining his father in as few words as possible. It's not until young Michael witnesses his father, Michael Sr. (Tom Hanks), less-than-brutally murder two men does the film really begin to take off. The film quickly alters itself from a family drama to a gangster thriller in an expected transition.Hanks's performance is much like the Bruce Willis performances in both of his collaborations with Sixth Sense and Unbreakable director M. Night Shyamalan. However, unlike Willis, the entire time you watch Hanks, you don't really consider him under-acting because you know he is capable of so much more. As difficult as it is to attempt to accept Forrest Gump as a man with few morals, Hanks pulls it off commendably.Paul Newman portrays John Rooney, the local hero/mob boss whose son becomes responsible for the vicious murder of Sullivan's wife (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and younger son, Peter. Daniel Craig plays the part of Conner Rooney, Newman's less than intelligent son, in what could easily become his breakthrough role. While his acting seemed to be sub-par, his villainous expression begs the audience to hate him.Jude Law adds to the mix as a sick-minded assassin/photographer of the dead. His performance is not as good as his Dicky Greenleaf in The Talented Mr. Ripley but it is definitely one that brings him closer to the A-list.While the performances of the stars of Road to Perdition are certainly memorable, the real star of the film is Conrad L. Hall whose cinematography outshines anything he's done in the past thirty years. Hall has almost guaranteed himself an Oscar nomination and has my vote so far this year.Road to Perdition may be no Godfather or Goodfellas, but in the days of special effects and poor screenwriting, it stands alone as the greatest gangster movie of the past decade.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw the cast of this movie I was pretty pumped up to see it.But when I saw the film it was actually not upto the expectations.From Hanks and Newman you would'nt have expected this sort of movie.It was an okay movie with a script written in such a way that did not require Newman or Hanks to act to their potential.Not that this film is a disappointment yet it is not an oscar worthy film nor are the performances oscar worthy.One thing which surely is excellent is its cinematography.The rain pouring down,cars scrolling on the roads,the sunshine finding its way through the curtains all is excellent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Irish Godfather</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The meaning of word powerful could be by itself describe this outstanding crime genre movie. Road to Perdition, may be considered one of the handfull of successful crime movies made ever since the Godfather Trilogy. The movie is about loyalty, betrayal, and nonetheless revenge.After an incident whereas Mike's (Tom Hanks) son Michael Sullivan, Jr. had witnessed a murder committed by Mike and his partner, his wife and his youngest son are the victims of a murder themselves that was intended for Michael.Despite being a loyal 'employee' to his 'father' he had no choice to avenge his wife and kids death at all costs.The audience will probably never witness such remarkable performance by Tom Hanks depicted as an avengueful man with nothing to lose. Moreover, the audience will probably never spot Tom Hanks in such a powerful crime movie as this.All the puzzle pieces falls into place although the cost of it was a tragic fall. The movie was excellent, I gave it a 10/10 because of its great plot, and directing.I'd recommend anybody to watch this movie if you are into mobster movies.However, this movie differs greatly from other mobster movies that deals with drugs, loan sharking etc. it's more of a story of an irish who was betrayed by his own friends.</fullReview>

This is a film that you will walk out of the theater thinking that you got your money's worth (and you did) but don't put it in any Hall of Fames. This does not on IMDB's top 200.

		<shortDescription>No gangster cliches here.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never really liked Tom Hanks. Ever since "Bachelor Party" and "Nothing in Common" where his characters are so self-important and shallow it makes you sick. He has mellowed with the years and more important roles have given him the opportunity to practice his craft.Ok, now I like Tom Hanks. This film really provides a marvelous character for Hanks to portray. No self-importance here. He is a father, first and foremost. A Man without a father of his own, putting his faith in a bad substitute father (Newman).Thrown together for six weeks on the road together, Hanks and his Son are more like a crime team than family. This may be the weakest link in the film.Hanks does not show a lot of emotion, which is fine, but then again he does not show a cold, calculated side either, and in his business he would certainly need not have much of a conscience. He is an orphan and put his trust in a bad man, someone that could provide a life for him and his family, so he does what he is told. This makes Hanks' character great. The machine that has been started cannot be stopped, yet throughout he retains his humanity and his love of his child, and most importantly, the desire to have his child not turn out like him.His son comforts him the way he never did or could.The film is beautifully photographed by Conrad Hall, who has a history with Paul Newman (Butch Cassidy, and Cool hand Luke.)Period pieces, especially set in this century are challenging (because we really know how it should look) and and admirable job was done in the set design and costume department (Except for the Aluminum sided L train in Chicago.)Sam Mendes has really achieved a unique perspective on the prohibition era gangster world. Where so many movies have used hackneyed cliches of the Chicago gangsters, this movie absolutely shines. The characters are very well crafted and Newman and Hanks are definitely on course for Oscar time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's the Depression (not now, in the film) and the Sullivan family is living quite well under the umbrella of the Irish mob's leadership of John Rooney (Paul Newman). Irish mob? would that make him a donald? Mike Sullivan (Tom Hanks) is a loyal but passionless enforcer in Rooney's army who seems to have detached himself from his duties, which is the only way the audience will accept Hanks in the role of a killer. Can we let this perennial hero portrays a psychopath? I doubt it. He's doing a job he hates, but it's one he does well. Does that describe some of us? So far, but I hope yours doesn't border on crimes against humanity.This happy little film takes you on the road with the two Mikes, father and son, for 6 weeks in the winter across scenic northern Illinois prairie. Think flat, brown, rain, shapeless woolens and smarmy characters. Tragedy has drawn them together and driven them away from their old life, and they can have no hopes of ever returning. The father is determined to get revenge and the son becomes an unwitting partner to his dad. These two Mikes are developing a unique bond, with the father passing along his survival skills to the son. You'll find "classic" moments that we've all learned from our dads like distinguishing between the clutch and the accelerator, how to behave at a wake and driving a getaway car. Lessons we'll never forget.Jennifer Jason Leigh has a role that's so undeveloped we wonders what really happened to her lines. Jude Law morphs into a reptilian artiste who captures his victims on film. His slouching gait and smarmy visage provides the tragic-comic relief in this Shakespearean tragedy. Paul Newman plays the patriarch who runs his tribe with elegance and style that's also picked up by Stanley Tucci who plays an erudite Frank Nitti as a mob boss who seems to have acquired an MBA. And young Tyler Hoechlin grows with his role. Great story, fine cast, talented director and perfect timing so how can it miss? John Rooney may be describing his own experience when he laments, `Sons are put on this earth to trouble their fathers. ` But is he describing Michael Sullivan's? You be the judge.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually Stunning, But An Overall Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know what audience this movie is trying to reach. As a gangster film, the action scenes are gripping but one must endure long dramatic scenes between. And for those who hope to enjoy a boy-bonds-with-his-dad drama, I'm afraid that they won't appreciate the violence. To top it off, Perdition has pretensions of being an art-house film.Visually, the movie is quite stunning and artful. One would expect this of a film directed by Sam Mendes who also directed American Beauty. The acting is first rate across-the-board. Character development was weak. And if you're looking for sex or nudity (basic elements of a good movie, in my opinion), look elsewhere.And am I the only person who found the score to be heavy-handed? The violins wailed and the piano rang out in every single scene. Rather than supporting the action on the screen, the score was intrusive and annoying. No kidding, there is a scene where the piano reaches a grand fortissimo as Tom Hanks simply opens a garage door to hop in his car.Claudia's Bottom Line: Would have been better as a straight gangster movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is Sam Mendes's second feature film, the first being the exquisite American Beauty. Road is a gorgeous piece of work--a classic gangster movie shot like a painting by Conrad Hall (who also shot Beauty), in which, as Mendes himself says, the landscape and weather are another character. Tom Hanks, Paul Newman, and Jude Law as well as the rest of the cast, including the kid (Tyler Hoechlin) who plays Hanks's son, are first rate. It's an ordinary enough story--based on a graphic novel and much like a dark comic book with little character development, but then it's a gangster movie!--but it is conceived and presented with such painstaking care to every visual and sound detail (score by Thomas Newman, also of Beauty) that you can't take your eyes off the screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually impressive, but despite all the blood, betrayal, and mayhem--and the urban industrial setting--the movie is not at all gritty.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) is an enforcer and exterminator for his gang boss and father figure, John Rooney (Paul Newman). Trouble is, he is being betrayed and, ultimately, hunted down by his brother figure, Connor Rooney (Daniel Craig), who is himself a kind of a Richard Widmark figure. Connor goes gunning for Michael, with tragic consequences for the Sullivan family. Michael and his son, Michael Jr. (Tyler Hoechlin), go on the lam, robbing banks of their ill-gotten deposits from the Capone gang. As a result, they are pursued by yet another gunman (Jude Law) who works for Capone, and who seems to be trying to meld his hobby of photography with his profession as a hired killer. Pere and fils hope to fight their way through to perdition--well, that's Perdition-on-the-Lake, where Aunt Sarah has a nice house and a dog waiting for them, at least for Junior. There are enough cold-blooded murders in this movie to keep theaters cool through Labor Day, despite that the story is essentially about the relationships between fathers and sons, and how maybe some good can come out of even the worst of lives.But the movie is aimed more toward the eyes than the heart. I haven't seen the graphic novel (so-called, I suppose, because of having better production values than a regular comic book), but I bet I could pick out 90% of its panels from the movie, which seems to move from panel to panel. Not that there's anything wrong with that. The shots are well-composed and effectively lit, and I thoroughly enjoyed the film as a moving "comic". It is stylish, if you're looking for that, but not at all realistic, if you're looking for that. The setting is somewhere in the Calumet Region just south and east of Chicago, a land of steel mills, oil refineries, gambling and prostitution and, at the time of this story, speakeasies. I grew up near there and wish director Mendes had taken more advantage of the exteriors heavy industry can provide for a gangster movie such as this. When all the mills and plants and refineries are going full blast, they could provide inspiration for the graphic novel version of Dante's "Inferno", with perdition to spare. It was awe-inspiring, but nowadays is considerably quieter and a whole lot rustier. There are also some nice shots of the flat prairies of northeastern Illinois and northwestern Indiana (supposedly so, at least--it sure looks like my old stomping grounds) and the lovely dunes at the southern tip of Lake Michigan. And a flatland crossroads that looks suspiciously like the one in Hanks' "Cast Away", or, more appropriately, in Hitchcock's "North by Northwest". It brought a tear of nostalgia to this old flatlander's eye.I recommend this one as a theatrical, visual delight. But, despite all the blood, betrayal, and mayhem--and the urban industrial setting--the movie is not at all gritty.</fullReview>

He can say more with his eyes, than most actors can say with their mouths. This is something that I first really noticed during Saving Private Ryan, and it really works here. This is a trait of Newman's as well, especially in his last frame of the movie. I can't praise this movie enough.

I found the ending of the movie implausible and a little silly. All the symbolic nonsense about redemption was tiresome and overblown. Many reviews, perhaps taking cues from the movie's press releases, compared "Road" to "The Godfather" and "Bonnie and Clyde." "Road" is simply not in that league. I think of it more in the category of solid, but not especially great movies such at De Palma's "The Untouchables."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie soars on most every possible level. The photography is incredible. The visuals are stunning. The script is well-designed, the acting is superb, and the directing is top-notch.This is a story of one man's battle with the mob, but more importantly it is a story about fathers and sons. While it is a thoroughly enjoyable gangster movie; it is an incredibly made movie about what it means to be a man raising a man.Tom Hanks, playing against type, performs splendidly as Michael Sullivan. His eyes are so cold you question whether it is actually Hanks on the screen. His scowl is so perfect that when he breaks the mask for a quick half smile at the end of the movie, you realize it is the first time he has smiled all film.Newman does well as the old mob patriarch. You may look at Jude Law for a good five minutes before it dawns on you that it is actually Jude Law (he is that good). Stanley Tucci is reliably solid as an actor, and this movie is no different.The real jewel of this movie is Mendes. Proving that his success with American Beauty was no fluke, he comes at you with a violent movie with a soul. Mendes' genius is that he is accessibly artsy. His color texturing and soundtrack use catch you sometimes without you even knowing it. Mendes may be the best filmmaker in the world today.If you enjoy gangster movies, see this. It may be the best since The Godfather. If you enjoy well-acted movies, see this. If you enjoy wonderfully directed movies, see this. If you have blood in your veins, see this movie.Road to Perdition gets 10/10 from me.</fullReview>

Whereas the Godfather films are characterized by an epic storyline and multiple well-realized characters, Road seems to be more intimate and definitely hinges upon the performance of its central character played by Hanks. The themes explored in this film are timeless, but using the backdrop of organized crime in the Depression era to explore them is a stroke of genius. The cinematography is simply gorgeous with light, water and blood used to great effect as modes of artistic expression. Enough cannot be said for the performers and their dead-on portrayals. Paul Newman and Jude Law give memorable supporting performances and should be remembered come Oscar time. Tom Hanks continues to amaze in a role that on the surface would seem unsuitable to his everyman image.

		<fullReview>Without a doubt The Road to Perdition is a movie full of great performances and stunning visuals and a story that is well worth paying inflated movie prices to see, however it is a shame that this movie is so good without being great. This movie is like driving on a rough and worn road through the most exquisite scenery.Perdition is about a man corrupt by violence learning how to be a father and trying to prevent his son from entering the same corrupt world he is in. It's a classic love over violence story and it's technical side displays a true understanding and mastery of visuals (probably due to Conrad Hall, arguably the best cinematographer of all time, and Sam Mendes, a true visionary and artist). However, this piece seems to wallow too much in vision and not enough in heart. The tone of the piece comes off as a bit pretentious. The vision of the piece consumes all else and doesn't really make room for enough true humanity.Despite Hanks and Newmans excellent performances, I never really felt particularly attached to either one. Instead I felt distant from them. In most good movies I'm drawn into the film. It feels more like I'm experiencing it instead of just observing it. I never felt like more that an observer in this movie. It heavy handedness just kept pushing me away.However it's still good, it's just not great and it's definitely not the best gangster movie ever. But I do believe that all should see this movie and the bigger the screen you get to see it on the better.</fullReview>

How could you not expect, once Hanks and his son set off on theirjourney, that Hanks will end up dead in the end? The annoyingbookend narration lets this "surprise" out early.Also, the movie wore its spiritual message on its sleeve, insteadof making it more a part of the film.

You just didn't see the mess.Paul Newman was incredible. Despite the fact that he usually plays the hero of his films, he was able to carry off the bad guy role superbly. The same could be said about Tom Hanks. Jude Law melted into his character so seamlessly, he was almost unrecognizable.I really enjoyed this film.

		<fullReview>The limit of 1,000 words for comments is certainly greater than the total dialogue in THE ROAD TO PERDITION. The prime plot devise is not what the characters say to one another, but how they are arranged in space and light. In fact, most of what IS said could have been eliminated for all intents and purposes, leaving the camera to tell the story. The acting triumph is how "verbal" actors such as Hanks, Leigh, Tucci, and Newman make their impact without words and without pandering to the camera. The real "star" of the movie is the overwhelming darkness of everything. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I tried hard to find a character with "light hair" and "fair complexion." Only Newman might qualify, but his coloration is the effect of age in this movie and not his famous "blonde and blue." Every single scene is under lit and most space is either crowded or cramped into corners. Even the "opened up" final scene focuses on the tree line and the house instead of the water, and the light is artificial--digital?--in its feeling. The movie takes us away from our normal locus in film and asks us to almost photographically engage light and composition. Certainly the Coen brothers did some of this in O, BROTHER! and THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE, but not to the almost exclusive use of composition and light set forth by Mendes and (I hope when credit is due, credit is given) his lighting designers and cinematographers. It's brilliant and different, though not unique. The most direct analogy as far as I can remember is DAYS OF HEAVEN, Terrence Malick's 1978 tour de force (done with the incomparable Nestor Almendros). However, in this case, "varieties" of light instead of "types" of dark made up the scenes and open spaces predominated in the composition. (I could be wrong about this distinction since it's been almost 24 years.)DAYS was Malick's second major film, as ROAD is Mendes's. One could argue Malick's BADLANDS was a "domestic" drama as was AMERICAN BEAUTY; then DAYS addressed power and morality as ROAD does. I hope Mendes doesn't follow his predecessor into more than 20 years of obscurity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Film!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the quietest "gangster" film I've ever seen. Everyone played their part with great restraint. No overacting here at all. It was almost downright peaceful. And although there was a certain amount of violence (what gangster film would be complete without violence?), it wasn't gory or overly bloody. You knew what was happening. You just didn't see the mess.Paul Newman was incredible. Despite the fact that he usually plays the hero of his films, he was able to carry off the bad guy role superbly. The same could be said about Tom Hanks. Jude Law melted into his character so seamlessly, he was almost unrecognizable.I really enjoyed this film. I am predisposed to liking all films about gangsters, but this one is good enough to make a believer out of anyone who sees it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Gangster/Road/ Film Destined for Classic Stature!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is almost uncanny how Tom Hanks can keep pulling off compelling film roles. This great actor does it again as Mike Sullivan. Probably Hank's darkest character yet but with depth and humanity. You probably know the storyline by now so I won't go into it here. Kudos also goes to Paul Newman ,Jude Law and Tyler Hoechlin as young Mike Jr. Oscar nods will surely go to Hanks(once again) and Newman. I wouldn't be surprised to see Law get a nomination as well. Anyone that can personify evil that slyly deserves an award. This film as all the workings of a masterpiece; directing,cinematography,mood,editing are way above the top. I can't say it is better then THE GODFATHER, as one reviewer has, but it is on even ground. This film is destined for a Classic status.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie caught me by surprise because I thought I knew what to expect going in, and I was dead wrong. Sam Mendes has done it again, in that he has taken on a well-worn genre and put his own magic touch on it. The best thing about the movie is Tom Hanks, although Tyler Hoechlin and Paul Newman bring incredible performances to the table, too. Jude Law is okay in this role, but I found his character and the whole part of the plot revolving around him to be the weakest parts of the movie. I just didn't buy it the way I bought practically everything else about this really good movie. With that said, the scene between Law and Hanks in the diner is easily one of the most emotionally intense moments in movies I've seen in a long time. That bead of sweat should get an Oscar. I haven't read the source material, though I'm a big comic book fan. I'm eager to find the graphic novel and read it after seeing the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but over-hyped</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Road to Perdition is indeed a very good movie. I definitely agree with everyone that has praised Hanks and Newman, and I would be very surprised if they didn't receive Oscar nominations. This is NOT, however, the Godfather, and isn't really even in the same league as it. People have been talking about an ensemble cast, but I would be inclined to disagree. Yes, there were numerous good performances, but Hanks and Newman steal the show. Everyone else in the movie is dwarfed by them. This isn't really the fault of the other actors, it's just the nature of the story and the roles. Nevertheless, I think this factor held the movie back a little. The standard of comparison seems to be to the Godfather, and in this department it's not even close. As many viewers have said, yes, Jude Law is creepy. He played the part very well, but I don't consider it to be anything special. Creepy villains are fairly standard, and although good, this is just another one.SPOILERS AHEAD IN NEXT PARAGRAPHThe thing in the film that bothered me most was the scene on the beach following Sullivan's death. The kid is standing in front of the ocean, which is a trite scene if there ever was one, but that was still OK. Then he spoke. "I realized that my father's greatest fear was I would be like him. I never touched a gun again" (or something close to that). These lines were ridiculous. The action and previous dialogue already made this very clear. When Micheal Jr. was pointing a gun at Jude Law, everyone in the theater knew why it was a big moment, particularly after Newman's "make sure he can get to heaven" line. Making Michael overtly make that statement was the cinematic equivalent of beating the unobservant audience members over the head with a stick. Admittedly, this is a minor thing, but it's once again a minor thing that The Godfather stayed away from. I have absolutely no problem with the father theme, and I loved the line about "I say he was my father." But that was enough.Despite my complaints, this is a very good movie that everyone should see. Watch it for a good story and for Newman and Hanks. Just don't watch it for another Godfather or, for that matter, American Beauty. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As Road to Perdition begins to unravel, you learn that Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) isn't an ordinary guy. He's afraid to tell his children about his occupation, and thus the inevitable occurs. As the decisive events happen, the viewer is carried in a waterfall of tragedies and shocking scenes. This movie has the cinematographic quality of any A-list movie in the last 10 years. Thomas Newman's score actually scores, providing excellent mood to the pace and environment of the movie. Tyler Hoechlin gives a believable performance as Michael Sullivan's curious son. Tom Hanks returns with another striking performance, excellently portraying his disturbed and disturbing character. Paul Newman plays a good John Rooney, accurately showing a confused, almost psychopathic son-of-a-gangster. The screenplay is intelligent, simplistic, and does not bother with boring clichés. Overall, I believe this movie will receive a handful of Oscar nominations, including, God forbid, another best actor nomination for Tom Hanks.</fullReview>

HOWEVER, the director's skills and eye are exceptional and fantastic and basically hold the film together over its two-hour length.

The directing was strong and steady, despite the fact that every character in the film loves stand in the rain with a wet gun, yet enter a house or motel or warehouse without a drip of water on the clothing.I put Tyler Hoechlin (Sullivan, Jr.) in the BEST ACTOR slot and perhaps limited within this film with that statement. There was no competition. All other performances are subtle but true to being able to recognized Tom Hanks acting Tom Hanks, Paul Newman acting Paul Newman, etc.This was a NICE film to watch wide screen and in a stadium seating theater that provided lots of opportunities to make whispered wise-cracks without being heard by other movie viewers (we were the only ones seated in this matinee screening!

DVD rental would be more cost-effective and the film will play well on a local television or computer without affecting the viewer's attention.The story fell apart at the flawed ending where everything we learn about the characters is scrapped for a quick exiting. BUT I accept that ending rather than another hour or so of gangster gangsterism. WHICH GOES TO SHOW that a well directed film only needs a few cars, a few country roads, some sound stages and back lots at Universal or Sony or Paramount or wherever (all within my general neighborhood in Los Angeles) and POW a success at the box office.

The extra editing and score time that Mendes took made the movie just that much better. But what makes it great is the story.

		<shortDescription>Maybe not necessarily a 'gangster' movie, but an excellent film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a HUGE fan of Mob / Gangster movies. Scorsese's Goodfellas and Casino, Scarface, and the Godfather series are all what I consider to be some of the best Mob/Gangster movies out there. I'd heard that Road to Perdition was going to be the new best Gangster and knowing of the amazing cast I had to see it.My first thought after the movie was that I wouldn't necessarily call this a Gangster movie in the caliber of Godfather or Goodfellas. This movie (to me) is more a movie about the undeniable relationship between a father and son. Yes, of course this movie is about the mob, but to me what stood out more than "Tom Hanks looks so bad-ass with a tommy gun" is how "Tom Hanks reminds me of my dad," or "The way the little boy will always love is father reminds me of the way I will always feel about my dad." This movie is a near perfect encapsulation of the previously un-definable and intangible relationship between a father and his son.In my opinion, this movie's greatest strength lies in those who bring it to life. Sam Mendes is as gifted as they come in terms of directing and cinematography. There are things done from a directors standpoint in this movie that I have never seen done before, as well as takes already existing directing techniques to new levels. Just like in American Beauty, Sam Mendes holds absolutely nothing back in Road to Perdition. He chooses not to censor anything to the detriment of the movie. During the scene where a woman and child are killed, Sam chooses not to directly film them. Instead, we hear the screams of the mother, we see charaters walk into the room where they lay dead and come out horrified. He communicates this scene to us without pulling a B-movie death scene.I've alread heard some criticize this movie for being too brutal. To their credit, it is brutal. But its tasteful brutality. As I previously said, Mendes communicates that this woman and child were killed, we know its brutal by the scremes of the father who discovers it and by the disconnection experienced by the womans son; we dont' need to see bulletfilled bleeding bodies.Finally (well, not really, but its all I can talk about, less saying "GO SEE IT.") there is the acting. Not a single actor or actress in this movie feels out of place or anything short of one-hundred convincing. Everyone acts to the best of their abilities and once the movie was over I was struggling to find anyone's performance anything less than flawless. Jude Law is an outstanding actor on his own and in this movie he shines as well. Everyone remembers his haunting voice attached to his sickly grinning face and devious persona. Paul Newman is simply oustanding. Every line he delivers is done as if he is the person he's portraying. Hes convincing, powerful, rich and solid in a mobster/godfather role and yet original as well, not appearing as though he's trying to emulate Marlon Brando or Robert De Nero. Tyler Hoechlin, who plays Hank's son, also does an outstanding job as the troubled, confused and saddened child. Simply put, one of the best performances in a big name movie by a "young" child (much unlike StarWarsEpisode1). And finally Tom Hanks. Surprisingly, Tom Hanks actually has very few lines. One of the greatest acheivements in this movie is Sam Mendes's flawless direction of Tom Hanks's acting ability. Hanks communicates volumes with so few words. This whole movie could be considered a "How-To" to communicate so much with almost no words. Facial expressions, camera angles, body language, presperation, ambient noise: its all used to perfection to create an amazing atmosphere, similar to what Coppola did in The Godfather.To me, this movie is so much more than just a mobster movie. Lets face it, no matter how much we loved ScarFace and Goodfellas, we didn't necessarily cry or re-realize some emotional facet of life. This movie teaches everyone not only about the relationship between a father and a son but also about some of the less focused on topics in gangster movies: trust, loyalty, self-perception. Many "mob" or gangster movies tend to focus too much on the killing and Hollywood-esque topics of gangster movies, Road to Perdition comes as a refreshing look at some of the other aspects of the Mob lifestyle. All of this combined with a monument to some of the best acting ability in Hollywood today and you have one excellent movie. Its very hard to find a thing that I disliked about this movie, possibly because of the amazing acting performances delivered by its incredible cast. Its such an amazingly powerful movie, I can't think of someone I would not reccomend this movie to. Go see it, go call you father or son afterwards. He'll be crying too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is very, very over-rated, but still is a movie worth seeing. No Oscars will be won by this movie. It is not a mob or gangster movie either. Road to Perdition is a drama about a father and son, pure and simple. The father just happens to be a hit man. But the movie is actually not an epic, which is a plus, running at about 2 hours made it enjoyable. If you don't feel like seeing garbage like MIB II, Croc Hunter, or Power Puff Girls, then see Perdition and you won't be disappointed.

		<shortDescription>Incredible, Best Film of 2002</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been waiting well over a year to see this film and I was not the least bit disappointed when I finally saw it. This is by far the best thing that I've seen this year, and I think that it's sure to garner many awards as the awards season approaches. After a stunning debut with 1999's "American Beauty," Sam Mendes follows his directoral effort with a film of equal or greater caliber. "Road to Perdition" continues what Mendes started with "American Beauty," and that is establishing himself in terms of style as a director. You can see many of the same creative aspects in comparing both of his films.This is not simply a gory gangster film, it is a story that conjures a vast array of emotions. It questions morality through a complex web of father-son relationships. The leading actors are undoubtedly remarkable, with Paul Newman's spectacular performance as mob patriarch John Rooney and Tom Hanks as his surrogate son Michael Sullivan. Newcomer Tyler Hoechlin makes his mark as Tom Hanks son, with a performance that few child actors can hold a candle to. I'm always skeptical of films that showcase a child in a leading role, because so often their acting is too far from convincing. Hoechlin stands on his own and is responsible for the success much of the film's emotional scenes. Jude Law, so often portraying as the quintessential pretty boy, may very well be the standout of the cast as grotesque and eerie Harlen Maguire, the reporter with a chillingly bizarre obsession and who is hired to track down Michael and his son.I can always tell how good a movie is depending on how often I check my watch while it's playing. At "Road to Perdition," I didn't check my watch once. I was sucked in even as the credits rolled, wishing that it would start all over again. This is definitely a film that I will go back to see again and probably again after that. Even if you don't like gangster films, you will be taken aback by this powerhouse of a movie. I mean, at the very least, who would ever willingly miss a chance to see Paul Newman in all his glory at a staggering 20 feet on the movie screen?? ;o)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>America's nicest hit man learns to share his feelings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On a recent documentary about Martin Scorsese, Paul Newman was glimpsed on the set of ROAD TO PERDITION saying, "And tell Marty to give me a job! I'm not dead yet!"He sure isn't. As John Rooney, the decrepit Irish mob boss who runs a small Midwestern town, Newman uses two-dimensional scenes with forgettable dialogue to print up a small but worthy handbook on how to act. His Rooney has the practiced but slightly worn charm of a mediocre gladhander. When the character strikes pensive Don Corleone poses, he seems to be acutely aware of his cheapness; Newman fashions a continually intriguing portrait of a mafia Willy Loman, until the last quarter of the movie and its torrents of corn drown him out. (He is actually required to say, "One thing we know--none of us will see heaven!"--a godawful line that was inexplicably used the in the climax of the trailer.)As such tales inevitably have it, Rooney has a sociopathic son--his biological son, that is. His adopted son is a devoted hit man on Rooney's payroll--played, inexplicably, and inscrutably, by Tom Hanks. When the sociopath son does some very bad things to Hanks and his family, Hanks grabs his living son and goes on a nighttime journey of revenge. The director, Sam Mendes, and his cinematographer, Conrad Hall, play up the Edward Hopper side of this pulp. The movie feels like a Hong Kong or seventies Italian crime picture given a soupy, sumptuous, middlebrow, Oscar-night deluxe tailoring. Though the tone is chilly and mean-minded, the images are meant to inspire oohs and aahs. The result is a weirdly schizoid mix of the manipulative and the hardboiled that actually makes MILLER'S CROSSING feel as emotionally engaging as THE GODFATHER.What persuaded DreamWorks to tell this peculiarly trite and uninvolving tale to the tune of eighty million dollars? Surely Mendes, whose press makes him seem the epitome of the suave phony sound bite, must have told himself that the movie's theme of moral anguish between fathers and sons elevated the pulpiness to a summit of Tolstoyan severity. But what does the movie really have to say, except that a) remote dads really ought to take the time to get close to their sons--even in the worst of circumstances, and b) gangland killing bad--peace good? (What was the point of Mendes' AMERICAN BEAUTY again? "Live each day as if it might be your last"?)Except for Newman's cool, pocket-hanky aplomb, and Jude Law's dry, Tim Rothian performance as a rotten-toothed Weegee-like crime photographer, I hated everything about this movie-- especially Thomas Newman's alternately New Agey and avalanche-of-schmaltz score. (Can Tom Hanks appear in a movie where his reaction shots are NOT accompanied by a soaring 200- piece orchestra?) Mendes seems like a fraud who's about to be found out. I think in retrospect that Alan Ball's script for AMERICAN BEAUTY made Mendes look slicker than he actually is; his work here betrays his theatre roots--street-corner shootouts and speakeasy dances are staged so stiffly you can conk your head on the proscenium arch. He seems to have no talent for anything cinematic; all the movie's polish is static--it's in Hall's overthought compositions and the fancy-pants production design. And Mendes leaves Hanks at sea without a volleyball. Playing a seemingly unfeeling, unreflective lug at the outset, Hanks just seems miscast in a role designed for a Michael Madsen or Russell Crowe--a glowering lummox later revealed to have a soul. Then, late in the day, when the hit man has to reveal his genuine affection for his son, Hanks has his casual, everyday, nice-family- man quality that throws the movie out of whack. You start remembering it's not really 1931; all the movie's artifice-laden conceits start to give.Hanks needs to make a cheap, non-monumental movie. There is a great actor in there--it could be seen in flashes in CAST AWAY, where his joy in what he was doing partly redeemed the play-it- safe filmmaking. PERDITION must have been intended as a daring departure for him (we see him blowing people's brains out --against white tile, a favorite Mendes image), but he really needs to call up Tom Cruise for some lessons in taking a risk.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Self Conscious Art House Exercise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoiler Warning! Plot elements you might not want to know follow.When viewing any movie for the first time, at some point you realize that either you have been drawn in or not drawn in. After the first half hour I realized this movie was in the "not" category. And when you make that realization, you suddenly become aware of all the sins the movie is expecting you to forgive. This movie is incredibly self-conscious. The producers, director and cinematographer are frantically screaming "This is a great movie", but it is not so. You can make a movie visually stunning, add a soulfully mourning string dominated (and over-cued) musical score, along with some good actors, but greatness will not automatically follow. Heart and soul are difficult to boil down to a recipe, but style over a good script is not the way to go."Road" lacks character motivation as well as sufficient prologue. It also lacks consistency. Sullivan drives all night to reach Chicago so he can offer Mr. Nitti his services and amazingly Mr. Rooney is there waiting for him. How? Sullivan is a professional hit man but doesn't finish off Jude Law's character when he has the chance. Why? Apparently so Sullivan can be killed at the end of the movie and give us all a dramatic moment. There's the house on the beach in Perdition and there's the dog but amazingly no one lives there. So Sullivan, not suspicious at all, stands in front of the window waiting to be shot in one of the most telegraphed movie moments in recent history. More? It pours rain the night Michael Jr. sees the truth about his father but the next day the snow doesn't look like it's seen a drop of rain. Mr. Rooney, who we suppose must have some character required to become a mob boss, embarrasses his son, Connor, at a meeting but later collapses and becomes a total wuss for same son. Sullivan picks off Rooney's bodyguards in the street. None of the bodyguards appear to be smart enough to hide behind the car. But why would they? That scene isn't supposed to make sense, it's supposed to be artsy. In my cynical little book, there is nothing worse than posturing, and this movie from the get-go postures itself as a great Oscar-winning achievement. And for that, it's a zero on any rating scale in existence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved American Beauty and I was looking forward to Mendes' next Masterpiece. Unfortunately Road to Perdition did not fit the bill. Not even Hanks,Newman, and Law could save this film. Most notable Daniel Craig should have received top billing. Unfortunately the well contrived shots were either too lengthy or wasted through pretentious editing. The characters were distant and not relatable. With the exception of one scene, the story is predictably unoriginal and not worthy to be compared to the great mob movies. It did succeed in showing that very fine line between betrayal and loyalty via spoon fed references. Road to Perdition was a skeleton of a plot with cut out characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No perdition, but no redemption, either</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** I would give this lukewarm affair a B/B- rating; in essence, it's what you get if Hollywood thinks they're making an art house movie with a uniquely American bent: the bonding of father and son (over such original items as driving lessons), a total lack of any kind of ambiguities (moral and otherwise), the half-baked attempts at biblical themes and proportions (Cain and Abel, the expulsion from Paradise, a father's sacrifice of his beloved son), the "redemption" of an "evil" man, an incoherent plot with more holes than the surface of the moon (where are the cops? why don't Capone's people simply take out that pesky assassin who wants to kill a mob boss' son? what's with the money Sullivan steals that never gets mentioned again? how on earth could he have hidden out long enough to recuperate without being tracked down? etc. etc. etc. the list could go on indefinitely), a "great" actor (here Tom Hanks) trying to act against type casting but never *quite* managing it (I mean, did anyone seriously believe this guy could finish off people ruthlessly?!? The only thing he did to indicate that he was a killer was to sport a frown on his face that looked like it had been painted on with botox), a "cute" boy who has to grow up fast and who delivers overwrought, pseudo-profound voiceover comments, a stock psychopath (Jude Law with teeth like the Jaws guy from the James Bond movies), a shameless movie score drenching every scene in swelling violins, and a tidy, pat ending that wants to say that, yes, there is redemption out there (if only you can kill the bad guys first?), the lewed fascination with violence, the bad dialogue. It is interesting to note, though, how Sam Mendez made a movie which tries so hard to be affecting, artistic and true and ends up with typically self-conscious Hollywood fare that leaves you *absolutely* cold (in that regard, it's almost as bad as "Schindler's List"). The only potentially moving scene is toward the end when John Rooney is murdered, and even that scene feels wrong to the core (would a mob boss' body guards really be that inefficient? And would a mob boss succumb that easily?) The only two good things: Paul Newman, who is great as always, and the cinematography. But that's not enough to turn a mediocre flick into a great movie. Of course, it's bound to collect all manners of Oscars come March but since when is the Oscar the hallmark of a great movie? Seriously. Hollywood should stick to what it's good at (entertaining flicks that don't place too many demands on your intelligence such as "Independence Day" and "Men in Black") and leave the art house flick to the rest of the world. Incidentally, if you want to see a great movie about a killer getting reformed, rent "The Killer" by John Woo.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe not necessarily a 'gangster' movie, but an excellent film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a HUGE fan of Mob / Gangster movies. Scorsese's Goodfellas and Casino, Scarface, and the Godfather series are all what I consider to be some of the best Mob/Gangster movies out there. I'd heard that Road to Perdition was going to be the new best Gangster and knowing of the amazing cast I had to see it.My first thought after the movie was that I wouldn't necessarily call this a Gangster movie in the caliber of Godfather or Goodfellas. This movie (to me) is more a movie about the undeniable relationship between a father and son. Yes, of course this movie is about the mob, but to me what stood out more than "Tom Hanks looks so bad-ass with a tommy gun" is how "Tom Hanks reminds me of my dad," or "The way the little boy will always love is father reminds me of the way I will always feel about my dad." This movie is a near perfect encapsulation of the previously un-definable and intangible relationship between a father and his son.In my opinion, this movie's greatest strength lies in those who bring it to life. Sam Mendes is as gifted as they come in terms of directing and cinematography. There are things done from a directors standpoint in this movie that I have never seen done before, as well as takes already existing directing techniques to new levels. Just like in American Beauty, Sam Mendes holds absolutely nothing back in Road to Perdition. He chooses not to censor anything to the detriment of the movie. During the scene where a woman and child are killed, Sam chooses not to directly film them. Instead, we hear the screams of the mother, we see charaters walk into the room where they lay dead and come out horrified. He communicates this scene to us without pulling a B-movie death scene.I've alread heard some criticize this movie for being too brutal. To their credit, it is brutal. But its tasteful brutality. As I previously said, Mendes communicates that this woman and child were killed, we know its brutal by the scremes of the father who discovers it and by the disconnection experienced by the womans son; we dont' need to see bulletfilled bleeding bodies.Finally (well, not really, but its all I can talk about, less saying "GO SEE IT.") there is the acting. Not a single actor or actress in this movie feels out of place or anything short of one-hundred convincing. Everyone acts to the best of their abilities and once the movie was over I was struggling to find anyone's performance anything less than flawless. Jude Law is an outstanding actor on his own and in this movie he shines as well. Everyone remembers his haunting voice attached to his sickly grinning face and devious persona. Paul Newman is simply oustanding. Every line he delivers is done as if he is the person he's portraying. Hes convincing, powerful, rich and solid in a mobster/godfather role and yet original as well, not appearing as though he's trying to emulate Marlon Brando or Robert De Nero. Tyler Hoechlin, who plays Hank's son, also does an outstanding job as the troubled, confused and saddened child. Simply put, one of the best performances in a big name movie by a "young" child (much unlike StarWarsEpisode1). And finally Tom Hanks. Surprisingly, Tom Hanks actually has very few lines. One of the greatest acheivements in this movie is Sam Mendes's flawless direction of Tom Hanks's acting ability. Hanks communicates volumes with so few words. This whole movie could be considered a "How-To" to communicate so much with almost no words. Facial expressions, camera angles, body language, presperation, ambient noise: its all used to perfection to create an amazing atmosphere, similar to what Coppola did in The Godfather.To me, this movie is so much more than just a mobster movie. Lets face it, no matter how much we loved ScarFace and Goodfellas, we didn't necessarily cry or re-realize some emotional facet of life. This movie teaches everyone not only about the relationship between a father and a son but also about some of the less focused on topics in gangster movies: trust, loyalty, self-perception. Many "mob" or gangster movies tend to focus too much on the killing and Hollywood-esque topics of gangster movies, Road to Perdition comes as a refreshing look at some of the other aspects of the Mob lifestyle.

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece. Best movie of the year by far.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would like to start this off by saying that every piece of this film oozes with greatness. The acting- Tom Hanks is simply one of the greatest actors of all time and he is beyond incredible in here, Paul Newman is also just great in this, everybody is. The story is simply a masterpiece character study, that entertains throughly. The look of it is also knock-you-socks-off quality, you actually feel as if Hanks &amp; Mendes &amp; company traveled back in time to shoot this.  I was interested to see how Hanks would do in this role, as a "bad" (or is he really?) guy, and he traveled far beyond any and all expectations; I see a third Best Actor Oscar in his future. Paul Newman is also just so good in this, everyones acting, even the kid's, blew me away. The story is incredible. And Jude Law, he so impressed me in his great portrayal of a true psycho. It combines above top of the notch character studies with an incredible story, which is a very hard thing to do. This movie as literally made my heart race, something I haven't done in a while actually at a movie. The emotion all the actors draw out is so amazingly real. The scenery &amp; sets, I could go on all day about how incredible they looked... this film is just simply, in my opinion perfect.  Road to Peridition is not what I've heard some "critics" call a "fad" movie, which by that they mean that since the other "critics" hype it and say it's so good is the only reason people think it's so good. What the "critics" say never holds any barring over whether or not I like a movie. So, concluding, I loved Road to Periditon; an amazing film, with perfect, top notch acting, an amazing story line and amazing character studies, and an amazing look. If you haven't already I would Strongly, with a capitol S, recommend to go see this right now. Extremely touching movie. This is the best movie of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow, Tom Hanks does it again...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really liked this movie, it certainly isn't the Godfather I or II as others have said, but it's powerful, very powerful, nonetheless. This movie really does try to get at the core of loyalty and I was drawn into the film, I always appreciate when I go see a film and won't allow myself to use the bathroom and force myself to wait. This is that kind of movie...Sam Mendes is a genius, I loved American Beauty as well. Tom Hanks is one of the best around, period. Jude Law was right on the money, everything in this movie seemed to click. As did the son in this movie, I don't know who this actor is, although I do recognize him from somewhere, but he was FANTASTIC. In some respect, he reminded me of the young, vulnerable Henry Hill in Goodfellas, there's no true comparison here, but once you see this movie, I think you'll agree with me...Go see it, it's worth every penny and more...</fullReview>

Especially with the very personal violence he encounters (you have to see the movie, or maybe you can guess what I mean, since it's so predictable). His son in the movie has the same problem with his emotions and lack thereof. Also, the odd emotional combinations and the overly extreme and useless violence were accompanied by short bursts of inappropriate humor. If the movie wanted to portray the violence of gangsters as seriously as most of the movie tried to, it shouldn't have changed the mood as suddenly and oddly as it did a few times.The movie tried to show the life of a hitman. And the life of a hitman is obviously very violent. So, the movie will make me empathize with the hitman's reasons for what he does, beyond my initial reaction to his occupation, right? Not this one. In the end, I have to ask myself, "What's the point?". Following the life of an emotionless psycho without any real point in the end (in my opinion) is not fun at all. The silly and unarguable last lines (the moral of the story?) only made me dislike Tom Hanks' character even more, because it implied that the things he did were okay. Which would have been fine if they hadn't been shown in such a hypocritical and meaningless way.But in the end, I don't recommend it at all if you're into the details of movies (because they are incomplete and contradictory) or even if you think violence is okay if it serves a purpose, but don't like violence otherwise (because it is purposeless here).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An excellent film, well worth the price of admission. Performances by Hanks and Newman are remarkably good, bordering on superb. Cinematography is consistent throughout, with excellent night-for-night work. The musical score by Thomas Newman deserves special mention because it fits in perfectly, is there but never intrudes. This movie could easily have gotten five stars from me, except for two things: It should have been in Black and White in keeping with the era depicted, and the character played by Jude Law was "over the top" both in the way it was written and the way it was overacted. This is the first Mendes film I've seen, and hopes are he'll do as well in future. There is a lot of violence, but not out of keeping with the subject matter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Acting and Cinematography but Cold</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has a self-consciously artistic look, and if movies can be judged on looks alone, this is one of the finest. The lighting, colors and composition borrow heavily from Edward Hopper. The movie also borrows Hopper's distinctive mood: lonely and quiet. But somehow -- and in spite of understated, taut acting by a great cast, and music that accentuates but never overwhelms -- "Perdition" doesn't go beyond that. It never quite achieves the artistry that it alludes to.Some reviewers talk about the moral ambiguity represented by having Tom Hanks play a mob hitman. This ambiguity is set out in the opening line of the movie: whether Michael Sullivan (Hanks) was a good man, or had no good in him at all. But there's no real ambiguity. Hanks has become such an archetype for the "decent everyman" that everything he does seems justified -- by his sense of loyalty, and the need to protect his family -- not driven by some dark kernel of evil compelling him to kill. Jude Law and Daniel Craig, by contrast, do great jobs of portraying the dark undercurrent in people who, in varying degrees, enjoy killing. This movie would have been somewhat more interesting (and its ambiguity more genuine) if Sullivan had more of a kinship to either of those characters, and even a touch of their evil. But their evil only serves to highlight his goodness. I think the lack of emotional resonance has something to do with what feels like a lack of depth in Hanks' portrayal of Sullivan -- he is too innately decent.For all its faults, "Perdition" is worth seeing for just the acting. Paul Newman's eyes alone speak volumes more than the lines he's given, and Stanley Tucci manages to exude intelligence, mob honor, Macchiavellian pragmatism, menace, and an odd sort of decency in about three minutes of screen time. At the end, I didn't care about whether Michael Sullivan was a good man or not, but I did want to see more of Tucci playing Frank Nitti (VERY different from the how the character is portrayed by Billy Drago in The Untouchables (1987)).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Master at Work!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is almost EVERYTHING to recommend Road To Perdition, but if all you do (as I have more than once) is to go to see a master at work, then go and watch each scene of the movie to see the cinematography of Conrad Hall. Most movie makers would love to have a handful of the scenes that Hall creates, but in this movie, almost every scene is master work. Rooms have 5, 6, 8 different zones of lighting; characters unfold behind rain and brilliant sun and in the dark of night, each with control, and grace and beauty. You watch, and think, Hall is saying, "well, you thought the last scene was beautiful/artful/complex, well watch what I do with this one...".And the actors each outdo the other. One watches Tom Hanks, more in control and adult than ever before, and you think, this is a masterful performance...until he acts opposite Paul Newman, whose power overrides every scene he is in, and you know who is the Master.Rarely does one have such high expectations for the next movie os a director than I did after American Beauty. Now I know, I can't wait for the next from the New Master in the field.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Road to Perdition" is interesting in many ways, but not all good. In some respects, it exhibits characteristics that reinforces what is turning out to be the current genre of the American cultural epic. Ironically, these are the same characteristics that keep such films from being better.What makes "Road to Perdition" so American is the theme, mood and atmosphere that appeal to our sense of "old Americana." Tom Hanks plays Michael Sullivan, a right-hand hit-man of John Rooney, played by Paul Newman, who is the mob ruler of a small Midwestern town during the prohibition era of the 1930s. All is well and good, until one day, Sullivan's son hides as a stowaway in his dad's car, witnessing the murder of another member of the mob, who's been accused of skimming from the books. The rest of the movie is Sullivan and his boy trying to escape from the mob, all while establishing the father-and-son relationship they never had.Essentially, the movie was intended as a portrait of a family-man torn between his love of his family and the loyalty to his mob boss. But, the portrait was never completed. The problems with the film started when it abandoned its heartland landscape and the slow moving rhythms of the portrait of Sullivan, to a semi-comedic farce about a man and his son on the run, robbing banks. In short, the film just got too simplistic for that drama that it wanted to be.The best parts of the film are the acting from Hanks, and the mood, tone and general atmosphere of the movie overall. It's a great backdrop for the intended theme; I truly enjoyed these sensations from an ethereal point of view.What makes this and other movies like it so American - and thus, effective with American audiences - is how they portray what is now considered a stereotypical American lifestyle. Oddly enough, it's one that hasn't reflected the modern American family portrait in years. This almost makes such films more reminiscent than modern. In "Road to Perdition", as well as the recent "A Beautiful Mind", this aspect of Americanism can only be accomplished by keeping things simple.Yet, this is what makes these movies so shallow. They're too simplistic. The relationship between Sullivan and his son were never well-established, either in the beginning, or later when they "bonded." This had to be done in order to retain the film's ethereal "simplicity", making its mood and tone so powerful. But this at the expense of depth and meaning. Same thing with "A Beautiful Mind." Nowhere did we see the real trauma that John Forbes Nash experienced through his real-life conflicts with other mental problems and sexual experiences that were never shown in the movie. While I enjoyed Perdition for its qualities, and enjoyed watching it in the theater, I felt it ultimately lost its grip on its purpose, and was ultimately more disappointed that it didn't live up to its potential.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most American Mob Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Right now, most Americans feel a duty to reflect on exactly what America is all about, why we are the country we are (whether that's all good or all bad is up to fate to decide), and what qualities we hold most dear. Its rare when a period film such as "Road to Perdition" can capture not only the past, but reflect so much of the present as well. What resonates even more powerfully with me is when that same film clarifies and through its clarification of the human spirit, resonates in our souls. It's easy for filmmakers to adapt, buy or hire writers to expound on some idea (ideal, moral or otherwise) the filmmaker holds up for examination in the film he or she is making. And like Willa Cather said once, "There are only two or three human stories, and they go on repeating themselves as fiercely as if they had never happened before." Which brings me to the focus of my critique. Fundamentally, the theme of the "orphan" has remained one of the most resonate themes in early American literature. Today amidst the aftermath of 9/11, we have a film that reminds us about themes of family, fatherhood (we too have our founding fathers to look back to as ancestors), and violence and life. The ways in which this film accomplishes the communication of its themes is masterfully interwoven with a constant reflection and deconstruction of the " mobster" genre. Themes of family loyalty are complicated as well as enriched when the orphan theme is brought into the film's narrative. This is a story of two fathers who protect their sons at all cost. This resonates to me considering our nation's own clash with Islamic fundamentalists whose families breath and eat just as we do. This is also a film about redemption; our human fight to right our wrongs. Those few human stories of life and death, love and hate, and the struggle of being a human being fully aware and in control of one's own life. These stories resonate, and do so in "Road to Perdition" through solid acting performances, flawless set design and lush cinematography. While Hollywood rarely turns out that raw film that resonates in completely different (and typically intertextual) ways, "Road to Perdition" offers up thematic resonance delivered in a visually gorgeous film. This film fiercely "goes on" as if it was the first great Mob movie of American history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not too many movies give me the feeling that I need to go back to theaters again to watch it, however, this movie has accomplished just that; just as "Spider-Man" and "The Sixth Sense" before it. I was quite impressed with Sam Mendes first film, "American Beauty", and expected something pretty good with his sophomore effort. I received much more than I expected. His usage of color, again, was right on. The weather and elements were created quite nicely to convey the mood and direction of the film. Tom Hanks and Paul Newman, of course, give us a real performance. The pace is great, without a lot of useless or awkwardly long scenes. Although I would classify the film as a gangster flick, it is more than that and less, at the same time. You are getting a movie that deals with family and loyalty, life and death, and the choices we make that effect it all. That is the more; you do get less bang-bang shoot em up in this gangster movie, though. Really, that only adds to the impact of the film; as when someone dies, it does not feel like just another addition to the body count. I am going to see this again, maybe this weekend, and I am pretty sure I will get even more out of it the second time around (and not only because I had to sit in the front row last time). I suggest this as an instant classic. Do yourself a favor and check this out.</fullReview>

The child is well played against the stars he will one day join in acting history. 5 stars!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oscar worthy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, the second from Academy Award winner Sam Mendes ("American Beauty") follows Tom Hanks as a mob enforcer who is setup by his bosses son and then finds himself on the run with his son after his wife and younger son are murdered. Hanks gives a nice performance in a role drasticaly different from those he normally plays and young Tyler Hoechlin, who plays his son, makes an excellent debut. Paul Newman as Hanks' mob boss/mentor/father figure also delivers a strong performance as an elderly man torn between his natural son and the man he raised... Jude Law as a hitman who tracks down Hanks is also good. A Solid, if rather bloody, effort all around. The first oscar worthy pic of the year. GRADE: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two Newman's and a Hall shine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching this movie last night, I was struck by how how absolutely glorious this film looks. Cinematographer Conrad Hall outdoes his previous teaming with Director Sam Mendes (American Beauty) by taking us down a slightly sepia-toned "road to picture perfection." Each shot is a thing of beauty, whether it's the rain cascading off the brim of a fedora, or a brilliant rack focus and zoom as Newman and Hanks walk out of the room leaving the humiliated Connor blurred until the last moment. Hall has worked with Newman before in "Cool Hand Luke" and his Oscar-winning "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," and once again he captures the living legend. Paul Newman will likely receive Supporting Actor attention, but the film's other Newman, composer Thomas Newman deserves even higher marks. His score, perhaps his best alongside "Shawshank Redemption" propels us when the action calls for it, and stirs our emotions with his trademark piano and strings during the slower, pensive moments. I've read some critics' bashing of the film's finale. Without divulging too much, I was pleased Mendes risked what could have been a 7-minute shorter movie and more "Happy-Hollywood" ending for the less mirthful but yet hopeful ending he provides.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Road to Perdition is as original as American Beauty in its own way, and both films prove Sam Mendes to be a director of immense talents. He creates a mood of relentless solemnity in this film, broken only (or enhanced by) moments of the blackest humor, and he manages to sustain this grim mood throughout. He also manages to get superbly restrained performances from all his actors, particularly Hanks and Hoechlin (as Michael Sullivan Sr. and Jr., respectively). And he manages to tell a timeworn story in a thoroughly unique manner. Road to Perdition goes deep, hits hard and leaves you reeling, but it's done in such a masterfully subtle and sublimely restrained way that you might not realize it until you've departed the theatre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*POSSIBLE SPOILERS* ROAD TO PERDITION starts off as a solid gangster movie. Slow at first and then things start getting better by the first fifteen minutes. PLOT: Curious as to what the details of his father's job actually are, young Michael Sullivan hides in the back of his hit man father's (Tom Hanks) car one night and witnesses what it is that he does for a living. When his wife and younger child are murdered, he sets out with young Michael to kill the ones responsible.The acting is pretty decent. It wasn't really Oscar material, but the Art Direction, Costume Design, and Screenplay all deserve awards. The supporting cast includes Paul Newman, Jude Law, Stanley Tucci, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and a fagnostic Dylan Baker. The film is very entertaining and intrigues you with it's wicked cleverness. I could almost describe this as a thriller because of the way the action sequences are handled. This is easily described as a Drama Suspense movie. While I really don't think it is worthy of the Best Picture award, it certainly is worthy of some Academies. ROAD TO PERDITION is a marvelous film that is sure to entertain audiences for many more years to come....5/5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There doesn't seem to be much ambivalence towards this movie, judging from the numerous reviews, but I think most of the arguments against it have to do with unrealistic expectations more than anything else. Sam Mendes offers taut direction, Hanks gives a dignified performance; yeah, we've heard that before: the real star of this movie is cinematographer Conrad Hall. Although he couldn't possibly follow up the work he did in the greatest movie of all time (Cool Hand Luke), he certainly gives us a work of art to take in. But back to the expectations: some people complain they can predict where the story is going. Is this a necessarily bad thing? Stanley Kubrick makes a gorgeous movie like Barry Lyndon using a simple plot at best, and it's a (deserved) classic. Mendes offers a beautiful portrait of fathers and sons with perhaps a simple plot, and viewers complain they have an idea of what's coming. Relax, enjoy a beautiful movie, and leave it at that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>About 20 years ago I saw a Japanese movie (that was at that point about 10 years old) called Shogun Assassin. It was about a powerful Samaurai whose master becomes afraid of him and orders him killed. Well, things don't quite work out and the warrior ends up traveling feudal Japan with his infant son in a baby carriage. The movie was narrated by the son. It was hyper-violent, absolutely crazy with all the various killers springing out and getting wacked to pieces by these two and I loved it.When I heard about Perdition, I thought it sounded awfully familiar, then I read in Entertainment Weekly that Perdition is based on an english language comic that was itself inspired by a japanese manga comic called Lone wolf and Cub. Maybe the american writer was inspired by the comic but the original source was Shogun Assassin (Japanese title "Lone wolf and Cub"!)To make it a little more convoluted, Shogun Assassin as well as another movie called Lightening swords of Death (which i have an original poster I'm proud to say) was actually a compilation of a Japanese TV series. Shogun was the first Asian movie I ever saw that I took seriously. In spite of the 200 psi blood fountains I finally started seeing the underlying themes that are repeatedly in my favorite asian films.So Road to Perdition addresses those same themes of revenge, redemption, fatherhood etc. with the Sam Mendes style and let me tell you, he has created an epic drama of revenge and redemption and raised it to ponderous and self aware levels rarely achieved in a mobster movie. He put the epoch back in epic. And he does it with such care to extend every moment just a little bit more so that we really get to be familiar with the fabric of our seat and the texture of our cup holder. And best of all he brings pretense back to pretend. The audience I saw it with was appropriately wowed.Now I think my opinion is skewed since I'm familiar with the source material. At momentous points when the camera sloooowly measures the grave impact of Tom Hanks' inevitable killing of somebody, I kept thinking back to the original with "Oh yeah, this is where he whipped out his sword, decapitated the guy then cleaned and resheathed his weapon before the head fell off." Or "In Shogun, the kid cut the legs off the bad guys in this scene." And every one of those scenes were brutal, visceral and over the top.But, in that absolutely outrageous Japanese Chopsocky flick, they told the same story, addressed all the themes and did it while keeping you on the edge of your seat.In Perdition, I think Mendes thought the material too important to give us a visceral thrill during any of the action set pieces. He seemed to intentionally shoot them for minimum impact. I'm sure he did meant to diminish such vulgar thrills and I'm sure a lot of people will enjoy this movie because of that, but for me, I just want to find Shogun Assassin on DVD now.There is one nit-picky point that I just did not understand. At the beginning of the movie the ground is covered in snow. During the evening a couple of days later, the ground is still covered in snow but it is raining. I know it rains sometimes when there is snow on the ground but this snow never melts. I just didn't understand why they bothered with the rain because whatever mood it set was offset by this issue for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must start off by saying this movie is excellent all the actors, play their parts very well and the atmosphere is just amazing. Lets start off by saying that out of all the comic book movies this summer this is the best. The story is excellent and it was just perfect for the big screen. Mendes keeps his style of shooting in this one, with its somewhat surrealness that was their in his first.Also coming off an oscar the man does not sell out, and thats great. Like I said before the actors just did such a good job. Paul Newman is a great man and plays the head of the irish mob so well. Jude Law, well lets just say I believe this is his best performance yet. The kid, Tyler, played his part like a well experienced actor and I see him as a star for life. Tom hanks theres not much to say, he always does a great job acting. I think its safe to say that most directors who work with Mr. Hanks, make their best productions ever. This movie can not lose, big stars, excellent idea and a big director, how could fox loose out.</fullReview>

Newman pulls in a typically unmemorable performance which is typical of his late career and Tom 'wet lips' Hanks is trying, oh so hard to be acting when we all know he should have just stuck to films that suited him like 'Turner and Hooch' and 'Bachelor Party'.

		<fullReview>Road To Perdition was an amazing movie in many different ways!Tom Hanks and Paul Newman are just pure gold in the film, their chemistry is very convincing as 30s mobsters. Jude Law enters the movie near the second half and manages to slyly steal the scene slowly but surely with a "gifted" but quite insane villan. The first thing I noticed as i viewed Road, was how natural everyone was. All the acting seemed natural, completely at ease and nothing at all was forced, every laugh, tear, and scream was convincing. I went into this film knowing nothing about the plot, on a tip from my girlfriend, and ended up getting very involved. Sam Mendes obviously had a fun time recreating the midwest in the 1930s, and everything seems accurate down to the last 2$ bill. He walks you into the era gently, lets you sit down, and meet the sullivans. thanks to a well written script, you feel like the sullivan family are the neighbours next door. The camerawork was appropriate in every scene. Soft and gentle at home, harsh and real when the dramatic action occurs, and relaxed and natural when the moments of levity set in. The movie itself was just something that didnt seem like 2 hours. it seemed like an epic film, but at the same time only a few moments.Lastly, one of the best things about the film was that all the death scenes were tastefully done, even though it does earn its R rating, the gore we don't need to see we are spared.If you like dramatic setpieces, give Road To Perdition a shot, or even if you are a fan of the director or cast.

		<fullReview>Warning: SpoilersI hate to p*** in the soup here and be the only one to voice a dissenting opinion about "road to perdition's" greatness, but it is just driving me up the wall to hear this movie compared to the Godfather, in terms of its overall quality, that is.For the first two hours this movie was as incredible and wonderful as everyone else is making it out to be. And then, the last five minutes rolled around.For a number of reasons it was stupid and just downright condescending, or it was in my view. The scene wherein the son walks in on his still dying father, and his father's murderer was horribly written and didn't not fit (in my own humble opinion) with any real message they were trying to convey. I couldn't figure out if they were saying that there would have been more honor in giving the gun to the murderous filth of a character and in turn being killed by him or not. I for one have a hard time imagining a reason for the son not to have killed him. hat better possible reason could one be given; not just the fact that his father had just been mortally wounded, not that the murderer was taking some sick, macabre picture, and forget that the man would probably have shot the son had he been given the gun.If the director had wanted to have some statement about the futility of violence or how killing begets killing, etc. it would have been much more poignant for the son to shoot the killer, and then have his father burst into tears over what he led his son to and then make him promise to leave this life. The entire rest of the movie could have been the same and would have been, in my opinion much more powerful. Maybe not, but hey thats my tne cents. I would have given it an eight perhaps before that last scene, but on leaving the theater i would be hard pressed to be able to give it much higher than a six.</fullReview>

One could assume that a brilliant director, Sam Mendes ("American Beauty"), two of our best actors, Hanks and Newman, a divine cast of supporting actors, and a top cinematographer all combining to film the story from an excellent book, would result in one of the best movies of the past 20 years. One would be mistaken ... that's why they make the movie. Yes, this is a technical marvel of a movie. However, the story is ridiculously simplistic and unbelievable. The characters are almost all without personality. Not EVERYONE in a mob can be as bland and reserved as the characters in this movie. Even the cartoon character played by Jude Law is 'quieter' than one would expect. Newman and Hanks nearly sleepwalk through their roles. The best performance is that of Tyler Hoechlin, who plays Hanks' son and the one accidently responsible for the happenings. He has the look of a future star. On the other hand, Daniel Craig, who plays Connor Rooney, Newman's son is so over the top, it is quite sad. Compare his emotion to James Caan in "The Godfather" and one gets a hint at why this is not a great film. Jennifer Jason Leigh is so underutilized that I feel for her. She is a wonderful actress with nothing to do but smile like June Cleaver. The usually spot-on Stanley Tucci totally misplays Frank Nitti, but I am assuming this was the director's perspective. Dylan Baker added some nice scene chewing during the hotel segment. I am disappointed and left the theatre with an empty feeling. Please don't listen to the critics who are hailing this as the best movie of the year or decade. It is merely melodrama at Hollywood's best, but not a great movie. I am ready for Hanks to prove his mettle and make some indie movies for awhile. He has more money than any one man deserves. How about giving a little back to the art form? Take some chances and let's see if you are a great actor or just a great star.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow... Sam Mendes' directing is absolutely spellbinding... His direction and framing of this story tells a story in and of itself -- visually. It is without a doubt the best directed film so far this year... If it weren't for Scorsese's "Gangs of New York" (which I have yet to see), I'd say, without a shadow of a doubt, that Mendes will walk away with the oscar for best director - and rightly so. Alas, the jury is still out.And of course, Newman and Hanks have many show-stopping scenes -- and I must say that Daniel Craig does a phenomenal job as well... All in all, this was just a really well told story that was expertly crafted on all fronts. -raf</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie of 2002, so far.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just returned from one of the most rewarding experiences I have had in a movie theatre this year. I just viewed "Road To Perdition". The story is one of the best and well told I have seen ever. It isn't just some gangster movie where they shoot up tons of people without a cause, everyone in the movie who is shot is shot for a purpose, except for maybe a few. Tom Hanks gives a oscar worthy performance as Michael Sullivan who goes after the men who have killed his son and wife, he goes along with his son that survived his Mother and Brother's murder. This movie is too brilliant ro describe in words. I keep trying to name things from it but the whole thing is amazing. I strongly suggest you watch this brilliant film. I would also tell you to see the brilliant "Minority Report", which is my 2nd, if not TIES for 1st, favorite movie from 2002. So go see "Road To Perdition" whenever possible. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Road to Perdition" is a movie that you won't forget or want to forget.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** "Road to Perdition" is a movie based on father-son relationships and revenge. The movie directed by Sam Mendes, based on the novel written by Max Allan Collins and Richard Piers Rayner, is a movie based on those two things: father-son relationships and revenge.Tom Hanks stars as Michael Sullivan, or what he is also known as 'Michael 'The Angel of Death' Sullivan. Michael works for mob bossJohn Rooney(Paul Newman), a man who took Michael in and treated him like a son when Michael had no father. Michael, and his family; wife(Jennifer Jason Leigh); his two sons; Peter Sullivan(Liam Aiken) and Michael Jr.(Tyler Hoechlin), owe everything to Mr. Rooney(or is what Michael's kids call him), he gave them a home when they had nothing. His two kids don't know what their father does for a living(their family isn't excatly loving and full of emtions), but all they know is that he works for Mr. Rooney. One night when Michael and his partner, Rooneys son, Connor(Daniel Craig), go out on a job for Rooney when Michaels son, Michael Jr., hides out in the back of their car. The job goes wrong and Connor kills them man, causing the kid to be a witness.The next part of the movie is based on the father-son relationship with both Michael and Michael(Connor then kills Michaels wife and other son to protect himself and his father), and also the relationship between John Rooney and Connor Rooney, can he give up the love for his real son, to save the life of the man he always thought of a son as well? The bonds of that love are tested both ends, loyalty and love.Now enter the other villian, a hitman by the name of Frank 'The Reporter' Maguire(Jude Law), who is hired by Frank Nitti(Stanley Tucci), to go after Michael and his son, but only kill Michael, not the boy. They call him 'The Reporter' because in his apartment, he has pictures of all dead people, he takes them every crime scene he goes to(how many he acutally did we don't know), but all we know is that he is a sick, and crazy man.This movie will not be forgotten because it is a movie that can't be forgotten. The preformances are great as expected, Hanks plays a little bit of a different character then what we usually plays, he's a little bit darker at heart. Newman just shows that age makes him even more better of an actor, he plays John Rooney, a man who doesn't want more violence to happen but is also stuck between love of his 'real' son and love for the man he always considered a son. And then there is Jude Law, he is also as good as any of the others actors in this movie, everytime he is on screen with Hanks, they go back and forth shooting lines at eachother, they match up very well; and he plays Maguire with such a erie face and eire facial expressions, you become scared of the man.All in all this movie has eveyrthing, great acting, wonderful story, great everything. If you haven't seen this film yet, you are missing out on the best film of 2002.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...I guess I'm stuck in between the comments I've read. I enjoyed the film, the cinematography is top-drawer and all the performances are as they should be. Oh, and the score is very good (IMO a score can sometimes make or break a marginal film) yet this film can hardly be called "marginal". It just seemed, well, somewhat sterile and a tad predictable. In arguably a weak year in cinema, it will probably get its share of nominations come Oscar time but I would argue that there were no Oscar caliber performances here, just good solid work. Even the great actors in history had certain weaknesses and Hanks, quite simply, can't play a "heavy". Newman shows he can still muster his enormous talent up again and again. I agree with the earlier reviewer about Law's performance. A fine actor but character performances like these were a dime a dozen back in the golden era. To wrap up: Worth seeing; just don't expect a real classic here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Long, dense and richly detailed adaption could probably be branded obvious and predictable by anyone not drawn into its vision of 1931 America. The narrative is deliberatley slow and the plot does follow a conventional structure (laid out no doubt in the original novel)....but for me this film gradually became a gorgeous postcard from a long dead world...much in the vein of "O brother where art thou" and Tom Hanks previous 1930's set smash "the Green Mile". The scene that captivated me involved Hanks joining Newman at a piano...both of them playing one handed in perfect harmony while Newmans washout son watches with poorly veiled enmity. It is simple to anticipate the future arc of the plot from that point on....but the story is predictable in the way that Shakespearian drama can be...and for me the play is the thing in much the same way. In Summary the Drama is riveting, the cast is superb, the period photography miraculous, the score is haunting, and the film is one of the best I have seen so far this year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Examining the fragility of living by a code</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Road to Perdition lives up to this reviewer's expectations. A heavy movie in both costume, weather and subject matter, balanced by the wonderful cinematography of '30s era Illinois and a sliver of hope. A tried and true subject of code within the crime family and how fragile it is and the damning effects it can have when these codes are ignored or broken. Unlike the Godfather trilogy, Road to Perdition gets right to the point without the multiple sub-plots. It examines the character and immense effort needed to live by these codes (family, honor, revenge, etc.) of three central characters. Hanks' performance is right on of a man who deals with the paradox of carrying out murder on one hand, while trying to be the best father and caring husband to his immediate family on the other. Newman delivers a tremendous performance that only Paul Newman can as the boss caught struggling with his own paradox, putting family above all yet, "...after all of this is done, you will be the son I miss," addressing Michael Sullivan. Road to Perdition is a great look at a good story. The story may have been done many times over, but this movie offers an interesting alternative viewpoint. If done right, the dichotomy of code within organized crime never gets old. Road to Perdition gets it right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fathers and Sons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the moviegoer sees both Tom Hanks and Paul Newman make their first appearances onscreen in "Road to Perdition," they are each inside their own homes, both the subject of awe for the film's narrator, Michael Sullivan Jr. Like a Russian tragedy in the feudal world of Czarist Russia, fathers and sons form the chain for a magnificent opus on American virtue, sin and although I hesitate to add it, beauty. In Sam Mendes' epic tale of honor, betrayal and vengeance, the camera frames men, young and old, meeting again and again in timeless 1930s American settings. Relying on its ability to condition the viewer to enjoy the workings of a world that Hollywood has glorified many times, but seldom, in such a stark and breathtaking cinematography, as this rendering of America's Heartland, the movie paints a broad and bloody canvas with powerful strokes. In what may very well bring his next Academy Award, Hanks exhibits his resonant personification of the everyman that captivated viewers watching him alone befriending and speaking to a volleyball on a deserted island in his last movie. Performing alongside Newman for what one can hope is not the first and last time, Hanks' performance as Irish mob hitman Michael Sullivan is a gritty, noirish tour de force. In an underplayed and stoic manner, Hanks' Sullivan engages in violent retributions and conveys the purposeful spirit of a man whose own future is far too intertwined with a legacy of the past that was perhaps his to never control. Again and again, Mendes uses bullets and bravery to show that honor and vengeance can be seen differently in view of an America that moviegoers will recognize and view as a departure, perhaps into the unknown blaze, of a past so many have barely glimpsed as part our collective tradition of family values meaning so many different things to so many.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not quite the epic it wants to be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Road to Perdition is a good movie, but great it aint. Great movies aren't predictable. From the very first line in the movie I knew how the movie was going to end. While this is a very different role for America's favorite actor, a bad guy has to put fear in the audience and Tom Hanks just didn't do it. And I just didn't care for the father/son bonding between him and his son. It served a purpose, but this movie is so cold and uninviting that even throughout their "bonding" the audience is constantly reminded that Hanks' sole mission is bloody vengeance. Although they share a lot less screen time Paul Newman, Jude Law, and Daniel Craig are the best thing this movie has to offer (besides the brilliant work of cinematographer Conrad Hall...more on him later). When was the last time someone was better in a Tom Hanks movie than Tom Hanks? Some critics are comparing this mob movie with the greatest of them all The Godfather. NOT TRUE. Francis Ford Coppola allowed us to look into the world of the mafia and presented us with characters we cared about. RTP director Sam Mendes did not create ONE character in RTP that I cared about. America loves "The Sopranos" because the hit show is so well written and so inviting with characters that remind you of your own family. It isn't the fault of any of the actors in RTP. They did the best they could but everybody in this movie is expressionless and devoid of any emotion. Newman was great, Craig's blue eyes are as intense as his character, and Law steals every scene he's in. This is where RTP becomes Oscar-worthy. Law is flat out perfection as the eccentric photographer/hitman Maguire. And Hall might as well prepare his acceptance speech. It rains more in this movie than it did in Se7en and darkness is so prevalent that it becomes a terrific supporting character. There might not be a more visually stunning film released this year. There are two great scenes in this movie that I won't forget. One is the scene in the diner where Hanks and Law meet for the first time and engage in an amusing conversation before Hanks realizes Law's true intentions(I won't spoil the fun)and when Hanks and Newman meet for the last time in the basement of a church and Newman says the best line in the movie. "The only thing we can be assured of is that none of us will get to heaven." Too bad the rest of the film isn't quite as heavenly. 7 out 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok, ok, ok! Dreamworks! 20th Century Fox! What the hell are you executives thinking? Hire me if you want a good director! American Beauty was perfect! Untouchable! But Mendes shouldn't try to adopt that style of filming for Road To Perdtion. Don't Have TOO Much American beauty Piano background scores, hello, this is a different movie. The Scene where Hanks and Newman tickle the ivory together is great -it's enough piano! Plus many other American Beauty-ish similarities! Another problem is this movie appears to be either UNFINISHED, rushed, or not well thought out. But the reason it is soo disapointing is because it COULD HAVE BEEN SOOO good! It COULD have been a real classic!!! This movie couldn't decide if it was 1.) a polished, hollywood money-making recipe for Tom H. and Paul N. to appear in one artificial, plastic Ethan Allen, J. Peterman commercial/catalog. 2.) An independent, non conformist American Beauty 3.) A touching, yet exciting poignant Mob Story. 4.) A thrilling Ganster Movie........ Let me give all you people who made this movie a bit of advice: YOU CAN'T have a real masterpiece if your TRYING TO PLEASE EVERYONE! just becuase Titanic had elements for everyone and made a ridiculous amount of money, doesn't mean you have to waterdown EVERY movie with enough target demographing to cover and please every sub-sub-sub-group!: 1.)the Irish Music (hey it worked in 50 other movies let's put it in this one -Hanks and Newman actually sit at a piano where the sheet music clearly reads Irish Songs!!!! 2.)The Kid Appeal (the boy learning how to drive and driving the getaway car in a silly manner. 3.)the Drama Appeal, 4.)The Violence Appeal 5.)The Period Piece Appeal ..... Alot of these elements work together in a film to tell a story, but it was like you people are trying to FORCE it all in to have something in the movie to please EVERYONE!! IF Mendes went to school for film making then he SUCKS!!! If there were any producers or excutives on the set making him f*** the movie up, then they should be slapped! SOMEBODY IS RESPONSIBLE! ONCE AGAIN THIS COULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT MOVIE!! Mendes has no idea how to build suspense! He does NOT know how to use the weapons in this movie to intimidate the audience, he TRIES and TRIES, but does not succeed. (He almost pulls it off when jude LAW is running across the street with the shotgun stashed under his treachcoat. But any other time a weapon is featured on the screen they are WEAK props and they are not built up or used to intimidate (see a scorsese mobster flick or a tarntino flick for reference). Tom Hanks had some really bad acting scenes. Hey if i'm directing Tom Hanks in a Movie I sure as hell am getting his best performance out of him! I'm sure that Mendes had no problem with Spacey, In American Beauty because Kevin Spacey is Hardcore! He is in Love with the art of performing. But it seems like Mendes was to much of a Pu**y to ask Hanks to reshoot all the scenes where Hanks' performance just wasn't up to par. Maybe Mendes is a sychophant who thinks everything Hanks does is wonderful. Well in any case, Tom Hanks as an actor was fine for this role, but he needed something more. Suggestion, opinion: perhaps the character should have little more affirmative, a little more MEAN. I'm saying the studio and Tom Hank's agent/manager already put him in a hitman ROLE, so why T.F. didn't they just push it a little further? They aren't going to ruin his career. With his performance in Road To Perdition, how are we suppossed to believe that Mike Sullivan is this real BAD ASS who was FEARED and commanded RESPECT and DERSERVED this so called REPUTATION???? Another thing: The scence where Tucci/Netti phones Jude Law to send him after Hanks, and Law is writing down information on a little note pad: "Mike Sullivan.... Kid - 12 years old..." That scene is completly ripped off from Pulp Fiction when Marcellus Wallace/ Ving Rhames calls HIS TOP guy, the WOLF/Harvey Kitel who then writes down HIS information (showing that both the Photographer and Wolf characters keep lists, and are meticulous and methodical) into a little notebook: "Black Guy: Jules.... White Guy: Vincent.... One Body Minus Head"..... The Road To Perdition is so predictible that even my girlfriend who likes movies like "Legally Blonde" and who isn't much of a movie critic even said during the film: "THIS MOVIE IS SOO PREDICTIBLE"... I don't know how much the movie cost to make but with that money and those actors, and a better director a just VERY SLIGHTLY reworked script,, you could have such a GREAT GREAT movie on your hands that it is just a damn shame!!!!!!!!! I mean one of those movies that EVERYONE wants to have in theur collection!!!! Tooo Bad!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Make no mistake, "Road to Perdition" is great entertainment. There is hardly a dull moment, and the acting and stylistic elements are top-notch. However, I get the feeling that director Sam Mendes intended this to be more than just entertainment, and on that level I'd have to say that he and writer David Self didn't quite pull it off. The film doesn't present any interesting questions of morality or philosophy, nor does it deliver any particular message. As Roger Ebert rightly notes, the characters in "Road to Perdition" don't make choices; they simply carry out actions that are long preordained. As with "American Beauty," Mendes' debut film, the ending is presented as more or less inevitable, and once again it is given away in the opening narration. (Note to Mr. Mendes: Enough with the voiceover bookends already! They don't illuminate anything, and they sound like they were written by a screenwriter with a gun to his head. You can keep the ethereal lingering opening/closing shots if you want, but the narration must go.) All that said, the film is certainly nothing resembling a waste of two hours. It's got a compelling story with fantastic moments of suspense, tragedy, and even humor; it looks and sounds spectacular; and Tom Hanks as a cold-blooded killer is a thrill to watch. Perhaps Mendes didn't intend the film to be anything more than this, but the voiceovers tell me different.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Road to Perdition is very, very well made. The movie looks great, is rich in period detail. Conrad Hall's cinematography will surely get him another Oscar. Paul Newman gives a grandiose performance that could be the topper of his wonderful carreer. But...this is a severley flawed film. Tom Hanks is just miscast as a hitman, first of all. He does not seem ever actually seem to be a killer...people say he is, but we never see it. The movie should show him going out for his employer and killing a man he has never met, who has never done anything to him. But the film wants us to like him. Why can't the fillmakers let this movies morale complexities be more...complex? Hanks is likeable, and he looks sad, but we never really see that he is a killer...we need to see this for the rest of the movie to work. He is just Tom Hanks. The middle of the movie is pretty lame too. There is an old farming couple that helps Hanks and his son...I mean jees, how much lamer can you get than that? Also, this is a movie that takes itself very, very seriously. The cinematography is beautiful, as I said earlier...it also is makes the movie very stagey, and makes it hard to actually watch the film as a story. It just seems like a collection of wonderful shots, as opposed to a movie. The ending is pure cheese, and the main antagonist, Newman's son, is just too one dimensional. It's just all too perfectly wrapped up in a bow by the end. The young son of Hanks asks "was Michael Sullivan (Hanks) a decent man?" Guess what? No, the answer is no. But the movie tries to fool you into believing different. Don't let it. He is a killer, a murderer, and the movie tries to let the character off the hook for what he has done. Michael Sullivan is a character who should have been shown as more brutal, then the audience could really have a measured way of judging him. The film also should have chosen the point of view of the child, yet it really doesn't go that route. So in the end, this is a beautifully filmed piece of nothing that tries to convince you it is something more than it is. It's self important Oscar bait. It's a good film that should be seen, but it really is nothing more than that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tom Hanks and Paul Newman, with great performances in their repertoire, are at the peak of their game in "Road to Perdition". A taut and beautifully filmed gangster thriller, "Perdition" will probably go down in filmdom history as one of the top movies of all time of this genre. Tyler Hoechlin, as Hanks' son, turned in a very fine performance, and appears to be on his way to a promising career.

Directed by oscar winner Sam Mendes (American Beauty) and featuring a stellar cast including oscar winners Tom Hanks and Paul Newman, and oscar nominee Jude Law, Perdition epitomizes one man's journey through hell. Tom Hank's portrayal of a hitman who must avenge the death of his wife and son in order to guarantee the safety of his other son (played brilliantly by Tyler Hoechlin) is nothing short of oscar-worthy. Excellent performances by Paul Newman and Jude Law add to the credibility of the movie. Sam Mendes has created a movie that feels and looks like an original 1930's gangster classic and rivals some of the greatest mob movies ever made. This movie screams OSCAR!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Problem of Expanding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Self, the writer of "Road to Perdition", said once that the problem with adapting a book is a problem of reducing. As this film is based on the graphic novel by Max Allan Collins and Richard Piers Raynor, he said it was a problem of expanding. And while the effort was valiant, this story was nothing more than a comic book.Director Sam Mendes's sophomore effort feels exactly like a sophomore effort. Coming off the highly praised Academy Award winner "American Beauty" (one of my favorite films ever), Mendes had a lot to live up to. This movie is a mobster movie, and with mobster movies, there are certain rules you have to follow, with the exception of the Coen Brothers' "Miller's Crossing". Mendes's interpretation of the Irish mobs in Chicago in 1931 looks, sounds and feels like the style of "American Beauty", and that's a problem. I love the unconventional music scores of Thomas Newman, but it couldn't be anymore inappropriate or out of place in this film. Conrad L. Hall's cinematography needed to be more epic, assuming that was what they were aiming for. On the other hand, as it is based on a graphic novel, it should have been shot to look more like a comic book. The teaming of Tom Hanks and Paul Newman probably looked great on paper. Newman shines, but not so much with Hanks. Taking on a role of a Irish Catholic hit man, is a courageous move for Mr. Nice Guy, and I wanted so much to believe him as a cold-hearted murderer. Mendes himself knows that "American Beauty" was a strong film in all of these areas, but the result is disappointing, and extremely ambitious.Now on to the good stuff. Jude Law's performance as the murderous photographer Maguire was very nuanced, scary, and fun, the qualities of a comic book villain. There are some very thrilling scenes of Hanks and his son (Tyler Hoechlin, not bad in his film debut) evading Law. There are also some very touching and often very funny moments between a father and son who are forced to understand each other. And Dennis Gasner's production design was top notch.So, the film wasn't bad, but it tried to hard to be something it wasn't meant to be. I respect everyone involved, and I still look forward to the next Sam Mendes film.</fullReview>

Tom Hank's portrayal of a hitman who must avenge the death of his wife and son in order to guarantee the safety of his other son (played brilliantly by Tyler Hoechlin) is nothing short of oscar-worthy. Excellent performances by Paul Newman and Jude Law add to the credibility of the movie. Sam Mendes has created a movie that feels and looks like an original 1930's gangster classic and rivals some of the greatest mob movies ever made. This movie screams OSCAR!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Problem of Expanding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Self, the writer of "Road to Perdition", said once that the problem with adapting a book is a problem of reducing. As this film is based on the graphic novel by Max Allan Collins and Richard Piers Raynor, he said it was a problem of expanding. And while the effort was valiant, this story was nothing more than a comic book.Director Sam Mendes's sophomore effort feels exactly like a sophomore effort. Coming off the highly praised Academy Award winner "American Beauty" (one of my favorite films ever), Mendes had a lot to live up to. This movie is a mobster movie, and with mobster movies, there are certain rules you have to follow, with the exception of the Coen Brothers' "Miller's Crossing". Mendes's interpretation of the Irish mobs in Chicago in 1931 looks, sounds and feels like the style of "American Beauty", and that's a problem. I love the unconventional music scores of Thomas Newman, but it couldn't be anymore inappropriate or out of place in this film. Conrad L. Hall's cinematography needed to be more epic, assuming that was what they were aiming for. On the other hand, as it is based on a graphic novel, it should have been shot to look more like a comic book. The teaming of Tom Hanks and Paul Newman probably looked great on paper. Newman shines, but not so much with Hanks. Taking on a role of a Irish Catholic hit man, is a courageous move for Mr. Nice Guy, and I wanted so much to believe him as a cold-hearted murderer. Mendes himself knows that "American Beauty" was a strong film in all of these areas, but the result is disappointing, and extremely ambitious.Now on to the good stuff. Jude Law's performance as the murderous photographer Maguire was very nuanced, scary, and fun, the qualities of a comic book villain. There are some very thrilling scenes of Hanks and his son (Tyler Hoechlin, not bad in his film debut) evading Law. There are also some very touching and often very funny moments between a father and son who are forced to understand each other. And Dennis Gasner's production design was top notch.So, the film wasn't bad, but it tried to hard to be something it wasn't meant to be. I respect everyone involved, and I still look forward to the next Sam Mendes film.</fullReview>

With a newcomer Tyler Hoechlin playing Michael Sullivan Jr.. Every actor or actress did just the perfect job. With a superb screenplay, based upon a graphic novel by Richard P. Rayner and Max A.

But one day, a problem arises when Michael Sullivan Jr. (Tyler Hoechlin) discovers something about his dad he shouldn't have. What this does, is lead you into a world of total evil, mistrust, confusion, and a long and interesting road to Perdition. I'm not going to say anymore. The rest is all up to you to decide and figure everything out. And if you know if Michael Sullivan was a good man or a man who never knew the meaning of the word good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Road to Where?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has all the trappings of an exceptional movie but lacks the substance to actually be one. Symbolic of this is the apparently excellent title. "Perdition" means hell, and Paul Newman has a line that the only sure thing is that none of the characters in this movie will wind up in heaven. Tom Hanks says his son still has a chance and the movie is about his efforts to save his son when the criminal organization he's always worked for turns against him and the rest of his family is killed. That's fine but the screenwriter is not satisfied with that and makes "Perdition" a small town in an idyllic location beside Lake Michigan. It looks gorgeous when they finally get there. But why would they call such a place Perdition? Because somebody decided they had to explain the title. It's that kind of thinking that ruins the movie.  When Hanks realizes he and his remaining son have to go on the lam, his priority should be to get away and disappear into the countryside and find a way to start a new life. His 12 year old son is going to need him and he needs to be certain this last vestige of his family survives. Instead, he goes on a one-man crusade for revenge. Why? Even Hanks says at one point that the mob is going to kill the guy he wants revenge against eventually. Shouldn't his priorities be with his child? To make sense of this, Hanks' character has to be shown as a suffering, driven man. But Hanks, an appealing actor with much more depth that we would have imagined years ago when he was stuck in silly comedies, has finally found a role he cannot play. His hit man is just a grim fellow, doing things because he feels he must do them. If that's the case, then why doesn't he just take his son and get the hell out of there? Because the script says so, that's why. I tried to think of who should have played this role. Reading the other reviews I concluded, as others did, that Bruce Willis would have been the perfect choice. He could have conveyed the real rage and menace of the character, as Hanks cannot, and yet made the family scenes believable.  The other reviewers are correct also in pointing out that the father-son relationships here are not fleshed out. There is at least an attempt at this with the Newman-Hanks relationship in the early scenes. There is one meaningful conversation between Hanks and his son. There is also a semi-comic sequence in the middle of the film about teaching the son to drive and conducting a series of bank robberies with the kid at the wheel of the getaway car. This is leavening but seems at odds with their desperate situation. The injection of a childless farm couple into the middle of it all is only a convenience for a happy ending. I was expecting something along the lines of "A Perfect World", with Kevin Costner on the lam with a small boy he's picked up along the way. There the relationship really develops and the ending made me cry. I didn't shed a tear at this ending, which is borrowed from "The Shootist" By the way, the Hanks character may have been based on a real gentleman by the name of Walter Stevens, an erudite family man who used to work for Al Capone. He took care of his invalid wife and three adopted children while reading the works of Robert Louis Stevenson, Jack London and Robert Burns, which he quoted frequently to his unimpressed gangster pals. When he died in 1939, he had been "credited" with 60 murders.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>COMPELLING, STYLISH, and EXCELLENT. (With flaws).</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Road to Perdition" is not up to the great standards of the classic "The Godfather", as I've heard some reviewers suggest; there are just too many small problems with the plot, to be related below. But it certainly one of the best made films I have seen in a long time (dark and gloomy though it is) and is just a damn fine piece of art; it is in fact so consciously stylish it is almost overdone at times, but isn't. Directed by Sam Mendes ("American Beauty") the film is beautiful to look at; the scenes of 1931 Chicago are especially memorable. Yes it's dark, but Winter in Chicago at the height of the Depression was very dark indeed. David Self wrote the screenplay, and played down some of the violence in the book; I had the most problems with the screenplay for reasons I'll get to. Conrad L. Hall filmed "Road to Perdition" perhaps with too much detail and concern for evocative imagery.We are taken back to eastern Illinois early in 1931 where Michael Sullivan (a laconic Tom Hanks) works as an enforcer and possible hitman for wealthy gangster boss John Rooney, played with effective emotion by Paul Newman. Sullivan is also raising a family with a wife (Jennifer Jason Leigh in what amounts to a cameo role) and two boys. Sullivan and Rooney had an almost father-son relationship for decades. The problem is Rooney's son, Connor, who is a weak, corrupt, and homicidally psychotic, and Daniel Craig portrays him superbly within the limits of the script. And this is the biggest problem I had with the movie.Connor is so very despicable and beneath contempt, so entirely evil and without any shred of redeeming qualities, he is painfully two dimensional. His murderous actions destroy the relationship between his father and Sullivan and are what drive everything that happens in the film. There is no attempt to even explain what motivates Connor to do what he does. This is a real flaw in the film. Villains with depth, going back to such as Magua in "Last of the Mohicans", make the events that transpire more meaningful. His attack on Sullivan's family, after one of the boys sees Connor and his father kill three people, begins Sullivan's search for vengeance and retribution.This brings up a plot hole. Rooney (Newman) knew all along his son was not only robbing him but killing his own men to cover up his actions. And yet he did nothing about it, not even just cut him out of the business and exile him to Ireland, where he suggested Sullivan go. Instead, he allowed Connor to inexorably bring him to ruin. Just because Connor is his son does not explain this adequately.Sullivan, on the run with his twelve-year-old son, is out for vengeance, and he sees Frank Nitti (a superb Stanley Tucci), whom he knows, running the Chicago mob with Al Capone in Alcatraz, but Rooney has already convinced Nitti that for business reasons Connor should be kept in protective custody from Sullivan - and to contract a hitman to kill him. So, Sullivan is forced to wage war by stealing Mob money in various banks while avoiding - or shooting it out with - the hitman, a creepy and odd fellow named Maguire played by Jude Law. It is also obvious that Nitti despises Connor, who will survive so long as his father lives. It is a business decision, after all, by Nitti.,Sullivan demonstrates his naivete when he brings proof to Rooney of Connor's ongoing theft. Of course Rooney already knows. . . and then Sullivan finally realizes what I realized at least half an hour earlier: the only way to get to Connor is to first take out his father - who had been a surrogate father to Sullivan. His delayed awakening to what had to be done came too abruptly to satisfy me.Sullivan's son, played introspectively by Tyler Hoechlin, follows his father around throughout his six week odyssey, learning to both drive and handle a gun. It seems as though "Road to Perdition" could very easily have been told more through the eyes and mind of the son. Nevertheless, he gave a good performance.Despite my complaints with parts of the plot and excessive attempts at artistic cinematography, this remains an excellent film well worth seeing. It is just no classic, such as "The Godfather". Nine out of ten! Newman is guaranteed to get awards for this, as is Mendes for the direction.There are other plot holes listed below but they may be spoilers.WARNING: SPOILERS BELOW!After Connor committed his first murder, and then saw Michael Jr. watching, why didn't Sullivan perceive the obvious and kill Connor blaming it on the already dead guys? Everyone hated Connor anyway.When Connor gave him that sealed letter, supposed from Rooney, to take to that coke head club owner/pimp, why was Sullivan so naive as to not open it and read it first? Why would he trust Connor after that murder?During the first shoot out with Maguire, why didn't Sullivan finish him off when he was down? It would have taken a second and prevented him from resurfacing later. It only made sense.Was Maguire acting on Nitti's orders at the end? Didn't Nitti say it was all over on the phone?Why was Sullivan so nonchalant at the end of the film in that house? Like he didn't have enemies including Maguire, among others?When Sullivan was shot, his son sure lucked out finding that farm family that neither called the police nor objected to Sullivan recuperating there, and then didn't mind Michael Jr. moving in. That kind of luck strained credulity.Why did Rooney do absolutely nothing to stop Connor even when he knew he was robbing him and even committing murders of his friends? There were any number of things he could have done besides just kill him.When Sullivan shot Maguire in the back at the end of the movie why didn't the bullet go through Maguire and hit Michael Jr. standing in front of him?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well made, but lacking something I can't put into words</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** spoilers***** Road to Perdition is a wonderfully acted film. Tom Hanks, Paul Newman, Jude Law, and new comer Tyler Hoechlin (spelling is off) do an excellent job in the acting department. The movie's musical score was appropriate, but the cinematography was astounding, one of the more impressive aspects of the film. If the film is sure to get a guranteed nomination in any category, it is the cinematography for sure. The movie is well made, but it is no American Beauty ( Sam Mendes first film ). I went into this film expecting the world, and really wanted to like it. Although I admired it, it was missing something that other mafia themed films made me feel ( The Godfather, Goodfellas, Scarface ). If it wasn't for the ending, the film would of been a letdown. Although I enjoyed it, I can't help but having a little bit of of an empty stomach after watching it. It lacked something I can't put in words. It is worth seeing though. Grade: In between B and B+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I bet Sam Mendes likes to date good looking women regardless of personality. I wonder if he will ultimately known for making pretty movies as well. Part of the reason The Road To Perdition looks good is well what the hell else is right now? I have never been a Tom Hanks fan and if he was trying to do the "chuck heston wooden-but-heroic" thing he achieved his goal. My husband was impressed by the sound quality, he's a techie he actually notices things like that. Mendes needs to find a writer who can do suspense if he wants to serious attempt to create the Great American Action Flick with Drama, absolutely everything was telegraphed. There were two standouts besides the quite remarkable visual quality of the movie : Jude Law and Stanely Tucci. Tucci did a nice impersonation of Nitti being a CEO and Jude Law's determined psycho dude was excellent. Action needs to capture your attention or make you duck and drama needs to make you care. I did not duck nor did I really give a crap about the fate of the characters. Perhaps, I am pressing with too harsh a litmus test. It was not a terrible movie but apparently I have not seen the one summer movie that really grabs me yet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Sons are put on this earth to trouble their fathers"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Possible Plot Spoilers!There is a common theme to most gangster movies- family (more particularly fathers and sons). In `The Godfather', it was Michael Corleone's journey from distancing himself from his father and the family business to finally being overtaken by the power of it, all in the name of protecting the family. In the opening scene of `Road to Perdition' a son reveals the question he is most often asked, `Was your father a good man or an evil man' ? Michael Sullivan, Sr. (Tom Hanks) works as a triggerman for local Capone captain John Rooney (Paul Newman). His son, Michael, Jr. is a twelve year old dabbling in the petty crimes of Depression era life for a preteen ? shoplifting and playing dice are as far as young Michael's illegality strays. His father, on the other hand, is so weighted down by his sins, that he literally hunches his way through each day, plodding, never smiling, a pre-techno Terminator with a tommy gun, his face a mask of troubled soul staring Hell in the eye yet unable to break free. He doesn't seem to have distaste for his work instead he evokes a resignation to what must be. `Mr. Rooney has taken care of us', he offers his son when questioned about his `job'. Young Michael, who fancies Lone Ranger novellas, proudly tells his younger brother Peter that their father is a hero, occasionally even working for the President. A child's dreamy fantasy of his father's occupation is shattered when Michael Jr. stows away as his father makes a late night business call for Rooney. What he witnesses, and the reaction of those involved, sets the father and son on the journey down the ?road to Perdition' (an In-law's seaside town where they might hide). Hunted as much by his past as the figure sent to silence him, Mike Sullivan must protect his son, not just from mob reprisal, but also the future he sees for his son. In a sense, he is protecting his son from himself, or at least what he might become. Michael Jr. is simultaneously horrified and enthralled by his father. As Mike teaches his son to protect himself and aid in their plan to seek revenge, he faces a greater dilemma: how to teach him to be like his father without becoming him. Jude Law plays `the Reporter', the strange and manic hit man sent to kill the Sullivans. In a similar vein as his other assassin character (`Enemy at the Gates'), Law once again buries his good looks and evokes a crazed, shark-like stare as he slowly stalks his prey. Daniel Craig is Connor Rooney, the impatient son of Newman's character, who is the catalyst for all trouble in which the Sullivans find themselves. Jennifer Jason Leigh and Stanley Tucci have small roles as Sullivan's wife and Capone enforcer Frank Nitti respectively. The real star of the film is Hanks of course, but on equal billing is the mood of the film. Director Sam Mendes (American Beauty) blends slices of a hypnotic score with patches of silence that casts the gloominess of the film and add to the weighty darkness that threatens to envelop both the characters and later the country in pre-World War II America. Hanks, brilliant yet again, shows the true genius of his talent- selecting great scripts. Based on a comic book/graphic novel, `Road to Perdition' is actually light on dialog with most of the language coming in the looks between characters. The wonderfully designed sets and beautiful cinematography lend more than perhaps words could offer. Mendes draws out the action like a man taking long slow sips from a tumbler of whiskey, and offers just the right amount of humor to effectively give respite from the tension in the film. `Road to Perdition' is a great contrast to the flash and emptiness of summer fluff like `Men in Black 2' and `Mr. Deeds'. An Oscar-worthy film for fans of ?old-school' cinema, `Perdition' challenges the viewer to stare into the soul of a man with little redeeming qualities and neither forgive, nor condemn him for his sins.</fullReview>

I did feel at some points the movie got predictable, but I really don't like suprises anyway. All in all a great film with lots of heart and feeling. As Oscar gets closer, I feel Tom Hanks did a wonderful job as the bad guy for once. People thought Hanks was always good at playing the good guy, well this movie proves that he can be play bad just as well. I think he deserves a nomination, NO.......the Oscar for "Best Male Actor in a Leading Role." (nice ring to it). I didn't really see any of Paul Newman's work, but his salad dressing is fabulous. (LOL!!) Okay,all joking aside...He was superb. I couldn't really tell if he was a bad or good guy, I mean his heart was in the right place at times, but I have no idea where his head was. Jude Law was also Excellent in this movie as well. I feel that he has an unique "knack" at playing anything that is handed to him. (Mr. Law if you read this... I think you deserved that Oscar...no offense Mr. Cain.) When I heard that he was to play an ugly, "sleezy" reporter/hitman, I expected him to look absolutly grotesqe, but he actually still look handsome (as usual :) ) Reader...If you want to spend the best matinee price this summer, bring a love one and go see Road to Perdition. The best drama of the summer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Road to Perdition is one of the most beautifully shot movies I have ever seen. The Cinematography was absolutely unbelievable. However the script did lack the emotion I was expecting to get from the movie. It wasn't the actors fault the emotion was not totally there, because as one would expect there was some unbelievable acting in this movie. I wouldn't be surprised if Hanks gets another Oscar nomination for his role as Michael Sulivan. He played the role beautifully, letting the audience decide weather to like him or not. Paul Newman was solid as Mr. Rooney. The whole loyalty thing did show through in his character as he had to choose between his real son and Michael Sulivan. Jude law also put in a good performance as the photographer. However the movie lacked a connection. Also the killing became so common in it that it lost its hole shock value, and by the end you really didn't care who got shot because everyone seemed to be. There is also no way that this should be getting compared to the Godfather or Goodfellas because other than the Cinematography those movies blow this one away. It doesn't captivate the audience like the others. So i definitely think this movie is getting to high of critical praise when it only deserves a pat on the back. There were some very memorable scenes that really kept your attention. For example the dinner scene or the scene where Michael goes down to give one of the guys the envelope. All I can say was I was disappointed, I expected this to be great when it was only average.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sam Mendes obviously tried too hard, and his self imposed mantra of art and violence sputtered all the way until the end. While the cinematography and pacing was excellent, the overall picture seemed like a revamped script from the deepest annals of some screen writing program.Sure, Tom Hanks was his usual self, but then again, it wasn't enough to sustain the leverage of the film before finally sinking. The main problem: too predictable. How so? After the first scene you know instantly how the story is going to end. Sure, it might have been the director's intent, but it just didn't work in this instance. Sadly, Paul Newman and Jude Law did not get the screen time one might expect from a film like this. Law', who never seems to play a bad role, needs to get himself a nice leading role instead of having to play second fiddle all of the time. Oh well, I give it a 6.6/10 for good measure.</fullReview>

This film succeeds on every single level-- it is masterfully acted by Tom Hanks and Tyler Hoechlin, both of whom come of as completely believable and 100% immersed in their characters (the entire cast, really). Hanks beautifully portrays Michael Sullivan, Sr. in a turn that had better earn him that third Emmy. Paul Newman is brilliant as Mr. Rooney, a character as conflicted and contradictory as Michael himself.The direction is simply amazing. With this breathtaking film, Sam Mendes firmly cements himself as one of the greats-- "American Beauty" was no fluke. This film is visually haunting; every shot has incredible meaning and depth, every bit of blocking has an inner purpose, and every action performed by the characters has resonance.Also of note is the score-- this film would not be what it is without it's incredibly beautiful score. It's both somehow tragic and uplifting, melancholy and energetic. It enhances the film immensely.I've said all I can; see it for yourself. I guarantee that you will enjoy this film on some level. I personally feel it's worth seeing multiple times-- the film's composition is simply that breathtaking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Road to Perdition this afternoon and not only did I feel like it was an amazing movie, I felt it was a rare movie experience. The complete and absolute highlight for me was the intense and convincing portrayal of mobster hit-man Michael Sullivan by Tom Hanks. Hanks is completely in tune with the serious tone of the story, you can just feel the intensity of the character of Michael Sullivan through Hanks simple presence and short but straightfoward dialogue. Paul Newman is perfect as Mr. Rooney, surrogate father to Michael. The rest of the cast are perfectly in tune as well as Ruthless mobsters and a completely insane hit man hired to kill Tom Hanks played by Jude Law. The pace of the film is kind of speedy in the beginning but for someone to call the film pretentious and overblown is ridiculous, the violent scenes are done with shocking realism and the entire movie is tense with fear. As I aforementioned the experience factor of the film, you can feel the fear of the situation of the father and son coming through to the audience. A lot of scenes at night in the middle of nowhere add to that mood. I predict that a year from now, all the major Oscar awards will be presented to Road to Perdition. I don't see anything coming that will better or come anywhere close to Road to Perdition. I could go on and on about how artistic the film was but I'm tired and will go to bed, the movie has been in my head all day and I urge people to go see it. You will not be dissapointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful, but embalmed film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sure,ROAD TO PERDITION looks and feels like a class movie. In fact, it's a coffee-table-book movie. Beautiful to look at but flat. But it is not a grabber, with a screenplay and direction which keeps the audience at a decided distance from characters supposed to be torn and tragic but who come across as uninvolving and uninteresting. The movie is an exercise in style, and in that it succeeds completely. As for being involved on any emotional level, it misses the mark completely. Comparisons with THE GODFATHER I and II are a mighty, ridiculous reach. Those two films had people you became intimately involved with, told with warmth, sweep, extravagance and style. If only ROAD TO PERDITION had at least a fraction of the energy and strength which the 1930's Warner Brothers crime dramas had in spades and which Francis Ford Coppola breathed into every emotional frame of his movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I bet Sam Mendes likes to date good looking women regardless of personality. I wonder if he will ultimately known for making pretty movies as well. Part of the reason The Road To Perdition looks good is well what the hell else is right now? I have never been a Tom Hanks fan and if he was trying to do the "chuck heston wooden-but-heroic" thing he achieved his goal. My husband was impressed by the sound quality, he's a techie he actually notices things like that. Mendes needs to find a writer who can do suspense if he wants to serious attempt to create the Great American Action Flick with Drama, absolutely everything was telegraphed. There were two standouts besides the quite remarkable visual quality of the movie : Jude Law and Stanely Tucci. Tucci did a nice impersonation of Nitti being a CEO and Jude Law's determined psycho dude was excellent. Action needs to capture your attention or make you duck and drama needs to make you care. I did not duck nor did I really give a crap about the fate of the characters. Perhaps, I am pressing with too harsh a litmus test. It was not a terrible movie but apparently I have not seen the one summer movie that really grabs me yet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Sons are put on this earth to trouble their fathers"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Possible Plot Spoilers!There is a common theme to most gangster movies- family (more particularly fathers and sons). In `The Godfather', it was Michael Corleone's journey from distancing himself from his father and the family business to finally being overtaken by the power of it, all in the name of protecting the family. In the opening scene of `Road to Perdition' a son reveals the question he is most often asked, `Was your father a good man or an evil man' ? Michael Sullivan, Sr. (Tom Hanks) works as a triggerman for local Capone captain John Rooney (Paul Newman). His son, Michael, Jr. is a twelve year old dabbling in the petty crimes of Depression era life for a preteen ? shoplifting and playing dice are as far as young Michael's illegality strays. His father, on the other hand, is so weighted down by his sins, that he literally hunches his way through each day, plodding, never smiling, a pre-techno Terminator with a tommy gun, his face a mask of troubled soul staring Hell in the eye yet unable to break free. He doesn't seem to have distaste for his work instead he evokes a resignation to what must be. `Mr. Rooney has taken care of us', he offers his son when questioned about his `job'. Young Michael, who fancies Lone Ranger novellas, proudly tells his younger brother Peter that their father is a hero, occasionally even working for the President. A child's dreamy fantasy of his father's occupation is shattered when Michael Jr. stows away as his father makes a late night business call for Rooney. What he witnesses, and the reaction of those involved, sets the father and son on the journey down the ?road to Perdition' (an In-law's seaside town where they might hide). Hunted as much by his past as the figure sent to silence him, Mike Sullivan must protect his son, not just from mob reprisal, but also the future he sees for his son. In a sense, he is protecting his son from himself, or at least what he might become. Michael Jr. is simultaneously horrified and enthralled by his father. As Mike teaches his son to protect himself and aid in their plan to seek revenge, he faces a greater dilemma: how to teach him to be like his father without becoming him. Jude Law plays `the Reporter', the strange and manic hit man sent to kill the Sullivans. In a similar vein as his other assassin character (`Enemy at the Gates'), Law once again buries his good looks and evokes a crazed, shark-like stare as he slowly stalks his prey. Daniel Craig is Connor Rooney, the impatient son of Newman's character, who is the catalyst for all trouble in which the Sullivans find themselves. Jennifer Jason Leigh and Stanley Tucci have small roles as Sullivan's wife and Capone enforcer Frank Nitti respectively. The real star of the film is Hanks of course, but on equal billing is the mood of the film. Director Sam Mendes (American Beauty) blends slices of a hypnotic score with patches of silence that casts the gloominess of the film and add to the weighty darkness that threatens to envelop both the characters and later the country in pre-World War II America. Hanks, brilliant yet again, shows the true genius of his talent- selecting great scripts. Based on a comic book/graphic novel, `Road to Perdition' is actually light on dialog with most of the language coming in the looks between characters. The wonderfully designed sets and beautiful cinematography lend more than perhaps words could offer. Mendes draws out the action like a man taking long slow sips from a tumbler of whiskey, and offers just the right amount of humor to effectively give respite from the tension in the film. `Road to Perdition' is a great contrast to the flash and emptiness of summer fluff like `Men in Black 2' and `Mr. Deeds'. An Oscar-worthy film for fans of ?old-school' cinema, `Perdition' challenges the viewer to stare into the soul of a man with little redeeming qualities and neither forgive, nor condemn him for his sins.</fullReview>

I did feel at some points the movie got predictable, but I really don't like suprises anyway. All in all a great film with lots of heart and feeling. As Oscar gets closer, I feel Tom Hanks did a wonderful job as the bad guy for once. People thought Hanks was always good at playing the good guy, well this movie proves that he can be play bad just as well. I think he deserves a nomination, NO.......the Oscar for "Best Male Actor in a Leading Role." (nice ring to it). I didn't really see any of Paul Newman's work, but his salad dressing is fabulous. (LOL!!) Okay,all joking aside...He was superb. I couldn't really tell if he was a bad or good guy, I mean his heart was in the right place at times, but I have no idea where his head was. Jude Law was also Excellent in this movie as well. I feel that he has an unique "knack" at playing anything that is handed to him. (Mr. Law if you read this... I think you deserved that Oscar...no offense Mr. Cain.) When I heard that he was to play an ugly, "sleezy" reporter/hitman, I expected him to look absolutly grotesqe, but he actually still look handsome (as usual :) ) Reader...If you want to spend the best matinee price this summer, bring a love one and go see Road to Perdition.

		<fullReview>The Road to Perdition is one of the most beautifully shot movies I have ever seen. The Cinematography was absolutely unbelievable. However the script did lack the emotion I was expecting to get from the movie. It wasn't the actors fault the emotion was not totally there, because as one would expect there was some unbelievable acting in this movie. I wouldn't be surprised if Hanks gets another Oscar nomination for his role as Michael Sulivan. He played the role beautifully, letting the audience decide weather to like him or not. Paul Newman was solid as Mr. Rooney. The whole loyalty thing did show through in his character as he had to choose between his real son and Michael Sulivan. Jude law also put in a good performance as the photographer. However the movie lacked a connection. Also the killing became so common in it that it lost its hole shock value, and by the end you really didn't care who got shot because everyone seemed to be. There is also no way that this should be getting compared to the Godfather or Goodfellas because other than the Cinematography those movies blow this one away. It doesn't captivate the audience like the others. So i definitely think this movie is getting to high of critical praise when it only deserves a pat on the back. There were some very memorable scenes that really kept your attention. For example the dinner scene or the scene where Michael goes down to give one of the guys the envelope. All I can say was I was disappointed, I expected this to be great when it was only average.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moody &amp; hypnotic saga</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Mendes' follow up to American Beauty is a moody and elegant crime saga, punctuated by short bursts of violence and some darkly humorous situations. While some critics have been quick to jump on the "best crime film since the godfather" bandwagon, "Road to Perdition" feels much more like a cross between the highly stylized gangster film "Miller's Crossing" and the revenge western "Unforgiven."I'll start with the good first. On a technical level the film is stunning looking. Cinematographer Conrad Hall's work is among his best to date (given his resume that's really saying something). You can practically feel the rain dripping off of the characters' hats. A beautiful production design compliments the photography, and Thomas Newman's classy score hits all of the right emotional beats.The cast is uniformly excelent. Tom Hanks, as Michael Sullivan, does excelent job protraying a man who is at once seeking revenge, seeking salvation for his past, and seeking santuary for his son. Paul Newman, in turn, responds to Tom Hanks by delving even deeper into his roll as the crime boss who can't control his own organization any more. With these two acting titans in the leads, it's dificult for some of the other actors to get their due - but there were some exceptions. In particular Jennifer Jason Leigh gives one of the few warm performaces ins an all too brief role as Sullivan's wife. Also Stanley Tucci and especially Jude Law are memorable as Crime boss Frank Nitti and a hit man, respectively.If the story does have flaws, its that this film has a certain self-conciousness about it. It knows that its trying to be a big important morality piece - which does detract from the emotional impact of the climatic scenes. (Granted I may also be responding to the ad campaigns - which have done everything short of write an acadamy award acceptance speech for the film)I gave the film an eight becuase it is an extremly accomplished - well acted motion picture. It was written with inteligence and grace and deserves alot of the priase it's getting. Definetly worth your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Road To Oscar?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a totally engrossing film from start to finish. It is one of those wondrous film going experiences, where you sense from the opening scene that you are in for a rare and special treat.Directed by Sam Mendes, who did American Beauty, this film is beautifully filmed, and marvelously acted. Every single shot in the movie is meticulously crafted and stands as a work of art on it's own. No detail is spared. Set in the early thirties it is completely authentic ( except for one continuity problem - see below ). It's hard to categorize this film, though. A relationship drama that's kind of suspenseful, a little bit thrilling, some action, but above all, intriguing. Tom Hanks lives up to incredibly high acting expectations ( can this man make a bad movie, anymore?!!?), and gives us a complex character, who despite his obvious criminal profession, is an ethical, sensitive, and loving family man. A difficult task to pull off, but Hanks does. His quiet restrained character, Mike Sullivan, conveys thought and emotion through subtle and gently nuanced expressions. It's this restraint which allows him to be so effective at his job, while his sensitivity makes him a loving and beloved father. A few complaints: A) Jennifer Jason Leigh, who is herself a talented and compelling actress, is only in a few short scenes, B) the ending was telegraphed at the beginning ( as was American Beauty - could this be a Mendes trademark? ), and C) the story takes place during 6 weeks in the winter (parts of Illinois, at that! ), but a number of scenes were very obviously filmed in the summer. This is the move to see so far this summer, particularly if you're a grown-up looking for quality entertainment, after being dragged by the kids to see Lilo and Stitch, Hey Arnold, MIB2, or Like Mike.Thumbs way up! I smell Oscar (nominations at least )! Oh, and Paul Newman, Stanley Tucci and Jude Law were terrific, as usual!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>COMPELLING, STYLISH, and GREAT! (With flaws).</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Road to Perdition" is not up to the great standards of the classic "The Godfather", as I've heard some reviewers suggest; there are just too many small problems with the plot, to be related below. But it certainly one of the best made films I have seen in a long time (dark and gloomy though it is) and is just a damn fine piece of art; it is in fact so consciously stylish it is almost overdone at times, but isn't.Directed by Sam Mendes ("American Beauty") the film is beautiful to look at; the scenes of 1931 Chicago are especially memorable. Yes it's dark, but Winter in Chicago at the height of the Depression was very dark indeed. David Self wrote the screenplay, and played down some of the violence in the book; I had the most problems with the screenplay for reasons I'll get to. Conrad L. Hall filmed "Road to Perdition" perhaps with too much detail and concern for evocative imagery.We are taken back to eastern Illinois early in 1931 where Michael Sullivan (a laconic Tom Hanks) works as an enforcer and possible hitman for wealthy gangster boss John Rooney, played with effective emotion by Paul Newman. Sullivan is also raising a family with a wife (Jennifer Jason Leigh in what amounts to a cameo role) and two boys.Sullivan and Rooney had an almost father-son relationship for decades. The problem is Rooney's son, Connor, who is a weak, corrupt, and homicidally psychotic, and Daniel Craig portrays him superbly within the limits of the script. And this is the biggest problem I had with the movie.Connor is so very despicable and beneath contempt, so entirely evil and without any shred of redeeming qualities, he is painfully two dimensional. His murderous actions destroy the relationship between his father and Sullivan and are what drive everything that happens in the film. There is no attempt to even explain what motivates Connor to do what he does. This is a real flaw in the film. Villains with depth, going back to such as Magua in "Last of the Mohicans", make the events that transpire more meaningful. His attack on Sullivan's family, after one of the boys sees Connor and his father kill three people, begins Sullivan's search for vengeance and retribution.This brings up a plot hole. Rooney (Newman) knew all along his son was not only robbing him but killing his own men to cover up his actions. And yet he did nothing about it, not even just cut him out of the business and exile him to Ireland, where he suggested Sullivan go. Instead, he allowed Connor to inexorably bring him to ruin. Just because Connor is his son does not explain this adequately.Sullivan, on the run with his twelve-year-old son, is out for vengeance, and he sees Frank Nitti (a superb Stanley Tucci), whom he knows, running the Chicago mob with Al Capone in Alcatraz, but Rooney has already convinced Nitti that for business reasons Connor should be kept in protective custody from Sullivan - and to contract a hitman to kill him. So, Sullivan is forced to wage war by stealing Mob money in various banks while avoiding - or shooting it out with - the hitman, a creepy and odd fellow named Maguire played by Jude Law. It is also obvious that Nitti despises Connor, who will survive so long as his father lives. It is a business decision, after all, by Nitti.,Sullivan demonstrates his naivete when he brings proof to Rooney of Connor's ongoing theft. Of course Rooney already knows. . . and then Sullivan finally realizes what I realized at least half an hour earlier: the only way to get to Connor is to first take out his father - who had been a surrogate father to Sullivan. His delayed awakening to what had to be done came too abruptly to satisfy me.Sullivan's son, played introspectively by Tyler Hoechlin, follows his father around throughout his six week odyssey, learning to both drive and handle a gun. It seems as though "Road to Perdition" could very easily have been told more through the eyes and mind of the son. Nevertheless, he gave a good performance.Despite my complaints with parts of the plot and excessive attempts at artistic cinematography, this remains an excellent film well worth seeing. It is just no classic, such as "The Godfather". Nine out of ten! Newman is guaranteed to get awards for this, as is Mendes for the direction.There are other plot holes listed below but may be spoilers.WARNING: SPOILERS BELOW!After Connor committed his first murder, and then saw Michael Jr. watching, why didn't Sullivan perceive the obvious and kill Connor blaming it on the already dead guys? Everyone hated Connor anyway.When Connor gave him that sealed letter, supposed from Rooney, to take to that coke head club owner/pimp, why was Sullivan so naive as to not open it and read it first? Why would he trust Connor after that murder?During the first shoot out with Maguire, why didn't Sullivan finish him off when he was down? It would have taken a second and prevented him from resurfacing later. It only made sense.Was Maguire acting on Nitti's orders at the end? Didn't Nitti say it was all over on the phone?Why was Sullivan so nonchalant at the end of the film in that house? Like he didn't have enemies including Maguire, among others?When Sullivan was shot, his son sure lucked out finding that farm family that neither called the police nor objected to Sullivan recuperating there, and then didn't mind Michael Jr. moving in. That kind of luck strained credulity.Why did Rooney do absolutely nothing to stop Connor even when he knew he was robbing him and even committing murders of his friends? There were any number of things he could have done besides just kill him.When Sullivan shot Maguire in the back at the end of the movie why didn't the bullet go through Maguire and hit Michael Jr. standing in front of him?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly authentic and astounding piece of film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The basis which great film thrives upon are the characters. In his sophomore effort, Director Sam Mendes (American Beauty) once again takes his stage background and fuses fantastic character development with audacious storytelling. Road to Perdition stars a phenomenal cast which provides the basis for one of the best films of the year. From its' sleek directing, to its' riveting central conflict between son and father, this film must be screened more than once in order to truly appreciate the authentic and masterful product that has been engineered. Tom Hanks continues to follow in the paths of the other famous Tom, as he also amazes in his selection of roles. Opting for a flawed and merciless character, Hanks portrays Mike Sullivan; a hitman under employment of the venerable Paul Newman. Newman plays Irish Mob Gangster Paul Rooney, a ruthless and seemingly timid character who controls all, as demonstrated in the opening wake sequence. Set in the Depression-era 30's, the setting completes this taut tale of vengeance and loyalty as Mike Sullivan must protect his junior when he gives into his curiosity and discovers what his father does for a living. The bonds of loyalty and family are despaired as those friends one considered family, are in actuality their killers. After a regrettable series of events, Michael Sullivan is forced to protect his son from those same people he worked for in fear of the young one divulging the information witnessed, thus compromising the whole organization. Director Sam Mendes proves with this very film that his previous effort, American Beauty, was not a stroke of luck. Based upon a graphic novel written by Max Allen Collins and Richard Piers Rayner, David Self's script based on the graphic novel allows Mendes to lift the imagery and visuals instilled within that novel. The subtle brilliance of the film resides in the aesthetic aspect, it has been quite some time since the concepts of style and substance may be both equally and positively discussed within the same film. The film's style is a surreal scope of visceral beauty. Mendes once again teams with Cinematographer Conrad L. Hall in order to lens this magnificent looking film. From the streaming bead of raindrops to the lush oceanic view, to the ambience captured in front of the lens, this film contains a myriad of memorable sequences (One such sequence is the Tommy-gun in the rain sequence) attributable duly to the visual stylings of Conrad L. Hall and the vision of Sam Mendes. Mendes also succeeds in the plot department. One of my biggest fears before entering the film would be to discover how much content can be extrapolated from a graphic novel. The film's nucleus is not on the notion of gangsterism, but on the notion of familial ties and loyalty. From the film's opening, we notice the salty relationship between the young Sullivan and his senior, as the film progresses, we see a certain sense of preference from one son to another as Hanks invites affection from one child and not from the other. Yet, throughout the tumultuous and stricken-riddled times, under pressure, a relationship forms between father and son as they escape danger and form an actual bond based on emotion and not one of a sanguinal affiliation. The debate of style over substance can be put to rest because this film has many of the prerequisites that are needed to create a truly great piece of film. As aforementioned, one of the traits was the acting. The film's focal point is the father and son relationship witnessed through a triadic loop. Allegiances and blood are witnessed as three different sets of father ? son relationships are jeopardized. As Sullivan is protecting his son, Newman's character is also protecting his, and while all this transpires, the bond that Hanks and Newman's characters possessed is also put to the test. Paul Newman does an absolute astounding piece of character incarnation with his brief albeit imperative role. Yet, audience members will retain the devilish snare of Jude Law's hired assassin role as Law tears into his cunning character's portrayal. It would be criminal to exclude Stanley Tucci's role as Frank NItti, Al Capone's right hand man. Finally, Tyler Doelich is brute and compliments the ongoing relationship between himself and Hanks as this young actor holds his own against the remarkable Tom Hanks. The film in essence is an audacious piece of cinema not because it is a gangster film, but because it is a piece about the relationships in our lives that were not held dear to us, and upon second chance, given the opportunity, we can resuscitate those failed relationships. If we look at the greatest gangster films made such as Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather I, or Martin Scorcese's Goodfellas, these films were great not because of their torrid love affair with gangsterism, but because it explored the trivial relationships normal society could have never understood and put them on a template. Loyalties and bonds can be easily decimated, and in this film, the relationships examined are two fold. One of which is the fascination within a crime family and its' many drawbacks, but secondly and most important of all, it is about the emotional toll it may take upon the members of these organizations. Jennifer Jason Leigh portrays Sullivan's wife and within the limited amount of time we see the pair together, the scenes allude to an impersonal and fabricated relationship. With the demands of ?evening assignments' for the Man of the house, relationships are not sincere and dependence more than romance seems to be the centerpiece of the relationship. Mendes will reap the benefits of this film for a long time. His vision and manipulation of the 30's crime era has resulted in a sleek, authentic and masterful film that requires full appreciation for the amalgamation of all the requirements that make cinema the art medium that it is.Giancarlo's Rating: ***1/2</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ROAD TO PERDITION was one of the most anticipated films of the summer, and I was one of the anxious ticket buyers in line on opening day to see it. Teaming Tom Hanks, one of the most compulsively watchable actors in Hollywood today, and Sam Mendes, who proved his artistry with AMERICAN BEAUTY, in a dark, moody gangster epic seemed like a sure bet. Two hours after paying my seven bucks I couldn't help but feel a little let down. The movie is undeniably gorgeous. It contains the most jaw dropping cinematography since last year's THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE, but after all was said and done I was left cold. There are scenes that seem to ignite the screen, like Hank's final showdown with Paul Newman in the rain. But many of the scenes fall flat, especially those between Michael Jr. and dad. These scenes feel like they SHOULD be the heart of the picture, but they simply do not ring true. The performance of Paul Newman is a towering accomplishment that deserves to be in a better movie. Hanks is decent, but when you remember that this is the man who gave us FORREST GUMP and PHILADELPHIA, you realize this isn't of the same caliber. Then, there is Jude Law, who plays the role of a hitman hired to kill Hanks. He is an oafish cartoon, a caricature of 30's noir villians direct from the Peter Lorre School of Gangsters. He sticks out like a sore thumb, jarring satire in a very serious movie. And the films conclusion is to neat and predictable to be respected. As the credits rolled I was conflicted. This film has so many things to admire about it, so many reasons to see it, yet there were just as many reasons to skip it. It gives you a taste of something that could of been very good, and makes you leave the theater wanting something better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you wake up hearing reviews comparing ROAD TO PERDITION with THE GODFATHER, there is little much in the way of stopping one from going. But the reality is far different. ROAD TO PERDITION is a superb movie, flawlessly acted and artistically solid in many respects, but the failure to perfectly blend and relate the two together (ROAD has a give-and-take approach where the art and performance tag each other in from scene to scene) keeps the Corleone family on top. But film fans can rejoice, another movie is successfully made this year ignoring pop culture.Michael Sullivan lives a life owing it to his boss, John Rooney. But that world comes to an end when one of his sons watches what his father does for a living.Based on a graphic novel, ROAD TO PERDITION deals with many subjects, but the plain reality is that Jude Law's performance was outstanding.

I also thought it had some of the most disturbing gun scenes I've ever scene you feel it each time you hear the report of a gun. At times you want to look away. Tom Hanks delivers a warm yet firm performance as a hitman and a father who's just doing what he has to do to provide for his family. Jude Law delivers a extremley creepy performance as a photographer hitman. Do yourself see this movie!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>COMPELLING, STYLISH, and GREAT! (With flaws).</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Road to Perdition" is not up to the great standards of the classic "The Godfather", as I've heard some reviewers suggest; there are just too many small problems with the plot, to be related below. But it certainly one of the best made films I have seen in a long time (dark and gloomy though it is) and is just a damn fine piece of art; it is in fact so consciously stylish it is almost overdone at times, but isn't.Directed by Sam Mendes ("American Beauty") the film is beautiful to look at; the scenes of 1931 Chicago are especially memorable. Yes it's dark, but Winter in Chicago at the height of the Depression was very dark indeed. David Self wrote the screenplay, and played down some of the violence in the book; I had the most problems with the screenplay for reasons I'll get to. Conrad L. Hall filmed "Road to Perdition" perhaps with too much detail and concern for evocative imagery.We are taken back to eastern Illinois early in 1931 where Michael Sullivan (a laconic Tom Hanks) works as an enforcer and possible hitman for wealthy gangster boss John Rooney, played with effective emotion by Paul Newman. Sullivan is also raising a family with a wife (Jennifer Jason Leigh in what amounts to a cameo role) and two boys.Sullivan and Rooney had an almost father-son relationship for decades. The problem is Rooney's son, Connor, who is a weak, corrupt, and homicidally psychotic, and Daniel Craig portrays him superbly within the limits of the script. And this is the biggest problem I had with the movie.Connor is so very despicable and beneath contempt, so entirely evil and without any shred of redeeming qualities, he is painfully two dimensional. His murderous actions destroy the relationship between his father and Sullivan and are what drive everything that happens in the film. There is no attempt to even explain what motivates Connor to do what he does. This is a real flaw in the film. Villains with depth, going back to such as Magua in "Last of the Mohicans", make the events that transpire more meaningful. His attack on Sullivan's family, after one of the boys sees Connor and his father kill three people, begins Sullivan's search for vengeance and retribution.This brings up a plot hole. Rooney (Newman) knew all along his son was not only robbing him but killing his own men to cover up his actions. And yet he did nothing about it, not even just cut him out of the business and exile him to Ireland, where he suggested Sullivan go. Instead, he allowed Connor to inexorably bring him to ruin. Just because Connor is his son does not explain this adequately.Sullivan, on the run with his twelve-year-old son, is out for vengeance, and he sees Frank Nitti (a superb Stanley Tucci), whom he knows, running the Chicago mob with Al Capone in Alcatraz, but Rooney has already convinced Nitti that for business reasons Connor should be kept in protective custody from Sullivan - and to contract a hitman to kill him. So, Sullivan is forced to wage war by stealing Mob money in various banks while avoiding - or shooting it out with - the hitman, a creepy and odd fellow named Maguire played by Jude Law. It is also obvious that Nitti despises Connor, who will survive so long as his father lives. It is a business decision, after all, by Nitti.,Sullivan demonstrates his naivete when he brings proof to Rooney of Connor's ongoing theft. Of course Rooney already knows. . . and then Sullivan finally realizes what I realized at least half an hour earlier: the only way to get to Connor is to first take out his father - who had been a surrogate father to Sullivan. His delayed awakening to what had to be done came too abruptly to satisfy me.Sullivan's son, played introspectively by Tyler Hoechlin, follows his father around throughout his six week odyssey, learning to both drive and handle a gun. It seems as though "Road to Perdition" could very easily have been told more through the eyes and mind of the son. Nevertheless, he gave a good performance.Despite my complaints with parts of the plot and excessive attempts at artistic cinematography, this remains an excellent film well worth seeing. It is just no classic, such as "The Godfather". Nine out of ten! Newman is guaranteed to get awards for this, as is Mendes for the direction.There are other plot holes listed below but may be spoilers.WARNING: SPOILERS BELOW!After Connor committed his first murder, and then saw Michael Jr. watching, why didn't Sullivan perceive the obvious and kill Connor blaming it on the already dead guys? Everyone hated Connor anyway.When Connor gave him that sealed letter, supposed from Rooney, to take to that coke head club owner/pimp, why was Sullivan so naive as to not open it and read it first? Why would he trust Connor after that murder?During the first shoot out with Maguire, why didn't Sullivan finish him off when he was down? It would have taken a second and prevented him from resurfacing later. It only made sense.Was Maguire acting on Nitti's orders at the end? Didn't Nitti say it was all over on the phone?Why was Sullivan so nonchalant at the end of the film in that house? Like he didn't have enemies including Maguire, among others?When Sullivan was shot, his son sure lucked out finding that farm family that neither called the police nor objected to Sullivan recuperating there, and then didn't mind Michael Jr. moving in. That kind of luck strained credulity.Why did Rooney do absolutely nothing to stop Connor even when he knew he was robbing him and even committing murders of his friends? There were any number of things he could have done besides just kill him.When Sullivan shot Maguire in the back at the end of the movie why didn't the bullet go through Maguire and hit Michael Jr. standing in front of him?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true masterpiece of its genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Road to Perdition tonight. It was amazing. Not completely original in theory, but original in execution and a masterpiece of its genre. Truly a film that could only be made through the leadership of a master in the art form. It did not, however, rise to the potential of being the master's greatest work. The film was made with the conscience of the genre without making a statement on the genre. Movies such as Unforgiven (dir. by Clint Eastwood) accomplish success in recreating the genre and at the same time leaving a mark on that genre. And I see Unforgiven as being an example of Clint Eastwood's greatest work. But, beyond my pretentious musings, this film is an outstanding piece. Any lover of film, or any lover of a great gangster story, should definitely see this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark, revenge tale redeemed by a father-son dynamic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Hanks stretches his dramatic muscles some more in this allegory brilliantly directed by Sam (American Beauty) Mendes. There will be Oscar nominations all around for acting, directing, writing, and cinematography-oh and of course Best Picture.This is a deceptively simple morality tale that seems to have Shakespearean overtones, and yet its source was a graphic novel! Tom Hanks is an enforcer/hitman for an Irish patriarch played winningly by Paul Newman. Newman and Hanks are like father and son. Newman's own son is a loser who sets in motion a series of tragic, violent events that leaves Hanks and his son on the run from a top hit man(Jude Law). As a determined Hanks seeks to vengeance in some clever, unorthodox ways, he attempts to connect with his own son.That connection forms the glue that holds this film together. The period is recreated splendidly in set design, costumes, and special effect backgrounds. Kudos all around. You kind of know how this will turn out after a couple of minor twists and turns, but in the end, it all makes sense. The world is back in balance and at peace.This is the perfect antidote to light escapist adventures and comedies. If a serious thoughtful well made story (albeit violent) is your cup of tea, then by all means sip away!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At a special members-only preview, The Los Angeles County Museum of Art last night played host to an early screening of the much-heralded new film from Dreamworks, actor Tom Hanks and director, Sam Mendes, The Road to Perdition.This film is amazing. Amazing because how bad it is. Sam Mendez used the same cinematograher for this sophmore effort, the great Conrad Hall. How did these two guys make such a boring movie? It's amazing.How do you get flat performances out of Tom Hanks and Paul Newman. Tom's gangster (Irish, yet?), was a monotone Sylvester Stallone imitation and Paul as the crime boss just didn't seem interested. Jennifer Jason Leigh wasn't even fun to watch as Tom's frumpy wife. Chicago in the Roaring Twenties, dull? As dishwater.The rest of the supporting cast was all too plain and generic. Very forgettable. I was praying for the always great, Stanly Tucci (as Frank Nitti) to do something wonderful. Bruce Gordon was better on the TV show. Amazing.For a brief moment things livened up when Jude Law entered the story as a newspaper photographer who specialized in crime scenes. For a minute the haunting beauty of "American" started to show. But then he started sleep walking too. Just amazing.Everyone knows the recent past is hard to get right. Here they went over board on the authenticity of props. OK, the cars were great, just like in Bonnie and Clyde. But there was no soul in any shot. The hairstyles were right, but nothing else was. The feel was wrong from the start. From here, the 20's and 30's may look dingy, but they weren't for those who were there. Try talking to an old person some time. This film is a blank.I was looking at my watch fifteen minutes in to this. I couldn't wait for it to end. It's about as exciting as ending up at the Indiana Dunes. Amazing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was nice to see a movie with fine acting and nothing being blown up. Tom Hanks and Paul Newman are real actors who do an excellent job in this movie. Tom Hanks is believable in his part as well as any part I have seen him perform in. The youngster who played his son in the movie Tyler Hoechlin is someone to watch as he was very good in the part. Be sure and go see this one, it is worth the money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Incredible Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was lucky enough to obtain sneak peak tickets to see Road to Perdition 3 days before its release.The first mob movie that I had seen that really focused on the life of a hitman rather than a don or family member, Perdition contained ingenious camera shots, spectacular acting, perfectly utilized music and a compelling and realistic storyline that seemed to pull me into 1931 Chicago and surrounding area.I don't want to give anything away- but let me say this: Tom Hanks is great as the hitman looking out for his family Paul Newman is convincing as the head of an important family. The rest of the actors also gave breathtaking performances that conveyed not only emtion, but a sense of realism as well.I implore you to go and see this movie, for it deserves a 10/10 in my book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just caught a preview of "Road to Perdition", and I must say, I was disappointed. While beautiful to look at on a technical level, the story and characters left me cold. What struck me as particularly hollow was the relationship between 1930's Chicago hit man Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) and his son, Michael Jr. As the film opens, they are extremely distant: the father cold and calculating, the son introverted yet observant. When they are forced to flee for their lives, a bond grows between them that, for me, didn't ring true, leading to an emotionless finale. Technically, however, the film is masterful. Sam Mendes may have begun his career in the theater, but he shows here that "American Beauty" was no fluke...this guy is a born filmmaker. He gets outstanding performances from Hanks (whose character, nonetheless, remains a cipher thanks to the screenplay), Paul Newman, and Jude Law, as well as Tyler Hochelin as Michael Jr. and Stanley Tucci as real-life mob enforcer Frank Nitti. The cinematography by the great Conrad Hall is breathtaking and Thomas Newman's score ranks among his best. It's just unfortunate that the story doesn't quite hold up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Daddy Sullivan's Redemption from Damnation!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Mendes has once again succeeded in bringing a phenomenally compelling movie to the screen. Like his Oscar winning American Beauty, the story of this movie revolves around the principle male character as a father, and is equipped with the perception of this man by his child during the boy's coming-of-age period. And the enigmatic idolization of a child for his father is so incredibly portrayed with each event unfolding, and with the father's attempt to seek emancipation from his Mafioso life. Mendez has done a marvelous job, creating a truly surreal cinematic atmosphere so coherent with the fusion of characters, their emotions and their events!The pace is slow but absolutely engaging. Yep, this film fine-tunes a storyline that is more potent and emotional than what has been projected from the graphic novel of Max Allan Collins and Richard Piers Rayner. But it does adhere very closely to Collin's re-write.Poignant, powerful, and somewhat subtly beautiful, this movie allows the development of the father-child relationship to work terrifically, and to be justifiably determined through the contact of other characters and the mesmerizing multi-events. It offers an overwhelming take on the `mob-family' culture and lifestyle of the violent Mid-West in the 1930s Depression Era -- with events that continuously keep viewers astounded and attentive. It's a fabulously directed movie, capturing an extensive scope of the forces of emotion: love, betrayal, loyalty, and vengeance. It garlands a gangster story with the remarkable feel of danger as the camera rolls, yet not escaping its desire to show the characters' self discovery aspects. Oh yes, the story is swarmed with actions of gangster-type hitmen, bringing the viewers into lots of corners and alleys of suspense and surprises. There're also the subtle ritualistic symbolism, clichés, and references to religious practices of the times.Great overall performances by a stellar cast of amazing talents, but Jude Law's Maguire very dark character (a.k.a. The Reporter) is most outstanding. Even though his dialogue is scanty, he provokes an alarm of uncanny mystery, suspense, and unpredictability each time he makes his entrance in the scenes. Truly an incredible show of performing talent! And with his attempt to meet his thwarted `study of death' pleasures adds momentary dark humor to the screen. Although Law's character is not in the original Collins-Piers graphic novel, his role is definitely a mighty plus for David Self to introduce into the script. And the obvious miss-and-match of events and situations from graphic novel to screen makes the story more moving and the characters more intense.This film focuses well on the dually conflicting conscience of every character, highlighting on the separation of thoughts along the line of duty and loyalty, between bloodline and surrogacy, and between monetary greed and respect of the `Code.' Each character is unique in their traits and feelings; each succeeding in appearing non-superficial and very credible. Even without lengthy dialogue, every actor exhibits very stunningly amazing images of his/her character. Tyler Hoechlin, a first-timer in his acting career, is professionally awesome as the young Michael and the story's narrator. Yep, all the principle characters do deserve an Oscar nomination this year!Even the film's final moments are incredibly potent. They beautifully sum up the emotional stress of Tom Hanks' character. They provide the answer to what Michael Sullivan, fears most as a father. Go see this film and find out if Daddy Sullivan's choice to travel the `road to Perdition' is what he wishes for his son!Truly a magnificent and dramatic thriller that will take the audience on a non-stop roller-coaster ride through history's dark gangland experiences and intrigue, yet not robbing the audiences of the heart-felt emotions of a father-son relationship! Looks like Sam Mendes will be leading his film to the road of many Oscar nominations!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Road to perdition was one of the best movies I've seen this year. I'm lucky enough that I got to watch this movie two weeks before it will be released in theaters. This movie is about a father and his son. Tom Hanks, who plays the role of a father, does an excellent job performing in this film. Although this movie is one of a kind, it does not pick up in the beginning. You have to wait for at least 20-30 minutes until it starts getting more interesting. But overall, this movie is an excellent flick for all of you out there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Rewarding Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview> I had a chance to catch a preview of this film, and I found it to be a rewarding film that kept my interest throughout. When I first heard there was a film starring Tom Hanks as a hitman in a period film, I was sceptical and expected the worst, but he plays the role very convincingly, once again showing his advancing diversity (a long way from the light comedy roles that he started out with). Hanks plays Michael Sullivan, a hitman who is the right hand man of John Rooney (Paul Newman), and also a married father of two boys. While on a job, his older son witnesses a murder. Soon afterwards it is decided that by being a witness he is a liability, and a hit is set. Unfortunately, it ends up being Michael's wife and younger son who are killed. Thus begins a lengthy chase as well as a mission of both revenge and redemption as Sullivan and his son are hunted by Maguire, who has a fetish for the dead. The story, although rather predictable, is well acted and directed, with compelling performances from all of those involved. (Jude Law displays much more ability than in his cardboard character role in Star Wars) Newman comes across convincingly in his role as godfather, even if he has little camera time, its a case of quality of quantity. Overall, the film is good and sure to garnish lots of attention. However, some people are already saying it is Oscar worthy, etc and although the film is engaging, the performances that are given should be expected, not treated as an exception.  A movie well worth the price of admission in a summer full of big budget mind wasters. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Perdition" is defined as the loss of a person's soul, or a state of eternal damnation. So it would be fair to expect "Road to Perdition" to be a cautionary tale about self-destruction. But, as he proved in "American Beauty," director Sam Mendes isn't interested in the obvious; in "Beauty" and now in "Perdition," there's much more going on besides the action we see and the dialogue we hear. Certainly no one is going to accuse of Mendes of copying from his Oscar-winning debut. Where "Beauty" resonated with seductive colors and crackling performances, "Perdition" is awash in shadows, darkness and solemnity. It's impossible to discuss "Perdition" without praising Conrad Hall's superb cinematography, which yields striking images of a world that's been drained of most of its color. Mendes also makes phenomenal use of sound, particularly during a massacre that occurs on rain-soaked city streets and a sequence in which the staccato clicking of a stock ticker is contrasted with the rat-a-tat-tat of gunfire. Beautifully acted, stunningly directed and richly rewarding, this is the kind of intricately designed movie that will undoubtedly yield more details and messages on a second or third viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By predictable I mean, PREDICTABLE. There is good cinematography, good performances... a lot of talent has been expended on this film. Yet its undermined by a pile of movie clichés and predictabilities that pile in, particularly at the end.Things really began to disintegrate for me with the implausible Tommy-gun massacre. Nobody runs for cover, nobody is wounded. Everyone is shot dead. At that distance. With a very inaccurate Tommy gun. "What!", I thought. Except of course the main gangster. Who just stands there... and is suddenly fearlessly reconciled to being shot dead. Going out without any trepidation... just a dramatic line for his last words. This is only topped by the PREDICTABLE ending. Possibly the most predictable one I've ever seen. How can you not know who is going to turn up? And yes he does. And the 12 year old kid who manages to become a getaway driver for his father suddenly can't pull a gun trigger to save his life. And the villain does the usual give-me-the-gun while slowly stepping towards him routine. Cliché after cliché after cliché.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crime still doesn't pay ? even for the 'heroes'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A dark and foreboding movie, "Road to Perdition," is a somber film to watch. The producers toned down the gore and graphics of the violent murders. But, I wonder if that sometimes doesn't mask the horror of what is taking place in the minds of some viewers. Perhaps it should be more graphic to further dissuade any notions of a person being able to kill so wantonly. Some rather bizarre murders have occurred in the past few decades, committed by young people. I don't need to list sources because a check of the Internet will provide numerous expert sites. While children couldn't get into theaters to see this "R" rated film, no doubt many may see it at home on DVD. I don't relish watching any of the gore of violence or killing. This movie has an age-old message that crime does not pay. It shows the hurt and loss that come to families who get caught up in crime. Very poignantly here, it's the damage and loss to and within the families of those very people engaged in the criminal livelihoods. The cast are all very good in their roles. Fortunately, the movie ends with a sort of ironic justice. The hunter and the hunted both meet their end. And the young Michael turns his back on a life of crime. I read that the story is based loosely on a real person, in the role that Pual Newman plays ? John Rooney. Did they really find all those old cars, or was this film made with CGI?</fullReview>

This sets of events that give us a bonding experience between the father and the son.Tom Hanks' acting was great as the leading man. I was also impressed with Stanley Tucci even though he didn't have that much screen time. But the real deal was Paul Newman in a supporting role. This was actually my first film with him starring in it. So I'm looking forward to watching his older work. I wasn't too keen on Tyler Hoechlin's performance but oh well. It goes I guess. I must say I preferred Kodi Smit-McPhee in The Road. A very similar movie with almost identical role as the innocent little boy.This movie had a great cinematography and I have to give extra credit to a certain scene where there is rain pouring. Absolutely beautiful to look at. Films' score was also beautiful. The subtle piano was great.The story was predictable and about halfway to the story it I knew how it was going to end.

		<fullReview>When his son witnesses him applying a hit, mob enforcer Michael Sullivan finds that the man whom he likened to a father has ordered a hit on him and his family. Too late to save his wife and youngest child, Sullivan goes on the run with his eldest boy and plots revenge along the way.How refreshing to find a gangster movie in the modern age, more so, how refreshing to find a gangster movie set in the early 1930s and not involving foul mouthed Mafioso types. Directed by Sam Mendes and starring Tom Hanks, Paul Newman, Daniel Craig and Jude Law, Road To Perdition is an adaptation of the Graphic Novel that was brought to us by Max Allan Collins &amp; Richard Piers Rayner. The film deals with themes of violence and its consequences and fathers and sons, set to a watery back drop during the Great Depression. It's also a pulse pinging treat of visual magnificence thanks to cinematographer Conrad L. Hall. Comparisons with great gangster film's of the past are inevitable, but Mendes' film has more in common with something like Eastwood's Unforgiven and John Ford's The Searchers, the journey of the lead protagonist is fraught and telling, and motivated by circumstance. But the trick for first time viewers that Road To Perdition has up its sleeve, is that we don't know how it will work out for Hanks' Sullivan. It makes for a riveting experience with many transcendent rewards along the way.As regards the cast, Hanks is a touch miscast, but his play off relationship with the quite terrific Newman gives the film some solid ground from which to launch its sombre story. Daniel Craig does a nifty line in weasel and Law convinces as a mouldy toothed hired killer who enjoys taking photographs of his victims. With almost philosophical mediations on good and bad, and elegiacally drawn by Mendes, the film thrives as a poetic and atmospheric piece. It's story might be basic, but it rises above that because it be a superbly directed and well acted picture. One that just happens to be beautiful in spite of the bleakness that lingers on the main protagonist. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Bloody Road It Is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Road To Perdition refers both to a town called Perdition, Michigan and to a place where lead character Tom Hanks will no doubt be spending a lot of time in the hereafter. Tom Hanks has astonished the world the range of his talent, he's no longer the guy who starred in silly comedies and this is just the latest in a collection of gem like performances you would never have expected. At least from the guy starred on television in Bosom Buddies.Hanks is an enforcer for a suburban Illinois Irish mob under the control of Paul Newman. Hanks is a family man with a wife and two boys and he's like a son to Newman. But blood is thicker than water and his heart is with his real son Daniel Craig.Craig is nothing like his father however and when Craig loses his temper and winds up killing someone Newman just said to talk to Hanks is not happy. But Tom's older son Tyler Hoechlin stowed away in the car and witnessed the whole thing.Informers have an especially low place in Irish culture and Hoechlin has a strong regard for that, but that's not good enough for Craig who thinks he'll get ratted out. Why take the chance as the bosses reasoned in Casino. He puts a hit out on Hanks that is botched, but also kills Tom's wife Jennifer Jason Leigh and Liam Aitken his younger son. Hanks and Hoechlin have to flee, but by no means is this over.Hanks and young Hoechlin have a good chemistry together. Both are tightlipped and restrained. Hanks lives in a violent world, but has done his best to keep his family out of it as best he could. He's numbed by the tragedy, but not enough to plan his revenge. Hoechlin is just traumatized, today he'd be in all kinds of counseling.Paul Newman got his last nomination for an acting Oscar, this time in the Best Supporting Actor category. Newman lost to Chris Cooper for Adaptation, but this was a fine role to cap his career. This did turn out to be his last big screen role in which he was seen. Road To Perdition won an Oscar for Cinematography and was also nominated for Best Sound, Sound Editing, Musical Score, and Art&amp;Set Direction.We can't forget Jude Law who is another of Newman's deadly hit men who also is unforgettable. And Daniel Craig who is the new James Bond is far from heroic here.Road To Perdition is an unforgettable and haunting film, don't miss it by any means.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Road to Perdition : Dostoyevskian</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 2002 "Road to Perditon" directed by Sam Mendes who also brought us "American Beauty." Where "American Beauty" is a film trite, trivial, filled with clichés, "The Road to Perdition" has Dostoyevskian reaches.Michael Sullivan's son, also named Michael, has witnessed his father in an inadvertent mob hit orchestrated by Connor Rooney. Connor Rooney learns of the young boy witnessing the carnage, returns to Michael Sullivan's house and shoots to death Sullivan's wife and the wrong, younger son. Michael Sullivan and the son who witnessed the mob hit set out in picaresque fashion to revenge the murders. They must find Connor Rooney who is being hid by his father John Rooney, John Rooney has also sent a hit man to kill Michael Sullivan; the son is not to be killed according to John Rooney but the audience knows that the boy's life is at risk; if his life is not at risk, the child could end up being a hit man himself.But the viewer must know that Michael Sullivan was orphaned at an early age--how is not made clear--and was taken in by John Rooney (Paul Newman). For revenge Michael Sullivan must kill off his father figure in a bloody machine gun shootout; he kills his brother figure in a simple gunshot between the eyes. John Rooney says that he's glad Michael Sullivan, hit man extraordinaire, is pulling the trigger to kill him. At some point, the viewer inevitably asks what happened to Michael Sullivan's father? Did John Rooney have him killed in a hit or did John Rooney do the hit himself? When did this happen? Why did this happen? The viewer is left with this unasked question hovering in the background.There is a pivotal scene in a church basement where John Rooney says to Michael Sullivan that neither of them as hit men are likely to end up in heaven. So the story becomes not only one of revenge, it is also about extrication of the son, Michael, from this road to perdition--the child as father to the man--that is to say, the child himself will become a hit man and thus lose his soul to perdition.The viewer must ask: whose movie, whose story is this? The story is from the eyes of the son, not Michael Sullivan the father.The movie is fast paced and suspenseful, the ending satisfies that Chekovian dictum: if a gun is on the table in the first act, it must go off by the third act; all pieces come together in perfection.</fullReview>

Somehow, this time the story turns the other way round: Mike fights to save his life and his only remaining son, because the rest of his family was killed due to dirty game of his own boss. He succeeds in his revenge and secures honorable future to his son, but gets killed in the end. Such stories never have happy end after all.The role of Mike Salliwan senior was wonderfully played by Tom Hanks, and the part of Mr. Rooney (the Mafia boss) was performed by Paul Newman. The film makes a great impression, and we hear the well-known phrase "we rob banks". This film is still worth watching although you could have expected something bigger from Sam Mendes after his American Beauty.</fullReview>

But, his children are unaware that this is his job, and when one witnesses a cold blooded murder by him, he is placed in an awkward position. And when an atrocity occurs, he leaves with his son and is bent on revenge. They rob abanks and much more and build a bond. They're the perfect team. Hanks does a great job as always as well as Jude Law who plays his creepy role to perfection.

		<fullReview>I LOVE TOM HANKS! Does this sound familiar? I'm certain that I've said this before, but it's because I truly do! Michael Sullivan Sr. (Tom Hanks) puts food on the table by working for John Rooney (Paul Newman), a crime boss. Sullivan is sent with Conner, Rooney's son to go and work some issues out. Unsuspectingly Michael Jr. is interested in what father does for a living. He stows away in the backseat to observe first hand. Conner, being the sick bastard that he is decides TALKING just isn't doing it for him! Unknowingly, Michael Jr. becomes a witness to what exactly is done to provide for The Sullivan family. TALK ABOUT EYE OPENERS.... Connor is made to apologize for his lack of discretion. Michael Jr. becomes reticent. Sullivan convinces his wife that his talk with their son will make matters okay. But there is serious doubt causing others to be edgy. Sullivan rushes home from a business trip, which was to be his demise. He finds that his mob family has taken the life of his wife, and their youngest son. Sullivan now realizes that he's in a race to not only avenge his family, but save his only son Michael Jr. from the life that he's lead. "It is a natural law; sons were put on earth to trouble their fathers." Expressively we see as Sullivan's character undergoes a major change. He races from city to city in search of work, with one exception. UNFORTUNATELY Frank Nitti (Chicago) can't grant him that exception. Harlan Maguire, a peculiar photographing hit man is hired to stub out Sullivan Sr. At the risk of getting Michael Jr. safely to PERDITION. Sullivan is forced to step on major toes. Although its not what one would consider a "normal" father &amp; son relationship. Sullivan and Michael Jr. bond as he teaches him to be observant, how to drive, and how to rob banks. Michael Jr. now knows the love, and fear that his father has in his heart. I loved this movie. Yes there was a lot of violence, and Jude Law scared the hell out of me! With all of that said, ROAD TO PERDITION is a beautiful movie about the love that is between each father &amp; son.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mendes follows up with another 'beauty'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone who has to direct another movie after his first feature film won him a Best Director Oscar, has to be scared out of his mind. How do you top that? Seriously. Although "Road to Perdition" is an impassioned story (based on a graphic novel) of an Irish mobster and his son trying to stay alive, its screenplay is not the opus that "American Beauty" was. So, how do you approach your next directorial project when the bar is absurdly high? Whatever Sam Mendes did, it worked, because "Perdition" is just as beautiful and poetic.The posthumous Oscar for cinematographer Conrad L. Hall is much deserved. "Perdition" is a story that takes death rather lightly with a very high body count and as seen in "American Beauty," Mendes will settle for nothing but the most visually memorable and poetic of tragic climaxes and deaths. These two make quite a team, inflating what's just a good but not great script into a rich and striking film. They milk everything they can out of the film's most poignant moments and convince you of that feeling that you're watching incredible, meaningful cinema when it's just a very good/interesting story at best.Taking place in 1930s Illinois and Chicago, "Perdition" is about Michael Sullivan, a hit man (Hanks) with two young boys working for an Irish mob boss John Rooney (Newman) -- loosely based on real gangster John Looney -- who gave him everything he's ever had. When a curious Michael Jr. wants to know what his father does, he accidentally witnesses a hit gone wrong, which puts Sullivan in bad standing with his mob family. Rooney then has his son, Connor (Daniel Craig), off Sullivan's family. Sullivan and Michael Jr. manage to survive and flee to Chicago, where they are still wanted dead. Soon, father and son must be honest with each other in order to survive and Sullivan will do anything to get his revenge yet still keep his son away from it all.The cast is great, but an actor with Tom Hanks' versatile talent has no business playing a hit man of few words. Perhaps the notion of a audiences thinking it's "just another mob film" scared Mendes and other producers into getting a marquee name, but all you have to do is say Paul New-- and the old people start flocking. Newman gets a supporting Oscar nod for nothing but the respect he commands of the camera and on the screen. A mob boss is such an intriguing role for a then mostly retired famous actor and it definitely gives "Perdition" something give it that instant classic feel."Perdition" avoids telling us all the mob stuff we already know from watching "The Godfather" and "Goodfellas" in terms of organized crime life being about loyalty, respect and family, etc. It jumps right into the fresh angle it's taking: the relationship between a hit man and his son. It's a story of guarding innocence in the face of harsh, immoral reality.Most of the film is just a thriller with Sullivan finding ways to get his revenge while avoiding the man hired to whack him (Jude Law). There's a lot of killing and the general rule has always been the more killing, the less meaningful death becomes and the more silly and less serious a film is (theoretically why action movies don't get taken seriously). But Mendes and Hall take exception, making sure these deaths will give you enough chills to forget that you're tired of seeing people get shot. Lots of films have you guessing who will die -- "Perdition" has you guessing what order.The script is good, just a little deliberate. It's not shy about letting you know what it's about and what its themes are, which is always good for some viewers and souring for others. But in the end its the thoughtful and artistic eye of Mendes that wins out as the film closes with a thrilling, beautiful and near-perfect climax. Mob movies might have gotten old for some people already, but it would be inadvisable to skip out on such great film-making for that reason.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cinematographic masterpiece...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are gangster movies and then there is 'Road to Perdition'. Rarely has this genre been portrayed with this kind of sublime touch as 'Road to Perdition' managed to do.This is a father/son story which basically employs the two totally 'unfit' for the roles - Mike Sullivan (Tom Hanks) who balances his 'dark side' with a shady career and his family though he is not perfectly equipped for the consequences of his 'dual personality' and Jr. Rooney (Daniel Craig) who is a spoilt rich brat having nothing apart from a gangster father.This being a gangster film, the requisite amount of violence and bloodshed would be justified but the 'classy' touch with which the scenes are filmed without actual bloodshed makes the cinematography a hands down winner... (the scene where Rooney is murdered by Sullivan - only 'sounds' of gunshots do the talking).All praise for the stunning look of this film. Sam Mendes continues to astonish with his vivid use of color for depicting red blood splattered against pale colored walls... (Cant believe that the director of American beauty (another superb movie) can deliver a gangster movie this convincingly... the background score where the child is riding his bicycle delivering papers through snow filled roads sets the tone for the movie to follow..'Road to Perdition' lacks the aura of 'Godfather' epic, but it succeeds in evoking an old-judicial system where eye for eye revenge is dominant and 'Tom Hanks' Plays this role perfectly murdering his earlier aides for revenge for murdering his wife and younger son along with playing a dotting dad with ease.Though not a box-office shatterer, this movie is well placed for being labeled a 'cult DVD classic' ---- 9/10 definitely</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A slight variation on the father-son relation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nothing to brag about. One more film about the end of prohibition and Al Capone. One more film on the mafia, both Italian and Irish. And yet this film has a slightly different touch. It is the fact that the father-son issue is widely explored. A mafia boss has a foolish and cheating son. He protects him and takes under his wing another man, Michael Sullivan, to transfer his paternal love onto someone worth it. Unluckily a detail one night brings the son of this latter man, Michael Sullivan Jr., into the act of witnessing the son of the mafia boss killing another good man on the spur of his anger. This son of a mafia boss will then try to clean up his plate and start killing everyone connected to that embarrassing witness. Michael Sullivan Sr. then has to get on the road of vengeance after the killing of his wife and younger son. He thus escapes the killers with his older son and yet he will end up falling in the last trap out of sloppiness, maybe just to be even with fate and God. The only survivor will be Michael Jr. All the others will be dead and happily buried. There is a slight empathy in that filial and paternal situation. An entertaining film indeed.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Gangster Film That Makes Me Cry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One level, Road To Perdition, the film and its source graphic novel, is an American adventure film, and on another it's a Greek tragedy. They complement each other well. They've extracted this tone from the gray pages of the comic book and flushed it onto the screen with a painterly, deliberate pitch in its pace. Director Sam Mendes and his screenwriter David Self have given a lot of imagination and emotion to this adaptation. This film is about gangsters in the 1930s, a vendetta riddled with Robin Hood-style bank robberies and brutal murders, all of which is packed to the rafters with subtext and metaphor. It's an often overlooked contemporary milestone that is stupendously, rivetingly acted. Even Ciaran Hinds, in a small role, is a powerhouse. And, I remember sitting in the theater as a mere seventh grader who'd never before been so stricken by the sheer look of a film and predicting that no movie that year would be more conspicuously lauded for its cinematography. Conrad L. Hall's work just had to win the Academy Award. And it did, and I was proud. He constructs an almost alternate reality through the subjective universe of darkness, shadow, night, grim chiaroscuro faces, cold and snow. His characters stand in downpours, the rain running off the brims of their fedoras and almost turning the shoulders of their inextricable wool overcoats into sponges. Their feet would do well in the trenches of WWI. The all-encompassing look of the movie emits a glossy atmospheric frost. There are lots of odd, slow scenes not in the graphic novel on which this very cinematic film is based.The classically structured narrative puppeteers three father-son pairs, two biological, the third emotional, and shows how the lives in which they've immersed themselves make unconditional love between them unattainable. Tom Hanks plays Michael Sullivan, a gunman for the Rock Island reach of the Chicago mob, around 1931. Tyler Hoechlin plays his son Michael Jr., an austere boy of 12. After his brother Peter asks what their father does for a living, it hits Michael Jr. that he's never really thought about it before, and to see for himself. One night he hides in a car, goes along for the ride, and sees a man killed. Not by his father, but what concession does that make? Sullivan works for Paul Newman's John Rooney, the mob boss, who is very old but very alive and zeroed in, and says in three words what another would say in seven. John's son Connor, played by a heretofore unknown Daniel Craig, is his muscle. Sullivan's kid gets suspicious because of Daniel Craig and has a nightmare about Hinds's house. Sullivan learns that Connor has been stealing from his father, and that foreshadows the epic's implicit deduction, because Sullivan thinks of John like his own father, and John speaks of Sullivan as a son. Men who name their sons after themselves have historically suggested a desire that the boy will become like them. This is not the fortune of Michael Sr., who has made a complacent agreement with his dark side and an underworld economy to afford a comfortable home with his wife, a fleeting Jennifer Jason Leigh, and two boys in relative peace from the hardships of being earnest.The key difference between the latent heroism of Sullivan and the innate evil of Rooney, he doesn't want his son in the business. What a horrible, terrible, despicable father is. Connor is in my eyes the most tragic and tortured character in the whole story. Our baroque plot ponders whether or not it is socially impossible for fathers to free their sons from the sneaky scope of their misdeeds and mistakes. It also adds definition with sons who feel they are not the most loved. "Did you like Peter better than me?" Michael Jr. asks his father. And in a scene where Sullivan goes to see Mr. Rooney, he is not psychologically prepared to grasp why Rooney would try to shield his son Connor, whom he sees as having deeply wronged him, to his unshakingly loyal servant who is "like a son."The dominant chemistry is between Hanks and Newman, and Hanks and Hoechlin, who plays his son. Newman plays Rooney as a man whose preference for body count is as spare and pared down as his language, but his way of speaking keeps him from being fully predictable to those who know him, and so is his preference for body count. Alongside this pleasantness and aphorisms we must juxtapose his dealings in booze, gambling and women, and his intractable decisiveness to remove any affiliate whose further use would be impractical for him.The Hanks character sees the tautly quantified brighter aspects of Rooney so unswervingly that he has almost surgically blinded himself from the evil of his actions. Even after he bears witness to the worst, he feels let down, or unreciprocated, more than deceived. This willpower leaves him lacking in wisdom to pass on to his own son, and it takes Rooney, in a solipsistic passage Newman delivers with a stoic sense of altruism, to sober him. Father and son set out, hunted by Jude Law's fascinating hit man who indulges in a business hobby by bartering photographs of the people he has murdered to the press. Tom Hanks and Daniel Craig play deeply tortured, sad, personal roles. How intensely the time, place and culture vacuums the soul, from idealism to cold-heartedness to greed to vengeance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MORE and more the influence of the printed pages of the Comic Book and its more well regarded cousin, the Newspaper Comic Strip is felt each and every year. It certainly isn't a new idea to adapt the stories of characters from these sources on the written page; for just about as soon as there were motion pictures, we were inundated with adaptations of such titles as BUSTER BROWN, TOONERVILLE TROLLEY and KRAZY KAT. These screen adaptations came in both live and animated cartoon form.MOVING on to our contemporary times, the lowly, comic book has given rise to a whole sub-genre (or sub-species if you please). Formerly castigated as being worthless and the progenitor of all juvenile delinquency, a resurgence in the interest of the old comics, comic art in general and realization that the colorful magazines really encouraged reading. As the years moved along, it was found that more and more of comic readers continued the habit through adolescence and into adulthood.THIS called for some more complex story lines and having fully three dimensional characterizations for a more mature readership; which culminated in the creation of what has been rightfully named 'the Graphic Novel'.ROAD TO PERDITION was one of the more successful of the publications in its class and hence was slated early on for adaptation to the screen.CHOOSING such a story made for a natural and most fitting of a movie; for anything that does a credible attempt at recreating either the Prohibition Era or the subsequent Gangster Era of the Depression Shackled 1930's usually sells well to the public at large. There would be no need to have any familiarity at all with any comic books or graphic novels in order to enjoy the film.THE story is set in the Area of Greater Chicago, circa 1931. In this way, it is both familiar as the Windy City was (still is) notorious for having a great deal of Gangland Influence in both the Underworld's Rackets, as well as in legitimate business, life and politics. The story reflects what was existing then; as there is a scene where Contract Killer, Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) has a conference with the top echelon of the syndicate and meets with Frank Nitti (Stanley Tucci). The author did well in choosing the meeting with Frank Nitti, instead of "Big Al", Mr. Capone, as it was less of a distraction for the audience for his Michael Sullivan, and yet Nitti's name is still familiar and authentic.LOCATION shooting here in the glorious Midwest, with its long winters, overcast autumns, beautiful springs and long, hot summers was executed in a most advantageous manner. Use of the City of Chicago, sans any more modern buildings via the judicious application of computerization, was executed in what surely was a flawless manner, nearing perfection.CHOICE of the Suburban locations, as well as those outside of the Greater Chicagoland Metropolitan Area* as well as those in the State of Michigan made for a truly beautiful succession of beautiful, colorful and perennially joyous, hopeful landscape.ALTHOUGH there is that passing reference to the Capone Gang, the Mob and the Syndicate (called "the Outfit" from earliest times), the main emphasis of the story concentrates on Gangsters of Irish Descent; emphasizing that not all of the Hoodlums in Organized Crime were of Italian bloodlines. THE story seems to act as a reminder that there are these bad guys throughout the entire spectrum of ethnicity that is America. We could have and had Mobsters of German, Jewish, Black, Russian, Greek ancestry; as well as those of Irish and Italian persuasion.WHAT appears to be a very poignant aspect of the story's basic premise. And that would be, just what, we hear you ask.WE believe that the whole business was neatly asked and wrapped up, s neatly as can be at the end of the story. The end, coupled with the kid's closing remarks about his father; seem to beg the question about people's being able to compartmentalize their morality. After all, we have heard that a lot of these Big Time syndicate Honchos are good family men, church goers and all for Law and Order; that is in their own Suburban Communities.WELL, that's our analysis and our premise. Just think about it, all of this from a humble, trashy, little glorified Comic Book; sometimes called a 'Joke Book, if you will! ** NOTE: * That may seem like excessive and even redundant use of terminology; but, honest injun! We've heard it said thata way! NOTE: ** We can remember when the term 'Joke Book' was interchangeable with 'Comic Book'! At least it was around these environs in and around Chicago!POODLE SCHNITZ!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Road to perdition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Road to Perdition is a drama, thriller picture. The director wanted to tell a different type of gangster picture. Adapted from the book the director does a great job showing the relationship between the father and son. Although there is violence in this film, their is also a lot of emotions from the father and son. They each have to play a different role in their lives now that the mother and younger brother were brutally murdered by the fathers own people. They come closer together and help each other out because they only have each other. The main point the director was trying to drive was, the father didn't want the son to turn to a life of crime like his father. By the end of film we learn that the son does not follow his fathers foot steps. The acting was fantastic, Tom Hanks playing the lead role of a gangster seems like it wouldn't be all that great, but when you add in the element of a father son relationship, it works out perfect. This is an old picture setting it was set in the early 1930's. The mood of the film felt dark and foggy most of the time. A unique gangster flick that had action, drama, and family. The film had great cinematography, acting and direction. This film will appeal to all audiences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Road to Perdition--9/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Perdition, n. The fact or condition of being completely destroyed or ruined; utter destruction, complete ruin." This word, so kindly given a definition by Oxford English Dictionary, fully embodies and is also the antithesis of the film "Road to Perdition." At first one may say that the entire film is one long road towards destruction- the destruction of a man's family, then of his morality. Or maybe it implies destruction of a hit-man's ex- employers by the ex-employee. Or it could be the destruction of all the hopes and dreams of a man, followed by the destruction of those who destroyed the hopes and dreams. The point is, these forms of perdition are not what the film is meant to be about. Yes, vengeance is part of it, but it's not the point.Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) is a mercenary who is part of a mob, where his Dad's (the late Paul Newman) the boss, and brother (Daniel Craig) his associate. After his wife and one of two sons is killed by his brother, also intending to murder Sullivan and his second son, Michael and Peter (Liam Aiken) go on the run to primarily escape danger, then go on a mission of revenge- both corporal and pecuniary.Throughout the film, Michael kills men practically in front of Peter, robs banks with the help of Peter, and, alongside Peter, is shot at by a sociopathic hit-man (who happens to have an interest in the art of photography and played by Jude Law). The thing about these horrendous acts by Michael in front of his young son, who is merely a child, is that the audience supports each one after the other, smiling at the bank robberies and satiated by the coldblooded murders of his enemies. Through all his faults, Michael is our hero. He steals the money for revenge, not greed (as shown when a hefty sum is left for a pair of Good Samaritans). While he kills for redemption, the man chasing him kills for pleasure. Michael had the same profession his sadistic chaser (Jude Law) has (coincidence?).And Michael truly loves his son- probably the only thing he does love. He doesn't know him well at first (he has no idea what his son does in school), but soon he knows his son more than any other ("You're more like me," he says to Peter). Michael is a man filled to the brim with hate for his family's assassins and love for his son. In the end, it is the hate that is destroyed. It is assassinated. It is removed by (who else?) his only son, who in the end performs an act that, in itself, defines the movie: the question of morality in murder is finally answered.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Road to Perdition" is, without a doubt an absolutely gorgeous film to look at and listen to. Visually, the film looks like a series of still photos come to life, set in the 1930's. Conrad L. Hall, one of the greatest cinematographers in film history (at least in my opinion), has captured the dark atmosphere of the film perfectly, and this is by far his best work. As his last film, the lush images seen on screen are some of the best looking seen in film to date. Paired with Thomas Newmans beautiful, albeit somewhat recycled score, this film is presented almost perfectly.Almost being the key word. The performances in the film are all very strong, Particularly from Paul Newman and Tom Hanks. The problem comes from certain parts of the storyline. The movie is well paced, however parts of it could have been left out. Whatever the flaws are in the story, this is still a great movie. It is Sam Mendes' best to date, and a very formidable end to one of cinemas best Cinematographers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most underrated films ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was left emotionally devastated by this film. The word 'masterpiece' might incite criticism from other reviewers, but I think this film deserves it. Road to Perdition pivots on its truly spectacular cinematography (which, in my opinion, is the best of any film) and its beautiful score by Thomas Newman; although the acting and script are also fantastic. The director Sam Mendes, cinematographer Conrad L. Hall and composer Thomas Newman reunited for this picture after 1999's American Beauty, and the result is a film which works in many respects. You may have heard of Road to Perdition as a gangster film. Yes, the main characters are 1930s Chicago-linked gangsters. But this film is far deeper than any mob film i have seen, and certainly the only gangster film in which i have cried throughout the final 20 minutes. It is about the love of paternal relationships (between Mike Sullivan Snr. &amp; Jnr, between Sullivan Snr and the man who fills the role of his father, John Rooney, and also between Rooney and his son Connor), but also the futility of violence and mob power, and how it can lead to the betrayal by and of those we love most, and the loss of childhood innocence. Although the film avoids dragging on 1hr45mins long, Mendes leaves us with an overwhelming sense of completion. The film has said what it set out to say, and delivered its messages exquisitely. This is also due to elements of Conrad L. Hall's cinematography (e.g. the ring composition of the shots of Michael Sullivan Jnr. on the beach in Perdition facing the sea and the pure sounds of the waves both of which begin and end the film). Mendes and Hall's signature cinematography of the reflection of rainwater is employed to great effect, symbolising the upcoming event of a death, as is the contrast of dark blood against light walls, which in turn contrasts with the general grey hue of the sets and costumes throughout. (The sets and costumes are accurate and effective.) The changing relationship between Sullivan Snr and Jnr is underlined by cinematography (e.g. in the first half, the son's view of his father is shot distantly, whereas there are more close-ups in the second half, and when the two are sitting in the car in the garage, their faces are separated by the frame of the car), and the rain scene is an iconic cinematographic triumph, my favourite elements of which are Hanks entering and leaving like a ghost, emerging from and disappearing into the rain, and the omission of sound effects until Newman speaks, lending greater impetus to heart-rending music of Thomas Newman. The fact that the masterful cinematography and script enhance the acting doesn't detract from the sheer talent of the cast. Hanks gives a top-notch performance, as usual, as Michael Sullivan Snr, a handyman for Irish-American mob boss John Rooney (Paul Newman). Sullivan is betrayed and forced to go on the run with his son Michael Sullivan Jnr after his son witnesses a murder. Hanks skilfully draws in the viewer to empathise with his guilt, grief and determination, and Newman shines as the mob boss faced with a terrible choice. Daniel Craig delivers, making us love to hate him as the spoilt, corrupt son of John Rooney, and Jude Law gives an unforgettable turn as the twisted crime scene photographer - slash - hit-man sent after the Sullivans. Law is extremely unsettling to watch, with his revolting hair, creepily long fingernails and rodent-like countenance. Tyler Hoechlin, as Michael Sullivan Jnr, exhibits remarkable talent. We as viewers can deduce his confusion, despair and love from his face alone, and he steers way clear of being included in my list of infuriating child actors. Al Capone's famous right-hand man Frank Nitti is authoritatively played by Stanley Tucci, whilst Capone himself is left ominously off-screen (his scene was shot, but omitted from the final cut, and can be seen on the DVD deleted scenes). Hanks is not a glamorous hero, he is ruthless and a multiple murderer, but hates the lifestyle from which he cannot escape as his and his family's welfare, as well as his relationship with Paul Newman, depend on it. This makes him all the more appealing as the film's protagonist. Unbeatable with respect to cinematography; a tall order in other respects. Fantastic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a film of extraordinary beauty and dignity. Its first hour is winter- it's perfect film-making, only very austere and hard and humorless. It's pitch-black and uncompromising, and altogether incredible. This is not to imply there is a change in quality in the second hour, only that there's a shift in tone as the father and son take to the road. Indeed the film lightens up (barely) once with them, but more importantly reveals the warmth underlying all that cold strength of the first hour. I had read Ebert's review prior to seeing the film (a mistake, but an inadvertent one) and in it he laments that the plot's progress is inexorable, that we know what will and must occur, that it is the stuff of Greek, not Shakespearian, tragedy, and all worse for being fated. He is entitled to his opinion, but the Sophoclean tragedy has its place and its proponents, as well- and, done well, in whatever form, such a story can be immensely powerful. So, do we know what must occur? As the film goes on, yes, we do. Does it diminish the film? Not a whit. What is of concern in such a tale is the journey, the form, the elegance with which it's done, the archetypal elements employed, and the soul of the thing. To judge using those criteria, the film is a complete success. It could not have been better made. Its tone is a long exhalation on a cold night. It is good work, great art, and affected me very strongly; it spoke to something fundamental in me- as it was meant to do. I hope we have not all become deaf to films like this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is there anything Hanks can't do? When this came out I gave it a bit of a wide berth as I thought that hanks had gone too far. OK so hes one of the best character actors on the planet today, but a mob hit-man? Could his performances in Big, Sleepless in Seattle and similar American slush, then his later work such as the compassionate characters in both the Green Mile and SPR undermine this potentially ruthless gunman's screen persona? Not so. He convinced me yet again, but in his own Tom Hanks way. Times were hard, he had a family to support and so through his Irish connections became involved in Gangland dirty work. I thought his character was totally believable and as with most of his work, he sucks you in and makes you believe him, which is why he's working so hard, pulling so many punters to his films and why he has a price tag to match.So we have a dog eat dog world of gangsters, underhand deals, sleaze and guns. I loved the setting, the emptiness and loneliness of some scenes and the hustle and bustle of mid depression city life in America. We are led quickly into Hanks role as a hit-man/runner for the mob/Irish gangs and treated to some fine work by host of quality actors: Paul Newman, Daniel Craig, Jude Law and the Hank's son in the film who whilst a bit wooden at first, seemed to loosen up towards the end, indicative of a linearly shot piece.The scene when Newman gives the boy a silver dollar after he witnesses a gangland murder (where his father Hanks machine guns a gang of heavies) was the moment I couldn't stop watching. It was a great moment.The film is lavish in terms of attention to period detail. The shot where they enter Chicago, although CGI is still breathtaking. My only concern was Hanks relationship with his son. There seemed to creep in a bit of post 70's American sacharrine rather than the harsh world of the 30's. The scene where Hanks was talking to his kid was however great, you could see this was the first time he had had a proper sit down talk with his son, yet I thought it could've been better. More could have been made about the shitty life Hanks had put his family and himself through. Maybe subtlety was better, but it was a good opportunity to highlight the situation as it would have been. The hug at the end was truly great, you could really feel that it was one of very few hugs he had ever had, particularly from his own boy.Jude law was great as the malnourished, hunched over nutter who made money from being both hit-man and photographer. It was inevitable that he would show up again at the end of the film, such a performance dictated a curtain call for this fantastic character...and a curtain call he got. With Hanks in the final act, he stands at the window in a brilliantly overlong shot. We see the sea lapping the shore, Has Hanks character made it? Broken away from the mob and carved out an anonymous life with his son after the horrors of what had happened in the last 6 weeks? Sadly no, after a string of armed robberies where he steals only the Mobs dirty money from banks known to hold the dodgy cash (to protect himself from instant execution) and whilst staring out of the window, Laws character kills him in a chronic irony and in my opinion a fantastic end to a superb movie. Hanks son in turn kills Law which leads to an understated anti-gun statement, but the end of the film where he returns to a remote farmhouse, where he had stayed earlier in the film, was a lovely touch and rounded it all off into what must be one of my favourite film endings. Tragic but complete.Sam Mendes has done it again. A real piece of film with just about everything all contained within it's priceless completeness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Simply Beautiful Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not being a fan of the gangster genre, if I like a gangster film, you can be guaranteed that there's more going for it than 'coolness' and violence... this film has far more going for it. When trying to explain it to a friend, i came up with the phrase a 'classy Gangster movie'. I have even bought this film on DVD, a sure sign that this is a film worth seeing... The first time I saw this film, I was blown away by the beautiful cinematography. The one stand-out scene being the 'massacre' on the street towards the end of the film - the silhouettes, the rain, the soundtrack - it just creates a near perfect scene overall. This scene aside, the plot and acting are strong... in fact I can name very few negative points about this film.In summary, it's great from all aspects... watch it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nonstop violence.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If a movie is to be judged purely on the basis of violence content, then Road to Perdition should win accolades. In this movie the violence is nonstop, nasty, and graphic. Every character in this movie is violent or is a victim of violence. The main form of violence is shooting, primarily with a submachine gun, but the use of hand guns is also graphically portrayed. The violence is so pervasive that the story itself is rendered superfluous. That the main protagonist is a paid assassin, albeit a gentlemanly one, with a lovely wife and two nice children, makes the movie somewhat more watchable, but honestly, can anyone feel any empathy for a person whose job is "remove" other people? Or is the scene in which a police officer is cruelly gunned down outside of a diner supposed to make this movie more likable? In a world that is ablaze with violence, what is the point of this movie? How does this movie make the world a better place in which to live?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was nice seeing Paul Newman and Tom Hanks perform together in a very interesting film in the 1930's during depression days. During this period of time, Al Capone and the mob were all involved with booze, sex and any kind of illegal way of making money. Tom Hanks is a hit man and has two sons and a sweet loving wife and a nice home. As the story progresses, you understand why Hanks carries a gun and one of his sons finds out the sad truth about his father and grandfather, whom he loves very much. The story points out the fact that some people are misguided by their loyalty's to superiors and the choices they choose in life can actually destroy them and the people they love. Excellent acting and great photography, depicting all the living in years gone by, especially the old cars and furniture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rewarding, Nicely-Made, Old-Fashioned Gangster Revenge Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In prohibition days, twelve-year-old Michael Sullivan discovers one night that his father is a gangster, when he witnesses his participation in an execution. When his mother and brother are gunned down the next day, he and his father flee the city. Where will they go, what revenge will they exact, and can they elude the quick-witted hit-man on their trail ? This is a good old-fashioned gangster melodrama, of the type Warner Brothers churned out by the bucketload in the thirties, although this one is handsomely dressed up with a lavish budget and highly acclaimed cast. It isn't exactly very original (although uniquely the original story came from a comic-book) but it's never less than entertaining and it has an absolute charmer of a string-score by Thomas Newman which rolls it along and packs twice as much emotional wallop into the drama. It also benefits greatly from the against-type casting of Hanks as the stilted, dogmatic protagonist ? if he smiles in this movie at any point, I didn't spot it. The support cast are great, particularly Law in the flashy role of assassin-photographer, and the entire story is wisely told from the child's point of view, giving the movie both objectivity and visual sweep (check out the reflection of the buildings on Hoechlin's face when they drive into Chicago). This was the last film to be shot by the great cameraman Conrad Hall, and if you want an object-lesson in beautiful composition, lighting and sheer visual storytelling (the sequence where Newman dies is particularly breathtaking) you couldn't do much better than this. A familiar and overly sentimental film to be sure, but a memorable and brilliantly stylised one.</fullReview>

There are plenty of tales of vengeance and retribution, but not many have the ability to depict it well. The writers of this movie did it well, as did the director. This wasn't a story of invincibility or super heroism, just a man who was wronged trying to even the score. Tom Hanks played a colder role than I thought he could ever play. The movie was intense, it was gripping and well put together.From one scene to the next the director did an excellent job of not dragging down the intensity or making you lose interest with useless dialogue.

		<shortDescription>The best gangster film made since The Godfather!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Road To perdition is an unusual story of passion, revenge, and self-discovery. Road to Perdition is a sad but a remarkable film. I was however disappointed that the family had to die, but it was predictable, and it was even sadder that the kid witnessed his father commit a double-homicide which led to his family's destruction. The story was strong, the cinematography was perfect during a depressing time for the U.S., the cast and crew were well chosen, especially Paul Newman and Tom Hanks, and the music blended into the film. I think the best scene in that movie would be the rain sequence. After all of the guards are dead in the street, and Paul Newman looks at Tom Hanks and says without hesitation, "I'm glad its you." However, the ending was kind of comic book like or as the novel of the film was called a graphic novel. I give that movie a 10 out 10, placing it right by the original Godfather as the best gangster film. Even better than Casino.</fullReview>

Hanks's character was a immoral man who had no feelings for anybody he ever gunned down. However, when it was HIS family on the receiving end of violence he became terribly concerned. These scumbags always think it is DIFFERENT when they are on the wrong end of the gun. Gotta give the guy credit, though, for sticking to his guns and staying behind his son no matter what. The actor who played the heartless photographer almost stole the show: what a complete waste as a human. Nothing stopped this man from completing his assignment; really loved his profession. Even though thugs have hearts they still reap what they sow. Good picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shows potential from Mendes...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The director from American Beauty (Sam Mendes) shows he has definite talent. In Road to Perdition, just as with American Beauty, there are very strong images that stick in your head and there are very prevalent emotions that you can't always relate to, but can understand.The movie had some amazing scenes, ones that I will remember for a long time. And a super-great cast. Really the only area of disappointment was the script, just too many formulaic elements were used (the ending and some generic mafia themes), and too many were underused (the effects of violence and loyalty are a few themes that could have stood out more).Tom Hanks is amazing as always. I was talking to a friend the other day and we both agreed that there is not one Tom Hanks movie that we absolutely do not like. He's had some fairly stupid ones, but not ever one that doesn't have some watchable merit. I think the same goes for Mel Gibson and Tom Cruise.Two things with the cast though, the actors playing the sullivan sons weren't great, and the Paul Newman character is grossly underused. Jude Law remains one of hollywoods most underrated actors and I really was intrigued by and wanted to see more of Daniel Craig's character, John Rooney's son.Overall it just seemed a little too distant and impersonal, which is pretty much the only thing I can see that was holding it back from standing with the greats of mafia movies like the Godfather and Goodfellas.Well worth seeing, but I wouldn't hold my breath for any oscars. I give it *** out of four stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>`Road to Perdition' was not a great movie. It was, at best, OK. Much talent was wasted. Paul Newman was hardly used. Jennifer Jason Leigh was completely wasted. Any TV actress could have played her role. Tom Hanks was good as usual as was Stanley Tucci but the roles demanded so little from the performer. Jude Law was OK. None of the characters were developed well. I didn't feel I knew any of them except in a stereotypical sense. Lots of money was put into this movie. It looked nice. I think it was set in the time period because of the clothes. Men got to walk around in long overcoats and hats made of very nice fabric. Nonetheless the movie was poorly written and unimaginatively directed. Many scenes were clunky and not in the least believable. The movie was set in 1931 but the dialogue was from another era, especially the cursing. An adult wouldn't have used the F word in front of a small boy nor would a small boy consider using it later. (SPOILER possible ahead.) Was I supposed to be touched by the sweet story of a boy and his brutal killer father? Was I supposed to believe that this thug lived in a large beautiful home, in the midst of the depression, with his loving wife and lovely kids. It rang very false. The whole story rang false. Characters were caricatures. And the `made for TV' ending. How conventional was that? The shot ringing out and the body falls but the bad guy wasn't killed how you thought but by the off screen character. How many times have you seen this ending? It was disappointing. The movie was nicely photographed though. It had a nice look but was empty.</fullReview>

Conrad Hall does his classic rain cinematography, the music is pretty good--that is understated for the most part--and there is one interesting performance. Not by Hanks or Newman (who are both quite boring) but by Jude Law as a psycho hitman. The theme of "sins of the father" is so hackneyed as to be laughable, and the ending, like that of "American Beauty" is supposed to be revelatory but is just contrived.

		<fullReview>Not a bad movie at all, but it certainly doesn't stray from the well-established Hollywood formula of the good-at-heart hitman out for revenge. The ending is very predictable and removes a large part of the suspense for that very reason. The cinematography was excellent, as well as the microscopic attention to detail. I kept looking for anything that would be out of place in 1931 but came up empty. All in all it was an enjoyable film, but it certainly doesn't deserve to stand out above any other movie of it's type. It is almost the identical storyline as Clint Eastwood's "The Outlaw Josey Wales", which was a much more enjoyable film. Clint's classic one-liners and the fantasy element of a lone gunman outdrawing an army of bad guys were more entertaining than the dramatic lessons "Road to Perdition" attempted to instill. At least Clint knew he wasn't trying to win an Oscar.Still, you won't shoot yourself for renting it. It is a well-made gangster drama, and an above-average film.

		<shortDescription>Pretentious and incompetent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS This silly movie repeatedly violated the most basic rules of credibility. Case in point - near the end Tom Hanks kills about 7 of Paul Newman's body guards with a submachine from so far away that the guards can't even see him. Rather than hitting the dirt though, they stand passively like bowling pins waiting for him to mow them down. Meanwhile Newman stands no more then 2 feet away from his guards, but isn't even scratched. Just how likely is such marksmanship with a 30s era submachine gun? But this is only one of virtually innumerable lapses of credibility in this film. Most irritating is the unbelievably self-indulgent way that the director emphasizes the supposed profundity of his work with agonizingly and utterly meaningless slow motion shots that like the inane gyrations of that stupid plastic bag in American Beauty are meant to remind viewers just how "heavy" this movie is supposed to be. Anyone who still believes they watched a good - or even competent - organized crime movie after viewing "Perdition" should go and rent "Goodfellas" or "Casino" and see what a real gangster film is like. P.S. If the supreme test of an actor's ability is when he plays against type, then compare Tom Hanks's flat, Pillsbury Doughboyish portrayal of a hit man here with DeNiro's flawless comic acting in "Meet the Parents". More evidence that RDN is the greatest actor of our generation, while Tom Hanks should stick with what he knows. Which isn't this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sloppy film filled with boring cliches</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Perdition" is an insult to intelligent movie-goers. The hostile family silence formula that worked so well in "American Beauty" failed dramatically here. A modern dysfunctional suburban family is very different from a depression-era family of mobsters. The director's arrogance was obvious in his ignoring flaws in several sets. When Michael Sr. walked into the bathroom to snuff the killer of his wife and son, for example, the camera panned to the mirror showing the victim in the tub. The blood splattering and skull parts on the wall, however, were close to the ceiling rather than just above the tub. (They probably did several takes on the scene, settling for his being hit while bathing rather than standing up, but decided the audience would not notice the discrepancy.) Another oversight was a camera shot while Michael Sr. and his son, Michael Jr., were driving. It was evening, yet the view through the back window was a daytime scene with bright greens. But even more insulting, the backdrop was WITHIN the car, failing to show car motion. There were several more flaws, but I stopped counting. The movie was one cliche after another: the red-hot knife to remove the bullet from Michael Sr.'s arm; the "I'm going to take over the family business one day so don't ever talk to me like that" "Godfather" cliche; the son not being able to pull the trigger (still further insulting in that Michael Jr. verbally stated this obvious fact in his totally predictable dialogue at the end of the film). The absurdity of the whole bank robbery sequence as an effort to show a growing bond between a hit-man father and a love-deprived son. This was probably intended to provide some kind of a story line for hopeless romantics. And the writer's and director's effort to make a violent criminal into a really good dad who had no choice but to kill for a living is really pathetic. One such example is Michael Sr. giving all his hard-earned bank robbery money to that "deus ex machina" farmland couple who had no children was nauseously magnanimous!(We knew where Michael Jr. would eventually end up living.) The final cheap attempt to get the audience feeling all warm and fuzzy was Michael Jr.'s closing narrative: Paraphrasing, `When asked what kind of man my father was I would say, ?He was my father.'" Where are the "gag me with a spoon" valley girls now that we need them. I gave this cliched, pretentious, sloppy, soppy, boring film a rating of two on a scale of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Carsick on the "Road to Perdition"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`Perdition' is one of those films where you imagine the studio execs must've wrested all power from the director early on and put the scenes together themselves - only committee thinking could produce such a muddled, shapeless movie; eager to appeal to the widest spectrum of audience taste and thereby, appealling to none.Thus, it's a windy road indeed: we start out cruising along wistful boyhood memories, pranks with gangsters, then quickly careen into countless people being shot point-blank in the head, followed by fast lane life on the run, then the light-hearted learning to drive stick shift (gives the word cliche a bad name), turn the corner to Bonnie and Clyde, then pull over for warm and fuzzy connections with dad, and race to the finish line with wall-to-wall killing.One thing is clear, Sam Mendes has clearly been impressed by the remarkable Coen brothers, as much of the `Perdition', to put it kindly, pays homage to their work, especially Miller's Crossing. However, Mendes manages only to be suggestive without possessing any of the Coen's wit and originality. And as wonderful as `American Beauty' was, wouldn't one self-quote be ample? Instead we get constant reminders of `and I did this in American Beauty and this...' as if he's afraid this movie will make us forget his good work...hmmm.Virtually every actor is as miscast as you could hope for. Only tremendous hubris could convince the usually fine Tom Hanks into playing a part he was born to avoid. Paul Newman proves beyond a doubt that there is a time for even the most famous of actors to retire - if only he could remember when it should have been. Jude Law, despite a mercurial dialect, gives the only fascinating performance and leaves one wanting more.Sam Mendes claimed he wanted to make this movie because of its father, son themes, but dress it up however you like, it's clear the real focus of the movie is the insanity of revenge. One of the last things we hear from our young hero comes just after the bloodbath finale: `. . . and I never picked up a gun again.' Right, show us two and quarter hours of grinding gore and then bring an anti-violence moral home. What specious nonsense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predictable &amp; Unoriginal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS AHEAD*** I see what Sam Mendes was trying to push for with this movie, but for Road to Perdition, it just did not work very well. First, the script and thus the film was terribly predictable. Beyond the first and only plot twist that sets the stage for the rest of film, the remainder of the movie was just one hunt and shoot sequence after another, which could work well in other films. However, in Road, each killing and death up to the end is so predictable that one ends up just waiting and waiting for each victim to be killed. And to rid the movie further of any suspense, the film music played over each of these sequence was more of a happy, peaceful tune rather than suspenseful. Now, one could argue that all of this was the intent of Mendes who probably wanted to create an atmosphere in the 19th century to make you feel that such shootings were common and that those killed expected to be killed. Yet, for the filmgoer, the combination of predictability and lack of suspenseful cannot be a good mix. This is not and should not be your surburbia American Beauty, Mendes, no matter how much you tried to make it be. I did enjoy much of the artistic qualities put into the film except for a few overdone parts, such as the boy alone narrating the opening and the end as so many of these, "This is my father" films do. Overall, Road to Perdition was worthwhile entertainment but unoriginal. My Rating: 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A second-rate vengeance movie with a body-count in the twenties, in America this is considered entertainment. The story is lame and the "potential Oscar" hot-shot direction didn't do it (where does the light come from in the field sequence?). Tom Hanks and Paul Newman should have passed on this stinker.

		<fullReview>After reading all the hype on this movie I thought it was easily going to blow me away, be best movie of the year. I love Paul Newman and I love Tom Hanks and most of their movies but, this one was really not very good. The acting was good, the story could have been good but it just didn't have any feeling to it. It was more like watching a report about something that happened but you never get emotionally involved with these characters. I never developed any connection to them that I cared about what happened very much. The movie started really slowly and was kind of boring for about the first 1/2 hour. During this time it looked like Mendes was trying to develop these characters and their relationship but he never pulls this off successfully. Although, you are supposed to get that their relationship is so close its father/son, hence the painful events later, Mendes wasn't able to draw this successfully. A quick piano duet and a game of dice with Sullivans kids, and a comment of loyalty is supposed to show me how tight their bond is? This is the underlying relationship that is the basis for the entire movie and thats it??? It just didn't work and it's unfortunate that such great actors went to waste from Mendes' short-sightedness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful, but embalmed film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sure,ROAD TO PERDITION looks and feels like a class movie. In fact, it's a coffee-table-book movie. Beautiful to look at but flat. But it is not a grabber, with a screenplay and direction which keeps the audience at a decided distance from characters supposed to be torn and tragic but who come across as uninvolving and uninteresting. The movie is an exercise in style, and in that it succeeds completely. As for being involved on any emotional level, it misses the mark completely. Comparisons with THE GODFATHER I and II are a mighty, ridiculous reach. That movie had people you became intimately involved with, told with warmth, sweep, extravagance and style. If only ROAD TO PERDITION had at least a fraction of the energy and pizazz which the 1930's Warner Brothers crime dramas had in spades and which Francis Ford Coppola breathed into every emotional frame of his movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Road to Perdition" was a beautifully shot, wonderfully lit piece of garbage. The story was completely predictable, full of father-son relationship cliche's. There was absolutely nothing compelling about the characters. Tom Hanks, as the cold-blooded killer with a heart of gold, is so distant that we never feel the slightest bit of empathy for him or his endangered son. Paul Newman, in the role of Tom Hanks' mentor, just comes off as an old fool with an excess of misplaced loyalty. Jude Law. Jude Law was wasted. A role with more meat on its bones would have been more worth his time and ours. For a truly magnificent gangster film, watch "Miller's Crossing" instead. The director of that film makes you care for the anti-hero without resorting to hackneyed tricks, like showing what a great dad he is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Road to Perdition (2002)Gorgeously films, dark and rainy and brooding, serious and bloody, this is a great film in many ways. It's easy to watch and get sucked into the aura of it all.It's a kind of Irish "The Godfather" and if the tone has changed from sunny weddings to rainy wakes, it has all the elements of the mobster family in time of crisis. Playing Brando is Paul Newman, with a shade of a brogue. And the wayward son (Daniel Craig) is at odds with the "adopted" son (Tom Hanks), as murders beget murders and one side of the family wipes out the other side. As usual, blood is thicker than water, so Hanks is soon on the run, taking his young son with him. The story is told, with some voice-over, from the point of view of this boy.As much as it's engrossing, it's also slow. The stereotypes are too plainly played out as stereotypes, with an Irish angle. Eventually a real Italian mobster is instrumental in a few more killings, an Al Capone type played by Stanley Tucci. It all works, it's all fine, but it isn't "The Godfather" in the epic or dramatic ways it really seems to intend.Hanks is terrific, however. He plays his part as a hired killer with unwavering coolness, but with a feeling he is trapped by his life. He does what he has to but with no pleasure, no bloodthirst. In a way, with the filming (sets, light, camera) and Hanks, the movie is a kind of must see. Then there is the somewhat over the top sensationalism of a late entry into the plot, a crime photographer played by Jude Law, who can play creepy rather well for such a pretty boy. His role is completely out of place in a way, and if the movie had encouraged this kind of invention all along it might have been an original worth its salt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a fascinating film, enjoyable on so many levels but most of all for telling a riveting story that holds the interest all the way through to the unexpected final five minutes. Tom Hanks gives what is arguably his finest performance to date and makes the father-son relationship, at the core of the story, a deeply felt experience. He and young Tyler Hoechlin are never less than superb.All of the performances are on the highest level--including Paul Newman as a crime boss, Daniel Craig as his satanic son and especially Jude Law, chilling as a man who photographs the dead he kills. This is all told in such a masterful way, rich in period detail and atmosphere that it is mesmerizing from beginning to end. Personally, I enjoyed this much more than any of the Godfather films which are so overwhelmingly popular--due in no small measure to the outstanding direction of Sam Mendes and the performances he drew from an excellent cast. Undoubtedly one of the most impressive crime dramas ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A touching coming-of-age film that will stand the test of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the opening sequence of Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes, 12-year old Michael Sullivan, Jr. (Tyler Hoechlin) talks about his father (Tom Hanks) who is a hit man for the mob. The older Sullivan works for aging crime boss John Rooney (Paul Newman), a formidable figure in mob circles who rules Chicago "like God rules the Earth". The film is about organized crime during the heyday of Al Capone but is also a touching coming-of-age story about an emotionally distant father and the son he must connect with in order to survive. Rooney, in a great performance by Paul Newman, helped raise Sullivan when he was orphaned and acts like a grandfather to his children. He is torn, however, between taking care of his business interests, protecting his own son Connor (Daniel Craig), and maintaining his close relationship with Sullivan. When these come into conflict, the results are lethal.Young Michael yearns for a relationship with his dad who is aloof and determined not to have his son follow in his footsteps. Michael is curious about his father's job and one night sees his father participate in a gangland murder. When one murder leads to another, Sullivan is forced to use the youngster to help him exact revenge. Father and son set out on a cross-country odyssey robbing the banks where Capone's illegal money is deposited. To survive on the run, they must contend not only with Rooney, but his trigger-happy son Connor and Maguire (Jude Law), a creepy hired assassin who enjoys taking pictures of dead people. Michael is willing to help because he needs his father's approval and, in the 31-day adventure that follows, the two form an unbreakable bond.Road to Perdition is restrained but never cold and both Hanks and Newman bring so much humanity to their roles that their characters have a rare depth. Backed by a lovely score by Thomas Newman, the photography of the late cinematographer Conrad Hall captures the mood of somber intensity in its depiction of the rain-soaked Chicago streets and the loneliness of the mid-western landscape. Road to Perdition is not the Godfather Four but a unique character study that will stand the test of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tom Hanks shoots all good actors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Personally I don't like Tom Hanks, but I don't say that he would be a weak actor. Hanks is very suitable as war hero and that kind of roles, but not as gangster. I accept that the Sullivan is straight-backed war hero but Hanks is too slack, he is still same old Hanks more than Sullivan, he is patriot.I read the comics and the plot was quite good, but unfortunately the film is full of fatherland morale, and some reason the religious themes has been forgotten. So modern Hollywood and America-style.Cinematography is modern, you can feel it when you watch the movie, you feel it is presented in our time, not in the 30s. No style at all, not even with the music. Music is quite nice, but not raise any feelings.Now to the biggest problem. Actors. This film have many good actors. Problem is that Tom Hanks walks through the movie and shoots all of them. The most Gruesomest part is when Maguire is shoots Hanks with shotgun for distance of two meters. Of course Hanks wounds him and escapes, but that's not all, wounded Maguire shoot Hanks to the shoulder with pistol. I love realism.It was pure pain until the end, full of nonsense and irrationality, with useless scenes, farmer's doesn't need money, they need a horse. End, Tom Hanks dies in the end! Finally, that is what we have been waiting all the movie long. But no, the movie cannot end when Hank is shoot (incredible), the Michael junior makes another unnecessary what removes all the dramatic. Surprising Hanks shoots the best actor in the film at the end and make a happy ending. Michael junior has nothing to do in the film, it was all the Hanks show.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fathers and Sons.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The unbreakable bond between fathers and sons is the real focus of "Road to Perdition", one of the finest films of recent memory. It is the early-1930s and crime boss Paul Newman (Oscar-nominated) rules the community with a quiet dominance. His son (Daniel Craig) and his top assassin (Tom Hanks) are the most-trusted in Newman's small circle. Hanks' is basically a second son to Newman and they have an unmistakable love and admiration for one another. Within Hanks' real family is wife Jennifer Jason Leigh and sons Tyler Hoechlin and Liam Aiken. Leigh knows of her husband's "business" but the two youngsters really have no clue. One day Hoechlin decides to hitch a ride with his dad (with Hanks not knowing) and the youth learns of his father's true colors. This is when "Road to Perdition" begins its long and imperative story. Hanks and Hoechlin know that they are in trouble now and must flee to save their lives. Along the way they become hunted by the sadistic Jude Law (a crime photographer/mafia assassin) and must make amends with Chicago syndicate Stanley Tucci in order to avoid Newman and his evil son. "Road to Perdition" comes from a graphic novel and it is very apparent here as the production values are as high as they can possibly be. The late Conrad L. Hall won a posthumous Oscar for his amazing cinematography and that was well-deserved. The score by Thomas Newman is one of the best of recent memory and director Sam Mendes (who nearly reached greatness with "American Beauty") does an outstanding job keeping the entire project together. "Road to Perdition" is a great film for everyone, but the production caters even more to loving fathers and sons who have a spiritual bond that cannot be ignored or denied. 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of my favorite movies, with a very nostalgic ending. The movie is about the Sullivan family, obviously Michael Sullivan (the father) is one of the main members of the mafia, the killer to say it this way, and an expert one. One of the kids wants to know the work of his father (a terrible mistake), so he hides on his father's car and well, he sees Tom Hanks in action to say it this way.Mafia doesn't rules, in Mafia nobody wins, when they want you out, they take you out. Of course you can see anyone who works at the mafia with a giant house, the best car in the world, whatever you like, but make a wrong work, or make something your "boss" doesn't want, and you're fired, and killed.You can see what I mean in the movie, Sullivan Jr. sees something he didn't had to see, and well, almost all his family gets killed for that "wrong thing" his son did. The movie is really entertaining, you see how the Sullivan's live after being chased by the mafia, or kinda of that.This movie is kinda of sad, shows us about revenge, those dirty works people do, almost everything you like. Hopefully the guy is reading this comment doesn't works for the mafia, and if you work at the mafia make yourself a favor and get the hell out of the country before you get killed by your boss and their workers.This movie receives: 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Road to Perdition is not as boring and flaw-filled of a film as some say, and not as great as others boast...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, so there were some very questionable subjects in this film - so what? I did enjoy it, and I ignore reviewers who say it is "boring, bleak, overrated and stupid". However, I do think it is a bit overrated. Seeing that a film critic named it "the best gangster film since the Godfather" is a bit disappointing, because I've seen much better gangster films since the Godfather, including the Godfather part II (or does that reviewer find part II not a sequel, but a chapter of a story like I myself do).  Overall, of course Road To Perdition had flaws, but it had some very good acting talent, which definitely crosses off bleak from its list of wrongs. I'm not sure if my first pick would be Tom Hanks for this film, but he worked, just like his character in Saving Private Ryan did as well. Perhaps Mr. Hanks is just trying to prove he is a versatile actor. Paul Newman didn't have a big part in this film, but he was in it more than I had heard from some haters of the film. The scenes Mr. Newman is in are interesting, though not his best performance at all. Stanley Tucci had a small part, and it's always nice to see his face. He is a good supporting actor, and I'm glad he got the part. Sam Mandes direction was not as good as I had heard, and was not the best aspect of the film, though it was very beautiful, and yet at other times dark and unrevealing. I like when directors change the mood of the surroundings to fit the characters mood. It brings out what they are feeling in more ways than one. At the Oscars this year, Road To Perdition might be getting some nominations, and to tell you the truth, I could care less. I hate the Academy Awards because the wrong people always win the Oscars. So therefore, if this film wins the award for "Best Picture", I won't bawl, nor will I throw a party. I advise everyone to just sit back and relax, because I am betting it will at least get a nomination. Road To Perdition entertained me, despite its flaws and odd casting choices(though the actors turned out to be good for the parts they played). I recommend it to you, but I just will add a few more words with my recommendation: don't expect The Godfather. 4/5 stars-John "Don Corleone"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>gorgeous, but what's the point?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Road to Perdition is a charmless tragedy about a hit-man (Tom Hanks) and his son (Tyler Hoechlin). Jude Law shines as the ruthless, deliciously creepy villain. Why we're supposed to hate him is unclear, since he's just another hit-man like Hanks, albeit slightly lacking in "Teddy Bear" qualities. Stripped of his looks, Law gambols about on rickety joints, concealing his pasted-on bald spot under a dusty fedora. He's the best thing about the film, barring the gorgeous cinematography and the haunting score. The plot is insultingly simple, intercut with montages of people getting shot while Hanks tries to look BAD 2 The BONE and his son tries, in vain, to act convincingly. In true Shakespearean form, only one of the main characters is alive at the end. I, for one, still found it impossible to care.Perdition is a bad movie, well made. The plot of a graphic novel simply doesn't lend itself to cinema, at least in this case, although I can think of few where one did. Perhaps it would have worked better if Hanks hadn't been so wooden, and his "son" hadn't been so expressionless. Ultimately, though, the thunderingly over-the-top style of "comic book turned film" just isn't suited to such a dark storyline.</fullReview>

The performances are also notable with Tom Hanks successfully suppressing his gee-whiz, good guy persona to inhabit the skin of a killer, and Paul Newman in fine form as the patriarch of a crime family. But except for the fancy packaging, the result is rather hollow. This is just another gangster movie, one that could have been made by the B unit of Warner Bros. in the 1930s with Bogart as Michael Sullivan and Billy Halop (the Dead End Kid) as his son. This is definitely a movie worth seeing, but the praise it inspired in some quarters seems to have been based more on expectations than the actual result.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Idea That Should Have Been Presented Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really excited to see this movie. I loved the idea of a son finding out that his father was a hit-man, and I was really looking forward to how it would play out. Maybe I got myself a little too excited, because in the end it was far from great. The plot is, like I said, great at a glance. A boy finds out that his father is a hit-man. Pretty cool if you ask me. Lot's of potential. I think it could have worked better just as a drama. Instead it's a revenge story, and the son is just along for the ride. That's it. There's nothing special about it. Now while it was still good and well-done for the most part, the best aspect of the movie is barely explored, and the son just feels like an existence. If he were an adult the movie would be the exact same. The characters are good for the most part. You can tell how stable the character's relationships are almost right from the beginning, and their characters are developed relatively well. It's mostly Tom Hanks's character who gets developed, though. Everyone else is fine, you know what kind of people they are, but Hanks has a more clear personality by the end. The acting was done quite well too, and I'm happy that every time I saw Daniel Craig's character I didn't just see James Bond. One thing I was particularly annoyed with was the irrelevance of the title. While it does end up making sense in the end for the majority of the movie it doesn't. The movie never makes it clear whether they're ever still going to Perdition. One moment they are, then they aren't, then they are. It can't decide, and it never tells you when they change their minds. Now generally misleading titles are good, but with this one it just doesn't work that well. Overall Road to Perdition is just good. It's a huge disappointment loaded with unexplored potential, but looking past all that it's still a solid movie. I'll have to see it again with my new, less- hyped mindset, but it won't be any time soon. In the end I'd still recommend this movie, just don't expect anything particularly unique because, it's anything but.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish and visually excellent, but sadly unwilling to depart from its comic origins.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My interest in 'Road to Perdition' was piqued when I saw that it featured Paul Newman, one of my favourite actors, and Tom Hanks, one of my favourite living actors. I was intrigued as to how Newman, whose career was defined by roguish but unmistakably likable characters, would drop all of his charm and step into the boots of an unashamedly villainous figure. I was also interested in seeing how Tom Hanks, known for his "everyman appeal", would steer his acting in an opposite direction to his performances in 'Forrest Gump', 'Cast Away', 'Big' etc. I am glad to say that neither of these actors' performances disappointed me, and some of the other cast members (incl. Jude Law and a pre-007 Daniel Craig) similarly satisfied. Sam Mendes' crime thriller begins in a rather moody, atmospheric manner, and the "getting to know the characters at a social gathering" reminded me greatly of 'The Godfather'. If the film had maintained this throughout, I may have been inclined to award it an 8 or 9/10. It disappointed me to see how 'Road to Perdition' was steered in a comic-book manner. Of course, directors work with what they get: Francis Ford Coppola's masterful handling of 'The Godfather' was due in no small part to Mario Puzo's classic novel; therefore, I wasn't exactly surprised to see that John Rooney (Newman) and Michael Sullivan (Hanks) weren't given the staggering portraits awarded to Vito and Michael Corleone. Nevertheless, I was hoping for more. 'Road to Perdition' is posited somewhere between Quentin Tarantino and Scorsese/Coppola, and I really hoped that Mendes would push it towards the latter. Unfortunately he didn't. As a result, I found it very hard to sympathise for any of the characters, and they never truly become known to the viewer. This tragic lack of emotion means that we follow the story, but don't invest in it. Despite the misguided direction of the film, it is certainly not an unenjoyable title. One element which is regularly praised in 'Road to Perdition' is its cinematography, and I can understand why. I haven't encountered such skillful camera-work since I saw 'Bullitt', and the use of reflective shots is just one element that defines Conrad L. Hall's perfect cinematography. The title is also very stylish, and the set designs are something to behold. Therefore, I'd summarise by saying that Sam Mendes' film is a very polished and technically superb title, but sadly swings towards 'Kill Bill' and similar titles, when its ideal place is amidst 'Goodfellas' and 'The Godfather'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Road to Perdition (2002): Dir: Sam Mendes / Cast: Tom Hanks, Paul Newman, Jude Law, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Daniel Craig: A long road of pain and sorrow traveled by a father and son. Tom Hanks plays an Irish gangster who is married and has two sons. He works for a mob player played by Paul Newman who is disappointed with his own son. Hanks's oldest son witnesses a shooting by Newman's son. When discovered, Hanks is overwhelmed with guilt. He arrives home to discover his wife and youngest son murdered, with his oldest hidden. Hanks seeks revenge but his boss refuses to turn over his son. Well written with loop holes in conclusion. Stylish directing by Sam Mendes who uses the same glorious style he employed in American Beauty. Hanks is flawless as a man who is good at what he hates but will force justice for the sake of his deceased even at the stake of fatalities. Newman is excellent with grief and regret yet understanding when faced with consequences. Jude Law steals scenes as a sniper who is crafty but overlooks smaller factors, which will cost him. Jennifer Jason Leigh is a fine presence but is underused as Hanks's wife. Daniel Craig plays the jealous son of the Newman character who erupts thus unleashing vengeance. Lacks background information but it contains themes of grief and the hopes that our children will not follow that road to perdition. Score: 8 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had heard a lot of good things about this film so was seriously disappointed. The plot was very clichéd and predictable all the way through. The final shootout scene was the most obviously predictable but many of the events leading up to it were also obvious. While too many of the characters actions made no sense whatsoever, particularly the actions and motivations of Paul Newmans character, John Rooney. The acting was poor particularly from Daniel Craig whose accent varied from New York to posh English often within the same line. Even Tom Hanks underperformed in the lead role. The variations in tone between serious and comedic were jarring and didn't fit with the film at all. And the film is plagued by the concept that to depict a dark tone or story just add torrential rain. Admittedly this concept is a problem in many films but this takes it to a new level.The only positives in this film are some fine cinematography and the attention to detail in capturing the 1931 setting.</fullReview>

Tom Hanks, the noble-minded Chicago Irish gangster enforcer, escapes Paul Newman's Irish mob with his young, (chubby, Italian-looking) son, heading for his Irish sister's remote beach house. Unfortunately, when they get there, the (possibly Irish) photograph-fetishist assassin (Jude Law) hired by Paul Newman has got there first and shoots him just as he is admiring the sea view. Tom manages to kill the assassin back, though, in order to save his son from a life of (Irish) crime, probably.There. I've saved you having to endure this pile of ordure. Any episode of 'Boardwalk Empire' has more depth, authenticity and downright entertainment value than RTP, and that's not saying much because Boardwalk Empire was pretty tedious.Any resemblance to 'Shawshank Redemption' is solely down to Thomas Newman's score.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent movie, one major irritating flaw</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sorry, but I just hate it when the director intentionally includes something ridiculous to cause aggravation in the viewer. This seems to be something that has been accepted as a reasonable tool to engage the viewer, however I see it as cheap, as when a comic over uses foul language since that seems to entertain the weak minded. Tom Hanks plays the professional very well. He is portrayed as not just good at his job, but also very intelligent. Explain why after knowing he disabled, at least temporarily, the man he knows has been assigned to kill him and his son, and also having met him knows he is a bit insane and fanatic about it, he runs out of the room. He knew he was temporarily helpless, and had no reason to run at that point. Being a professional, he would have ended him. Yet suddenly, he becomes terrified during a situation he would have coolly handled. If the director wanted this killer to be used in the final scene, he had only to introduce police rushing into the area, one of many other events, to create the outcome he desired. The only explanation is as I said in the opening, purposely create the situation where the viewer is pushed to extreme irritation by the ignorance of the action that he did not finish him at that point. And as I already said, I see this as a very cheap and easy method to evoke emotion from the viewer, rather than actually build a situation that is realistic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch it for camera work and cinematography and dialogues that bring the characters alive.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A gangster movie that has all the perfect ingredients, acting is top class with Tom Hanks, Paul Newman, Daniel Craig all in their respective roles but one boy Tyler Hoechlin is the eye catcher for me. The characters are empathetic and well carved out, the dialogues so well written by David Self add color to the characters. Like when Michael Jr. asks his father Michael Sr. "Did you love Peter more than me?" or the confrontation of a father-son like relationship of Paul Newman and Tom Hanks, it is all well spoken. But still we can predict the outcome of each that is taken time to deliver with pauses in between may be to add solemnity. So there comes a question, is this what it ought be, cant there be any other way. Well if there was, then it would not been for this movie.It's a gangster movie in which only mob and its runners are involved and no civilians please. This movie spared them. Now, the direction is again top class with Sam Mendes at the helm and this being his second one (first was American Beauty), he did a great job. It's all neat and clean except for a couple of obvious glitches like a shootout where Tom gets a machine gun while mob has rifles and Paul seems to feel happy, that it is Tom who is killing knowing that he may be killed by him too.The difference is this movie compared to others is the son-father relationship. While one wants his son to be a part and take over his business, the other does want him to take the same road. And poignantly, tbis point is emphasized at the last few lines, when Michael Jr. tells that when someone asks how was Michael Sr. Good or Bad, he replies "He was my father"Now, if there is one thing that has to be said sound and loud then its the cinematography, its not unbelievable but so very mesmerising. the shots chosen are so great, be if the shots of characters or the topography for them which is mostly rain or snow or lush green farms that spreads all across the screen. Only at the end, when the credit came "In Memory of Conrad L Hill" I did realize that its for cinematography that the movie is acclaimed more than anything else.Watch it for camera work and cinematography and dialogues that bring the characters alive. It's 3/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Road To Perdition hit theaters, it was critically acclaimed and was eventually nominated for six Academy Awards. While it was a great film, it was very dark and fails to deliver the emotional impact that it intended to have on it's audience. In the 1930s, Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) is a family man living in the suburban mid-west. By all accounts, he is a normal man, who is hiding one very dark secret, he is a hit-man for an organized crime syndicate. His secret is safe and life continues on as usual until one day, his son, Michael Jr. (Tyler Hoechlin), witnesses his father execute someone. Sullivan assures his bosses that everything is fine and his son won't say anything, but when has the mob ever taken that chance? Sullivan and his family are targeted for elimination and only he and his son manage to escape to Chicago, where he plans his revenge. As with most films based on a novel, the story here is top notch and very well written. Tom Hanks is the premier actor of our time, a man who will be remembered for centuries, but was he really the right choice to play Michael Sullivan? Hanks has many amazing skills as an actor, but playing such a cold, sedentary character, Hanks is unable to use his many tools and gives a performance that is very dry. The audience simply doesn't relate to Sullivan the way they relate to his son, and that brings the emotional impact of the film way below what it was intended to be. Tyler Hoechlin is fairly well known now, but when he got this role, it was his first, and he beat out over 10,000 other kids to get it. I don't know who any of those other kids were, but Hoechlin couldn't have had much competition, because he was out of this world good. It's a shame that the Academy rarely recognizes kids and that Paul Newman got the Best Supporting Actor nod over Hoechlin, because this kid is really the only one who comes off in a way that the writers originally intended. Road To Perdition was a tremendous story and was full of award winning actors, but the star power was more important to the producers, then finding actors who fit the characters as they were written. Aside from that and a painfully predictable ending, that you have to see coming, this was a pretty good film. I loved the setting and how dark it was, as well as the originality of a film that takes places nearly 60 years ago. I just find it ironic that in a cast full of Academy Award winning actors, it's a kid who steals the show.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Falls short</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has many memorable scenes of brutal, if stylised, violence, a magnificent performance from Paul Newman and several other things to recommend it. However if falls short of its obvious efforts to be a classic for at least 3 reasons I can think of.Firstly, the source material. On watching this I felt the story was a bit thin at times and the characters were not entirely fleshed out. On looking it up, I was not surprised that the source was not a novel but a graphic novel and the emphasis was to look good rather than than make sense. In particular the Jude Law character jarred. Why would no one ask questions about a man who took and published some many photos of violent deaths? Also, why did not Tom Hanks, who was otherwise an exemplary gunman, not kill him when he had the chance? Hanks seemed at times to have Godlike powers. How on earth did he get into the church where Newman was? Was not Newman protected? Why was he just allowed to leave? And why, for that matter, did Newman's guards later stand around like dummies to let themselves be machine gunned down?Because it looked cool in a comic book (and on the screen). This brings me to my second objection: the film sometimes seems to try too hard to be great. Shots of curtains fluttering, tree lined roads and the dark graininess all seemed a bit overwrought a t times and reminiscent of other greater films. My third objection is the casting. Paul Newman was superb, but the other leads were badly cast. Hanks is too lightweight to be convincing as a killing machine. Both Craig and Law struggled with their accents, with Law in particular being too much of a pretty boy to be convincing as a psychopath.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A personal tale set amidst the Depression-era criminal underworld</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a gangster film, but it's done in an artistic way, rather than as an action movie. Director Sam Mendes gives the scenes a certain poetic or "dreamlike" feel, and there are lots of artfully composed shots and camera movements. Conrad Hall won a posthumous Oscar for his cinematography. Tom Hanks acts against type as an enforcer for Irish mob patriarch Paul Newman. Brits Daniel Craig and Jude Law stretch their acting chops playing sketchy American characters. The whole thing is set in 1931, with old cars and tommy guns. Most violence is off-camera to emphasize the psychological aspect. The enduring theme is about father-son relationships.The film has a certain coldness that makes me hesitate to embrace it as a personal favorite, but it sure is a fine piece of filmmaking. I'd put it in the same class as, off the top of my head, THE ASSASSINATION OF JESSE JAMES BY THE COWARD ROBERT FORD (2007) or NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN (2007).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I simple can't believe this movie." Kristl said when the credits started to roll. They were lounging on the couch in the garage turned movie theater. It had been isolated to keep it warm and made soundproof. However at times they felt little tremors when heavy traffic rolled past outside."Believe? What is there to believe?" Henry said, "It is a movie, not a religion.""Hmph." Kristl said, "It just so overdone sentimental that I simply can't connect to any of the characters. Even the great Paul Newman fails to touch me. The whole movie keeps on hitting the nostalgia bone without interruption. It invokes the mood of Schindlers List but basically has nothing to show for it. The main character is a killer and that is it. He gets chased by his former compadres because the son of the crime lord wants him dead because the hit-man's son witnessed killing someone. He hits back. A lot of people get killed. End of story. Standard action flick.""You're just grumpy because there are no women in it." Henry laughed and he opened a can of Molson's triple X. Drinking this beer was a sin he liked to indulge in at times."Actually that is a bit of a pity...I mean Tom Hanks is an nice actor, but well.. A cute woman would have been nice.""Well that illustrates part of it. There are no women in it, no police, no humor and no love interests. It is a sentimental serious movie." Kristl said, "The whole story is forced. Paul Newman who doesn't to want drop his no good son despite the fact that he is a scumbag. Tom Hanks who doesn't want to let go, even though he has a son to take care off. And the end was so predictable.""Well, it's a nice action flick and a bit sentimental, but I like the way he outsmarted them all." "You know I saw Miller's Crossing and that is just so much better. For instance in this movie the characters just don't develop. The interaction between the father and his son are that they exchange some words and his dad learns him how to drive and shoot. And the only thing the kids seems to learn is: 'thou shalt not kill'. At least not with guns." Kristl continued."Ah well. But you have to say. The movie looked nice with the proper scenes and shots.I recall this shot where the camera is set up so it shows the boy sitting in a room on a bed and the father enters the house. It has almost the quality of a painting.""I agree, there are some beautiful scenes.""And there is a certain sadness in how the mob boss and hit-man end up as enemies." Henry said,"The sadness of a father losing his son."Kristl nodded. "Well.. in a fashion. That part would have been nice, but it was so underdeveloped in the movie. It would have been a nice to have seen the parallel of the father son relation between Newman and Hanks and Hanks and his son. They could have left out Craig or Jude Law and given more time to the father son relations.""But if they leave out Graig it would have knocked out the bottom of the movie. There would be no conflict." Henry said smartly."Well there is always a reason for a conflict. You just think up one.. ""And that from you!" Henry laughed and took another swig from his can of beer and then burped.Pig, Kristl thought.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful Film, but not without flaws.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, I must say how well deserved the Oscar for cinematography was for the film. Every shot looks incredible, from the way each shot is filmed, to the layouts of every frame. Just...stunning.Now for the movie itself. The first 30 or so minutes were a bit of a drag, but still did well to introduce me to the major players, and the plot itself. When the Movie really started to take off, it was fantastically engrossing. I really enjoyed it. It had a rather simple plot, but had enough twists to keep it interesting. And besides, I didn't even mind the plot that much. It was just that pretty. Masterfully done. The score in this film was held the entire way through, and quite honestly, a bit annoying. It just felt cheaply done, and didn't fit the atmosphere of the movie. It seemed done on a computer, while a studio recording of much darker tones would've been more appropriate.This brings me to the performances. Tom Hanks is always masterful, and this was no exception. I was hoping for Paul Newman to be in this a bit more, as he played my favorite character of all time (Butch Cassidy). Nevertheless, Newman played his part very well, and clearly hasn't lost any of his talent, as many before him have. The little kid in the movie (the main one, that is) was quite annoying during the beginning, but as the ball began rolling, I didn't really mind him. Daniel Craig and Jude Law were both English dudes playing American dudes in this film. Craig was a lot better in his role, and although Law was good as a creepy guy, his accent was awful, and there wasn't anything special to say about the rest of his performance.Anyway, there's my review. To sum up... +Fantastic Acting performances(where it counted) +Visually sublime +Engrossing, Thrilling and Entertaining -Jude Law's Accent-Boring Introduction -Sub-par Scoring8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mendes' movie is outstanding regarding the cinematography: his direction is flawless, with clinical shots and a beautiful photography.But on the other hand, I thought the cast was odd. Hanks didn't fit his role at all, he is one of the least emotional actors in my opinion, he doesn't convey much and has kind of the same expression all the time. You wouldn't expect him to be able to play both sides of the character. Big miscast. Same thing could be said about Daniel Craig. Also, all the characters lacked a bit development; a great surprise was Jude Law's, who was really intriguing, though unfortunately underused.Overall, I thought this was a marvelous movie, technically, but lacked a great amount of emotion and that little thing that sucks you in the plot: the script is kind of basic and doesn't show much lyricism.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are some things I'm willing to suspend my disbelief for. Tom Hanks (the same actor who starred in Bosom Buddies and Splash) as a hit-man? No. I draw the line there. I will not accept Michael Keaton as Batman, Tom Hanks as a hit-man, or any other 80s stand-up comedian with delusions of being a serious actor, in a heavyweight role. I seem to be in the extreme minority here, but these really are not very good actors, in my opinion. But, hey, what do I know? I think Jean-Claude Van Damme deserves a lifetime achievement award.There's potential for a good movie here, but only if it's remade with a better lead actor. I'll believe Keanu Reeves as a hit-man before I believe Tom Hanks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just rewatched PERDITION, a movie based on either a comic book or an old Japanese action flick, or both. Tom Hanks plays a gunsel for the Irish mob, headed by Paul Newman. Hanks is eventually betrayed and plots his revenge, making good use of his street-savvy young son. Jude Law plays a hit-man sent after Hanks. The film is heavily stylized, and almost feels like a cartoon at times, which may put off some viewers. At other times, it feels like a filmed play. I originally saw it in a theater, but seeing it now on a small-screen TV hasn't lessened its impact any. It is dark, moody, violent and a must-see for gangster flick devotees.

It's a beautifully made with it's subtext of guilt, vengeance, and redemption. Some may complain that Tom Hanks was not right for this role, but I personally thought everyone put on a excellent performance, especially Newman and Law .

It has a very well thought-out and in-depth plot structure, which allows for this movie to use multiple approaches in order to get the viewers attention. Whether it's the loss of a loved one, gang related issues, shootouts, or a simple father-son bond, this film is able to hook its audience by any means necessary. The main roles are played by the father (Tom Hanks) and the gang leader (Paul Newman) as well as the son whose cherubic attitude adds for a more settle atmosphere. Even though Tom Hanks seems a little out of place in this acting style, he plays his role with enough intensity and emotion for the viewer to believe the movie was simply a true event that was filmed by accident. I give this movie my highest praise and would recommend it to any type of viewer. It has plenty of action and drama scenes, while still having its comedy moments and a person of any background or social class can relate in some way to this film</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Road To Perdition, a story about a gangster (Tom Hanks) and his son who are on the run after their family had been killed. The movie itself takes place in Chicago during 1931. At first, Tom Hanks' son had no clue as to what his father did for a profession. Young Sullivan, being the curious little kid that he is decided to sneak out one night to see just what exactly his father was up to. Little did he know what he was about to get into. After that night, Peter would no longer be able to look at his father the same way ever again. In my opinion, I thought that the movie Road to Perdition was a great quality film that was definitely worth watching. At first, the movie had been perennial and didn't seem like it was really going anywhere. To my surprise, however, the movie had taken off pretty rapidly after the initial shooting. One of the greatest things in this movie is the soundtrack. The epic music matches the violent action throughout the movie very well. Another thing I thought was strong was the acting. Tom Hanks played a pretty good role although I am not used to seeing him play the "Bad Guy" role. The only thing I would say is not the greatest is the story structure because like I had said earlier, it is fairly slow going in the beginning of the movie. Overall, I would have to say that this definitely one movie that I will remember and most likely end up watching again sometime in the near future.</fullReview>

Maybe because I'm such a fan of the graphic novel and at the risk of sounding like a fanboy(the only form of life lower than a fanboy is a cockroach)The movie as a whole fails for me.The additions Jude Law, and the subtractions everything else left me feeling cold and more than a little disappointed. I was expecting a great crime movie more in the vein of Bonnie and Clyde Mendes took all the heart out of the story and left us with nothing but the bare bones.

		<fullReview>The Road to Perdition (2002) is a crime film about a man, Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) who is seeking revenge over the death of his wife, Annie Sullivan (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and youngest child, Peter Sullivan. He also has the help of his eldest son, Michael Jr. (Tyler Hoechlin). It begins with Michael Jr. finding out his father kills people for a living by witnessing it with his own eyes. The trust between them is put on the line. When their family is killed, they have to stick together to survive, one can not live without the other.I found this film extremely boring to begin with, but I told my self to stick with it even though I was finding it hard to concentrate on it. About an hour and a half into the movie, it begins to pick up when Michael Sullivan is telling his son how to drive a car. It is a comical scene which made me realise I know nothing about cars. The scenes which involve death are shocking, but are not brutally violent, which makes the film different. When the gunshots go off, it doesn't make you jump, there is a soft tone about this film. This is probably brought about by the amazing cinematography; every shot could be a photograph. This also fits in with Jude Law's character that shoots photographs of the dead. He has been hired to assassinate Michael Sullivan and Jude Law gives this character a creepy feel, he does wrong things and yet he makes you feel sort of happy about it. The final scenes are amazing. It has a shock dramatic ending, but you don't feel sad for losing a main character. You feel a joy of relief because any resentment Michael Sullivan Jr. had for his father is lifted when he forgives his father for what he did for a living and realises he is nothing like him and will not become him.The acting in the film was amazing, there is a whole cast of fantastic actors. However, Daniel Craig's character I found weird and Paul Newman's character didn't interest me in the slightest, which let their acting abilities be not known. I felt Tom Hank's performance was a little disappointing at the beginning of the film, when his wife had died, I thought it lacked real emotion. However, as the movie progressed, so did his acting talent. Jude Law was fantastic and Tyler Hoechlin was OK, but nothing special.The direction of Sam Mendes is great and the cinematography of the film is the best thing. It is purely amazing and uses many soft tones, this, combined with the music, tells the story in a unique way. When the dialogue went silent, the music told the narrative. It sets the mood, tone and era of the story. I found it fantastic.The problem with this film is that it is really slow moving. It is has a good storyline, amazing actors, beautiful cinematography and great music, but it lacks something special. You really have to keep all attention on it otherwise you will get bored.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overall this is a good movie. The cinematography was very well done, and the cast did a fairly good job. Hanks portrayed a good mobster, but I can't say that the role fit him perfectly. He really didn't talk all that much, and with not much emotion. But, what do you expect from a hit-man. He did the best possible job for this role and was very clear and concise when he had some meaningful lines. I actually thought that the actor who played John Rooney had more emotional scenes that Hanks did and he really lit up the picture. All of the actors did a nice job though and it was a good put together cast.The story isn't all that different from other things that have been done before. The "gangster father wanting a different life for his son" has been done before, and the ending was predictable, but it brings closure to the film. I knew what was going to happen, but I didn't mind. There was nothing else that could happen at that point of the movie. It's the way that everything was done that made this a good movie, how they did, what was expected to be done. I thought the story line was good and made for a nice movie. I recommend this movie to be watched by anyone, because it has some really good lessons for everyone even if you're not into the gangster films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Road to Perdition" was a pretty good movie, nothing too special, but overall good.Tom Hanks (who did a phenomenal job acting) plays a brigand who had his wife and one of his two boys killed. After that he took his living son, played by Tyler Hoechlin, to try and rob all of Al Capone's money. That is the basic plot, not that complicated, and that leads me too one of my first complaints. The writing was way too simple. The fact that the solution to everybody's problems is killing the person that started the problem is too simplistic. It seems like a child wrote the story. What is worse than that is all of the editing mistakes, I could name about a billion, but I'll do just a couple. First of all, at the end when Michael Sullivan Sr. is looking out the window and you can see the waves of water hit the beach in the reflection, the sound of the waves don't match up. The big one that made me mad is after Michael Sullivan Sr. gets shot and two random old people know how to dig out a bullet, patch up the wound, and don't ask any questions about it. Now the cinematography of this movie was beautiful. Some of the shots were breathtaking. Anytime you would see a dead body, or someone dying, the shots would be perfect. I would not change a thing about it. Overall I would give it a 7.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Road to Perdition was a film about the darker side of life in the early 1930's, the mafia scene and how gruesome it could be. The movie keeps a morose mood, and has consistent symbolism with water and death. Love, betrayal, and death are all things that make you attached to this film in the roller-coaster ride of emotions the characters go through. While some people question whether this movie is worth watching, my opinion is heavily favoring this movie. With one of the finest works of his career, Tom Hanks portrayed Michael Sullivan, a gangster with a side of him that his son never knew about. Hanks played an unfamiliar role of a gangster, one the audience is not used to seeing Hanks represent. Nonetheless, he played the part to perfection, leaving viewers on the edge of their seat. The acting in this film was just not spectacular by Hanks, but the rest of the cast as well, including Paul Newman and Jude Law. Young Tyler Hoechlin gave a great performance of Sullivan Jr., a child confused about what his father wanted him to be and more importantly, what he wanted to be in life. The direction in Perdition was nearly flawless, with the symbolism and the whole idea of the story being a flashback of Michael Sullivan Jr. The darkness of the film gives a dreary sense of depression and despair. Director Sam Mendes put themes in the movie, such as violence. Violence doesn't only hurt the victim, but what it does to the person who pulled the trigger. It eats at them, slowly corroding their emotions. There is also a connection between fathers and sons. The relationships between Sullivan and his son, and Sullivan and Rooney are very similar. Sullivan Jr. idolizes his father, yet fears him at the same time, just like Sullivan is to Rooney. What makes or breaks the overall mood and tone of a movie is the soundtrack, and in this case, it made the movie. The gloomy music added to the dark theme that the director was aiming for, music that could easily be related with death and betrayal. The soundtrack was nominated an Oscar for best original score, and for good reason. The soundtrack grasps the plot of the movie, using haunting sounds to emphasize what was happening during that scene. Overall, this is a movie I would recommend to anyone. The film gives a long lasting effect and makes you think about what you just saw. It left me making implications to what Michael Sullivan Jr,'s life was like, and how death had affected his adult life. This movie is a must see for any body.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>unacknowledged LONE WOLF AND CUB rip</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a great idea for an updated Americanized version, but it really irks me that, at least in the writing credits listed on IMDb and all of the reviews I've read of this film in print and blog media, no one mentions that this is an uncredited updating and remake/rethink of Kazuo Koike's LONE WOLF AND CUB series (manga and movies and TV show from the 60s/70s). I know it was commonly acknowledged that that's what Collins' graphic novel was based on. But here in the movie credits - nothing (unless I'm seriously missing something). It is so obvious to anyone who has seen this film as well as the LONE WOLF pix. Hanks is Itto Ogami, his son is Ogami's son Daigoro and Newman is Lord Yagyu. I hate sh*t like this where there is no credit mentioned. Like Collins and his partner Rayner and screenwriter Self and director Mendes just came up with this idea totally out of thin air. It seems likely Fox must have come to some kind of financial agreement with Toho, Katsu Productions and Koike about the film because, to me anyway, the similarities really are enough to be actionable in a legal arena. It's an even more blatant copy and much more obvious than when Kurosawa adapted (also uncredited) Dashiell Hammett's RED HARVEST to samurai times in YOJIMBO.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really beautiful film that although has some minor niggles; sustains tension, concentration and emotion throughout.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think it must be my love of the genre that keeps Road to Perdition so high up on my list of recent films that are of a high quality. But for all its moody cinematography and poetic music that stirs the odd emotion at critical times, Road to Perdition, when broken down, is actually quite a flawed film. These flaws relate to conflict the hero and villain engage in, something that is a necessity when it comes to the story arc Road to Perdition adopts. But amongst the small things that keep Road to Perdition from being on everybody's list of great recent films, it's still a one way journey full of engaging scenes, tense moments and like I mentioned; brilliant cinematography and music ? if I had made this film, I'd be proud.Road to Perdition is a textbook example of a genre film played out under a guise of look and feel. But guise is perhaps too harsher word to use. There is the establishment of the world the lead characters live in; the 'bad' event from the outside that jeopardises this and during the film's second third, a linear journey that keeps going down the straight and narrow with whatever conflict happening there to fill in the blanks. But most of the time, people don't have too much of a problem with straight forward stories like these and I feel it isn't accepted as much as it should be due to the over expectancy based on the very things that make the film so good aesthetically: namely the look and music of the film.Road to Perdition starts out in a pretty innocent fashion and its perspective of innocence is maintained throughout given we are supposedly seeing this film through the eyes of a child. The film begins on a beach to tranquil noises of waves lapping, the first example of the film's great attention to sound, as a boy named Michael Sullivan jr. (Hoechlin) stands there about to tell us his story. I suppose the principal error here is, by the time the film's started and the plot revelation pops up to do with 'getting to a beach house', we might suspect that he's survived to that point anyway.The film then begins proper, in the past, in the snowy wilderness that is Prohibition era America. The opening stages of the film are set in a utopian bliss with what could quite possibly be a perfect Western family: a husband, wife and two sons. The opening exchanges are juxtaposed with ominous scenes related to crime: Michael jnr. steals a chocolate bar from his employer and when he gets home, the snow ball fight with his little brother sees them hit one another and fall down, pretending to be dead after having been shot. Once this is all over, guns and murder will be closer to the two of them than they could have ever imagined.The film also presents us with an odd problem in the sense it is unclear who the protagonist really is. The film feels as if it is being told through a child's eyes but it is not shot like it, at least not consistently. We spend a lot of time with Michael jnr's father; Michael snr. (Hanks), but this is for the audience's sake that they know what's going on and who's developing what. True, the scene in which Junior discovers what Senior does is shot in the point of view format from Junior's eyes but most of the time, he acts as an ally for his father; a helper who drives when necessary or honks the horn when required.Then there is the problem with the conflict. The film's basic approach of having the two Michaels go on this 'road trip' of sorts, firstly to get help from a chief gangster in Chicago and then onto the lake house is relatively routine but it works although the main reason the film feels underdone or lacking the first time you see it is because of the lack of conflict. Within the film, Connor Rooney (Craig); John Rooney (Newman) and Harlen Maguire (Law) act as enemies to the two Michaels but it's only Maguire that causes distress or antagonistic behaviour of any sort. It's interesting to note who brings about the actual 'bad' that comes from the outside to disrupt the Sullivan family's initial bliss. Then analyse who the biggest threat in the film is to the remaining Sullivans ? they are two different people.But then again, since there is confusion over who the lead character actually is anyway, you could argue that if Junior was the protagonist then he gets most of the antagonism from his own father and thus; conflict with Harlen and Connor is unneeded anyway but he is too young to fill the role when some of the more obligatory scenes nearer the end arrive. Road to Perdition sparks debate over whether it is a brilliantly told, well shot gangster film or a confused mess with limited real interest. It is the sort of film you enjoy coming back to every now and again, re-surfacing the arguments but enjoying the visual and audio qualities all the same. While the immediate ending contradicts the 'road movie' arc by turning the whole thing into a circular journey, Road to Perdition is a strong and interesting gangster film that does not hold back and keeps you focused throughout.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>McCheesy's take on "Road to Perdition"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a way to start a day. I saw this in a typically sun shiny morning and I can tell you if you are up for a depressing yet wonderful film to jumpstart your day, I suggest Road to Perdition.The film is about a mob gangster Michael Sullivan who was betrayed by his boss because his son, Michael Jr inadvertently witnesses a murder. So, to tie all loose ends, mob boss John Rooney decides to kill his loyal right-hand man. But when Connor Rooney, John Rooney's son, mercilessly kills his family (only his older son Michael Jr surviving), he decides to go on a vendetta to avenge his family's death.The story is not your typical gangster film. There's no police cops to arrest mob bosses here nor drug cartels for that matter. The story is focused on Michael Sullivan's revenge on the people who betrayed him. Sam Mendes and the writers managed to excellently blend a father-and-child story angle in a gangster themed story.The performances were great. Tom Hanks as usual delivers, Jude Law unexpectedly sent chills down to my ancestors as a creepy looking psychopath/photographer. Paul Newman as the aging mob boss was great as well. One minute you hate him for betraying his loyal right-hand man, the next minute you don't want him to die soaking wet.Daniel Craig, before James Bond, portrayed an annoying scheming mischievous son to a mob boss. He had it coming to him. Yes, he was spot on with his performance too.The best scene in the entire film would probably be when Michael Sullivan ambushed John Rooney and his mob thugs drenched in rain. Sam Mendes did this slow-mo shot when Michael was shooting them with a machine gun in a distant house and the thugs were like dropping like flies and John was by the car, with his head down realizing his grim fate. Michael killed all of them except John. So, he approached him with gun in his hand, John turns to him, almost into tears and utters what probably is the best line of the film: "I'm glad its you". Michael with a sad look then shoots him down.That scene will stay in my head forever. It was emotional, sad, depressing and it almost wanna make you cry but somehow you feel that the Michael character is doing the right thing. Very poetic scene to be remembered for ages.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I believe that this film is often overlook as a great film. It is more than a gangster film but a great father and son film. Fathers and sons struggling to define their relationships. I loved how the seasons changed in area of the America which I find most American. It captured what I love about the Chicago and the mid west. You could discuss for hours the complex relationship with John Rooney (PN), Connor Rooney (DC), Michael Sullivan (TH), Michael Jr (TH), and Peter Sullivan. The basic feelings of jealously, insecurity, and want that launch the story. I am not sure why the film did not get greater praise. Put this one on your Netflix list.</fullReview>

Paul Newman does a great job as the mafia boss but personally I think Jude Law gives the best performance in the film as the hit-man. The rest of the supporting cast including the future Bond, Daniel Craig, do a very good job as well in the film.A very watchable film which should not be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A vastly over looked movie !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Critics tend to make a huge fuss over what sometimes tend to be the most rubbish of movies in Hollywood! Yet no one seems to mention this work of art. As I was on my path of watching Gangster movies, I came across this little gem on my shelf and popped it into my DVD player yesterday , watching it again for a second time. Road to Perdition is not really a gangster movie , it might have gangsters in it yes but on the whole this movie is based on relationships between fathers and son and loyalty and duty. Micheal Sullivan is a man who is torn between 2 worlds when the world he once was very much a part of come crashing down on him, Tom Hanks is just simply wonderful to watch as a hard man who opens up like a father and tries to show his gentle side to his realising that its just the two of them , during the course of the movie we get to see him open up like a flower and we the interaction between him and his son which at times was amusing and hard to watch as it makes me wish I could have a closer bond with my own father like that. Paul Newman was great as the mafia Don style but then also showing his fathering side which shows us that it was not all black and white as it is with most gangster movies , also great performances from both Daniel Craig and Jude Law who I can't normally stand. The use of locations and scenes was magnificent along with other uses of camera angels to make things stand out larger than they have to be. The script was also very sharp and tight which just added to the brooding menace of the characters along with one or two memorable lines that will stay with me. My only complaint was that it might just drag its heels here and there but quickly gets back onto track. To conclude although Road to Perdition starts of slow , it very quickly fires into a very good film that must be watched , why it was not given any of the awards at the Oscars is beyond me but as far as I can go , it should be on your '100 movies to watch before I die' list!ROAD TO PERDITION - 8.2 OUT 10PRAY FOR Micheal SULLIVAN...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Irish Themes and Culture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As in other gangster films, one of the most important motifs of this movie is its relationship to deeper cultural elements. Without its Irishness, this would be just another "mafia" story. The characters names, the Catholic religion, the Irish wakes, the Irish fondness for liquor, the food, the accents all combine to beautifully highlight the powerful Irish heritage and its influence on the 1920s and 30s criminal culture. The film masterfully highlights the so-called shanty Irish crime bosses who controlled Boston and the greater East coast politics in the early 20th century. The murderous pathology of Michael Sullivan and his gang of hoodlums is ironically juxtaposed to the decidedly poetic, religious, lyrical, music-filled Irish family life he and his gang inhabit.</fullReview>

Hall, superb acting by Tom Hanks, Paul Newman, Jude Law, wonderful directing by Sam Mendes, and of course a haunting and moving score by Thomas Newman. All the technical parts come together to create the mood for this powerful story of a boy who discovers that his father is a hit-man. They go on a journey together and realize more about each other and themselves than they ever knew before. It is hard at times to watch this because we know that this can only end in a cruel and sorrowful manner. It does. But we are left with knowing that there is hope for the boy. That is all that matters to Michael Sullivan: to make sure his son doesn't end up the same way. Simply put, this is a stunning achievement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant, see it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Road to Perdition has all the stereotypical 30's gangster traits - tommy guns, dark silhouetted goons in their overcoats, sleazy jazz clubs and hypocritical lead characters. In that respect the film is entertaining - the characters are at once astonishing and abhorrent for their brazenness. RTP, like all really good movies works on other levels as well.Firstly, there is the theme of father-son relationships. Each of these relationships comes to us with a history that we are given a glimpse of early on. This is achieved seamlessly without slowing the momentum of the plot.The film advertises the father-son thing as being the central theme and so I watched and waited for the bit where they finally sit down and "talk" - you know, have a real heart-to-heart (and act completely out of character). Thankfully it never came and yet I felt like the primary father-son relationship had by the end, changed profoundly. This is the first reason I really, really like this film!Secondly, the cinematography is incredible. The lighting is rich and worth watching for itself.Finally, the music is well done. It aids the story at all times while managing to be distinctly beautiful in its own right.There is much to enjoy in RTP, so watch it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very under-rated, powerhouse crime drama that will rock you to the very core</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I waited a long time to see Road to Perdition and I don't know why because it's definitely the type of film I love to see. I finally picked it up and got a chance to watch it and was not surprisingly blown away by it. In the recent rash of mobster/gangster flicks like The Departed, and to a lesser extent the terrific We Own The Night, I think Road to Perdition does a fantastic job. The film is gorgeous (well deserving of it's Oscar for cinematography) but how in the hell did this film miss all the other Oscar nominations it should have received? This entire film and everything about it boggles my mind because overall it was received well by critics, it seems to not be a classic film and Tom Hanks is completely overlooked in every discussion and he absolutely takes this movie and his role by the throat and puts everything into it proving once again that he is possibly the greatest, most influential and versatile actor in history. The film is a mobster movie, a coming of age movie, a drama, a dark and gritty crime film...it just encompasses so much. Director Sam Mendes took the exact same gritty style that he gave to Jarhead and translates it to this 1930's mob drama. The story is so captivating and enthralling from beginning to end and will leave you breathless and in tears.Tom Hanks headlines in one of the greatest roles he's ever done. Michael Sullivan is blood thirsty, and determined and brooding, and level headed and he's a father who doesn't quite connect with his eldest son because he sees himself in him. A complex and multi faceted character and Hanks nails it with this eerie subtlety. He was robbed of any and all awards!! The young Tyler Hoechlin is terrific as Hanks' young son who is left in the midst of violence and a life on the run. He is really terrific and shows some real chops up against both Hanks and Newman, and him and Hanks have awesome father/son chemistry. I have great respect for Paul Newman. He is a terrific actor and an icon to Motion Pictures but this doesn't do anything for him. I thought they would utilize Hanks and Newman and their relationship to the utmost but Newman's role is a cameo at best with no real depth, or importance other than being the figure head to this Irish mob family. His Oscar nomination for the role is ludicrous!! Especially considering it was the only acting nomination and the lead cast blew away their roles and Newman was barely existent save for a few intense moments. In a sadly small role Daniel Craig is terrific as the maniacal and power hungry son of Newman. Craig has this glint of psychosis to his character but it never truly gets explored but still he is terrific in his role...better than Newman's. Jude Law makes a late appearance in the film as a psychotic hit-man that films his dead bodies and he is quiet and brooding and does very well in the role considering how late in the film he comes in. He makes a worthy opponent to Hanks' character.Road to Perdition sends you straight back to the time it takes place and just enthralls you in this story of vengeance and family and growing up and the script is brilliant. Hanks truly does make the film with his character and the story is gripping and important. It doesn't present itself as an epic really but after seeing it and taking it in and thinking about it, it becomes so much more in your mind and really sticks with you because of the performances and story. Road to Perdition seems in every way shape and form to be the kind of film critics salivate over and should have been an Oscar sweep and yet I remember when it came out and thinking that it wasn't really a well talked about film and now that I've seen it I can verify that the film is very under rated and under-appreciated. As I was watching it I am convinced that this is the type of film that will stand the test of time and in 30-40-50 years it will be considered a classic and definitely one of Hanks' best performances. For any fans of the mob film, period pieces or just a deep and intelligent story you must treat yourself to Road To Perdition. 9/10 PS: This is review number 599 for me. My 600th review will be close behind as I pop the much talked about classic Casablanca into my DVD player for the first time. Stay tuned and thanks for reading.</fullReview>

I first saw part of this film some years ago and never took any notice of Daniel Craig, but you certainly notice him now since he became James Bond. He has a very convincing American accent as has Jude Law. At the risk of using a word I feel is used too much these days Sam Mendes has a flair for creating iconic images and there is one such scene where Tom Hanks is looking out the window to the sea which multiplies the shock of what happens next . The violence in the film is very unpleasant and you can almost feel the pain of the gunshot wounds and some of the deaths are very sad. I thought The Untouchables was the ultimate in modern day gangster movies but this is even better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE GATES OF HELL: ROAD TO PERDITION : "No one here is bound for heaven."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"No one here is bound for heaven." Mike Sullivan (Tom Hanks), a hit man for crime boss John Rooney (Paul Newman) finds himself at odds with the gang after his son 12 year old son Michael Sullivan, Jr. (Tyler Hoechlin) witnesses a contact killing. "Sons," moans Rooney, "live to give grief to their fathers." Known in mob circles as the Angel of Death, Sullivan tries to maintain an uneasy peace with his crime overlord for the sake of his family. Sullivan who lives according to a strict "moral" code of loyalty to the mob and protection of its members believes he has the loyalty of his mob-land boss John Rooney. Rooney even offers a token to Michael Jr as a guarantee of silence.Paul Newman plays the role of John Rooney with eloquence; there's the deceptive charm of a truly diabolical crime lord and the twinkle in the eye of friendship while something different boils beneath the mask. Newman as Rooney exudes paternal concern for Mike Sullivan who as an orphaned lad had been adopted by the mobster.Yet betrayal is in the works. As Rooney seemingly settles old debt in coin, Rooney's profligate son plots the death of Sullivan and Sullivan's family.Tyler Hoechlin plays Michael Sullivan, Jr with devilish charm. In flight through the Midwest, there are moments of a normal father son relationship: learning how to drive, to shoot a weapon that are bent to nefarious purpose the two have in mind.In presenting this relationship, "Road to perdition" however does suffer from a perspective switch. It begins as the portrait of killer Mike Sullivan and his dirty work and ends as the tale of Sullivan's boy trying to rationalize the deeds of his father. The line between the two perspectives is not clearly drawn.In the aftermath Sullivan's other son Peter and his wife are killed by the mob. On the run with Michael Jr, Sullivan vows vengeance on the crime boss.Guy guy type cast Tom Hanks gets plenty of opportunity for murder and mayhem in the course of his one man crime spree across the Midwest directed at secret mob assets. Can one man overcome the machine? While the film may be compared to the epics of organized crime, "Murder Inc," "The Godfather," and "Goodfellas," the historical Irish certainly produced their share of bad guys and indeed the Irish-American actor James Cagney invented the gangster movie genre but the Irish never attained that level of organization in crime as later immigrants who organized the syndicate and ran crime on national basis under business like rules.Certainly in the time Perdition speaks to, there were Irish bad guys but organization was strictly the province of others. Where Irish organization existed in criminal activities, it retained a stated normative and romantic purpose however shallow.Yet literature may vary from life to make a solid point here a valid moral lesson that in the netherworld of crime a destructive life inevitably results in a tragic downfall. This theme attains its glowing moments in the sharp black and white scenes of gangland executions. "No one here," quips Sullivan's crime overlord Rooney, "is bound for heaven."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Road to Perdition, directed by the director of the American Beauty, Sam Mendes, is a movie with some similarities to some gangster movies of its kind, in specific like The Godfather (there are undeniable discrepancies, though). We see in this movie Michael Sullivan Sr. (Tom Hanks) involved in goon gangs to make a living in a family he hardly endeavors to keep moral and ethical: just consider the catholic prays everybody says at meal table (remember the Godfather with its trilogy of themes which were Godfather, Family, and Business among which, the middle one must not be ever mixed with the last?). Michael is a villain, so is Mr. Rooney (Paul Newman), but with one big difference: Mr. Rooney could not manage to deter his son from getting into crime; however, Michael is doing a hard job teaching his son, Michael Jr., that following his father is not all the time correct. Road to Perdition is a symbolic name for a street which might lead the father and the son to a shelter (aunt Sarah's home) but we come to realize that the ultimate shelter for such guys involved in bloody savagery is annihilation: just look at the end of the film in which Michael Sr. falls fatally wounded after being shot by a killer in disguise of a press photographer (Jude Law). To conclude let me mention that Michael was the only photography subject of the killing photographer who was taken a picture of with open eyes, all alive!http://opinion.persianblog.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sam Mendes and screenwriter David Self (Thirteen Days) crafted an excellent and enjoyable movie. Conrad Hall won an Oscar for his cinematography and every scene is beautifully shot.John Rooney (Paul Newman) runs a mob franchise for the Capone organization in Depression-era Illinois. Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) is his key lieutenant. Sullivan kills and tortures people, but he's also a good Catholic and devoted family man. Rooney seems like a friendly grandpa who happens to inspire fear amongst his friends and neighbors. The film explores the relationship between fathers and sons but it also has plenty of violence.My only problem with the film is the casting of Hanks and Newman. I found it difficult to accept them as men capable of evil deeds. I couldn't forget their established screen persona's as decent, likable every-men. For me, Hanks just seemed wrong and miscast as a Capone thug, he belongs in fluffy romantic comedy. Jude Law is excellent as McGuire a creepy photo-journalist who has a parallel career as an hit man. Daniel Craig is very good as Newman's son Connor. I saw this with a mixed group, while the men enjoyed the movie, while the women complained that it was too violent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Road to Perdition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Mendes' much-hyped follow up to the over-rated American Beauty suffers firstly from comparisons made to The Godfather; few films could hope to overcome such a cheap and lazy comparison, and it's to Perdition's credit that it manages at least to establish an identity of its own. Having said that I was reminded more of Millers Crossing than The Godfather by the look and tone of the film.Tom Hanks plays against type as a reserved, almost staid, foot soldier for the mob, and he does well in a role that is largely underwritten ? as most of the characters are, come to think of it; perhaps a consequence of the film's 'grown-up's comic book' roots. All we know about him is that he was taken in by mob boss John Rooney (Paul Newman, clearly relishing his role) ? and even that is awkwardly shoehorned in to a conversation between his two sons. Rooney's real son, Connor (Daniel Craig, as far from Bond as he could probably ever get), is a greedy weakling, and it was this father-son relationship that was the more intriguing of the two. Rooney Sr., must make the choice between sacrificing his more worthwhile 'son' to save the life of Connor, or allow his real son to be murdered by Michael (Hanks) in revenge for the murder of Michael's wife and youngest son. Unfortunately, this dilemma is only briefly touched upon, and Rooney's decision never satisfactorily explained.Despite these gripes, Road to Perdition is a terrific reward for those with the patience to allow a film to unfurl at its own pace. It looks both exquisite and authentic, manages to avoid glamorising the gangster lifestyle, and benefits from good performances throughout. Jude Law gives his best performance to date (not a high hurdle, admittedly) as the creepy hit-man/photographer Harlan Maguire; Stanley Tucci is reliably smooth as real-life enforcer Frank Nitti, and Craig is convincingly slimy as Connor Rooney. Newman's character is somewhat undernourished, but even he has more flesh on his bones than Jennifer Jason Leigh's stereotypical all-American mom.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the very first frame of Sam Mendes's gorgeously shot gangster drama 'Road to Perdition', you know you are in the hands of a truly gifted auteur. Starring the indefatigable Tom Hanks as a lonesome Depression-era hit man grappling with his loyalties to his Irish Catholic mob and his family, the movie is a picture-perfect vehicle for Mendes to showcase the breathtaking camera work of legendary cinematographer Conrad Hall. Each scene is meticulously framed, and some sequences are bound to leave you breathless (e.g. the silent shoot-out in the rain). Uniformly good performances by Hanks, Paul Newman and particularly Jude Law as a cold-blooded killer sent to hunt down the protagonists on the run make this an achingly beautiful film -- a big-hearted paean to the sometimes troublesome relationships between fathers and sons.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Undiscovered Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that only experienced film makers and movie goers can truly appreciate. The camera play and audio work is shear genius. Coupled with an outstanding musical score and the acting talents of all involved, it's a piece of art, a mandatory lesson for students learning how to move an audience through the cinematic medium. The storyline is challenging for commercial and critical success, because 'period pieces' have always been a tough sell at the box office, while gangster genre films have never caught the critic's eye. Nothing short of the best acting I've seen from the three major stars of the movie (Hanks, Newman and Law), but everyone else, from the young Tyler Hoechlin to the most trivial character shuffling across the screen, adds to the brilliance of this masterpiece. I'd only challenge the viewer to watch it a second time, paying particular attention to how the camera and sound make their individual statements for the film, yet artfully blend with all the other elements that tell the story. Kudos to everyone involved in this work. In the so many years and so many movies I've seen through them, I'll never understand why this one didn't sweep the Oscars. But then again, knowing the academy's politics, I probably shouldn't wonder.</fullReview>

I have no idea why Tom Hanks was not nominated in Academy Award? The directing and cinematography are really good. Sam Mendes is bringing different style this time, I think. The style this time is quite different from what he did in American Beauty. I love the composition and structure of every scene in this film. The use of color in this film is perfect. It deserves to win Best Cinematography. It really creates the atmosphere and the "old days" feelings. The movie score by Thomas Newman is touching. I would say no more.

		<fullReview>Reviewers who say this is the best gangster flick since The Godfather are presupposing it is a gangster film; this is as much a gangster film as The Shining is a horror film. Road to Perdition is no mere genre movie.Tom Hanks is as great and as versatile as ever; Paul Newman gives a heart felt and memorable performance that truly convinces; Jude Law and Stanley Tucci enjoy themselves in their gangster roles immensely. On the other hand, why Jennifer Jason Leigh wanted to take a role where she is a silent housewife for five minutes before vanishing from the film completely is anyones guess.This is a beautifully shot and entertainingly told morality epic. Best since The Godfather? I never liked The Godfather - but this is easily the best since Once Upon a Time In America. That makes Road to Perdition the second best 'gangster' flick ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a film Noir the Road to Perdition must be very successful, however, I couldn't help feeling I was watching a post-modern Western; the frontier landscapes being exchanged for the urban underbelly of 1930s prohibition era, and the usual central conflict of civilisation and savagery.Realising early on that quite apart from all its religious symbolism; e.g. Cain &amp; Abel, Roman Catholicism, guilt, etc, this is also a film that concerns itself with a very popular notion in films made since the 1970s; the corruption of the American dream. I don't believe Tom Hanks' character had been a particularly good father before we pick up the story, he also wasn't a bad one, however, once the main plot line kicks-in, his son represents, to me, more than anything else, a mirror by which Hanks fully understands and accepts his own social identification. There is a point in the movie in which he looks at the boy, in that inimitable way, in a scene full of exquisite self-understanding; the house may have been big and the cornbread had tasted good, but at what cost!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Father-son relationships, and how protecting these sons is at the heart of this excellent "gangster" film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Road to Perdition' is Sam Mendes' highly anticipated second film and follow-up feature after his Oscar-winning directorial debut in 'American Beauty'. However, instead of the contemporised exploration of the American dream in modern-day suburbia displayed in Mendes' previous film, 'Road to Perdition' is a dark tale about father-son relationships in a story of revenge and redemption set in the gangster era of the 1930s. Tom Hanks stars as Michael Sullivan, a seasoned hit man who is loyal to Irish Mob boss in Jack Rooney (Paul Newman)- who also represents a father figure for the lead character. Michael Sullivan works amongst his gangster peers while raising his own two sons with his wife (Jennifer Jason Leigh). The eldest son, Michael Sullivan Jnr (Tyler Hoechlin) is bewildered and curious about his father's employment and his relationship with Jack Rooney. When Michael Sullivan Snr goes on a job with Rooney's real son and ominous rival, Connor (Daniel Craig), to intimidate a dissenter, Sullivan Jr follows them. Junior witnesses a violent unfolding of events and sees his father murder rival gangsters and then is discovered himself by him and Connor. The Irish Mob turn against the Sullivans due to Connor's distrust, and both Michael Snr and Jnr must flee and they seek revenge on the people that betrayed them. Jack Rooney, protective of Connor, sends a psychopathic and mysterious renowned killer in Harlan Maquire (Jude Law) to hunt both the Sullivans down before they challenge the powers of the Chicago Mob and ultimately seek their own justice.'Road to Perdition' is based on a graphic-novel by Max Allan Collins and Richard Piers Rayner, and has been amazingly transformed to the cinematic form. A very subtle dark piece of the gangster genre that explores deep issues of father-son relationships, and it seems authentic in its display of the 1930s period. The cinematography is quite frankly the best of 2002, with a range of colour accentuating the haunting beauty of the era and the darkness of the story. This mastery by veteran cinematographer Conrad L. Hall makes this one of the many reasons to see Road to Perdition. The other main reasons is the performances of the whole cast especially Paul Newman as the world-weary Mob Boss who reluctantly protects his volatile son Connor over his adopted son in Michael. Tyler Hoechlin gives a very subtle performance that is extremely convincing as the young son who seeks the truth about his father. Michael Sullivan Snr is one of Tom Hanks most unique and different roles, and could be argued one of his better performances given the restraint and subtly of it in conjunction with the character. However, the most flamboyant and entertaining role from an audience perspective is seeing Jude Law as the main rival in Harlan Maquire. His portrayal and performance as the seedy character along with the make-up adds to Jude Law's already versatile and interesting list of on screen personas. Daniel Craig and Stanley Tucci are quite good in their subsequent roles as well, but Jennifer Jason Leigh never really shines in an unfortunate limited and underwritten role.Sam Mendes has bought to screen another interesting story with superb and expert direction, and he has no qualms about relying on the visual construction to convey the plot. The only main problem with Road to Perdition is that it lacks a sense of passion ignited into its subjects, as the ever-foreboding sense of darkness evokes throughout the tale here. However, it's all handled gracefully and we are still compelled by these characters.Personally, I think Road to Perdition is almost a masterpiece, and it certainly is one of the best films of 2002. It isn't quite as deep an exploration of the gangster world as 'The Godfather' (1972) or 'Goodfellas; (1990), yet it manages to convincingly use it as a backdrop for an excellent father-son tale intertwined with revenge and redemption. The acting is top-notch with excellent direction, and the late Conrad L. Hall's Oscar-winning cinematography for this film is simply sublime. Sam Mendes brings us an excellent follow-up film to 'American Beauty' with 'Road to Perdition' ? which has a very dark and interestingly paced story! 'Road to Perdition' is simply a great movie, a genuinely underrated one, and is easily one of the best films from 2002! ****? out of *****!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Story of Curiosity Killing More Than The Cat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I freely admit to being a Tom Hanks critic (with some notable exceptions), but this was a film where I really enjoyed the Hanks magic. It tells of Michael Sullivan's life in the Irish mafia during the time of Al Capone, and how a mistake on the part of his unknowing son led to the slaughter of his family and his subsequent revenge. If you like gangster movies (Goodfellas, A Bronx Tale, etc.) there's a high likelihood you'll also like this movie.The mood is very well established i the music and lighting. The film has many dark scenes, and the director makes great use of rain and water as both a symbolism and also as a way just to set a tone with the dark uncertainty that storms bring. The opposite effect is also achieved at the beach, which could also be viewed as a water symbol in a sense. But my point was more in the sunny brightness of the beach scenes. (Pay attention to this while you're watching and see if you can sense the mood shift.) As usual, Jude Law puts on a commanding performance. I don't think he's been in such a great character role since "Gattaca", and maybe hasn't been since (his portrayal of Errol Flynn in "The Aviator" was marvelous but too brief). I certainly hope this is a Hollywood star that shines bright for many years to come before finally fading away. (As a side note, what happens to Hollywood heart throbs like Tom Cruise when they reach old age?) What more to say about this film? Great acting, directing, casting, mood, music, lighting. Certainly I'm missing something, but until I revise this review later I would say this film is worth watching and for me worth watching again. And can Jennifer Jason Leigh ever do wrong?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can viewers say about Tom Hanks? From watching this film there is only one word to describe his acting abilities: sensational. A shame he didn't receive a thoroughly deserved Oscar for his portrayal of the mobster Michael Sullivan in this passionate Sam Mendes picture Hanks stars in the Oscar winning (Best cinematography) 2002 crime drama about a man who deals with the pressure of losing his family and his much loved job. He has to escape from the mob world and deal with the pressure of looking after his troubled son Michael Jr.The story in simply stunning. It creates passion, emotion and tension in every scene and fits perfectly into the genre. A film centred on passion and loyalty delivers memorable scenes. High emotion runs riot when Michael Jr discovers what his father's job involves. But the ending also creates as much passion as the whole film.There are many religious ideologies but forth from the director of American Beauty Sam Mendes to create the passion for the early 1930's showing how people felt about the situations and how much it meant. Religion is an important issue here, showing how people felt and reacted to different situations. And that's probably why the film was so successful because it was able to dive deep within the time and capture brilliantly the essence of the 1930's. The way people went around shooting each other, the business dealings, funerals etc are all contained within the film to promote situations of the current time.Older audiences will be able to appreciate the ideologies put forth but must have a strong heart to deal with the highly emotionally driven plot.The mode address is also worth notification as the characters all wear very fashionable clothes reflective of the time. Being part of a rich culture Hanks and his fellow mobsters wore fashionable stereotype costumes looking very classy and typical gangsters.The acting is simply stunning. Hanks steals the show once again but credit must go to Hoechilen who deals with so many emotional situations. As a young boy he must cope with all the new happenings surrounding him and Hoechilen pulls it off brilliantly. He is able to capture the true emotions of the character brilliantly to make audiences sympathize with him. Jude Law was also terrific as one of the central hit men. His ironic laid back style towards his profession is definitely notable and breathtaking. Craig and Newman also perform with their hearts on their sleeves as father and son.Confrontations between the characters are very well used. Having all the protagonists confront each other after different situations shows how each person reacts to the other and how they now have to deal with their lives.Passionate and emotional, a must see</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very well made film that maintains interest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Road to Perdition is a film that engrosses from beginning to end. It is about a gangster named Michael Sullivan, who is forced to go on the run from the gangsters with his son, after his son witnesses one of the murders he has carried out. There are several key points that result in the film's success. Firstly the characterisation and acting, in particular Paul Newman and Jude Law's characters were given an incredible aura via dialogue about them and their presence to make them interesting. Tom Hanks is as usual, brilliant playing Michael Sullivan, and Tyler Hoechlin doing a decent job as his son Michael Jr. Each of these actors fitted their roles very well, Tom Hanks in particular managing to pull of his detached hit-man character, very against type, you'll agree. Another good aspect of the film was it's cinematography. Jaw dropping at times, it sometimes went a bit too over stylised distracting from the realism. The directing was spot on, and the film was a very enjoyable watch, managing to balance touching moments, with high tension and carry off both with maximum impact.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, let me say to 'Richtersaurus:' ARE YOU NUTS? To call 'Road to Perdition' "arguably the best gangster movie ever made" is like saying that 'Mac and Me' is arguably the best movie ever made about a boy's friendship with an alien.It's like saying that 'SuperBabies: Baby Geniuses 2' is arguably the greatest suspense movie ever made.It's like saying that 'Teen Wolf Too' is the greatest film ever to feature the sibling of a former 'Family Ties' star-turned-werewolf leading a spontaneous dance number by a swimming pool. (This one might be true...MAYBE.) But "one of the greatest gangster movies ever made" this ain't. I mean, we are talking about a genre that includes 'The Godfather I/II,' 'Pulp Fiction,' the Scorsese trilogy, 'The Usual Suspects,' 'Scarface' and on and on and on. 'Road to Perdition' does NOT belong with these films.Seriously though, 'Road to Perdition' isn't BAD per se. It's just disappointing given the impressive cast. To begin, the pretense of redemption -- the ruthless gangster conflicted about his horrible crimes -- is unoriginal. ('Unforgiven' and 'Godfather III' come quickly to mind). The film focuses so heavily on Hanks' redemption that it comes off feeling inauthentic. I felt like yelling, "okay, I get it. He's really a good guy. Whatever! Just do something to make me care. At least do something interesting!" This is a film that tries too hard to be great. The end result is something you're just not likely to remember a week after you see it.</fullReview>

The bloody trails of violence that Michael Sullivan takes on is justified by the his fear of his son following the same road that he had taken several years back. Yes it will be unfair to compare it with that masterpiece"Godfather" but in terms of the graphic representation and the aptness of the recreation of Chicago, it is a worthy successor.Tom Hanks takes up a challengin role that is so much unlike the image of a next door guy that he has immortalised on the screen and he dlivers a gem of a performance . And the faher and son relationship brings the movie alive and grings variuos hidden layers of emotions that somehow makes one feel the profoundness of those six weeks on the road that brought his son closer to his father more than the many years that they were together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the story about mafia. Everyone could have many interpretations about their life. The life maybe good for someone, or bad for another one. So, that was making the film started by these words, "There're many stories about Michael Sullivan" (Tom Hanks). His son has the same name. The story tells by the son.Michael Sullivan has two boys, Michael and Peter. Michael is the older one, an ugly boy; Peter is a good and diligent one. Sometime Peter asked to Michael what are the jobs of his father. Michael doesn't know correctly what to say. He just explains that his father do the job from John Rooney (Paul Newman), the boss of mafia. The question makes him want to know what is the truly job of his father.The conflict began at the funeral of Denny Mc Govern. His brother, Finn McGovern, after his speech, says statement that was making John Rooney angry. His statement look like reveals that John Rooney was the killer of his brother. To make this problem clear, John Rooney sent Connor Rooney (Daniel Craig), his son and Michael. Connor Rooney make a mistake: he kills Finn. He shouldn't do that because his father wants to keep Finn as friend.There's one thing makes Connor Rooney jealous to Michael. It looks at the moment when Michael Sullivan and John Rooney playing piano together. The notes are simple and serene. This flick show that they were has a good relationship, like father and son. The relationship doesn't belong between John and Connor. It makes Connor want to kill Michael sometime, using his friend's help. Connor kills Michael's wife and Peter himself.Michael Sullivan and his son, escaped from the plan of Connor to kill them. They go to Perdition. The road to Perdition became a great story for Michael Sullivan, Jr. Finally, he knows exactly what are his father jobs. One of them was rob the bank. He likes that.Connor sent Harlem Maguire (Jude Law), a photographer to kill Michael. Jude Law has a good performance in this character. He plays a killer who has another job as a photographer. Before or while someone he kills going to die, he took a picture and published it on pres.The road to Perdition by this father and son shows us to understand about father-son relationship. They became closer. The son knows the father deeply than before. The other important message by this movie is vengeance. I remember what Hattori Hanzo said in Kill Bill (Volume 1) that vengeance is like the forest -- if you go inside, you don't know the way out. This was happen to Michael Sullivan.Everyone have a memory about someone. Sullivan, Jr. has his own memory about his father. After his father death, people still asking what his opinion about his father. The life of Michael Sullivan maybe good for someone or bad for another one. But, Sullivan Jr. has one only answer: "He was my father."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is the only film I have seen in a picture theatre where I was the only one there. It was good to sit back and relax and enjoy the beauty that was Sam Mendes classic. It was a little sad though that no one else was there to see it. It is always good to see a film with other people to judge a reaction.I recently bought a surround sound system and Road to Perdition was one of the first films I watched on it. I forgot what a brilliantly shot film this is. Mendes deserved an Oscar for this. More so than for the mediocre American Beauty.The first thing I noticed about this film was how in contrast it was to other Hollywood movies. This is filmed like a movie from the thirties and forties. There is no rapid camera movements. There is no quick cutting and jolting effects that give you sea-sickness every time you view it. Most of the time Sam Mendes camera never moves. The only times it does is when the short (never overlong) bursts of action occur. Even then the camera sweeps slowly giving an almost slow motion effect.The cinematography in my opinion has to be the best in film history. And that's saying something. Every frame is meticulously detailed and perfectly lit. Nothing is done half-arsed.The acting is brilliant. Not overdone and everyone works off of each other instead of trying to out-ham one another. Tom Hanks is always good as is Paul Newman and Daniel Craig. Jude Law however, proves that he's not just a pretty boy actor. He plays the part of the slimy photographer with absolute perfection. He should have garnered an Oscar nod at least for this performance.Everything else like costumes, art direction and music were pulled off with the highest degree of excellence. What I liked about this film was how art and technology came together in such a well-honed amalgam. Sam Mendes surrounded himself with the best technicians in the business. However, story was never compromised. The narrative moved along at the right pace and not once did you stop to think how beautifully this was put together. It was only when the final credits rolled did you understand that you were witness to film history.I am a big fan of mafia and gangster movies (The Godfathers, Goodfellas, Donnie Brasco,The Untouchables, Gangs of New York, Copland, Scarface) and there are few films that blend art and technology so well (The Godfather, Star Wars, Raiders, The Lord of the Rings, Pulp Fiction). I have recently seen Sam Mendes' Jarhead and he truly is a visionary filmmaker. I hope he reigns long in the business and I can't wait for his next film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Road to Perdition is an exceptional film - one of the best I have seen - and I would highly recommend it. The photography is outstanding, as is the musical score and the acting. Paul Newman is excellent and Tom Hanks is inspired. The young actor playing Tom Hanks' son is particularly impressive, being only 13 at the time of filming. The quality of the film is reflected as much in what is not said as in the dialogue. The direction and photography combined ensure that each scene is close to perfect. Scrupulous attention is paid to the smallest detail. For example cloth was specially woven for the costumes to ensure that they are authentic for the period. I have awarded the film a well deserved 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The narrative of 'Road to Perdition' follows Michael Sullivan, father of two and a hit man for the mob. Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) keeps his work and private life separate. However, when these two worlds unintentionally collide resulting in the murder of his wife and son, he decides he has to revenge the crime whilst protecting his remaining son Michael Jr. from the mob. The title of the film, 'Road to Perdition', symbolises the path that the father is travelling along towards his damnation since the word 'Perdition' denotes hell, where the soul is damned for eternity.The main theme explored by director Sam Mendes, is the relationship between father and son. Mendes develops the theme of parental protection through this relationship and the fact that a parent will do anything to protect their child and keep them safe from harm. A scene that visually represents this theme is when Michael Sr. covers up his gun with his coat to prevent his son from getting a good look at it.Mendes also explores this theme from the viewpoint of his son. Michael Jr. respects his father and this is depicted in a scene at the start of the film when, instead of entering his father's room, he remains at a distance on the upstairs landing in order to ask his father to come to dinner. This respect is further reinforced through the dialogue when Michael addresses his father as 'Sir'.The image of the good and moral man that Michael Jr. had believed his father to be is shattered when he discovers what his father does for a living. Michael Sr. tells his son never to tell anyone what he has witnessed and this authority is emphasised by the camera adopting Michael Jr.'s point of view at a low angle. However, the need for Michael Jr. to continue to have a morally righteous father figure is symbolised by him reading a Lone Ranger comic book, where the Lone Ranger represents the perfect moral role model; righteous and just and which is in contrast to how he now views his own father.The acting in 'Road to Perdition' includes some strong performances, with Tom Hanks and Paul Newman standing out as Michael Sullivan and John Rooney respectively. The editing is visually representative of the collision of two worlds and is achieved through the use of crosscutting which works to good effect.The music used in 'Road to Perdition' is classical and therefore for the most part un-intrusive, which allows the audience to concentrate on the well-constructed narrative. The only time the soundtrack is noticeable is when it switches from non-diegetic to diegetic and an example of this switch is when Michael Sullivan is playing a duet on the piano with John Rooney.'Road To Perdition' has a well-crafted narrative, exploring themes that strike a cord with every member of the audience, and is a testament to the tender direction of Sam Mendes and the superb acting of Tom Hanks and Paul Newman.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I believe that the reason that I love this movie so much, is because like a lot of gangster movies, this one is real. You have probably read the summary of the movie, and so I will just give my thoughts about the movie. When the young Michael wants to find out what his father is doing, he doesn't realize what kind of Pandora's box he'll open. Him seeing his father and the idiot son kill that guy realizes that his father is not the perfect man that he thought he was, and he can see why his dad wanted to keep the work he did away from his son. This mistake on both Michael's part and his father's part got the mother and brother killed. Mike Sr. goes after the people responsible and give's them their due. However, in the end like the mistakes we make, comes back to get him. Mike Sr. dies in the end, and Michael Jr. is left alone in the world. Most people hate real life stuff, because they want to get away from the pain that reality brings, but I love these types of movies because it makes me believe that life is not the way we want it.</fullReview>

I have nothing but praise for it and it will stay with me for a long time. I rarely have avoided a film for so long and then kicked myself for not seeing it so much sooner. Gangster movie it is not. I cant describe it as fabulous because the film is painful to watch in a bitter sweet way. The score is also impeccable It has to be seen. But you wont forget it for years, if ever. The acting is superb, the setting excellent, the atmosphere so accurate to be flawless. How this film missed a whole line of Oscars I will never know because it stands head and shoulders over almost everything I have ever seen. You wont be disappointed but watch it alone if you get emotional.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A much-overlooked film, superbly done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't understand why this movie didn't get more attention than it did. For my money, it was pretty much perfect. The look of the movie was exactly right. It was very stylish, full of all the elements we want to see in a gangster movie, but it didn't rely on style alone. There was plenty of substance to make an interesting story we haven't seen before.The key to the movie was having a kid that could act to play Michael Jr. This movie would have fallen on its face with a lot of child actors, but Tyler Hoechlin does a great job. He's young enough that we feel bad for him being exposed to his father's world, but he's mature enough to deal with it well.Hanks and Newman give perfect performances. There is a lot more to their performances than just their speaking parts. Scenes like the piano duet at Rooney's house are priceless, even though not a word is spoken.Visual and audio elements are handled extremely well. For instance, when Mike (Hanks) finally takes down Rooney (Newman) and his men, a lot of movies would have had a huge shootout with loud gunshots, blood splatter effects and closeups of the characters firing their weapons. Here, on the other hand, we just see the muzzle flare of Mike's gun in the darkness. Everybody in the scene knows what's going on, and so do we, and the film lets muted sounds and visuals tell the story. Then after Mike and Rooney have their final conversation, the gunfire is extremely loud as Rooney dies, reminding the audience this is serious violence, not just eye candy.I can't find much to complain about in this movie. Thomas Newman's music is too much like his score from "The Shawshank Redemption". Don't get me wrong, it's great, it's just maybe a little too familiar. There are also some possible errors, but not big ones. For instance, the Sullivan's car is extremely shiny when they arrive in Chicago, even though they've been driving on dirt roads in the rain for days. Maybe they washed it in the suburbs somewhere.All in all, a classic that can easily be watched again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually Stunning Gangster Set Pieces</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Road to Perdition" is an unrelievedly dark and violent gangster movie; all the talk of the off-screen murders didn't prepare me for the high body count.It explicitly references "Godfather" and the Coens' "Miller's Crossing" both visually and plot-wise, with a different emphasis, on another son named Michael's reaction to growing up in a violent family business.Like "Godfather," there's an ethnic celebration -- here, macabrely, a wake instead of a wedding, and a particular revenge murder mise en scene. The Irish-American milieu is like "Miller," plus the surrogate father and son confrontation and do-the-right-thing motivation; the bowler hat is no longer floating on the wind but is firmly on a spooky Jude Law's head (who also figures in a confusing plot point that evidently wasn't in the graphic novel the film is based on). Most like the Coens is that the cinematography, by Conrad Hall, almost overwhelms the actors with its striking beauty and breathtaking set-pieces, but Tom Hanks and Paul Newman prevail, and some of the gorgeous sets are real locations not back lots.I'm probably the only one other than Daniel Craig's family who went to see the movie for him, and director Sam Mendes really appreciates his craggy face and solid body language in creating a non-stereotypical villain.Unfortunately, unlike the other two films, no woman gets more than two lines so the testosterone is a bit over the top.Thomas Newman's music is inoffensively vaguely period and Irish.(originally written 7/14/2002)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some nice touches, but these don't save an uneven and ultimately syrupy gangster flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I didn't see this on the big screen but on the TV screen with an interruption every 30 minutes for adverts. I admit that is not the best way to view a film, and maybe I'm therefore being more negative than I might have been if I had managed to see this at the cinema. Nevertheless, given the cast, the cinematography, and the efforts that went into recreating the depression-era US I found this a hugely disappointing effort.My main problem was that the pace and feel were so uneven. It begins promisingly enough as a conventional gangster flick seemingly studying the relationship between Paul Newman's character, his real son played by Daniel Craig, and his surrogate son played by Tom Hanks. But all too suddenly, and before the relationships between the characters have been fleshed out properly, the film tips into a tale of family murder and revenge. Later it turns into a light-hearted road movie when Hanks begins robbing money from the mob with his 12-year-old son acting as getaway driver. The ending is tragic, sentimental, and also highly implausible.The problem with The Road to Perdition is that is really doesn't know what sort of film it wants to be. It's a great shame considering some of the talent that went into it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Majestic and brilliant.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It comes as a surprise to me that not a lot people like this film and that it isn't mentioned as a classic in much the same way that Sam Mendes' first movie, American Beauty, is, because in my opinion (and I loved American Beauty it has to be said), Road to Perdition is a much more satisfying and more moving experience. In an era when gangster or crime movies are much more modern and full to the brim with four lettered words and obscene acts of violence, Road to Perdition is almost an old fashioned film. Superficially it recalls the gangster movies of the thirties (it does take place in the 1930's after all), the type of film you would see Bogart and or Cagney in, but the script is more in line with what you would have got from Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola as well as Sergio Leone, as it recalls very much films like The Godfather and Once Upon A Time In America with its complex character motivations and almost Shakespearian-esquire sense of tragedy and drama. Even the visuals are similar. One sequence has Michael Sr and Michael Jr (played by the wonderful double act of Tom Hanks and Tyler Hoechlin) seeking refuge in a home owned by a couple who are only too happy to take them in and the lighting is almost an orange color in the interior shots, almost in such a way that one cannot help but think of The Godfather trilogy.This being Sam Mendes there is a lot more going on here than just a film about gangsters. It is a wonderful story of fathers and sons, regret and a message that one should always love their family when they have one because you never know when it could all change. Even better is that Mendes and screenwriter David Self manage to tell this story without ever going into the realms of sentimentality. The emotional impact of the movie is kept raw and real, so much so in the final moments, which I won't reveal here. The casting likewise is on the money. Tom Hanks has never, I repeat, never been better than he is here, his performance controlled and at a distance. Forget Forrest Gump and Philadelphia, this is the film which contains his best performance. Likewise Paul Newman. Watching him here makes you regret that this legend doesn't do more movies in this day and age and then there is Tyler Hoechlin. This is a child actor with real grit and edge and never once, like many child actors nowadays (stand up Haley Joel Osmond), does his performance feel like a performance, it feels real.I love this film so much, I think it's a shame that it isn't as regarded as highly as it should be as everyone puts it work that is so good. Special mention must also go to Thomas Newman (one of my favorite composer) and Conrad Hall, photographing his last film, whose works is also up to an impossibly high standard. If you have still to watch this film, please do, you won't regret it. Just make sure you have a box of hankies ready, as you'll need them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh yes, a great movie. I love the cast - old Paul Newman is perfect in his role, as is Tom Hanks and the perfidious Jude Law. Tyler Hoechlin - well, I was stunned by his performance. He has a substantial role in the movie and bears the emotional and psychological burden. It is a movie dealing with fathers and sons, with justice and injustice, with retaliation and atonement. The setting is outstanding, the depiction of the genre and the contemporary atmosphere needs to be applauded. You feel like being there, in the dark, gloomy 30s. I like Paul Newman's line: "This is the life we chose, the life we lead. None of us will see heaven." Wonderful accomplishment. Recommended</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Style over story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of "Road To Perdition" is interesting, fresh and captivating, yet it feels to me that the director, Mr. Sam Mendes, wanted to combine and explore too many things at once. I just never really got what the story as such was about, not that it was too complex, far from it, it just didn't pull me into its world. In the end everything kind of falls into place, but the movie would have worked better had the main part of the story been more in the foreground. All this, however, is more than compensated with a very unique and powerful style of the whole movie. The cinematographer, the late Conrad L. Hall, works wonders with the sets and at times makes even the people that don't care much for art think to themselves how absolutely beautiful some shots look. The scene with those mobsters getting shot one by one in the rain is so rich with perfection it alone was well worth the Oscar for best cinematography. The score by Thomas Newman just makes the acting, the camera and everything else work to the max. An exceptionally well crafted movie, which is a true visual feast. The actors do a good job, but the story is almost second-nature here.8/10Recommendations: anybody who's into great cinematography, sensually rich movies or just wants to see an above average Hollywood movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Road to Perdition has an exceptional soundtrack!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie. There is very little wrong with it at all, in my opinion. However, I want to briefly state my thoughts about the music in Road to Perdition.Does anyone else feel like this is some of the best music they've ever heard in a movie? I seriously have trouble thinking of an original score that I like even nearly as much. The Last of the Mohicans comes to mind, but I think Thomas Newman's work is somewhat more complete (or said another way, their are more tracks that are exceptional). I recognize that the theme is fairly pervasive throughout virtually all the songs, but I don't think what the music lacks in variety detracts from the beauty and power of the soundtrack. What do you guys think? Ah God! I sometimes get a pleasant shuddering in my back and face that starts with the upper spine and tingles outward when I listen to this stuff. It's almost orgasmic! I'm absolutely smitten!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb visuals; ordinary script (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Road to Perdition is quite a simple film and rather sentimental too, but despite its shortcomings, it still works. And it works because it's so well made ? the photography is absolutely magnificent, the music is superb and it has a wonderful sense of time and place. It's just a pity that it doesn't have much depth.The main theme of the story is relationships between fathers and sons. Fair enough, it's as worthy of exploration as anything else. But although it's an interesting idea to place such a story within a gangster film, there just isn't enough meat to it. Really all you have is one father blindly sticking behind his son (Newman's John Rooney begrudgingly supporting Daniel Craig's Connor) while another (Tom Hanks' Michael Sullivan) tries to avenge the death of his wife and youngest child. It's that simple. Sure there's one scene where Newman strikes Connor and then embraces him (it seems like all Connor wanted was a hug and a bit of attention from his old man; that's why he was stealing and killing) and there's a bit of bonding between Michael and Michael Junior, but once Hanks and son are on the road, nothing much changes.It's especially disappointing because the set-up promises lots of conflicted interests. Rooney sees Michael as more of a son than Connor and Connor is jealous. So Connor exerts his power and tries to get his father's attention. But once Connor goes through with killing Michael's family, neither he nor Rooney's character develop. They just blindly stick together. And although there's a scene where Michael and Rooney talk, and although Rooney occasionally expresses his regret as regards the situation, it feels like lip service. Both characters are rigid. One's going to blindly protect; one's going to unblinkingly kill.What character development there is in the film is mainly limited to Michael and Michael Junior, and although some of it is quite touching, some of it also quite sappy. On the positive side you have some nice scenes where Michael is teaching his son to drive, a good moment when Michael Junior gives his dad a quick hug that has a pleasing sense of affection and awkwardness, and the humorous robbery montage. On the negative side you have some overly sentimental stuff with the farmer and his wife (is it wise to give people mob money?) and a final voice-over that is a little bit treacly.However, I do like the ending. (Not the absolute ending, but the scene in the house.) Sure it's obvious that Michael is going to die and sure it follows movie law (the sinner must pay with his life but redeem himself with his final breath), but it's just beautifully shot. I love the way that the music, when Michael looks out of the window, is pulled out and the way that sound of the waves takes over. You know what's going to happen. You know he's going to get shot. But Mendes is smart enough to know that the audience knows and so he builds the tension with the stunning visuals and the tranquil sound of the waves; the shooting is more violent because everything is so peaceful. And although the message behind Michael's final action is a little trite ? he saves his son's soul by ensuring that his son doesn't have to kill ? it works completely. I just wish the final voice-over weren't so overly sentimental. I guess people want to know that his son is going to be okay, but it doesn't need the treacle on top.And another minor gripe is the way that gangsters are portrayed in the film. They're all so noble. I mean, aside from psychos like Connor and Maguire, everyone acts in a dignified, philosophical way (even Capone's right hand man). In reality they were, and still are, ruthless, cold-blooded parasites. I very much doubt they were as reasonable and high-minded as the people here. But like I say, that's a minor gripe. After all, the film is based on a comic book. (Oops. I mean, 'graphic novel.') Where the film excels, though, is in the visuals. I don't think there are as many films that are as beautiful. My favourite shot has to be one of the opening moments in Chicago ? there's a bit where Michael and son are walking along the street and there is nothing but hats. It's a great shot. And then there's the shot of the kid surrounded by people reading the newspaper as he reads his Lone Ranger story. It has an added impact because amongst all these people the kid is realising the enormity of what has happened and that his father isn't the clean cut hero that he thought he was. I also like the scene where Michael finally takes revenge. Everything, quite rightly, is kept silent to focus on the emotion of the scene rather than the blood and guts, and the way that it's shot is quite abstract and otherworldly. Michael, at that moment, is unstoppable. He's almost like a ghost. And the final moments between Rooney and Michael are excellent ? everything is really said with their eyes. It's just a little frustrating that Hanks and Newman didn't have a better script to work with. Had that been the case, Road to Perdition could have been truly great instead of being merely very good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Of fathers and sons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Filmed and edited in a beautiful, classic way with plenty of symbols embedded in the visuals, this is a movie that will thrill anyone who has ever toyed with a camera or just enjoy the art of photography. Gangster Hanks is forced on the run with his young son, a journey linked to another father-son relationship, namely that of Gangster boss Newman and his semi-insane offspring who is jealous of the affection that his father shows Hanks. The story could easily have been told in a very sentimental and melodramatic way, but instead Sam Mendes sticks to a very precise and at times cold (though not cold-hearted) mode of storytelling. This makes it all the more powerful to me, but my girlfriend thought she lacked a point of identification for the same reason. The movie shares the combination of harsh violence and a theme of protecting childhood in a mad adult world with Luc Besson's "Leon", and perhaps the melancholy and portrayal of understanding between mortal enemies with Michael Mann's "Heat". Perhaps not terribly original but extremely well crafted on all levels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>another great movie from Mendes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Micheal Sullivan is a hit-man for John Rooney. Sullivan has worked for Sullivan half his life. He see Rooney as a father figure for himself, as Micheal didn't have a father. Connor Rooney is searching for his fathers respect, but is jealous of Micheal, as John treats Micheal more of a son than he does towards Connor.When Connor kills a man while on a job with Sullivan, his son Micheal sees the event and loses trust in his father. With twisting of words, Connor kills Sullivan's wife and other son peter, and tries to assassinate Sullivan and Micheal.Rooney puts Connors into protection under Frank Nitti in Chicago. Sullivan follows, but Nitti sends out a hit-man - Maguire to kill Sullivan.This is a great gangster/mafia film. What makes it different though is the mix of family drama. Micheal tries to understand his father, but he still sees Sullivan as a very distant man. Sullivan loses faith in the Rooney, his father figure and Connor tries to win his fathers love back away from Sullivan. There is a real complex father message that runs through this film. Every son wants their father to help and guide them, but what happens when they cant and we see them as the flawed humans they are.Once again Mendes out does himself. His direction is flawless. All the detail he places is wonderful, and is enhanced by his use of widescreen. The cinemaphotography is so lush and vibrant. The use of dark heavy colours enhance the mood of danger and the dark world of the mafia. Mendes does a great job of bringing the 1930's to the screen. The sets are detailed, lush, and the costumes are just so well done.Another part that makes this movie so great is the music score. Thomas Newman is such a gifted composer. He can mix new-age sounds with historical music and create something so wonderful. The use of violins were used to their greatest potential, lifting all the drama to a much higher level.All the acting is perfect. This is one of Tom Hanks best roles. Paul Newman is great as the leader of the Irish mafia. Tyler Hoechlin as Micheal Jr is a stand out though. He brought such strength and sympathy to his character.This is a great watch. Deep, dark and very dramatic. You can't help but shed a tear at the end of this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overall, recommended. Though I really wished it wasn't Tom Hanks who played Mike Sullivan. His steely hit-man look is achieved by furrowing his eyebrows. Should I be convinced that this is the look of a guy who's been killing people all his life? Let's face it. Tom Hanks make his characters likable. That's his thing, his gift. And it was totally wrong for this movie. This movie should have been like dark chocolate--bitter, dark, mysterious, with a tinge of sweetness. Instead, with casting of Tom Hanks, it became a milk chocolate--with a biteful of aluminum wrapper on the teeth to go with it.Otherwise, it was quite good in many aspects. The camera work is done beautifully--the way scenes flow, it's difficult to remain unimpressed. There is also one striking scene which everything that happens is seen through between Mike Sullivan's two feet. The look of the film, created by the use of light and shadows, dark and neutral color tones, are visually satisfying. The score is quite good, although it doesn't quite hit the mark in some scenes. The main score is one of my favorites in film.Good supporting cast--Paul Newman was great as the crime boss. Jude Law plays a slimy, balding hit-man with a taste for taking photos of those recently deceased from violent crimes.As for the other main character, the kid playing the son did a decent job. He does not overdo his part, for which I'm quite glad.The story does leave something to be desired. Predictable and hackneyed plot, with pretty weak story development. I have not read the original source material from which this film is based on, but I understand that the film took quite a few liberties with the plot anyway, so you can't really blame the book. But it's not really that bad, especially when you take the whole movie as a package.Just as a side note--keeping in line with the title of the film, it would have been better if the final twist on who killed who did not happen. After all, the kid learned more about his father in those six weeks they spent together than he has ever before--and during those six weeks, all that the father was concerned about was revenge. Not the welfare of his son, but revenge for done deeds. What a lesson for the kid. If the movie was truly about father-son relationships, it would make much more sense to continue the cycle of violence.Bottomline, it was a high 7. Satisfying, solid film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What exactly is the Road to Perdition. It is the road a mafia father must take his son on to get him out of harms way. Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) is a stern yet loving father of two boys, Peter and Michael Jr. But the Sullivan parents hide a dark secret they share with a local grandfather type figure. Sullivan is a member of the Irish Mafia and a hit-man for John Rooney (Paul Newman). After his son Michael (Tlyer Hoechlin) witnesses the murder of a mob boss at the hands of his father and the mad son of Rooney, Connor (Daniel Craig) everything turns bad. After the brutal murder of Sullivans wife and younger son Peter, he must get Michael out of harms way to a town called Perdition. Along the way they begin to drain the mob bosses assets from banks and come upon a dark secret that Connor is hiding.The cinematography is unbelievable. The acting, though out of place with Hanks as a hit-man is still superb. The story is hard to down at first but you soon come to relieve what a man would do to protect his son and enact revenge. Road to Perdition. Starring: Tom Hanks, Tyler Hoechlin, Paul Newman, Daniel Craig, and Jude Law. 4 1/2 out 5 Stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant film, almost but not quite wrecked by miscasting Tom Hanks.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everything about this movie is superb - the script, the cinematography, the music and the performances. An intelligently told tale of redemption and retribution, with the one false note of the excessively "heavenly" Perdition which is the end point of the journey. Unfortunately, the casting of the lead role with Tom Hanks was a major miscalculation that may have caused this film to be less well received than perhaps it ought to be.The basic story is absolutely perfect for creating perpetual dramatic conflict. The ruthless killer, chief hit-man for the Irish mafia no less, suddenly in a position where he has to constantly do what he would otherwise never do - show his love for his family. If you are immediately convinced of the ruthlessness, the cold heartlessness of the man in the performance of his job, he can scarcely do anything in the course of this story which won't surprise the audience and reveal a layer of character. And this is the rub.Tom Hanks already *is* the loving, giving family man, so the only surprise is that he is cast as a dour mob assassin; after that his actions don't surprise at all, since we know Tom Hanks will have a deep-seated love for his son and to do anything and everything to save him. When Hanks arrives at his house and goes upstairs to find his murdered wife and younger son, his heartwrung cry of anguish is nothing less than we would expect from the actor who has never been afraid to show his emotions. But this destroys the character of Michael Sullivan as he is described by the other characters. The only time that Sullivan actually kills someone in a totally ruthless manner, the film chickens out! Maybe it was at Hanks' insistence so as not to look bad for his core audience. But if there was ever a character point which needed spelling out in cold blood, it was when he did indeed "shoot the messenger", having just left his son outside in the car. Instead of which, Mendes had the camera pull in on Hanks's face, censoring the murder he is committing. It should have been shown in the same way as Connor Rooney's (Craig) murder of Finn (Ciaran Hinds): no hesitation and the full uncensored bloody consequences.The end result is that the portion of the film in which Michael Sullivan is getting to know his son Mike Jr. has no impact. Michael Sullivan teaching his kid to drive is Tom Hanks teaching a kid to drive, only without Hanks's customary humour; we're certainly not learning anything new.However, everything else about the film is so good (Newman, of course, money in the bank, and the two Brits - the already established Jude Law and the if-I'm-not-mistaken-soon-to-be-big-in-Hollywood Daniel Craig are both utterly superb; Conrad Hall's valedictory work as dp, here reunited with Paul Newman after shooting him in Butch Cassidy and Cool Hand Luke thirty and more years ago; Thomas Newman's plangent score) that it would be a shame not to see it at least once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heaven, Hell and Tom Hanks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Road to Perdition" is Sam Mendes' take on the graphic novel by Max Allan Collins and Richard Piers Rayner. In it, Tom Hanks stars as Michael Sullivan, a deadly hitman who's also a family man. he fears that his son, Michael, Jr., played by Tyler Hoechlin, will follow his bloody path. Hanks gives a stoic performance here. Other good performances come from Paul Newman as John Rooney, the avuncular crime boss, and Jude Law as an evil crime photographer. The theme of father-son relationships is strong, both seen between Sullivan and his son, and symbolically, in the famed piano duet between Tom Hanks and Paul Newman. The violent story is tempered with beauty in the haunting score by Tom Newman, and the stark imagery, in which bright colors are kept to a minimum. This gangster story is worthy of others such as "The Godfather" and "The Untouchables."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lone Wolf and Cub with tommy guns!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although the original graphic novel and movie contain characters that are based on real people, the story itself is an adaptation of Kazuo Koike and Goseki Kojima's "Kozure Okami", better known the the US as Lone Wolf and Cub. It tells the story of Itto Ogami, samurai and the Shogun's executioner. Ogami is framed as a traitor by a rival clan and his wife is murdered. Rather than commit seppuku, Ogami takes his young son, Daigoro, on the road with him, while he sells his services as an assassin. Ogami searches for his opportunity to gain revenge upon the Yagyu clan, the group that framed him. Daigoro acts as a passive observer, rarely speaking, always watching as his father dispatches assassin after assassin.Spoilers: Here, we have a hitman who has been set up by a rival within a crime family. His wife and child have been murdered and he takes to the road with his surviving son. His son is witness to the brutal life he leads, eventually seeing his father's own death. If you are going to steal, steal from one of the best.Now, the fact that the story isn't exactly original doesn't necessarily make it bad. The story, as told here, is quite good, if somewhat predictable. It also bears a strong resemblance to Miller's Crossing. However, that film is an homage to other gangster films. Thus, many of the same story conventions arise.The film is beautifully shot, and the performances are good. The story is a bit incomplete; but, having never read the graphic novel, I have no idea how much was left out of the film. It is a fine work, if a bit predictable. I don't think it's the greatest gangster film to come along; but, it is a fine addition to the pantheon.Sam Mendes keeps the film focused on the relationships, which keeps the film from devolving into pulp. The actors are all first rate, although Tom Hanks isn't entirely believable as a hitman. He doesn't really have that aura of menace that Deniro or Michael Caine brought to their performances in gangster films. Still, his relationship with the son works well enough that you can forgive his lack of menace.Ultimately, this is a fine film worth viewing, but not quite a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After liked very much "American Beauty" I had great expectations about this film. Obviously, I didn't expect an American Beauty 2 kind of movie, I like directors who makes different kind of films. But, after watching it, I felt kind of disappointed. Don't get me wrong, I think that Sam Mendes made a good work, but the problem was in the script. It has very good acting, an excellent cinematography and some interesting scenes, but I could figure out most of the scenes before they happen. Even the end (no, I'm not gonna spoil it), a couple of minutes before I thought "Now, this is what is going to happen... blablabla...", and so it was. Surely I'll go to see the next Mendes flick, but when I came to compare between "American..." and "Road to...", the first one takes a lot of advantage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i'd first like to say that i have great respect for tom hanks as an actor. i can honestly say that until today i have not seen a tom hanks movie that i haven't enjoyed; i would also like to add that i really enjoyed mendes' first film 'American Beauty', which in my opinion ranks up there in my top-ten list of all-time faves; i didn't in any way feel the same about road to perdition.my main problem with the film was that it didn't go anywhere fast. it focussed more on the development of father and son's relationship than it did on the story itself. now dont get me wrong, i wholly approve of getting a better understanding of a character's state of mind, and i enjoy seeing the way a character progresses during a film, but when it came to this movie, the character's felt very two dimensional to me, so-much-so that as the film approached it's end, i felt nothing for the characters, and frankly, didn't care what happened to them. it was almost as if they were never there.my opinion of this film would have probably been far greater if the people responsible had only opened up the story a bit more, and not concentrated so much on developing a relationship, which, by the end of the film hadn't really developed at all (a huge shame when you bear in mind the wonderful job mendes did with spacey's character in 'american beauty'.)putting character development aside though, i must admit there were aspects of the film which i did appreciate. for starters i really liked the cinematography of the film, it had a visual style which i can't fault, and, as ever tom hanks was on top form in what was a very peculiar role for him.but, unfortunately the positive elements of rtp were majorly out-weighed by it's negative aspects. i felt the film was a real let-down and very much a case of style over substance, which is a huge shame because it had an amazing amount of potential (great director, great cast, great cinematography) ,it's just a pity that it couldn't deliver the goods in what could've been a real winner of a movie.3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Am I the only one who's tired of seeing Tom Hanks in these movies? Don't get me wrong, Road to Perdition is a visually stunning movie, and some of the performances (Paul Newman) were quite good, but Tom Hanks just plays his role as the "Everyman" persona that he's come to master. Be it Road to Perdition, Saving Private Ryan, Castaway or the Green Mile, Tom Hanks is always playing the same character, the likeable, kind of funny, day to day nice guy. In short, he's playing himself, Tom Hanks. Personally, I'm tired of it. Not that I don't like him, but if he was a friend, I think we'd be getting to the phase where I don't really call him anymore. It's not that I don't like him, it's just that I'm kind of tired of hanging out with him. If he makes another "Philadelphia", I might call sometime.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The elements are there, but this is not your usual gangster movie. The usual violence is overlayed with a sadness, of being trapped on a road one cannot get off of. The music score reinforces and elevates this mood in a way the acting alone would not have done. The score is haunting and effective. Tom Hanks feels no choice but to seek retribution for the unusual twist the plot takes early on, and from there on out it is a sad road he follows.Hanks is very effective in his role, as are Paul Newman and Tyler Hoechlin. Fans of Hanks and Newman will not want to miss their portrayals.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rating: 8 out of 10. Directed by Sam Mendes.Many movie lovers think of Tom Hanks as one of the best actors ever, I have never felt this way about him, in my opinion, he just does not rank up there with actors such as Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, and Robert Duvall. However, my opinion of Tom Hanks has changed after seeing 'Road to Perdition'. I thought he was awesome as Michael Sullivan in this movie. I'd prefer to see Tom Hanks in roles like this one instead of what he usually portrays.'Road to Perdition' has top notch acting, in addition to Tom Hanks, Paul Newman as mob boss John Rooney is quite good as well, Newman was nominated for a best supporting actor academy award for this role. Jude Law as the assassin Maguire was dark, strange, and disturbed, yet interesting to watch. It is nice to see Stanley Tucci as mob figure Frank Nitti, Tucci did a very good job playing this character.As a mob movie 'Road to Perdition' is quite good, but not as grand as Coppola's 'The Godfather' or Scorsese's 'Goodfellas'. Sam Mendes did a great job directed this film and perhaps one day will be up there with Coppola and Scorsese as a top crime drama director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful, but never soars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, an admission -- most gangster movies bore me. They really do. The Godfather? Yawn. Godfather II? Hmmm....wonder if dinner is ready yet? Goodfellas? I've got some paint to watch dry. Its not a universal with me, but close enough.But I liked this movie, and I think that its success or failure has little to do with the whole gangster/mob genre of movies. Rather than a gangster movie filled with unrelatable lowlifes with odd aspirations, its really more of a conventional tragedy with people wearing 1930's gangster garb, but who are working off of very human emotions that the audience can easily grasp.Throw in beautiful cinematography and some excellent performances by a top cast, and you have the makings of a good film. If I had a complaint it would just be that the movie never seemed to really take off. It was pretty, moody, well-acted and had a lot to recommend it, but it was also just a little TOO well mannered, and the dialogue rarely sparkled. Some of the best acting in the movie came when the actors were acting with a look or an expression, rather than through the actual spoken words, and it wasn't until some late exchanges between Hanks and Newman that it really grew powerful. Combined with the deliberate pacing, this left the movie feeling a little flat at times, and I suspect that your average action junkie will have a hard time mustering the patience to sit through the film. That's his/her loss though -- its a good one, if not necessarily an all-time classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is only one word needed to describe Road to Perdition..... AMAZING. Alot of gangster movies have gun fights that steal the show but Road to Perdition has some of the best acting I've ever seen. I thought nothing was going to contend with The Godfather or Goodfellas but Road to Perdition can be put aside the movies and not be overlooked. Thats not to say that Road to Perdition doesnt have exciting gun fights. My favorite would have to be when Mike Sr. is hiding in the shadows and starts killing off John Rooney's men and eventually the big man himself. Tom Hanks and Paul Newman give one of the greatest, if not the greatest performances of their career (up till now). I love the scene when Tom Hanks comes up to Newman and points the machine gun at him. You see the fear in both of their eyes', just as Hanks is about to kill him Newman says "I'm glad its you." That one line just gave goosebumbs. But everybody knows that Newman and Hanks can pull off a great performance but the one that really suprised me was Tyler Hoechiln (Mike Sullivan Jr.) He gave a performance that could stand up to both Newman and Hanks. When he looks at the camera you can see a great wisdom in his eyes that overshadows his age. The Godfather needs no introduction, neither does Goodfellas, but Road to Perdition was what the word "underrated" was created for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sam Mendes' follow-up to fantastically entertaining American Beauty is Road To Perdition, a film set in 1930s USA centred around Mike Sullivan, who works for the Irish mob. First and foremost, it must be said that this movie is beautifully shot and for that, praise should be lavished on Mendes as director and especially, the late Conrad L Hall for his cinematography. As a pair, they obviously had a real understanding and it shows in this piece. Paul Newman's final scene in this movie is fantastic and nobody deserved an Oscar for this more than Conrad!With regards the acting, much was made pre-release of Tom Hanks playing a bad guy. Whether he is actually all that bad is debatable but to be honest, I didn't notice a massive shift in his screen persona. However, he did look slightly uncomfortable which I attributed to the fact that he looked like he'd gained weight for the role. Whilst the press focus may have been on Hanks, it is Newman whose image hangs over the film. Newman is an actor of enormous screen presence and is excellent support as leader of the clan for whom Sullivan works. Kudos should also be given to Jude Law, who as the photographer skulking in the shadows, puts in a creepy, unsettling performance and his menace also hangs over the film. With regard to Sullivan's son - it is hard to judge his performance as one is always loathed to compare child actors. However, he does a good job considering his fellow cast members and is watchable even during emotional scenes where he stays the right side of "butter wouldn't melt".I will admit to being a big fan of Mendes both on film and on stage and that I enjoyed American Beauty immensely so maybe I am a little biased in his favour but I feel that he does an excellent job in creating a world for us (along with Conrad L. Hall) that feels both mythic and real at the same time both through the camerawork, set design and pallette of the piece and that his decisions on shooting from the son's perspective particularly in the early scenes really helps to draw us in to the story and gives an unusual perspective from which to view the film.If I had any concerns about the film, I would say it is a little on the slow side in places and that the Sullivan family feels a little underwritten but all in all, I think this movie is immensely watchable and a beautiful legacy for Conrad L. Hall. Amazing. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm truly sorry, but this film is so calculating, so formulaic, so two-dimensional that it is embarrassing. We're supposed to grow feelings for these characters, except that they are flatter than film stock, and the only growing possible from watching them is that of growing older. We're supposed to believe that the killer Mr. Hanks plays can snuff out human lives like killing weeds, and then turn around and show massive amounts of true compassion and tenderness and affection. As my grandfather used to say, "far-fetched", at best. The trouble starts with the writing -- colorless, predictable, trite, and spreads like an oil slick from there. And I suppose we are all expected to be in awe of the cleverness of the title? Bullpucky. This is a film with so many empty calories that they probably had to feed the crew cardboard cuisine during shooting to avoid dangerous weight gain. Beautifully shot? Closer to the point would be -- shallowly-romanced by an often-acclaimed yet visually over-eager cinematographer in the manner of a deserted island Don Juan with a washed-ashore blow-up doll. Toss in a previously capable director who stood by and watched this 35mm disaster do nothing more than admire its physique in the mirror with his dollar-filled hands stuffed in his proverbial pockets, and you have a very plastic piece of Hollywood-chromed drivel attempting desperately to masquerade as a work of art. The only emotions this film conjured up in me were great disgruntlement (at being used), and great joy (that I was the guest of a friend and didn't have to pay to spend the two hours it took to be greased on through it). They should have called it "Road to Profit" because that is all the meaning it ever had.</fullReview>

Throw in some Japanese "Manga" &amp; "Anime" camera angles then let them go out &amp; make "Road to Perdition".

Several small problems annoy the attentive viewer. The rain on piles of snow would wash it away &amp; frequently the ice cold scenery isn't matched by the breath of the actors, they should fog but don't alway do so. Also any Tommy Gun firing long burst during the elaborate scenes of carnage will smoke like heck, especially in the rain, as they got very hot very quickly. The problem with this film is that drags along at such a slow pace that you have time to examine the scenery in detail as it crawls along the screen.The characters are comic book, two dimensional &amp; the story oh so predicatable. The end scene in the beach house is telegraphed to the point of making me puke. Don't tell me you didn't think that was going to happen! Of course the hero falls just as he attains his freedom!

Hall since the movie "In Cold Blood" and the old 60's series, "The Outer Limits". Mr. Hall is gone now, but this I believe his last work, Road to Perdition would have been bland without it. He added style to this film and that kept my interest throughout. Oscar worthy? You bet and I am so glad he won for this.Tom Hanks, Paul Newman and Jude Law's acting was wonderful as well. (Ah, Paul Newman was GREAT!) In the middle, it did drag for me and yes, they could have easily chopped a good 15 minutes of the film to make it a brilliant in my view, but none the least, don't let that stop you from watching this film. It is good for all the reasons I named above and more.Please, don't pass on this one if for nothing else, to see how important Cinematography can be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>spoilers to follow:of course, it looks beautiful. but too mannered, too airtight. it's raining, when it needs to be. they understand light and shadow (the kid reading by flashlight, the waiting room with the newspaper readers, etc.) as well as composition (too many soullessly contrived symmetrical shots for my taste, though). the action, the sets, the costumes, the camera motions ... all are top notch, expertly chosen and plotted.but for what? I like movies that show me something new and unexpected. this seemed like an uninspired collection of scenes, by someone who understands film grammar. the images are good, but none are powerful. men in overcoats, cut down in the pouring rain? men in suits, sitting around a polished wooden table, lit with soft yellow orange light?there were some good things; the kid looking through the crack of the door, Jude Law. his scenes made the rest of the movie look inferior, almost as if there were two movies. the good one that he was in, and the other one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>perdition: 'the abode of Satan and the forces of evil'; (on that road)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate the subject, but I admire the film. "The Road To Perdition" is an apt title describing the lives of the mob bosses and their men in the 1930s. This film was set during six weeks of the winter of 1931, narrated by Michael Sullivan, young son of Mike Sullivan, played by Tom Hanks. They even used a small prosthetic to make a bump on the bridge of Hanks' nose so that he wouldn't look so cute, and more like someone who had been through his share of fights. Paul Newman is perfect as the mob boss and the father that Hanks never had. With lesser actors, this would have been a very ordinary movie.SPOILERS follow, for my recollection, please read no further. Young Michael, curious, hides in car one night, witnesses a killing, to keep him from talking the boss's son kills Hanks' wife and young son, the wrong son, Hanks and Mike Jr go on the run, Jude Law hired to track them down and kill them, Hanks too smart, begins to take "off the books" mob money from banks, to get mob attention, Newman understands problem but cannot bear to have his problem son whacked, so Hanks wipes out Newman and his bodyguards one night in the rain, leaving no one to protect the problem son, so they let Hanks snuff him also. Hanks and son go to aunt's house on the lake shore, empty, Law is there, shoots Hanks, son walks in with gun, Law walking towards son, Hanks has strength to fire one more shot, Law goes down, Hanks dies, son drives car back to farmhouse where they had stayed for a while, is raised by old childless couple, young Michael never picks up a gun again, does not himself travel the road to perdition.Great cinematography, the DVD picture and sound are first-rate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful capped with wonderful cinematography</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An extraordinary film, beautiful in both its compositions and its acting. The cinematographer, Conrad L. Hall, provides images of rain swept characters; men with deep, sorrowful faces looking from below the rim of their hat, the rain streaking down their long over coats. Aware of their fate, the men look into the shadows at the invisible assassin. Sam Mendes' first film (American Beauty) found simple elegance - a bag, floating in the wind. Here he finds beauty with every camera angle and every shot. Not a scene goes by that we don't admire; a lot of thought has gone into this film. Sam Mendes is clearly a man with an eye for detail. The camera moves majestically from scene to scene, providing us with a truly great visceral experience. Unlike other films with an abundance of style (hello, The Matrix Revolutions), the plaudits don't stop at great camera work. Every actor puts in a magnificent performance as their characters gently brood over the morality of what they do. Tom Hanks plays a hitman (Michael Sullivan) for the local gangster (Paul Newman), a man he has known for a long time; a man he greatly respects. When his son finds out what his father does for a living he is deeply disturbed. It is this rift, between father and son, which dominates most of the film. There is also great sincerity shown between Tom Hanks and Paul Newman. Both the characters and the actors respect one another - the scenes between these two are great to watch. A special mention must also be given to Jude Law, an actor with immense talent. He gives us a character that is hunting Sullivan - a devious, snake-like man. He mooches around, hunched over, looking at us from beneath his brow. He seems to feel nothing, and is undisturbed by the murders he perpetrates. It is the man Sullivan would have been if it were not for the presence of his family.While the story seems all too neatly tied together, and the script somewhat overly pretentious, it is the acting and the cinematography which draw you into the film. It is magnificent to watch and emotional and heart felt throughout. One line sums up ideology of the film: `This is the life we chose, the life we lead. And there is only one guarantee: none of us will see heaven.' Michael Sullivan never pretends to be a good man ? all he wants is a better life for his son; he wants his son to see heaven.For those that care, I gave the film 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If only it was a longer film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film angers me and makes me feel good at the same time. The reason it makes me feel good because it has so many wonderful scenes and the cinematography was more than outstanding but the whole film just swooped by like it never happened. Since seeing the film I have been dying to know what they left on the cutting room floor, because there just wasn't enough scenes in this film for me to enjoy it. Having said that, it is the most darkest gangstar film I am yet to see because the locations were dark, the music is dark and beautifully, and finally it has dark characters, Tom Hanks I think is in the best film role of his life as he genrally seemed like the quiet father figure with a ruthless side to him with no thought for the dead. I didn't like Sam Mendes's first offering American Beauty, so I wasn't to sure what to make of this film, but it left me wondering why people do praise Mendes so much for his work. I admit he has only made I think 2 films and those 2 films have made such an impact on the world but I fail to see what the fuss is about. Road to Perdition is by far his strongest work, but he needs to bring out a longer version, if there is one of course, because this film does have the potiental to become one of the greatest gangstar films of all time but it just needed that little more footage. The deleted scenes I thought were great and should have been included. I have to admit, I seem to fall for any film longer than 150mins. I have an obession with time in films, I prefer them to be longer alsong as they have more development in them of course. Apocalypse Now Redux was just the ticket for those extra scenes and I think Road to Perdition can be the very same, or should I say could have been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>well created movie - not "the godfather" but close</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A good story of a fathers attempt to both "save" his son (on more than one level) and to extract revenge on those who murdered the rest of his family. Examines the developing relationship between Hanks and his son and indirectly compares it to that of Hanks and Newman (Hanks surrogate father). Well acted by Hanks (in an atypical role), Newman (also cast as a rare bad guy) and Jude Law (as the nastiest most amoral of them all). Excellent photography and musical background enhances the film further as does good acting from the support cast. I recommend you hire or buy the DVD as it comes with many extras including the director's commentary which helps one appreciate the level of detail and thought that went into creating this authentic movie of 1930's Chicago. eg did you know that Anthony LaPaglia's scene as Al Capone was deleted? PS: AC/DC's song titled "Highway to Hell" means the same as "Road to Perdition" - just thought that you'd like to know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hanks makes it all worthwhile</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Road to Perdition" is a technical stroke of genius. Sam Mendes directed with great heart, great precision, and great attention paid to every detail. The story, while not as epic in scope as, say, "The Godfather," is strong and compelling. You can't help but watch this movie and get involved in it. People who say it's unemotional or that they felt "detached" from it have been reading too many books about movies; that, or they're big, big fans of the "Scooby Doo" movie.Paul Newman is terrific here; how could he not be. Jude Law provokes chills as the photographer/killer. Tyler Hoechlin is a child actor who can actually act.Another big star is, of course, Conrad Hall, whose cinematography goes beyond words into the realm of the fantastic. This is one of the best LOOKING movies of all time. I would love to have seen it on the screen, but unfortunately, Dreamworks did not release it to many theaters here in Texas. Shame.Which leads us to Tom Hanks. Here is the Great Man, in a great role. Who would have thought the star of "The Man With One Red Shoe" (or, how bout this one, "Bonfire of the Vanities") would go on to become the De Niro of the Nineties, and now the 21st century? Hanks is a movie star on a par with Tom Cruise and Mel Gibson -- no doubt. He took over the Everyman slot once occupied by Kevin Costner and made it his own. But he brings to the role of Michael Sullivan the mythic presence of Harrison Ford, while becoming the character as thoroughly as De Niro became Jake La Motta.I'm tripping over myself to heap praise on Hanks' work in "Road to Perdition." It's deserved. This is a performance to get stupid over. Strong, brooding, powerful, reserved, moral, conflicted, Hanks shows us a man trapped in a job that he hates (think Lester Burnham), a job he's nonetheless very efficient at doing. We believe he can handle firearms, we believe he can kill people, but Hanks never lets us believe he does it for fun. We don't catch him showing off. When Hanks shoots a guy in the head, he does it because he's forced to. When Hanks, as Sullivan, gives you an order, you carry it out because there's the impression that he's slightly more ethical than you are. I don't care that he's a hired gun; Sullivan just has that weighty, unspoken authority.So, even if "Road" weren't excellent on every other level, Hanks would make it well worth seeing. By the way, the movie isn't "slow," but "well paced," which used to mean something in Hollywood, and to audiences. Thanks, MTV!</fullReview>

At first I though "wow he's playing a bad guy", but no he's a bad guy so he can be a good dad. Oh well, more meat than Forest Gump I guess. Paul Newman is flawless as usual, even in his 70's the guy sure can act. I always forget I'm watching Paul Newman. Hanks too. Great acting. The 30's was well recreated and the whole depression feel sure was in the air (as it were). Tyler Hoechlin has a great career ahead of him. He nailed his role.

		<fullReview>"Road to Perdition" is without a doubt one of the most beautifully constructed films ever made. The film deserves to be mentioned in the same league as "The Godfather" due to it's flawless acting, cinematography, and score just to name a few. Very rarely have I ever been so taken in by a films tone, which is created by 3 superior artists. These are production designer Dennis Gassner, music composer Thomas Newman, and the late Conrad L. Hall, who photographed the film. Sam Mendes is already well on his way to becoming one of the great directors of his generation and once again he delivers the goods. Even though the storyline isn't particularly strong, "Road to Perdition" is one of those rare films where the artistry more then makes up for it and turns it into one of the most entertaining and thought provoking films of recent times.</fullReview>

After being betraied, Michael must go on the run until he can get his revenge. Also staring is the wonderful Paul Newman (Cool Hand Luke)as Michael's boss and father figure, and Jude Law (A.I.) as a crazy hit-man after both the Michaels.

		<shortDescription>Sensitive, beautiful, absorbing, rewarding, uplifting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Mendes' second film has his welcome hallmarks all over it, and is as absorbing as American Beauty as a result. Courageously and painstakingly adapted, beautifully filmed,thoughtfully cast,impeccably acted, this film is pure class, resting comfortably in the film noir genre that spawned Dial M For Murder, The Big Sleep and Vertigo. If only more directors/producers were brave enough to tackle period pieces like this so honestly.You sense in Mendes' work that there's little in the way of directorial ego at large here; the focus is entirely on the story and the best way to tell it. Leave the CGI and fancy pyrotechcnics to the likes of Cameron and Bruckheimer; this is a simple, almost naive tale about fear and love and the loss of a person's identity to a darker, more powerful force. Tom Hanks' Michael Sullivan is initially something of an engima, refusing to allow the merest chink of familial affection to break through the armour of self-preservation necessary in the more grisly aspects of his job as a hit-man for a small town Irish mob. His development as a father to his bereft, bewildered son is delicately acted and touching; his growing devotion (and surprise at his own behaviour) for his son at total odds with his obsession with revenge. My only criticism is the slow start, but this is crucial to juxtapose the quickening of pace as the tragic pair are forced to go on the run - from a stiflingly Victorian, predictable family life to those of fugitives - this pace seems laboured but it's well worth the wait once the story gets going. Also at times the young actor playing Michael Sullivan Jr. is a touch wooden and his reactions not entirely believable, but this isn't something worth worrying about, it certainly didn't ruin my enjoyment of the movie.The late Conrad Hill's cinematography makes the action an absolute joy to watch. There are key scenes filmed precisely as an affectionate nod to Mendes'and Hill's American Beauty, as well as others, such as the scene outside in the rainy street at night, where seven or so gangsters are murdered, that is simply breathtaking. Visually the film is that impressive that you could still be absorbed with the sound down.Paul Newman's characteristic old-school grace on celluloid, combined with his remarkable interpretation of Rooney as both the benevolent, kindly uncle/ruthlessly violent gangland boss, only adds to the complexity of feelings aroused in the viewer. You can only imagine the rage Sullivan feels at his betrayal after so many years of loyalty to the 'firm' and yet, as the ultimate wiseguy Henry Hill says in Scorcese's Goodfellas: "Your killers come with smiles" - Sullivan realises far too late he has no friends left, that everyone is dispensable. His one wish to spare his son the same tragic fate is granted, however bloodily, and this leaves the viewer with a sense of hope at the end. I would recommend this film to anyone; it's been hammered by the critics but ignore them; this is a masterpiece of cinema. You will not be disappointed. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The theme in Road to Perdition shows that parents will do anything within their power to save their own child from danger.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Note: this review contains a spoiler.Road to Perdition is a mob movie based on revenge and a bringing together of father and son. Tom Hanks stars as Michael Sullivan and Paul Newman plays John Rooney. As with any movie, there is a theme, defined as a central insight. The theme in Road to Perdition shows that parents will do anything within their power to save their own child from danger.The theme for Road to Perdition is evident in almost every scene in one way or another. During the scene at the church (approximately 1 hour and 45 minutes), Tom Hanks confronts Paul Newman in a pew and they move their discussion to the basement for privacy. Hanks informs Newman that his son has been stealing money from him. Newman then confesses to Hanks that he knows that he has been betrayed by his son and he states that, `you are asking me to give you the key to his room so you can walk in, put a gun to his head and pull the trigger. I can't do that.' This is the best scene that shows that a parent will do anything to protect their child. Newman will not give up his son to be killed, even though he knows that Hanks' vengeance will end when the son is dead.Another scene that shows how a parent will protect a child is the scene at the beach house (approx. 2 hours). At the point that Hanks is shot by Jude Law and he is lying on the floor dying, Hanks' son walks in, behind Law wielding a gun. Law turns and tries to coax the gun from the son. The scene pans to Hanks lying on the floor holding the gun that has killed Law. This scene shows that even in his own death, a father will kill to save his child.The lighting used for the basement scene is low key diffused with some high contrast. The lighting appears to come from single overhead bulbs that are evenly spaced on a wire. When the light illuminates the characters, their faces are still enveloped in shadows, as they do not step fully into the light. The use of this lighting in this scene indicates to the viewer that these characters are extremely dangerous and are hiding from the apparent truth. It also indicates that the characters are still in danger and the lighting for this scene is also a foreshadowing of the death that is still to come.During the scene in which Hanks and his son are in the car driving to the beach house, in the town of Perdition, there are bright, vivid colors in contrast to the dark colors throughout the rest of the movie. The use of bright green grass, the red car, the blue water and the tan sand indicates a certain happiness that the characters would feel now that they are out of danger and the boy has been saved from the path of life that his father was afraid he might take. The scene shows that Hanks has done everything in his power to save his son from the mobster life.Road to Perdition shows several times, in many different ways, that a parent will do anything to save their child from danger, even death. The theme of Road to Perdition is extremely important to the way the film was shot. Each scene is shot with the indication that the father is trying to save the boy's life by using his `talents' as a mobster. In doing so, Hanks is freeing his son from the mob lifestyle, thus giving the boy the opportunity to be a better person than he was himself.Overall, I enjoyed this movie and recommend it for those who enjoyed the 'Godfather' trilogy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ties between fathers and sons.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Hanks plays the role of a lifetime in Road to Perdition. A story of the ties between fathers and sons when fathers put them in uncompromising situations. Hanks plays Mike Sullivan an early nineteen hundreds hit man working for mob boss Mr. John Rooney played by Paul Newman. When young Michael Sullivan witnesses Conner Rooney, played by Daniel Craig, and his father kill a man this story takes a tragic toll that leads us through a winding road of deception and loyalty. David Self, plays on the sons of the movie as they watch their fathers in every aspect of life. He uses this motif to display to the audience, the needs the sons' have for acceptance and love from their fathers. As Hanks takes his young son on a journey to seek out his former employers son, we see the dynamics of these relationships unfold. As in The Godfather, Newman sends his son away to seek protection although we wonder if Hanks is more of a son than Craig. The movie moves along with much muted color. In almost every scene, there is one small trace of green representing the envy between Craig and Hanks. In the end, we see the vibrant blue of the ocean bringing us hope and full circle. This dynamic cast teaches us the troubles of fatherhood, and the innocence of every heart. All though many men become their fathers, it is the sons' choice to choose their own paths. Hanks and Newman have a bond as two fathers but also a father and his son. Newman states:" Sons are put on this earth to trouble their fathers."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an interesting film about an enforcer for an Irish mobster during the early Thirties who by circumstance finds himself on the run with his surviving son after his family is murdered.Tom Hanks is Mike Sullivan, an enforcer for John Rooney, played by Paul Newman. Each of these veteran actors turns in a superlative performance. Hanks is sullen and loyal to his chosen profession, but as he runs from the killer sent after him by the mob he begins to bond with his son and faces the reality that he hasn't been a very good father. Fatherhood also comes into play for Paul Newman, who suffers because of the deeds of his own reckless son. Connor Rooney is the one who has killed Mike Sullivan's family to cover up for a shooting witnessed by the Sullivan boy. Newman is menacing as the local boss, but also human as he struggles with his own mistakes of fatherhood and his admiration and loyalty to Hanks' character.Jude Law plays the killer sent after Tom Hanks, and he is very good in the role. His character also doubles as a crime scene photographer in an odd twist. He plays the part of a contract killer with chilling effectiveness.This movie tells an interesting story and the acting is superb all around. Sam Mendes, the director, has achieved an excellent follow-up to "American Beauty," which incidentally (maybe), also dealt with fatherhood and immortality.I have only one slight reservation, and it may seem petty, but the score was almost a direct rip-off of the music from "The Shawshank Redemption" (not surprising since Thomas Newman did both). Since the theme appeared throughout the film, it was a bit annoying to me. Even the ending, which took part along a beach, was reminiscent (sort of) of that other film.Very good film and I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

Paul Newman and Tom Hanks give out a hell of a show, and Tom Hanks is certainly one of the most intelligent and talented actors i have seen. Paul Newman is charming, and judging by this movie- he only get better as the years go by. 8/10 in the Abby Parker scale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Irish mafia isn't given nearly as much screen time as their Sicilian cousins. For every Miller's Crossing there are three Godfathers; a Sopranos for every Grifters. Road to Perdition sees Tom Hanks as Michael Sullivan, personal `Angel of Death' for Irish mob-boss John Rooney (Paul Newman). Sullivan, an orphan, had been raised as Rooney's son, and carved a nice Norman Rockwellian life for himself, his wife and two kids. Each morning he has breakfast with his family in their lovely country home, before heading off to work to intimidate and kill Rooney's enemies. Unbeknownst to Sullivan, his oldest son (Tyler Hoechlin) tags along on one of these missions, and sees exactly what his father does for a living. In a misguided effort to silence the boy Rooney's son kills Sullivan's wife and youngest boy. Revenge and the safety of his surviving son motivate Sullivan to hit the road. Road to Perdition is beautifully rendered look at 1930s depression era America. Director Sam Mendes has stayed true to the story's graphic novel roots, and dishes up a spectacular looking film, one so finely detailed you can almost smell the gunpowder and smouldering cigarettes.

		<fullReview>The Irish mafia isn't given nearly as much screen time as their Sicilian cousins. For every Miller's Crossing there are three Godfathers; a Sopranos for every Grifters. Road to Perdition sees Tom Hanks as Michael Sullivan, personal `Angel of Death' for Irish mob-boss John Rooney (Paul Newman). Sullivan, an orphan, had been raised as Rooney's son, and carved a nice Norman Rockwellian life for himself, his wife and two kids. Each morning he has breakfast with his family in their lovely country home, before heading off to work to intimidate and kill Rooney's enemies. Unbeknownst to Sullivan, his oldest son (Tyler Hoechlin) tags along on one of these missions, and sees exactly what his father does for a living. In a misguided effort to silence the boy Rooney's son kills Sullivan's wife and youngest boy. Revenge and the safety of his surviving son motivate Sullivan to hit the road. Road to Perdition is beautifully rendered look at 1930s depression era America. Director Sam Mendes has stayed true to the story's graphic novel roots, and dishes up a spectacular looking film, one so finely detailed you can almost smell the gunpowder and smouldering cigarettes. Hanks is surprisingly effective as the strong silent hit man. His Sullivan is complicated, the actor subverts his natural likeability to present a man who is at once loyal and caring, but will put a bullet through your skull without a second thought. It's a layered, subtle performance that moves away from the heroic characters that Hanks usually favours. Look for the supporting cast at awards time.

		<shortDescription>Beautiful to watch, frustrating to hear</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Mendes was hailed as the hottest new director after his debut film, American Beauty, wooed viewers and critics alike with its critical examination of post-modern life. It is only natural, then, that his second film, Road to Perdition, be examined more closely than the typical film.Road to Perdition, though not nearly the triumph that American Beauty was, still reveals Mendes' talent as a director: the cinematography, music, and set design of the film all create an ambiance which perfectly parallels the film's dilemma about a boy whose father works for the local mob boss. The boy reminisces about his father, played by Tom Hanks, asking the question 'was he a decent man or a horrible man?' The answer lies somewhere in the middle, and we see this in Mendes' direction. There is both a nostalgic beauty AND darkness to the mood, created by lighting, setting and sound. These elements are not lacking.What is lacking in the film is a thought-provoking and entertaining screenplay. The dialogue in the film is sparse and does not lend itself to many memorable moments. As a result, characters are underdeveloped and leaving the audience unfulfilled. Even Tom Hanks, one of our finest actors, struggled to breathe life into his cardboard character. Only the kids in this film have interesting dialogue to work with.The combination of inspired directing and uninspired screenwriting produces a film beautiful to watch and dialogue frustrating to hear. When their's so much potential in a film, it's almost worse than if the film were no good at all. Yet, I would suggest it to great appreciators of film as an art. At the very least, you will get your money's worth taking in the sights.Rating: 7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the things I remember from the opening week of this film was that a lot of people said "I'm not sure if Tom Hanks fits to play an ice-cold assassin. I don't know, I'm used to see him as a part of the cast in other types of movies. Lovestories and comedies." But note that he was one of the characters in Steven Spielbergs film "Saving Private Ryan." I think that's the closest you get to the job he did when he played Michael Sullivan in Sam Mendes film "Road to Perdition."I saw this film some weeks ago, and it was just great! And to every person out there that didn't pay attention to this film; go and see it! I have never actually liked gangster films, simlpy because they are totally without a story. Just some guys in hats that are shooting on each other. But "Road to Perdition" has a good story, which basically are showing the relations between the father and son. But thanks to a brilliant director, fantastic characters, the best locations you could ever think of, and a fantastic photograph named Conrad L.Hall this film is a masterpiece! You have to look for on the details in this film, Sam and Conrad gives you the most beautiful outline-picture in the world when Sullivan and his son are driving in to Chicago. During the film, you get to meet Harlen Maguire. He is what you may call a mega-controversial person. "I shoot the dead" as he says in the film. He takes pictures of dead people. Crazy? -Yes, absolutely. His mission will be to kill Sullivan and his son. And you will notice during the film that he is insane. And Hollywood's grand old man, Paul Newman plays the gangster-boss in this film, something which he does very good. And finally, Tom Hanks. In my opinion he does one of his best jobs as a character in this film. And with Thomas Newmans great music, Sams directing, Conrads filming, great settings and locations, great costumes and great characters this film should have won many Oscars. Unfortunately, it didn't. But to everyone out there, please go and see this film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this in the theatre and was amazed. When I wanted to give it a second look I rented a copy from the local video store only to realise they didn't have the original format in stock. I watched it "formatted to fit your screen". This normally isn't a problem but with this film it is. It has to be one of the best filmed movies I've ever seen.Cinematographer Conrad L Hall is a genius. I loved Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (Think of the classic end scene) and Cool Hand Luke but Road to Perdition probably topped both of them, in Conrad's department at least.The movie was great in general. Great director, great acting (Paul Newman deserves the credit here, the kid too), and even a good script. But do yourself a favour and take home the widescreen original format, and pay special attention to the cinematography. Wow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Puzzlingly unsatisfying movie [SPOILERS]</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mendes' second outing does not lack for cinematic rhetoric, theatrics, fine performances, a compelling central theme, directorial assurance or epic ambitions, but it remains strangely less than the sum of its extraordinarily fine parts. The problem is it never quite becomes the epic it so badly wants to be (the film wears its aspirations on its sleeve).The problem is that it is neither armageddon nor, despite the title, armageddon of the heart. Hanks never really appears to question his life as a hitman nor, in a bizarre choice clearly shared by director and actor, does he ever really confront the reality of killing people. It is as if murder takes place somewhere else. Even the murder witnessed by his son is committed by Daniel Craig's character and though Hanks joins in it is essentially played offscreen. This soft-pedal destroys the film. It is a moment a director as flawed as Pekinpah would not have missed and one can only wonder whether Mendes fought any battles over this.This difficulty destroys the film because it leaves Hanks nowhere to go in his character except seek revenge for the death of his family. He never, apparently, considers the possibility of doing anything other than killing Daniel Craig, the culprit. In the dialog with Paul Newman in the crypt of the church we are led to believe that Hanks considers himself beyond redemption, and yet we never really feel that he needs it, because he is, after all, Tom Hanks.The ripple effect is devastating in terms of the dramatics, because his son's idolization of him simply does not trouble him as it should, not do we really feel that he is on a mission to prevent his son following the same path (although that is in fact the motor of the third act).There are other problems. Daniel Craig's character is so thinly written that we never even glimpse the psychosis that drives him to commit the acts that set the movie in motion. A tragic waste of a marvellous actor. We are led to believe that he commits serial murder to cover up the fact that he has been stealing from his father, and yet all the evidence is that he knows his father would put up with anything from him.Only Newman's character is truly satisfying, because he confronts the fact that he is damned in a way that Hanks never does.(A small irritation is that "Perdition" turns out to be a small town. I am so sick of this device. It's a pretentious TV way of making your film sound more interesting than it is.)I really wonder if half the problem wasn't that it comes from a graphic novel. It is astouningly easy to be seduced by graphic novels, because they are by their nature so cinematic. You read it and see the movie in your head, and if you're Sam Mendes then WHOOMPH suddenly Paul Newman's attached and you have your money. In the process you tend to overlook the narrative problems and the nitty gritty of development that any other script would be forced to go through.That said, I have the sense that there was a greater movie in the material. A different piece of casting than Hanks, or a more challenging characterization of the protagonist would have made a huge difference. As, indeed, would have been a more realistic depiction of the era, which though faithfully reproduced in terms of architecture, costume and music, has nothing whatever of the grime and grit you see in newsreels of the period. A different textural context would have made a vast difference.I've written at length because I liked this movie: it has many fine things in it, not least the cinematography and Thomas Newman's extraordinary soundtrack. I like Mendes for his obvious ambition, but he needs more steel in his backbone if he is to not fall into the traps so elegantly laid for him by Hollywood.</fullReview>

I was impressed by Hanks (tho he's one of the actors you cannot expect bad performances from) as well as by Hoechlin. A great young talent. The story was okay, although I was hoping for a different ending. However, a great movie with great acting, awesome 30's scenery, and the same beautiful photography and directing as known from Sam Mendes' magnificent American Beauty.I'd give this one a drama/thriller rating of 7/10.

Tom Hanks is somewhat miscast here, but I suppose that was largely the point. He's become a fine actor. (A long way from "Bosom Buddies", huh?)

That said, I can always see in retrospect if a plot is predictable or not, and this one didn't leave a terribly good aftertaste. The ending was just way too neat, but I like what Ebert had to say about 'deus ex machina' endings being acceptable in tragic films.Despite its numerous flaws, I really enjoyed this film -- never a dull moment, and I love movies that flow rather than get 'in yer face'. This one never disappointed, and of course the cinematography was stunning. Eye candy for certain, and both Hanks and Newman were excellent.Undeserving of any awards outside of cinematography/sound editing and such, but a very pleasant diversion -- recommended. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comic Book Depression Potboiler</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Road To Perdition was good. I enjoyed it. However, I enjoyed it on the same level that I enjoy other films based on comics. You cannot take this movie seriously. This was a comic book movie just as much as X Men 2 was. A non science-fiction comic book, but a comic book all the same. This film has all the hallmarks of modern comic books: The dark brooding imagery looks just like comic drawings from an average brooding anti-hero graphic novel, the twisted and quirky villain of Jude Law's character is a cliche carried over from 75%+ of modern comics, and the overall entire mood of today's dark, cynical, self-important comic books is stamped all over this movie. Hanks is playing Batman, only with a Thompson submachine gun and a trenchcoat instead of the batmobile. It isn't an accurate view of mob life in the depression, it's a cynical and imaginative teenager's view of mob life in the depression. This film is as far away from The Godfather as Star Wars is from The Right Stuff. That's not to say it isn't entertaining, if you overlook the numerous anachronisms and goofs, it's a good movie. However, audiences and writers of today are so distanced from this period, and from history in general, that all they have to relate it to are second and third hand sources. It would be impossible for today's young filmmakers to do an accurate portrayal of the 1930s. Look at a film like Robert Altman's Kansas City (also starring Jennifer Jason Leigh) to see a REAL portrayal of the 1930s. Altman was born 40 years before Sam Mendes, so he knows what he's talking about. The audience won't care about realism though. Average Audience members of today consider films of 2 - 3 years ago to be 'old' and don't watch them, so they look at this enjoyable comic book movie and equate it with a serious, historically film like The Godfather...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In `Road to Perdition', Tom Hanks plays Michael Sullivan, a 1930's hit man. He was raised by a magnate geriatric bandito, John Rooney. Sullivan, who is one of Rooney's hit man, is also a devoted family man. His life takes a turn on the wrong side of the road when his son witnesses a bloodbath hit mainly orchestrated by Rooney's ferocious gunslinger son, Conner Rooney. Realizing that Sullivan's oldest son cannot be trusted, Conner guns down Sullivan's wife and youngest son. Obviously, now it was time to `hit the road, Hanks and don't you come back no more no more.' Ok! I know I am being silly with Hanks' character Sully. Anyway, the primary premise of `Road to Perdition' is Sullivan's courageous journey to save his oldest son's life and lead him to Perdition, the town where young Sullivan will be at safe heaven. At the same time, Sullivan is on his own `road to redemption' in taking extreme measures in protecting his son and displaying subdued tenderness towards the young Sully. Director Sam Mendes' sophomore effort is another `american beauty' of a film. Conrad Hall's breathtaking cinematography was quite deserving of its Oscar accolade. Hanks' portrayal of Sullivan was so emotionally complex that it might still require for you to bring your `hankserchief' even though the character was a bit shady. Jude Law's menacing performance as the vanity-challenged mortality-photographer hit man might have been in the wrong part of the law, but still developed as a no `flash in the pan' disposable work and was more in the `picture perfect' category. `Road to Perdition' perdio in the Oscar race but it's still worthy enough for you to `hit the road, Jack' and rent it at your nearby video store. **** Good</fullReview>

The story was very simple and thin and we see too much of shoot downs and murders as in so many mafia movies. The director wanted to concentrate the focus on the relation ship father/son where he succeeded in. But what I expected was more suspense and guessing and not so many bullets. The film was accompanied by very fine music which I have already heard in another film. The visual picture was very good too.

		<fullReview>Although this film has a lot of great elements working for it -- great technical aspects and masterful performances from Jude Law and Paul Newman -- somehow it doesn't add up. The mood is confusing and suffers from unnecessary bouts of comic relief. The character development is inconsistent, and the viewers simply have to take certain things for granted. As is too often the case, Tom Hanks underplays a character, and his absent performance is misinterpreted as "understated." (Much was made of the fact that he played a "bad guy," but really his character was the most moral in the picture, save that of the son, and besides, he's played unpopular before, and better, in "A League of Their Own.") Jennifer Jason Leigh's talents are wasted. Hopefully director Sam Mendes has something better on the horizon.</fullReview>

Mood? Cinematic artistry? Come on, what about purpose? A reason why? Terrible disappointment. A poor excuse to make a movie. No story worth telling here. What?!

Such hopeful expectations with the cast offered. Such hopeful expectation for a worthy story considering the stellar actors cast. Newman!!! Hanks!! One would think that their respective past histories of cinematic output would suggest a story of import, of moral merit, of valuable message. What were they thinking? What could they have possibly visualized when reading the script? Instead, a waste of talent, celluloid, money, time &amp; whatever. What total trash. We observe immoral men staking out their territorial claims in a most violent, testosterone-driven fashion. What extraordinary peacocking we witness here. Might as well watch a film on territory-staking micturition patterns by varieties of wildlife. And revenge? So what!! Kill 'em all for all anyone should care. Oh yes! Jude Law offers the artistic, albeit weirdly deranged, perverted element best reserved for 'film noir' (Road to Perdition is not of this particular cinematic genre). He would have been exceptionally well cast in something worthy of this type of character portrayal. All in all, not worth taking off the shelf. Thankfully we rented this on a monthly subscription at the local video store, a subscription lent by a friend whose animals we were tending. Therefore it even cost us less to watch such worthless drivel. The animals are far more interesting.</fullReview>

He works for the mafiaboss Rooney that helped him out for many years back. Mike's wife knows that he is doing brutal missions, but that doesn't his two sons know, Peter and Michael. But Michael hides in the car one time and sees his father kill two men with a Tommy gun. Soon the wife and the youngest son Peter gets killed by Mike's former collega.

They seem so distant, so plain, uninteresting. Tired, would be a very accurate word. And then, the story has serious flaws. Are we going to believe that a man alone can bring chaos to a crime organization just by himself?. Was it so hard for a cold blooded maffia just to find the man and eliminate the problem? And over and over again, you can predict what's going to happen, until the very end. There are few surprises. In my concept, the story is not a complete waste, and the movie could have been more, if not for the slow pace, and lack of emotion, which, sorry to say, Mr. Mendes, seems to be the director's fault.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Road to Perdition is one of those movies that's heavy on mood and atmosphere but makes you stop and think every few minutes, "What the heck are these people doing in this movie?"Tom Hanks is hitman Michael Sullivan, in the employ of local tough guy John Rooney (Paul Newman). Sullivan's very effective at his job, and he's equally effective in keeping his true occupation from his young sons. On one fateful night, however, son Michael (Tyler Hoechlin) stows away on one of his father's business trips and witnesses a slaying. Knowing the boy has seen far too much, Rooney's own son decides to kill him - but gets the wrong boy (not to mention his mother).So the Michaels young and old are on the run. Sullivan wants to get back at the man who killed his family, and that journey can only lead to one man - John Rooney. There are several problems with this movie. The first is - surprisingly - in the casting. Hanks isn't wrong for the part of Michael Sullivan, but there's also no real need for him to play the part, either. He's okay, but he's just not as effective as Tom Hanks usually is. For someone who's such a great and accomplished actor, Hanks had no need to take on this role, which conceivably could have been played by most actors in America.Paul Newman isn't any better. I know, sacrilege! Newman's been in Hollywood for a long, long time, and he's one of my all-time favorite performers. But the man's getting old. I don't mean he's aging gracefully, although he had been doing that for many years. I mean he looks old - in this movie, he looked very haggard and weary, as if he had been working on the movie nonstop for seven months. There's none of that old fire and passion we've come to expect from Newman. There's one scene in particular near the end in which his character confronts Hanks's character, and - no lie here - he sounded like he was on Death's door.Oh, I know. He IS an old man. Newman's 78 years old, now. But I've never seen him look and sound as bad as he did in this movie. The last movie I saw him in was Message in a Bottle (1999), in which he played Kevin Costner's cantankerous father. And he was very, very good in that movie. He was funny, self-deprecating, engaging, and magnificent - aging gracefully, if you will. But this movie's like the anathema to Message.Imagine, a movie with Hanks and Newman! New guard and old guard! It should have been a real meeting of the thespians, a chance to compare the styles of two of the greatest ever to walk onto the silver screen. But it's a major disapointment, this acting summit. Hanks is earnest but a little insincere, and Newman looks like he's walking in his sleep.What makes this movie even more disappointing is the fact that it was directed by Sam Mendes, who wrote and directed American Beauty (1999). This is his first film since Beauty, but there's none of the nuances of that masterpiece evident in this one. Was he just happy to work with acting legends? There are some interesting, almost random funny moments, as when Michael, Jr. learns to drive the getaway car (they're on the lam, remember), but overall it's a bleak, uninspiring film. At least the title is appropriate, as "Perdition" means "eternal damnation," which is what watching this movie sometimes felt like.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just an average gangster movie, 'Road to Perdition' tells the story of a famous hitman (Hanks) who works to a Mafia boss (Newman) that likes him as a real son until the day that the loyal hitman must fight his Mafia family in order to save the life of his son and to revenge the death of his wife and his other son. The director (Sam Mendes, the same of 'American Beauty') tries to make a stylish and thoughtful movie despite the cruel and violent theme but his attempt is not completely reached because the final result is just a movie with some well worked scenes but with no originality. The cast, especially Jude Law, made a good work. I give this a 06 (six).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawless production but something's missing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't sure what to expect from this, having read the original graphic novel first. And while it's high calibre cast and crew (Tom Hanks, Paul Newman, Jude Law, Sam Mendes, Conrad Hall) have made something that looks lovely, it didn't really do anything for me. The source material would have made for a great John Woo film (Collins cites him as a influence on the book in the introduction to the book) but Mendes and co seem to be aiming for something higher, a serious film about violence and the vicious cycle inherent in nature. Unfortunately they don't achieve their aims. While some might have felt that the violence in the film was too much, I personally felt that it was too understated, just enough to give a glimpse of the characters dangerous world but not much else. For me, Hanks just doesn't cut it as Michael O'Sullivan, his face too jowly with his puppy-dog eyes and weak moustache. Just because the other characters act afraid of him doesn't necessarily mean it convinces me. Oh, and can someone explain to me why they needed Jude Law to look so ugly. If they wanted someone who looked that way for the role why didn't they hire someone who really did look like that? But then again, that's Hollywood for you.Much like ?American Beauty' this is simply the Hollywood alternative to its bloated action films rather than something genuinely different. It just plays to safe with its intended message.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In an effort to constantly drive the action down the road to Perdition, the director creates a stagnant, linear plot. Foil after foil is used to continue to keep them moving down the road and killing. The silent moments in the film are the best and allow Hanks and the other actors to truly show complex emotions--regret even while killing, for instance. Visually, some incredible moments exist, as when Hanks is gunning down the guards in the street in total silence. Yet overall the director aims for film-noir without the mastery of lighting or the medium that the best film-noir directors possessed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not a great fan of gangster movies and even less a fan of "Road to Perdition." I experienced boredom frequently during the film and felt that much of it had been done elsewhere, and to better effect. I kept asking myself why this film had to be made, and why Tom Hanks and Paul Newman wanted to be in it.I guess it works best as a character study. One with lots of rain, lots of murdering and pretty monotonous music throughout. Well at least the period music in the honky tonk was ok, until the shooting started.Imagine this script, in the hands of and rewritten by the Coen Brothers or even Sam Raimi. Maguire looked a bit zany when he smothered the nearly dead guy. That tone might have alleviated the ennui I experienced. Different movie, of course.The photography supported the story well, and is fine memorial for the late Conrad L. Hall.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot stress on how much of an outstanding movie this is. It is just so great! It is a great movie about organized crime, and the kill scenes are nicely directed. The story is about a very talented hitman called 'The Angel of Death' (Tom Hanks) who was adopted by a mean old crime boss John Rooney (Paul Newman - In his Academy Award nominated performance) at a very young age. Since John treats Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks - a.k.a. The Angel of Death) as his favorite son, John's real son Connor Rooney (Daniel Craig) gets very jealous and tries to have some business man secretly (without his father's consent) kill Michael. Well, that doesn't go as well as planned, and Michael ends up killing the business man and some of his associates. But, Michael's family isn't so lucky, when Connor himself kills Michael's wife (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and youngest son, leaving Michael only with his oldest son, Michael Sullivan, Jr. Since John must kill Michael in order for him to protect Connor, Michael and his son hit the road to Chicago to hide out. In Chicago, John has everyone looking for Michael including Frank Nitti, Al Capeone and a warped hitman named Maguire (Jude Law) who poses as a reporter, takes pictures of his victims, and wears a 'Charlie Chaplin'/'Malcolm McDowell in Clockwork Orange' hat. The movie really moves along quickly and isn't slow at all. The story is really interesting, but the movie only got 1 major Academy Award Nomination. It should have been nominated for Best Picture, Best Actor - Tom Hanks and Best Director - Sam Mendes, instead of just Paul Newman getting nominated. This film is all around excellence, but isn't as good as Mendes' first feature 'American Beauty'. Grade: A+</fullReview>

Yet that was a film with out pretense and probablly got a poor rating The most offensive part to me is that it destroys the most interesting part of the narrative to me (the scenes where he gets the money together) by making it far to comic and with Scarface esque dissolves.

		<shortDescription>Not even Hanks, Newman or Mendes can make this Story Likable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is an anomally that whenever an acclaimed actor or director signs his/her name onto a film that people, including critics, automatically label these films as great works. This is one of those types of films. Just because Tom Hanks or Paul Newman is in it or Sam Mendes directed it or its a gangster film (which for some reason everyone likes), people believe this is a great movie. At its core this movie is truly a very unlikable story. There is nothing in this story that is at all redeeming. The characters are all unlikable, petty thugs that nobody should have any sympathy for. To make things worse the acting of Tom Hanks' son is miserable, he may be the most sympathetic character within the film but his portrayl is awful. **Spoilers** There is way to much killing and violence that goes on within the film such as the absurd killing of the younger son and wife along with the grotesque killings of Newman and Hanks and the pervertedness of Jude Law. There is not one single aspect of this story that a viewer can latch on to and immerse themself within the story. I will give credit where credit is due, the movie is extremely stylish, with great camera work and settings. Since the story though is so bland and unredeeming, there is not one good acting performance. Hanks, Newman and Law (who are all of the upper-echelon of actors) all have very one-dimensional characters, with very little depth. People reviewing movies need to begin to think for themselves and not automatically write off every film acted in by Hanks or Directed by Mendes as being great (Sam hasn't made enough movies to be given this kind of credit already). This movie is mediocre at best with an ending that is completely depressing. Look beyond actors, directors and camerawork because the first thing that makes a great movie is the story itself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>7 out of 10Road to Perdition is a lovely film, well-shot, well-written, and mostly well-acted. It has a fine story to tell, with an underlying theme of the bond between father and son that's genuinely touching. The film certainly has its heart in the right place, and director Sam Mendes does a competent job behind the camera putting it all together. However, the film often suffers from a sense of emotional detachment. Yes, you can feel for Tom Hanks' plight in this film (and Hanks delivers another fine performance yet again), but the core of the movie, the fate of the hitman's son, left me feeling cold. Tyler Hoechin's unexceptional, very mediocre performance kept me at a distance, to the point where I no longer cared what happened to Sullivan, Jr., only his father, whose conflicted personality is easily the most riveting part of the film. A fairly solid film, to be sure, but the resolution of the most important plot element will only result with a mere shrug.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually impressive and oozing with quality and talent but lacking in entertainment value</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Hanks plays Michael Sullivan, a hit man employed by John Rooney (Paul Newman). One night, in an attempt to find out what his father does for a living, Sullivan's eldest son follows him and witnesses a murder carried out by Rooney's son, Connor. This leads to a chain of events which involves Sullivan's wife and younger son being murdered and Sullivan going on the run with his eldest son while being pursued by a professional killer (Jude Law).The film begins with the eldest son pondering over whether Michael Sullivan is a good or a bad man. One feels that this issue isn't really resolved by the end of the film. Tom Hanks' most memorable roles to me are in ?Splash', ?Big' and ?Forrest Gump' and despite my high regard for him as an actor of quality, I cannot find him believable as an amoral bad guy. Sullivan has kept his work a secret from his son to protect him, but in doing so finds that he is unable to show the affection that his son craves. The relationship between father and his surviving son is handled sensitively and convincingly with subtle humour.Jude Law fans will be disappointed to witness him as a bit of a slimeball character with stained teeth and long filthy fingernails, who shoots dead people with both camera and gun. However, he does manage to carry off the part convincingly.?Road to Perdition' is one of those films which oozes with quality and talent, being directed by Oscar winner Sam Mendes and starring Oscar winners Tom Hanks and Paul Newman and Oscar nominee Jude Law.The film is also a visually impressive one with effective use of lighting and good-looking costumes. These qualities are most apparent during the final encounter between Rooney and Sullivan: no one speaks; it is pouring with rain through which we see the actors as dark silhouettes and out of the darkness comes rapid gun fire. Cinema critics will love the poetry of the moment but to me the sequence is too affected. This film has a number of good qualities which will impress critics and voters at next year's Oscar ceremony but from the point of view of the average cinema goer, ?Road to Perdition' is lacking the surprises and entertainment value to make it a memorable classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once again the general film going public are being conned into believing that a film is good just because it is well shot. This is actually a very ponderous, aimless film which is either badly written or badly edited (can't decide which!) but most definitely badly directed in terms of the quality of the end product. The characters are so shallow that it is an effort to have any consideration for them whatsoever and to believe that this film subsequently has any depth is a validation of the power of hype, marketing and the herd mentality. I can only assume that those lauding its merits are under the assumption that this is sophisticated cinema, but don't really understand it and are too embarrassed to say anything that goes against the crowd.The is a prime example of how audiences are being mis-directed with a couple of stars, a celebrity director with limited talent and an occasional (very occasional) nice shot. I normally love this genre, I enjoyed American beauty, I like ALL of the main actors and yet it still wasn't enough to distract my opinion away from what a very unexceptional film this is. I actually wanted to walk out but unfortunately I always give a film the benefit of the doubt until the credits roll.If you want beautifully shot period gangster films watch 'Miller's Crossing' (8/10)If you want to see the dynamics of a criminal and his sibling during the Depression watch 'Paper Moon' (9/10)If you're the kind of sucker that wishes to facilitate studios that manipulate you into believing that this kind of junk is high quality film making, then watch 'Road to Perdition' (3/10).And don't forget to bleat like a lamb when you file out at the end of this piece of mutton.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow! The Big New Gangster Movie! Except it does not exactly live up to the hype. It even makes me wonder if director Sam Mendes was more than a bit lucky in pulling off American Beauty, a film which was not only captivating and thrilling to watch, but whose greatness relied heavily on the considerable consensual reality of critics and audiences that read a lot into the movie that wasn't actually stated. Fine ? I got the point with AB; finding a point worth bothering about in Road to Perdition on the other hand, is like trying to find flavour in a limp MacDonalds burger that has somehow been served up at the Ritz. Cinematography is gorgeous ? the scenes are beautifully shot ? they all look like a definitive breed of gangster movie and any of them would make wonderful posters to grace the wall of the local Odeon; sadly, the motion picture itself here is rather less than the sum of its parts. The characterisation is one-dimensional and Hanks (wooden throughout) very mis-cast. An interminable number of scenes end with long drawn-out pregnant pauses (with or without a nice John Williams musical slow-fade) in which the viewer might be invited to add some Deep Meaning. But does the film warrant such effort? Not in this viewer's opinion. The actions of the main characters often seem at odds with the personalities portrayed (would they really have done that?). The voice overs are trite and predictable. The moral dilemmas are reduced to absurd simplicity and repeated over and over again as if the audience might have nodded off (an understandable temptation.)The story follows reluctant henchman Tom Hanks doing his best to be an upright hitman out of gratitude to the big boss (Paul Newman) who has given him the means to provide for his family by following a life of crime. His young son finds out what he does for a living and Hanks tries to protect him from growing up as a gangster.It really is incredibly slow, but in an `isn't this artistic?' self-indulgent way. I am reminded of the career of that once amazing actor, Meryl Streep ? she turned in great performances until she seemed to feel she had ?clocked' what made an ?award-winning performance.' From then on in many of her films, there would be little pauses to allow the viewer a moment to admire the brilliance of how she had just delivered those wonderful lines ? and lead one critic to coin the phrase `doing a Meryl Streep'. In Road to Perdition, Mendes has a self-satisfied approach to directing that keeps inviting viewers to admire the Sam Mendes Moments. Oscars might be there for cinematography, but as a directorial second feature this has the trappings rather than the substance of greatness.Some light relief is provided by a sickly photographer character played by Jude Law, who specialises in taking photographs of the dead ? or recently dead ? and doesn't mind helping people on their way for a monetary consideration and the chance of a good, saleable photo. His part is based on a real 1930's photographer, some of whose pictures appear in the film. The character has no moral dilemmas: he is just plain nasty!Road to Perdition follows a middle road, very slowly, and contains small amount of blood-curdling gore but not enough to keep real gorehounds satisfied ? just enough to upset those who don't like that kind of thing I expect. But the movie is aimed at a more discerning market and fails to deliver. Even reading meaning into the title (perdition = utter loss) satisfies only in a banal sort of way. It would be true to say that although the film is paved with good intentions it suggests the director has failed to capitalise on the artistic success of his earlier American Beauty and has taken the road to box office mediocrity and bankability.</fullReview>

It is a slushy almost Spielberg-esque film of schmultz. The scenes at the end where Michael tells us that if asked whether his father was a good man or a bad man, that he would reply 'he was my father' is instantly rememberable for all the wrong reasons. I gave this film 5. And Tom Hanks just doesn't fit. Paul Newman however is excellent but let down by dire directing and screenplay.</fullReview>

Widescreen imagery and Dolby sound wasted on 'character' development and a script with so many holes in the 'disbelief' dept. it doesn't matter because everyone involved is laughing all the way to the bank.

		<fullReview>Possibly the most overrated movie in cinema history judging by all the reviews and hype. I am almost in a state of shock after shelling out my hard earned cash in order to utterly waste 2 hours of my existence sitting through this utter, utter drivel. During the movie, I counted 6 people get up and leave before the end. I think I was too shocked by the pathetic excuse for a film which was unfolding before my eyes to follow them, otherwise I surely would have been on my way, yelling like a madman. I kept thinking that this couldn't possibly be happening and that some redeeming feature was about to show itself in all its glory, but no, in the end, it left me totally ....bereft...of...oh, words just fail me. Which is very rare, believe me. When I have had time to recover, I will try to come back and articulate my feelings more fully, but for the moment let me just say please, please, for the love of GOD, do NOT waste your life by watching this abomination on celluloid. Perhaps wait for it to come out on DVD or video and then rent it just to witness a piece of movie history in that it might just be the worst movie ever to get an oscar (yes, believe it or not, oscar-talk is being bandied about). I am completely dumbfounded. Sam Mendes, retire. Immediately.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not an epic, not even a great film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I missed all the hype about this film, so I managed to go into the cinema without any false hopes or impressions of the film.I was, however, expecting a better film. Especially after all the names flashed before me during the opening credits - Paul Newman, Jude Law, Tom Hanks, Sam Mendes, and most notably Conrad L. Hall. All of them disappointed me, except for Hall, whose cinematography was as excellent as it has been in his other films. Newman and Law were simply too flat - well, there was at least some development in Newman's character (unlike the two-dimensional-snuff-you-while-you're-sleeping-because-I'm-truly-evil Law). But I never felt anything for him, no anger or sympathy. Perhaps I wasn't meant to, but nothing in this film really gripped me.I've read a few reviews about what an epic film this was. No, it was a lengthy film about Tom Hanks going on a killing spree, with long periods of non-epic slow-talking and short bursts of unnecessarily violent gun-battle, finished off with a dull, morose ending. The start of the film was too revealing, and didn't add to the film, as perhaps the start of American Beauty did.If you're expecting an epic, go and watch Cinema Paradiso instead.4/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I heard on the add that this is the best crime drama since the Godfather I knew that wasn't true. In any case however I saw it, knowing that it is the same director as American Beauty which was great but a tad on the pretentious side. The same holds true here except Road to Perdition is much more boring; the whole movie feels generic. On top of that Tom Hanks sucks, he is no good in this role he's too nice a guy and by the end of the film we are suppose to feel as if he's a ruthless thug but no he's just Tom Hanks. As for Paul Newman he's just there looking old and suppose to be wise know it all. Which brings me to another point, there is suppose to be some sort of 3 way father-son relationship between Newman Hanks and the kid but its all lost to me I didn't see that. And supposedly there is this amazing cinematography nothing special to me. The one good thing that comes to mind is Jude Law who was great he really got across that his a dark guy and how his fingertips were bleached from all the time spent in the dark room was a nice touch. Overall this is going to be my newest example of movies that try to be profound and end up falling on their faces.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does Mendes succeed? Does Hall?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay. So we have Tom Hanks saying, "I'm an actor. I grow my hair out really long for a role, I can cry on a beach in Normandy, and I can even put on a long face and shoot people at point blank with a revolver." Thanks, Tom. My roommate said he'd rather Mendes cast an unknown for the lead--but let's get realistic about that one (even when Soderbergh makes a "low budget film" he uses an A-list actress).Moving beyond God's Gift to the Screen Actors Guild, we have a film with a strong first act and a satisfying--if not heavy-handed--third act. Of course, most films go awry in the crucial second act ('A Simple Plan' comes to mind). I would say that 'Road to Perdition' doesn't suffer in this area but it certainly doesn't shine.While there is humanity to be found in Michael teaching his son to drive, the entire bank robbery montage (while beautifully compressed and effectively designed) hinges itself almost solely upon the scene in which Sullivan confronts Rooney about his son's deceit and dishonestly--a scene which falls flat when Newman says, "I know." Of course, so much ammunition has been built into this confrontation that it is bound to soar; it crashes nonetheless.Jude Law was predictably good as usual, providing one of the most thrilling gunfight scenes I've seen in a quite awhile when blows holes in a steel crate. Though somewhat one-dimensional, the assassin/photographer character is compelling enough to be a worthy adversary for Sullivan. Notably missing is Jennifer Jason Leigh, who gets so little screen time it's a wonder the editors bothered billing her in the opening credits or casting such a great actress for the role to begin with.I'm curious now. Does Sam Mendes hate the NRA that much? Not since 'All the Rage' have I seen a film that so overtly protests gun use and ownership. I believe "I never picked up a gun again" ranks up there with 'American History X's "racism is bad because you shouldn't hate people" for Most Insulting Final Reflection in Cinema. The same can be said of 'American Beauty's introspective final narration as well.This aside, 'Road to Perdition' reaffirms Conrad Hall as one of the greatest living cinematographers. He can shoot interiors, exteriors, rain, snow, day, night, faces, shadows, landscapes, buildings, and just about everything in between. Muting the rain-drenched Tommy gun shootout was a good choice; it further compliments an incredibly visual landscape.I may see this film again sometime, but if I do it will be only to discuss key to fill ratio, film stock, motivated lighting sources, and shooting in adverse weather conditions.</fullReview>

The movie is imaginatively shot and tightly directed, but it suffers from poor casting. Hanks is never credible as a man who blows people's brains out for a living (Hanks?

		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that no movie should be so bold as to compare itself to The Godfather. This gives people who actually know about movies false expectations, unless of course the movie actually is able to deliver on that level. Road To Perdition, however, fails in every aspect that it attempts. Is this a mob movie? Any fan of mob movies would agree that the Italian culture mixed into the films is imperative. In RTP, where's the culture? Where's anything? The acting is poor at best, as is the dialogue. The scene with Hanks and Jude Law in the diner could have been a powerful, memorable scene, but instead it plummets into the ground and is forgotten minutes later. If you hate predictable movies, don't see this one. If you couldn't see the ending halfway through the movie, you may need to re-evaluate your ability to process human thought. This is actually a great movie, if you're dumb enough to ignore the dry plot with a predictable ending. Emotional? No. Engaging? No. If you do get roped into this movie, bring a magazine and a mini-maglite. If anyone complains about you reading during such a 'fantastic' movie, do them a favor and hit him with the maglite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie takes itself too seriously</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, the electricity went out in our house this morning, and by afternoon I was bored enough to go to the movies by myself and see the only film playing that I hadn't already seen and that halfway interested me: Road to Perdition. Unfortunately, I would have been just as satisfied by sitting at home starting at the wallpaper for two hours--and I would have saved 5 bucks to boot. (Thank goodness, at least, for matinees!)On the surface, the movie has all the sights and sounds and the feel of what should be a really good film. The problem is, the plot is formulaic, cliched, and, throughout most of the film, downright laborious. This is nothing new, of course, except that the directing talents of Sam Mendes fool the movie into thinking it's much more important than it really is. The film takes itself too seriously throughout, with scene after scene of dreary rain-soaked shots, smoky backroom meetings, and somber, serious, grave, oh-so-heavy conversations. (*yawn*) The movie seems to shout "look, we've got mobsters! we've got shoot-outs! we've got Paul Newman and Tom Hanks! Give us the Oscars now and save everyone the trouble."This is a disappointing choice of projects for Hanks, who manages, as always, to be brilliant--despite what he has to work with here. The rest of the cast, including Jude Law (who seems to have forgotten he's no longer playing a robot) and the cute but too-eager Tyler Hoechlin, is as mediocre as the rest of the film.I won't give away the plot--but you've seen it all before. (Only better, sharper, and not so dang long.) But let's just say the young boy's cheesy opening monologue about his roadtrip with his dad, and his cheesy closing monologue about his father not being good, or bad, but, golly-gee-whiz, just his father (*sniff*) sandwich a story that is too gory for young viewers, too simple-minded for mature movie-goers, too boring for the action crowd, and just proud enough of itself to, I'm afraid, fool the Oscar-voters into giving it undeserved plaudits anyway. (How's that for a long sentence? ;o)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to care about at least one character in a movie. That doesn't happen here."Perdition" also has some insurmountable problems and story holes that, amazingly, I haven't heard mentioned anywhere. One is the ridiculous staging of the big shootout in the night rain. At quite a long distance and for about fifteen seconds, Tom Hanks machine-guns all of Paul Newman's henchmen to death (about eight of them) as they just stand straight up in the open, firing back at him with pistols, getting picked off one by one. No flattening oneself to the ground, no diving for cover behind a car.The movie takes place over six weeks in the dead of an icy, rainy winter. After he has killed the last of Newman's people, Hanks and his kid head for Hanks' sister's house on Lake Michigan, a few hours' drive. When they arrive it's the middle of summer. Huh? Did they take the scenic route, like through Europe, Africa and the South Pole? A dog lives at the house, but where's Hanks' sister? Nowhere! No explanation, nothing!There's more, but what's the point. Hard to believe Mendes is the same man who directed "American Beauty."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very dissapointing. MINOR spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a huge fan of American beauty I was expecting the world of this movie. Unfortunately it doesn't deliver for many reasons.Technically the movie can't be faulted. The score is beautiful and heart wrenching, the cinematography is almost as breathtaking as Barry Sonnenfelds work on Millers Crossing and the Editing is silky smooth. The only behind camera role that could possibly be questioned is that of the Director. I hate to say it but I believe Sam Mendes was the wrong man for the job. As is made obvious by a few scenes that are very awkwardly played out.The biggest fault with this movie was that of the acting. not the actors per se, but their intentional stone facedness. Tom Hanks is obviously playing a man with a hard heart, but he displays that by almost non-acting. As a result of this you get the impression that he is seeking revenge due to some misplaced code of honour rather than genuine grief. Even the 12 year old boy seems completely nonplussed that his Mother and Brother have been murdered and that his Father is a cold blooded killer. it is also hard to believe that these two characters co-exist in the same universe, they seem so oblivious of each others life up to the point of the 'Incident'.only Paul Newmans character displays any notions of family unity. The fact that he refuses to give up his son despite his knowledge that his son is stabbing him in the back makes him the most sympathetic character in the movie.The other aspect that really lets this movie down is the glaring inconsistency. Why does Jude Laws character not kill the boy when he is honking the horn (i'll say no more). How can Sulliven hold a nothing conversation with a stranger in a cafe straight after the slaughter of his family. Where does the bullet go that breaks the rear windscreen of Tom hanks car? Why does sullivan completely give up trying to protect his son at the end? Why does Hanks'son accept such terrible explenations of Hanks' lacking fatherhood (even Hanks looks genuinely confused in this, the most heavy handed scene in the movie).other faults lie in the direction of the movie. the most interesting part of the story involves our heroes becoming vigilante bankrobbers. Unfortunately we only experience this in a 5 minute musical montage.the direction of the 'Bonding' scenes is of the most base and predictable nature. We need to show the two of them bonding, so what do we get? Sullivan teaching his son to drive. Unbelievably trite and so overdone in hollywood. As for the scene on the farm where Sullivan jr is trying to understand if his Father loves him. It reminds me of the scene in the church in Saving Private ryan, only rather than reaching a logical conclusion, it just ends. As if the scriptwriter couldn't think of a solution so just decided to move on and hope nobody notices.Rather than learning lessons about Family ties (The villains situation cleverly contrasts with the hero's) Sullivan ignores all lessons and exacts bloody revenge. I presume this is for the satisfaction of the viewers. if so then why do we not get to see the revenge when it comes. Surely the satisfaction of Revenge movies is seeing the look in the villains eye when he finally gets caught. We are very tastefully denied this indulgence and instead we get some very clever camera set-up involving mirrors which is audacious in it's pretentiousness and completely unsatisfying.I went in to the theatre expecting a high brow Shogun Assassin. What we get instead is a rich mans Shogun Assassin that is no more thought provoking, intelligent or entertaining for it. Tomisaburo Wakayama creates more fear, apathy, compassion and respect in one stare than hanks can manage in a whole scene. Masahiro Tomikawa conveys more love, understanding, obedience and inquisitive innocence in one flick of a nipple than Tyler Hoechlin can manage in 50 presses of the clutch.High production values cannot save an empty story devoid of emotion from the apathy it deserves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>These days, movie studios begin campaigning for Oscar votes even before the pictures are released. In the case of "Road to Perdition", I got sucked in to believing that I was about to see something on par with "The Godfather". WRONG!! True, the movie was stunning visually; many of the scenes looked like Edward Hopper paintings. But the screenplay was cryptic and uninteresting, and I was troubled at the amoral tone of it all. I understand that the source material ended with Michael Jr.'s reflections on his "Road" after having become a priest. Including that would certainly have brought some moral context. Instead, both Michaels are given a level of hero status after committing multiple homicides. It was especially disconcerting to see the attempts at humor injected into the father-son antics, such as Michael Jr.'s adventures with the clutch. These are murderers, and we are supposed to be laughing? Part of the problem, I think, is with Hanks' performance. I enjoyed him in Big and Saving Private Ryan. But is miscast here. Jimmy Stewart had the talent to play dark roles as well as every-man and comedic ones. But Tom Hanks, talented as he is, is no Jimmy Stewart. His portrayal of Michael was stolid, somber and boring. Were we supposed to feel sympathy or contempt? I felt nothing. Fortunately, there were two stand-out performances. Paul Newman was riveting and memorable as the Irish "don". Jude Law, who always inhabits his characters fully, was fascinating. The movie would have benefited with more screen time from both of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Has more pedigree than a kennel. A very earnest endeavor on the part of all concerned, and no doubt many trophies, plaques and statues will exchange hands. You can wake me when the last speech has been made.Dramatically and thematically, "Road to Perdition" plods grimly along; it has Something Very Important To Say and is fond of saying it twice, and often three times just to be safe, for anyone who may have missed what was obvious from the start. It's high-gloss prestige junk food, a Serious Movie for people who never go further than the new release section at Blockbuster- an emotional sequel, if you will, to the Oscar-baiting films of Rob Reiner ("A Few Good Men", "Ghosts of Mississippi") and Lasse Hallstrom ("Cider House Rules", "Chocolat", "The Shipping News"). The movie is rote and plodding and impressively mounted, neat and tidy and thoroughly innocuous, lacking genuine, messy passion and respect enough for its audience to provide us with entertainment as well as instruction. A stranger's obituary- or a good episode of "The Wonder Years", for that matter -is more moving than "Road to Perdition".But I confess, most people will probably be impressed. It does indeed do a very thorough job of presenting itself as an object to be taken seriously. But so did that kid in the back of my sophomore English class, and nobody could stand him so why does Sturm Und Drang like this get a pass? "People ask me if my father was a good man"- they do? Who on earth would put that question to anybody? I hereby declare a ban on voice-over narration for all filmmakers who aren't Terence Malick.God himself sees through cinematographer Conrad Hall's lens, but it's all pretty pictures in search of something worthwhile on which to hang. And it certainly was nice to see Paul Newman; his scenes were good, they hinted at a more vibrant and compelling movie. Plus, it reminded me that we were out of his yummy Peach Salsa.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The biggest disappointment of the year has to be this lifeless and dull gangster flick. Sam Mendes obviously wanted to make a work of art. His shots are so preciously composed and scenes meticulously staged that there's no pulse left at all, just a nagging sense that someone like John Woo could have made a truly thrilling film with this same material. Only Jude Law as a rodent-like hitman/crime photographer manages to shake up the staid proceedings at all, bringing a creepy vitality to his scenes that hints at what might have been in the hands of a director with something on his mind other than winning another Oscar. Avoid this turkey unless you are very easily impressed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Curiously lifeless - has the look but not the feel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Obviously I'm in the minority, but I just don't understand what all the fuss is about. I found Road To Perdition to be an onerous dirge of a film in story, acting and direction. I felt it lacked any kind of creative energy at all. Hanks isn't believable as a menacing hard guy, and Mendes direction is so symbolic and showy it began to annoy me.This film is meant to capture a period of American history so the audience ooh and aahs at the historical detail, perfect wardrobe and mural-like composition - like Edward Hopper on film. But as the story unfolds in it's detached, mechanical way it looks more like an interpretation than a reproduction. It just doesn't feel like an American gangster movie - it seems you could have transferred the story and characters to a different era (or country) and gotten pretty much the same film. You could blame it the fact that Mendes is British, but his countryman Alan Parker attempted some very similar cinematic ideas using similar source material in the incomparable Angel Heart and succeeded wildly. The only high point of this film is Paul Newman, who gives a good performance. He seemed to understand better than anyone else what the core ideas of this story were. Even the talented Jude Law seemed a little lost in what has become such a tired, stock character in movies of late - the perverted sociopathic fetish killer. I'm sure this film is going to get lots of Oscar nominations, but in ten years I think audiences will look back and realize how average it really was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Bad, But Predictable, Routine, and Rather Dull.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought The Road to Perdition was just okay. I didn't seem verydeep; like the characters weren't very well drawn or even wentthrough any changes.Oh, yeah, this "review" contains "spoilers" which means don't readthis if you haven't seen the movie, because I may be giving awayimportant plot details.Note: *Spoilers* ahead.Anyway, I mean the kid's like, "some say my paw was an evil man,and some say there was some good in him and I say he was justmy paw." Well, the script may have had the kid say that in hisvoice-over, but Hanks was kind of like the mobster with the heart ofgold.We've seen it before. He only killed people in the mob. It wasn'tlike he had to choose, geez should I save my son? The more Ithink about it, the more I didn't care for the film. No surprises. More and more often these days I think of that Radiohead song"No Surprises" when I'm sitting through another movie.You saw the preview and you knew who the characters were fromthat and then when you saw the whole two hours, it didn't seem toexpand on that. So as a simple action tale it was too slow, and asa character driven drama it was too empty and routine. We'veseen all the period gangster stuff before, and anything interestingin Perdition had already been done much better in the 1990masterpiece, Miller's Crossing.I didn't think it was bad, I thought Hanks and Jude Law were good. I love Jennifer Jason Leigh, but she hardly had any lines and thenthey killed her. Stanley Tucci was good as Frank Nitti.Newman was fine, but this was a pretty easy role for him; he'ddone it before. All he really did was get out of bed in the morning,kiss Joanne goodbye and go to work where he said the lines hehad memorized. I don't fault Newman, just the callow script.I thought Tyler Hoechlin was fine as the young Michael Sullivan Jr,but nothing special. Also, I think the voice over should have beendone by an older actor; as this character grown up. Because he'stalking from the future. But that's a technical flaw.By the way, at the end, I suppose since he went back to live withthe couple on the farm (what a surprise) that that meant that hisaunt had been killed by Jude Law at her sweet house on thebeach. There seems to have been some question.It was also a disappointment as the follow up film from directorSam Mendes, who directed a really fresh and original film (unlikePerdition), American Beauty (1999).What is also totally lame -- at least, as of this writing -- the userreview headlining the imdb entry of Road to Perdition says"arguably the best gangster movie ever made." That is laughable. The only thing ARGUABLE, is whether Paul Newman will makeany more films.Of course there's dozens of better gangster films. And there's noARGUING about this film vs., say, The Godfather, or Le Samourai. Be careful using the old "arguably the best..." Some people seemto think that gives them carte blanche to make any outrageousstatement they want. Road to Perdition is arguably better thanNewman's last two films. Road to Perdition is arguably better thanHanks' last two films.Here's a short list of better gangster films: The Godfather I, II -- and even Godfather III, Pulp Fiction, Miller'sCrossing, The Hit, The Limey, Bonnie&nbsp;and&nbsp;Clyde, Jackie Brown,The Usual Suspects, The Untouchables, Goodfellas, White Heat,Once Upon A Time In America, Get Carter, Sexy Beast, TheRoaring Twenties, Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, A boutde souffle/Breathless, All Through the Night, Another Day InParadise, The Asphalt Jungle, The Big Heat, Bob le flambeur, TheFriends of Eddie Coyle, The Getaway (1972), Ghost Dog: The Wayof the Samurai, The Glass Key (1942), Heat, The Killing, Out of thePast, The Killers (1963), The French Connection, The Killers(1946), Killing Zoe, La Femme Nikita, The Lineup (1958),Performance (1970), Point Blank, The Racket (1951), Rififi, Robinand the Seven Hoods, Le Samourai, The Sting, Things Change,This Gun for Hire, The Way of the Gun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Any movie that Tom Hanks does cannot possibly get lower than 5/10 solely because he thought it was good enough to make. Unfortunately, 5/10 was exactly what I gave this overly dramatic, far too slow and extremly cliched movie. Even every good drama has to break the ice every once in a while with some subtle humor, Road to Perdition instead took itself more serious than the funeral of a long suffering cancer patient, with few, very few eceptions. It is only in these exceptional scenes than Tom Hanks is anywhere close to his element. At least he tried, which is more than I can say for anyone else. With it's unbelievable characters, short choppy dialouge, and the worst young actor in Tyler Hoechlin, I found myself so bored, I actually wrote this review in the middle of the movie. Too many neglected elements keep this movie from ever gelling as a good film or even an amusing waste of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love Tom Hanks and while some of his earliest efforts may have been just a little silly, he's come a long way as an actor and entertainer! The Road To Perdition is very much NOT his best work. It's not silly either! Hanks is directed to have about 1 1/2 expressions in this film. He never loses the grimness of the subject matter and neither he nor I had a very good time. This movie kind of reminded me of a John Grisham book, where all the characters were mean-spirited, nasty or just plain crooked. With Grisham one is forced to pick the least offensive characters and go with him/her. I felt the same about Perdition. I liked Paul Newman's light Irish accent... I felt Jennifer Jason Leigh was completely wasted... and Tom... oh Tom... did you need the money? Did you need to stretch as an actor?? There simply has to be better material out there for Tom Hanks as well as the rest of the crew!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The sensitive inner lives of murderers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has all the elements of a great movie except a brilliant script and a compelling central performance. It's like watching a film school exercise by a talented director who has been given state of the art technical assistance and an unlimited budget for a project that in the real world never should have been given a green light, and burdened with a miscast actor who never should have taken on this role.I admit I have a low tolerance for films about the sensitive inner lives of murderers and thieves, but even if I didn't, this film's point of view is particularly bogus, with a tacked on anti-violence message that belies the film's very reason for existing. There's even a hint of contempt for the audience by way of Jude Law's character, who gets off photographing murder victims. Maybe the director thinks his film is above all those other splatter and gore films because this film's violence is so genteel and artistic. I think we now know who was responsible for the brilliance, insight, depth and humor of American Beauty - Alan Ball. Road To Perdition has about as much to say about the lives we live as an episode of The Untouchables.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There was a lot to like about this film. Hanks and Newman are superb and the photography wonderfully evokes the dirty thirties. However, as happens all too regularly in Hollywood films, the plot is really weak. The ending was *so* trite and formulaic that I found myself acting out the scenes in my mind and mouthing all the lines before they appeared on the screen. Even though I sympathized with where the film wanted to go, I found the finish to be completely unbelievable. Surely there had to be a less clumsy way to tie up the loose ends and get the message across. A morality play doesn't need to be a Sunday school comic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Waste of Talent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Looking at the talent involved in this picture, I was incredibly disappointed at the end result. The only positive thing that I have to say about the movie is that it had excellent sound effects and sound editing. The cinematography was excellent, if it was a direct to video movie. The peripheral areas of the screen were largely ignored; I cannot recall a single scene which was not maximized for pan-and-scan viewing. This leads to the question of why bother getting two excellent actors like Hanks and Newman if you are not going to let them act with each other? Their scenes together played in coverage, with cuts back and forth between closeups of them as they delivered their lines. When you have 2 actors of that caliber, let us see them act with each other; let us see them react to the other's lines. The direction also seemed somewhat slack, as there appeared to be continuity errors throughout. Snow covers the ground at the beginning and it looks to be mid-winter, then action takes place a day or two later in the midst of a driving rainstorm, and that same night there is snow on the ground again. Of course, as they drive away that night, we see their car from the air, and crops are being planted in the fields. At the end of the movie we are told it all took place within 6 weeks, but judging from the landscape, it is mid-July at the earliest.Perhaps that is nitpicking, but it is a fair comment because if the script had not bored me out of my mind, I would not have noticed the weather problems. Unfortunately, the script is extremely predictable and rather tedious. Every little piece is telegraphed. From the letter that Sullivan has to deliver to the conclusion, one could tell what was going to happen and had to wait for the movie to catch up. Furthermore, there were several points of the movie that served no apparent purpose, most notably the crime spree that Sullivan and son went on. That spot of film neither moved the plot nor developed character, and seemed to exist only for a gag on learning to drive a stick shift. The section actually resulted in a massive plot hole, unless we are to believe that gangsters are very forgiving. My guess is that the real Nitti would have shot someone like Sullivan on sight for his actions rather than actually help him. After all, Nitti had nothing to gain by helping Sullivan.In short, although the movie will likely be nominated for several Oscars, it really deserves only one for sound. That is a shame, considering the talent involved. It should have been much better than it is, but is instead a complete waste of time and talent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dead-end "roads" to perdition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Often times, and unfortunately, good films don't live up to the expectations placed on them. So it is with "Road to Perdition."Director Sam Mendes' sophomoric attempt at filmmaking makes me think he either aimed to high, or (and i don't think this is true at all) that he got lucky with "American Beauty.""Perdition" does many good things, but it fails at what is really important if you want to make a great film. Yes there are many good moments of acting and cinematography, but those are quickly followed by uninventive acting from Tom Hanks (his character ranges from the cold and distant father to the loving sensitive father of "sleepless in seattle" without showing us why he changed and what it was exactly that motivated him. more or less, it is left to the imagination).One of the most frustrating flaws of "Perdition" is the failure of the characters to develop any meaningful bond or relationship which would drive the movie. It's as though we are shown the conflict each character is presented with, but then not shown the inner conflict they may have or not have. I won't cite examples because i hate spoiling any specific part of the movie. Summed up, the characters go from one feeling to another without so much as the blink of an eyelid. Partially responsible for this could be "Perdition's" strict adherence to the "Great Hollywood American Drama" formula, which makes for cliched and predictable scenes and acting, as well some cinematography. The first shot of Jude Law was a meaningless camera trick that conveyed no information to the viewer except, "hey, look at this, it looks neat."There were many good things done by D.P. Conrad Hall and Director Mendes. The problem was that they couldn't cover the mistakes made and turned what could have been a great movie into a good one. I recommend seeing "Road to Perdition," because it is a good movie. The point of this essay, however, is to challenge the label of "greatness" simply because the film doesn't deserve the title.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Road to Perdition is superbly put together. The look, the style is original and consistent from beginning to end. Some scenes are brilliant. Go see it for the dazzling parts and for the originality. Many directors take a novel and turn it into a comic book. Mendes took a comic book and made a movie about people. Unfortunately the screenplay is flat-footed. You know what will happen long, long before it happens. The only surprises are in the details. This problem is compounded by severely understated performances from all the leads. Only Jude Law has any flash. SPOILERS. Hanks is stone-faced as the enforcer. He is supposed to be "the Angel of Death" but shows no sign of pride in his skill or craftsmanship or any trace of aggression toward his victims. This actor has no "edge" at all! He spends half the film seeking revenge for the murder of his wife and youngest son without showing a trace of feeling other than dogged persistence. His performance is BORING. (Even his agony at finding his wife and child slaughtered was an offstage howl, you never saw it on his face.) He does a decent job with the father-son part of his role but the assassin part is MIA. Very bad news for the big moral issue in the movie. It is no use to argue that a professional enforcer in real life would be a dull plodding thug because flashy types get caught and men of feeling and imagination find different jobs. This is a movie and if the viewer feels nothing for the character there is no payoff. When Hanks got shot in the end my attention was on Jude Law holding the gun.It is a brilliant film, but flawed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I go to see a film with this kind of star power, I admit I have high expectations. Unfortunately in this case the expectations were not fulfilled. The movie itself leaves a lot to be desired. It is 100% predictable. After the setup, practically every scene is telegraphed like a flashing neon sign. I realize the movie is about gangsters but was disappointed that the body count seemed to be competing with a Rambo movie.The plot is thin and the photography is dark. Although Tom Hanks shows his range as an exceptional actor in this opposite of Forrest Gump character and deserves the Oscar nomination he will probably get, he alone cannot save this mediocre flick. The only other acting performance of note was a very good job by the actor playing Hanks' son.Paul Newman once again proves why people should retire. Three exceptional actors whom I have enjoyed in other substantial roles (Stanley Tucci, Jenifer Jason Leigh and Jude Law)are basically wasted (literally and figuratively). They are relegated to roles that are little more than cameos.A disappointment, but still a must see if you are a Tom Hanks fan.</fullReview>

Tom Hanks carries the weight of the film, and only stumbles a few times.

		<fullReview>This movie is truly horrendous, and doubly so because the premise and cast had such promise. Let's start with what was good. NOTHING. Let's run down what was wrong. First of all, the score was awful, and made the numerous and truly baffling montage sequences border on unbearable. All drama, tension, and real guts disappears the second the sappy music kicks in. And the fact that the whole thing is told from the perspective of a naive, all-American twelve-year old kid takes away almost all true potential the film has. Plot is ignored for a ridiculously horrible father-son subplot. Get this, while the two are on the run there actually is a dumb, stock, sequence in which the son learns to drive, which becomes a running gag throughout the movie. Since when do mobster flicks have running gags? They don't, and this isn't one. Road To Perdition could have been good. There were one or two good scenes. I give it that. Paul Newman is the best thing in this movie. Tom Hanks reeks in comparison, and the movie plays more like Forrest Gump. The whole bad guy buzz is totally untrue, and for maybe only ten minutes of the film do you even inch near fearing him. This film misses everything that makes a gangster movie good. Most essentially a spine, and a sense of the darkness and violence that plagues us. And the previews of the film try desperately to play up this very aspect. Please, for God's sake, do not be fooled. This movie is not the classic that they are telling us it is. It may win best picture, and Tom Hanks may get an Oscar nod, and I guess at least he's trying something different (which is noteworthy in itself, right?) But if you want a genuinely good movie about the mafia, rent Miller's Crossing. Or The Godfather. Or anything, please. This movie made me squirm in the isle. Stinkeroo.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, I agree, it is not possible to discuss "Perdition" without praising Conrad Hall's cinematography. But, no, this is not a "cautionary tale about self-destruction," nor is it "richly rewarding." It is richly exploitative--yet another young (and, coincidentally, foreign) filmmaker's futile attempt to come to grips with the endemic nature of American violence. But this visually stunning movie stuns more with its cynical pretentions, leaving the viewer feeling used and resentful. After countless bodies are sprayed and bloodied--including that of his mother, brother and father-- a totally unaffected 12-year-old witness and participant blithely scampers off with his dog to the elegiac haven of a proto-Ma and Pa Kent like some impervious young superhero.In attempting to explain or expose the roots of stereotypically violent American machissmo, director Mendes merely extends a trend he purports to abhor.His movie is "Paper Moon" meets "Bonnie &amp; Clyde" meets "The Professional"--and when this expensive, much-anticipated new suit of emperor's clothing is unveiled, nothing of value, honesty or insight is visible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the winter of 1931, supposedly 12-year-old Tyler Hoechlin (as Michael Sullivan Jr.) wonders what his mobster father Tom Hanks (Michael "Mike" Sullivan) does for a living. Young Hoechlin follows Mr. Hanks to "work" one evening, and witnesses him blasting away some rival gangsters. This leads - in a VERY roundabout way - to "Godfather"-type Paul Newman (as John Rooney) hiring independent hit-man Jude Law (as Harlen Maguire) to track down Hoechlin and Hanks, who are off to cool their heels in Chicago. Hanks thinks they will be safe with a relative, which is puzzling when you consider the characters' line of work.Looking uncannily like Paul Peterson ("The Donna Reed Show"), Hoechlin does a terrific job for director Sam Mendes; and, getting to work with this cast makes him the luckiest young actor of 2002. But, the most striking thing about "Road to Perdition" is the stunning cinematography of Conrad L. Hall, which deservedly won a career capping "Academy Award" for the late photographer. Mr. Hall's work is truly superlative. This helps make up for the overall impression of a measured, contrived staginess to both the narrative and visuals. The deviating end is abruptly uplifting (the unrelated dog is an example of the aforementioned staginess).******** Road to Perdition (7/12/02) Sam Mendes ~ Tom Hanks, Tyler Hoechlin, Paul Newman, Jude Law</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not bad, but not as good as everybody says. I believe the movie has been massively overrated due to the star-studded cast it features. It is all good and fine to have two great actors like Tom Hanks and Paul Newman starring in a motion picture along with supporting actors like Stanley Tucci, Jude Law and Daniel Craig but the ability of the actors themselves in not enough to make a good motion picture on its own. The story is overly simplistic, the characterization too shallow and all in all the movie is not really involving. We never actually get to feel for the characters, we never really care. On the positive side, the camera is very good, but not nearly enough to lift this movie above the realm of average.All in all not a bad movie, but definitely nothing to write home about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great, but flawed; Tom Hanks is wrong for the role</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A great film with a painful amount of flaws. Technically, it's gorgeous. Conrad Hall's cinematography is original and stunning, and Thomas Newman's score is one of the more memorable of recent years (and it's only rarely overused). Mendes keeps up his great technical direction. And the supporting actors are magnificent. Jude Law (whose character design is awesome; the make-up artists should be remembered, as well), Stanley Tucci, Dylan Baker (possibly a tad too dandy), and Daniel Craig are all excellent. Law and Craig ought to be remembered around Oscar time. I would almost guarantee that Paul Newman will get nominated. He's excellent as an aging Irish crime boss, pulled between his screw-up real son (played by Craig) and his better, though adopted son, Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks). Newman has some great lines. The flaws lie in the script and in the central performances of the film. In the script, there are a couple of sidetracks that are unnecessary and should have been cut (most notably the cliched sequence at the farmhouse with the nice farm people, and then the end should have been worked out better). In addition to this, the themes of the film are never explored to their full potential. Road to Perdition is about the relationships between father and son. We never really see enough between Newman and Hanks. Part of the fault exists in the script, but Tom Hanks and Tyler Hoechlin (who plays Michael Sullivan Jr.) are really not up to the job, and therefore the film falls far below what it should be. Hanks is in totally over his head here. We were all curious whether he could play a bad guy, and the answer comes pretty clearly: he can't (btw, if you saw it and didn't notice this: Hanks never kills anyone on screen; although there are a couple of ghastly deaths in the film, we never see Tom Hanks directly pull the trigger and kill someone; he's always slightly off screen when he kills someone). I like the guy, but he seems so unsure of himself in this film. He's supposed to be a quiet tough guy, and that's not Tom Hanks. His sensitive side keeps popping out at bad times. Someone else should have played this role. Johnny Depp, perhaps? Maybe even Bruce Willis. But not Tom Hanks. Little Hoechlin's failure probably can be blamed on Sam Mendes. He never seems sure what he's supposed to be feeling from scene to scene, and he changes moods abruptly and often unexpectedly. We ought to see the burgeoning relationship between him and his father. If that would have come out better, the film would have been 100% more successful.But I've complained more than I should. All I'm saying is that Road to Perdition ended up being a disappointment because it promised so much. When it's good, it's fantastic. There are a couple of the best set pieces ever in this film. Just watch the scene where Hanks mows down a bunch of Newman's bodyguards in the rain (Newman is particularly fantastic in this scene, and I love the way Mendes has him act here). There's also a brilliant montage of bank robberies where the camera is always drifting to the right. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Godfather Godfather II, Godfather III, Goodfellas, The Untouchables, and Casino are all much, MUCH, better than this. The movie stars Tom Hanks as a mob hit-man and a father. After his son witnesses one of his hits, hanks must hide him from his mob friends. It was kind of predictable and pretty boring. I usually don't fall asleep at the movies, but i found my self dozing off every few minutes. It is obvious this movie is going to win a bunch of awards because it is a drama with Tom Hanks. I mean i like Tom Hanks but i thing he was wrong for this movie. Which is a shame because Sum of All Fears, Attack of the Clones, and The Bourne Identity were all better movies this year. A lot of people did like this so i guess it's up in the air. 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe American Beauty was a fluke!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>British director Sam Mendes follows up his wildly over-rated debut film American Beauty with the even more average Road to Perdition. You probably know the plot line; so I'm not gonna bother summarizing it?******Spoilers*****Is it an epic gangster movie, brilliantly filmed, acted and written with a terrific moving score? Is it a gripping tale of revenge and betrayal? A coming-of-age classic where father and son unite to put right the wrongs that have been bestowed upon them? Some people would have you think so, I'm afraid I'm not one of those people.It's the screenplay and the two main actors that really let the film down. David Self, writer of 13 Days and the 1999 re-make of The Haunting, wrote the adaptation of the Max Allan Collins &amp; Richard Piers Rayner novel, presumably of the same title. The characters are poorly written, under developed and uninspiring. The dialogue is easy and the plot borders on ridiculous. The story is uninteresting, the pacing uneven and the content emotionally shallow.The music is dire. It's far too similar to other Thomas Newman forays, such as American Beauty, Six Feet Under &amp; In the Bedroom. While they were moody, atmospheric and ultimately moving pieces, this score is far too loud in places and totally inappropriate for the period and tone of the picture. It just becomes annoying and clouds everything Mendes is showing us.Sam Mendes' direction is solid, if completely unspectacular. He attempts to bring an obvious darkness to the picture, but needs to do a little more than heavy rain and low lighting to achieve this impressively. Hanks and Hoechlin are wooden in the lead roles and there's not much chemistry between the two. Hanks being badly cast IMO. Someone with a bit more emotional depth &amp; complexity would've been better for this role. I've heard people say it's interesting to see Hanks play the bad guy, but he's not really the bad guy is he? He's a good guy that does bad because he has to. The 'other', darker side of Michael Sullivan isn't played upon enough either, after showing the potential to be the most interesting aspect of the film. You don't get any sense of history between Hanks and Newman, so don't care when Hanks has to kill Newman to revenge the death of his wife and son, Peter.Hanks ends up being boring to watch, and it's difficult to feel sorry for a man who only ever plays roles where you're forced to feel sorry for him. His character really isn't that different to recent films his done. Hoechlin is obviously a newcomer and maybe a more experienced director could've got a better performance out of him.Other than that, Paul Newman is good as Sullivan's boss John Rooney, my only criticism would be that he's just not in it enough. Jude Law brings that quirky British cheekiness to his role as the assassin (Harlen Maguire), but again, he doesn't get enough to play with. The shootout scene between Hanks and Law is probably the best of the film. The supporting cast includes 2 fine actors completely wasted in nothing roles, Jennifer Jason Leigh as Anne Sullivan (Hanks' wife) and Stanley Tucci as Frank Nitti, the gangster who protects Rooney and his family from the revenge seeking Sullivan. Worst of the whole cast though is a terrible turn as Connor Rooney (Newman's son and killer of Hanks' wife and other son), by Daniel Craig, who? Exactly.The ending is predictable and conceited. I understood that Hanks didn't want his son to grow up like him by shooting Law before his son could, I didn't need to be told that by Hoechlin in his horrible little speech at the end, saying that we should love, accept, respect and forgive our fathers for all wrong doings, just because they're our fathers. B*ll*cks.This is supposed to be a tale of regret, redemption, revenge, self-discovery and the building of a true father - son relationship. It doesn't explore any of these elements intelligently, therefore doesn't really work on any level. It doesn't inspire to become better friends with my father. You can't help but think the whole thing was devised and made just to win Oscars. The more I think about it, the less I like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lies his father told him...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A corruption of innocence, but perhaps not a lasting one, for a young lad in 1931 Chicago who finds out the hard way what his icy, distant father does for a living--a hit-man for the Mob. Ostentatiously handsome crime-drama improves in its second-hour, but is so understated as to be almost murky. It's unclear whether the right hit is taken in Tom Hanks' home, and if not, when are the facts sorted out? Also, and I'm not sure on the politics of Mob killings, but Hanks' final trip to a hotel suite seems an Open Door policy. The acting is obviously good, but not surprisingly good--there are few surprises here except a bit of (understated) humor in the film's midsection. Hanks plays the father, and while he's uncharacteristically low-keyed, he conveys his usual conflicted warmth; Paul Newman, as the Godfather, does well with an underwritten role(he doesn't care that he's being duped? Has he lost his fighting spirit?). Supporting performers Jennifer Jason Leigh (thoroughly wasted) and Stanley Tucci can't make much of an impression in mouth-piece roles, but Jude Law (in another underwritten part) manages to put off some oily reserve. Wants desperately to be a classic genre piece (or, more likely, to look like one), but the final results are so burnished and unblemished, it verges on the bland.</fullReview>

The production design is also a factor in what makes this movie special. To me, it takes a lot to beat Godfather, but the fantastic cinematography displayed wins this contest.

		<shortDescription>Style over content</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched 'Road To Perdition' for a second time. It seemed a good movie when it came out, and it won awards. Sam Mendes directing, Tom Hanks, Paul Newman, Daniel Craig, Jude Law; how can it be so slight? How come it seemed good on a first viewing? A simplistic story, without depth or character development, and no sympathy or emotion. Affected self conscious direction steals away compassion or interest. An example; we are given a room full of people reading newspapers. EVERYONE is reading a newspaper, and virtually every newspaper is held open at a double page spread. Nobody wanted to read a book? Nobody folded a newspaper to get a close focus, as you do? It made a great pattern, and was a perfect example of style over content. A snow covered urban scene, and then a great downpour of rain. Photogenic stuff, rain; misty, and especially attractive on a dark night. Dripping off hat brims! Yeah, that looks good, so let's do it again. But torrential downpours like this would have cleared snow away. Next morning what do we get? Snow, mature snow that's been there for days, looking exactly as it did before the rain on the ground. It made no sense, and I grant you it is not a vital detail, but detail it is. Good direction involves more than good shots. And the acting was subsumed by such directorial conceits. Even Paul Newman could not make sense of his Irish American accent. Was this - could it be? - Sam Mendes? Mendes, so good when he does Shakespeare in the theatre, and outstanding when running his production company, Neal Street? It seems he does not direct good films. His first film was - I think - the Oscar winning 'American Beauty', which was disappointingly predictable. So was Revolutionary Road, which again lacked any convincing relationship. Maybe he will make a good film one day, but he has to get over this mannered stuff, which only works with James Bond, where depth and insight are not needed. When he is in a producer role, as in the brilliant 'Hollow Crown', Neal Street's conflation of four great Shakespeare history plays, he steers the films to excellence. Having Richard Eyre and Rupert Goold on hand to direct gets fine results.And a fantastic script helps, of course.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worthy Film, But No Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Road to Perdition" has strong credibility through its delivery, but I also must say that I'm in full support with several of the naysayers who thought there was something falsified about the story and lacks in an emotional punch. The story offers very little and there are small subliminal messages this film is trying to get across, it never fully clarifies what it is getting at or what it is trying to get at in terms of a theme. On one surface, it centers on the bonding between father and son, it is actually quite lame in its presence compared to the 2009 film "The Road". I assume many people will find the final scenes quite disturbing.In spite of its several flaws there is plenty of material that works in this movie. Much like the 1987 film "The Untouchables" among other period pieces, "Road to Perdition" succeeds in capturing the look and feel of 1930's Chicago during the Great Depression. The details look stunning thank mainly to the cinematographer Conrad Hall. Hall makes the scenery and photo shoots look and feel quite authentic. Thomas Newman's musical score is properly set to fit the time period like the way we would expect from a noir movie like this one. The artistic direction, cinematography and music score are truly what carries the movie along.The acting is quite passable, but still hit-and-miss in some areas. Jude Law's performance was the most exceptional in terms of engaging, but other than that, there very limited dramatic panache within the characters. The dialogue in the long run is quite muted and tends to overdo itself with emotional body language instead. Sure there are a myriad of big scenes, but the performances are not always very reliable. Tom Hanks turns in a great performance as Michael Sullivan Sr., a Chicago hit-man working for Irish mafia leader John Rooney (Paul Newman). But Hanks has performed in better movies and it stands as one of his lower tier roles (compared to "Forrest Gump", and his acting in "Philadelphia"). It is a welcoming surprise to have Paul Newman here and that he even at 77 at the time, he is still boss and he was well deserved of the Best Supporting Actor Oscar at the 2003 Oscars. A pre-James Bond Daniel Craig was stunningly convincing as the leading antagonist as the jealous son of Rooney's, Connor. I always had a soft spot for British performer Jude Law, but in "Road to Perdition", he breaks type-cast to physically look ghostly pale, and incredibly unkempt, plus his role didn't offer much acting skills, but he's still incredibly talented and I enjoy the stuff he's done over the years. Tyler Hoechlin was also wonderful as the younger Michael Sullivan.This movie received three Oscar nominations (including Newman for Best Supporting Actor), but I was pleased that the technical aspects of this movie got the merits rather than the performances. The technical crew deserves full applause for the hard work they done. Overall this movie is no masterpiece, but not a complete dud.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Sullivan Jr. is a curious boy who wonders what his father (Tom Hanks) does for a living. On a late night out, he sneaks into his father's car and witness a gangland killing. His father is an enforcer for a prohibition era Chicago gang run by John Rooney (Paul Newman). Rooney's son Connor (Daniel Craig) doesn't trust Michael and tries to wipe out his family. Michael and Michael jr escape the slaughter.Sam Mendes is an expert director. He gives this movie a certain graphic novel style. However the story is fairly thin. The pace is really slow. There isn't enough. Also Tom Hanks doesn't fit a killer role. He's still the nice guy and the loyal reasonable guy. In the scene where he talks to Rooney about his son Connor, Tom Hanks has too much naivety and too much good guy persona. He is supposed to be the strong silent tough guy but he can't quite get in touch with his inner gangster.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Road to Perdition signaled to me that there had been a change in measuring artistic merit of movies. Before it even hit the theaters it has been deemed a classic. If i remember right, it has been compared to Once Upon a Time in America (1984).Then i saw the movie with a weak story and some great scenography. Even the role of Jude Law or the appearance of Paul Newman haven't been able to improve the impressions.In any case, Road to Perdition has been considered a great movie, at least judging by the rating here and what you dig up on the internet. The only explanation i might have is that it Toma Hanks and Sam Mendes participated on it.Tom Hanks had been working hard from the beginning of ninety-nineties until this movie to cement his image as a character actor. After Road to Perdition it has been almost expected that a movie with him must be a blockbuster.Sam Mendes got unanimous praise from the media on the wave of success after American Beauty. However, after this one it took him almost a decade to repeat success at any rate with Skyfall (2012).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Road to Perdition is beautiful . . . and I mean really, really stunningly gorgeous.But just being sumptuously shot isn't good enough, you need a bit of substance; and that's where Sam Mendes' 40s set gangster film falls short.Admittedly, when you're in the same genre as films like Goodfellas and the The Godfather, it can be difficult to really stand out, but Road to Perdition is too cold and, dare I say it, boring to be held in the same regard as those masterpieces.It tells the story of gangster/failed family-man Michael (Tom Hanks) whose gangster family ? led by Paul Newman's John Rooney ? turn against him. He is forced to go on the run with his eldest son, impressively played by Tyler Hoechlin, as they are hunted down by Jude Law's semi- necrophilic hit-man.For such a stellar ensemble cast, much of the acting is surprisingly weak; especially Rooney Jr. played by Daniel Craig, boasting a pants mobster accent. But the two actors with the most screen time ? Hanks and Hoechlin ? manage to hold it together, and it is their father-son moments that carry the most emotional weight.At its heart, Road to Perdition is a film about a father being cast out by his adopted family (the gangsters) and finding his true family. That really is a beautiful message, and one that actually comes close to supplying some real heart. It's just that whenever the plot drifts back into a gangster revenge story, it just grinds to a halt, and apart from the gorgeous visuals, there is absolutely nothing worth investing your time in.It's does look good though . . .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite an outstanding cast (Tom Hanks, Jude Law, Daniel Craig and Paul Newman's final screen appearance), under-explored setting (organized crime in the depression-era midwest) and very solid inspiration (it's directly and admittedly influenced by Lone Wolf and Cub), this never quite congeals into anything more than a dull, formulaic revenge picture. Hanks, usually the beating heart of a film, is chained down by a dry, emotionless turn as a distant father figure whose young family is virtually wiped out by an out-of-control colleague. On the path to revenge he tries to reconnect with the only other survivor, his twelve-year-old son, but the two have such a faint rapport that the inevitable payoff lands on a flat note. Craig and Law are worthwhile in their roles as quirky, irredeemable psychopaths, but get so little screen time it's tough to develop an appreciation for the nuances of either. For the majority of the run time we're just tailing Hanks, at his most wooden, as he systematically wipes out the opposition. Bland, redundant, over-long material that misuses its many blessings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Too pleasant to be thrilling, too dark to be a straight feel-good father and son drama, Sam Mendes' gangster movie ? I say movie and not saga or epic because it's simply not epic enough ? is mostly just an exercise in style, but it's a pretty good one that can best be described as lots of rain dripping off of hats. There's also an interesting sequence near the beginning (during and after the death of Peter and Annie) that almost has a horror atmosphere. Throughout the cinematography is excellent, and there are a few really memorable shots.After what, mainly due to the sweeping score, feels like a 40-minute introduction, the story follows the gangster Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) and his son (Tyler Hoechlin) on their road to, well, in a sense, perdition. Without revealing too much, Tom Hanks looks exactly like he does in Cast Away towards the end. Before that, there are some good scenes, most notably one in which Hanks talks to his son about how he treated him differently from his other son, and one where Hanks learns that people are out to get him.Tom Hanks is almost annoyingly solid in this, sort of like a mob Meryl Streep. Daniel Craig is very good too and makes me look forward to seeing him with Mendes again in the upcoming Skyfall. However, I don't quite see what Mendes and the others were aiming for with this one, because overall it is quite pale, and the bookending narration feels like the kind of writing course stuff that probably irked people in American History X.</fullReview>

This tells the story of a young man, whose father (Hanks) has an odd job that he's not sure of, but something to do with another family, who has a mysterious past connected to his Dad. From what he gets at, his Dad is a "bodyguard" for the leader of the family (Paul Newman). When his brother asks what his Dad does, he decides it is best to find out. What he sees is not good, and when his Dad finds out, the family is not happy, he sees something nobody is supposed to see. The son of the head (Daniel Craig) decides to kill the son, but when he misses, the father must take his son and run for their lives. The plot thickens when a creepy assassin/photographer (Jude Law) gets hired for the kill. And that's only the beginning! I loved the art of RTP in the sense that you could always see what was coming, but not how it was coming, and just when you thought it was safe, you had to hold your breath.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked this film, but it was quite hard going at times; there's a very doomed tone to it ? partly to do with the voice-over (also used in Mendes' previous, American Beauty). A voice of fate perhaps. I was also pleased to see three interesting British actors. Ciaran Hinds, briefly. Also Daniel Craig doing his version of what Tim Roth, Sean Bean etc. do and an excellent turn from Jude Law as a Very Nasty Man.The film looks at the Faustian nosedive that organised criminals buy into from the perspective of the innocent ? Michael Sullivan (Tyler Hoechlin), son of the grudgingly criminal Hanks. Running (effectively) two stories in tandem, a boy growing close to his father and both of them on the run from the mob, the film inevitably has its debts to The Godfather and The Sting amongst others. Mendes uses Hanks' fluency with comedy to really nurture some humanising humour through the middle of the film. All are ably served with some brief but terrifying scenes with Newman as the business-hearted capo acting everyone else into a dunces' corner. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Less Interesting Than It Appears</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Mendes abandons the sitcom loopiness of his first feature, `American Beauty', for an earnest, plodding father-son bonding follow-up that, if it weren't for the violence, would make for a fitting episode of the `Hallmark Hall Of Fame'. It also features one of the least interesting performances by Tom Hanks in ages, shallow, manipulative work designed to stack the deck in his favor. He plays a Depression-era hit man forced to take his young son on the lam after his wife (a wasted Jennifer Jason Leigh) and another son are murdered; the murderer is the son (Daniel Craig) of Hanks' beloved crime lord boss (Paul Newman, also lost) who has raised Hanks as if he were his own son. With all this male Freudian blather, you would think Mendes would want to air it out at least a little bit but Conrad L. Hall's monotonous visuals of a bleak Midwest winter, though they're suitable given the title, further adds to the dismal, literal tone and Thomas Newman's score is dull and portentous. Mendes still comes off as a British student off on the grand tour--he wants to pass off his foreign observations as original and caustic but, after two films, he can't seem to come up with a fresh slant and his precocious mocking of American mores and history still seems uncalled-for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dull and rather pathetic film in places, however...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film focuses around a man's bond with his son and his struggle to keep his head high in the deepest of situations.When i saw this film it came across as an incredibly dull film. The picture was dark and bleak which, i know is what the film crew are aiming for but it really doesn't aid the film. It's a gangster film and for this you would expect this dark, powerful, misty stand offs but there was something different with this film, something wrong. There never seemed to be any kick in the film it just seemed to stream on like a uneducated child's sentences.This brings me to my next point which, in all fairness isn't a great annoyance. Now forgive me if i am wrong but what i don't appear to get is this ending. The only way to prove my point is to unleash a spoiler at this part...*SPOILER*In the end Tom Hanks just walks up to everyone he needs revenge on and kills them. Now what i can't see here is why didn't he just do that in the first place? I mean he just walked in, did the job and walked out.*END OF SPOILER*Putting these points aside this film does deliver some good things, Tom Hanks puts together another solid performance and some scenes in the film are decent and manage to wake you up.Worth a rent...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The great problem in American pictures since the beginning, is the relations between parents and children. Europeans can hardly stand the sentimentality, the badly acted tears, the long glimpses through the tears, the good hearts, "the despites of" and so on. This is another example. Very young watchers might like the father/son-feelings here, but not a more mature audience.Anyhow this isn't for young watchers. It's another gangster melodrama, well performed by Tom Hanks end even better by Jude Law, although Law in many way is making a comic book ratlike hitman. Paul Newman goes on routine.The worst thing about this it that it sometimes is boring. What happened to 90 minute-movies? It's difficult filling up two hours. It's a too big suit for most directors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had big expectations after checking imdb rating and seeing Tom Hanks, Paul Newman and Sam Mendes in movie credits. I was very disappointed after watching it. Screenplay is very bad - one of the most predictable of all movie I have seen, characters can't predict simple actions, actions of such characters as Nitty and Capone in confrontation with main character (Hanks) are totally unlogical. Sadly acting of such great people is quite average. It's not ganger movie, not action movie nor family, I really don't know where to classify it. It's very hardly comparable to similar-theme "Leon Professional". Shame Dreamworks - 5/10 (only cause big cast names, without them - 3/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I notice this film has already made it into the imdb top #250, which puzzles me somewhat considering it's one of the most run-of-the-mill films I've seen in years.Not wanting to drone on about it, I just felt there was nothing there: the plot was incredibly thin and predictable, and seemed to act purely as a vessel for Mendes' (impressive) direction.After looking forward to seeing Hanks playing a 'bad guy' for once, I was disappointed (although admittedly not surprised) to see him playing a character with not a bad bone in his body. Yes he has an 'evil' job, but his morals are good and we are on his side throughout the film. And watching him playing the quiet good-guy for the 1,000,000th time in his career means there wasn't even room to concentrate on developing interesting characters (a la American Beauty). Don't get me wrong - there's nothing inherently wrong with it - there's just nothing unique with it either. True story - the day after I saw it somebody asked me what I watched at the cinema the day before. It took me 30 seconds to remember! 5/10</fullReview>

Road to Perdition contained music from American Beauty. I know it's widespread, but unless you are convinced the already existing piece fits the scene perfectly, you should have new music composed. In this film, the original score did not fit the new images, making it seem awkward and unfitting.Road to Perdition: not one to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Road to Perdition" is a gangster flick (circa 1930) about a Tommy gun goon (Hanks) who is also a loving, caring family man. He has a score to settle and, with his young son in tow, goes off to take on a top local mobster (Newman). Lopsided in favor of showcasing auteursmanship over audience appreciation, this drab, moody flick is an overhyped, artful shoot with a good cast which moves along at a snail's pace as it delivers its only marginally interesting story ultimately ending with a laughable scene reminiscent of something from "Lassie". Oh happy day! I will have to defer to critics and public alike who gave this flick high marks as I personally was disappointed, double-timed through the boring filler, never could make the buy-in, and gave the flick an undeserved B- for B-udget only.

		<shortDescription>Strange to think that this was a graphic novel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Usually, I never would have guessed that a graphic novel could get adapted as such an impressive movie. But it was, as was a later adaptation ("Sin City"). "Road to "Perdition" portrays hit-man Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) wondering how to protect his son (Tyler Hoechlin) from the mafia life in 1931 Chicago, while also hoping to remain loyal to godfather John Rooney (Paul Newman). The movie looks at a number of things: the poverty prevalent in the Depression, and the pragmatism of the people involved in organized crime. As Rooney says in one scene: "None of us will ever see heaven." I think that it's very appropriate that Tom Hanks and Paul Newman eventually co-starred in a movie; after all, Tom Hanks was to his generation what Paul Newman was to his generation. All in all, a really good movie. Also starring Jennifer Jason Leigh, Jude Law, and Stanley Tucci.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a sad and terrible movie. Tom Hanks tries to play a gangster but he can never look MEAN! The story is not very good. We are supposed ( think) to have sympathy for Tom because years ago he took the only job he could find to feed his family. This is not believable. Many families were having a very hard time getting food on the table in those days, but how many of them became Hit Men? Instead, they found an honest way to survive. Perhaps someone can fill me in on the ending. Tom was taking his son to his sister's place to leave him for her to raise, but when he got there, the murdering started. The sister was not seen. At the ending of the film the son was walking across the field to a house that looked different from the one where his aunt lived. Who finally ended up rearing him? It's been a while since I saw this film. Perhaps I have forgotten some of the clues. Even though I did not find this movie to be a good one, I liked it much better than American Beauty. That film was absolutely AWFUL!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Style Over Substance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the graphic novel by Max Allan Collins, which was in turn based very loosely on various factual stories of the 1930s, THE ROAD TO PERDITION tells the story of Michael Sullivan, a family man and thoroughly nice guy who also happens to be an enforcer and hit man for the Irish Mob. Sullivan strives to keep his homelife separate from his work--but son Michael Jr. precipitates disaster when he follows his father and witnesses a murder. Determined to both protect his son and have revenge on the mob boys who have suddenly turned on him, Sullivan goes on the run with Michael, and in the process finally "finds his heart" through his determination that young Michael will never walk his road.There is a great deal to like about this film. The cinematography is astonishingly beautiful and extremely well supported by the editing, which is among the best I've ever seen, and the soundtrack, which lends the story a melancholy depth. Many of the cast members are also exceptional, most particularly Jude Law, who creates perhaps the most chilling killer seen on screen in a decade. But the film has two significant problems: the plot and the star.There are several issues with the plot, but the overwhelming one is its predictability. There is nothing new until one reaches midpoint, when Sullivan--with the assistance of his son--attempts to force the mafia to permit his revenge via a series of bank robberies in which he takes only mafia money. This was quite an original idea, and very intriguing, so I was doubly frustrated when the film took yet another predictable twist that effectively negated that rather large chunk of film time.As for Tom Hanks--he is an extraordinary actor, and the role of a hit-man seemed a unique opportunity for him to blow off the super-likable parts for which he has become famous. But instead of doing this, Tom Hanks essentially gives a standard super-likable Tom Hanks performance, and I found it increasingly difficult to believe him as a mob enforcer, much less to give his drive for bloody revenge any credence.When all is said and done, what is left is a film that essentially holds you by virtue of sheer cinematic technique. THE ROAD TO PERDITION has an amazing sense of style and creates an amazing visual portrait of the era, and that--along with such performers as Jude Law--held my interest to the end. But far from "finding its heart," the film is hollow, a matter of style over substance, and I found the story obvious, the conclusion foregone, and the statement commonplace. Final thought: the scenery is pretty, but the trip goes nowhere.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ghastly overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The hype for this movie was so incredible that I thought I was about to witness The Godfather Part IV. Instead, I literally witnessed The Godfather Part IV, Miller's Crossing 2: The Return of Casper and Conrad L. Hall: The Movie all in one setting. The first (and biggest) problem with this movie is the screenplay. It might as well have been written by a nineteen year-old gangster film buff. It reads like it was written by someone who learned everything they know about the mafia through watching movies...and doing a poor job at even THAT. The family business and Sullivan's relationship with the Paul Newman character is only assessed in a brief spatter of dialogue in which Hanks explains the family business to his son. One of the principle characters, Al Capone, (whose iron will results in the murder of the only female star in the film less than twenty minutes into the first act and Sullivan's youngest, forcing him and his oldest son to go on the run) is never even seen! Instead we see one of his underlings played an extremely miscast and unusually subpar Stanley Tucci, in what could have been a bit part. The subplot of the hitman searching for Sullivan feels so tacked on, it's almost as if the producers included the Jude Law character in a last ditch effort to ensure that at least ONE teenage girl would go to see the masculine dominated piece of shite. This is in no way a gangster movie like The Godfather (to which it has been compared by a small collected of narrow minded imbeciles who probably can't even tell me which movie "leave the gun, take the canoli" comes from) nor is it in any way a family movie. The Godfather defined two genres. The gangster film and the family film. If films were people Road to Perdition isn't worthy enough to kiss the Godfather's ass. There are two female characters in the entire movie [sic] (both of which could have been bit parts) so how the hell could this be considered a family movie. I can't believe feminists haven't taken an interest in what could be considered a male chauvanist movie solely because there are no female character for the entire 2nd act, and the better part of the 1st and 3rd. This is a shrewd, pointless, cliched story about fathers and their sons and "bringin' home the bacon" and as if the ONE scene in which we see Sullivan do his dirty work wasn't irritating enough, there's a tacked on voice over of a grown Michael sullivan Jr. talking about how after the day his father died "he never picked up a gun again." There's nothing this film has accomplished that even the worst "life in the hood" movies have. The visual structure is a different story alltogether. I won't be surprised if Mendes scores another oscar for direction (despite the fact that he really, truly deserved the award for American Beauty) and I'll be outraged if Conrad L. Hall doesn't win the oscar for cinematography. he's a seasoned veteran and the BEST at what he does. his contribution to this hackneyed metaphorical 20-car pile up is so audacious yet beautiful at the same time it almost makes this film worth seeing. but in my opinion...steer clear. this was just an accident waiting to happen. i'm also quite surprised at Mendes, who proved himself to be a consumate director with Beauty. the scenes are poorly composed and generally boring to look at. watch this one with the mute button on. hanks has never been worst and newman proves that he's too old to act anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terribly Boring this Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No one wanted to like this movie more then me, but unfortunately for me it was pants. Which of course was very depressing.It was obvious really what Mendes was going for here, a slow moving poetic elegy of a film. On the evidence of American Beauty you would expect him to be really in the zone here. American Beauty was a film that showed very real and tender human emotion without sugar or schmaltz. However, here the audience are cheated out of a good film by the lack of direction in this movie. I patiently enjoyed the slowness of the film, the beautiful vistas that Mendes used. But the film really lacked punch where it needed it. All of the big scenes between the main protagonists where empty affairs. Maybe it was the two dimensional nature of the characters, dragged as they were, from a graphic novel. Spoiler: The scene between Tom Hanks and Paul Newman at the end of the film should have been akin to the powerful scenes of the Godfather, but it simply failed to deliver. Actually the Godfather is probably the best thing to compare it to. Not just because it is at, or near the pinnacle of gangster movies, but also because the Godfather says more about father son relationships than the Road to Perdition, despite the rather unsubtle studio trailer. Its a petty thing to comment on after the release of the film, but the trailer for this movie was blatant in its underlining of the films themes of Father and Son, Crime and Redemption. Perhaps because even passing reference to them was actually missing from the film.This combined with a VERY predictable end spoiled the film. I was simply bored waiting for the 30-40 seconds until Jude Law finally put Hanks out of his, and my, misery.In this film Mendes probably had his whole way. After American Beauty he could work with anybody he wanted and the daily screenings at the studios probably convinced the executives that they could smell an Oscar. But to me this was a bland film that starts slow, ambles in the middle and ends predictably.</fullReview>

Beginning with a decent yet unimpressive portrayal of a mobster family, Road to Perdition finds itself chock full of mostly lackluster acting (Jude Law being the exception, portraying the only interesting character in the film) and overly predictable plotlines. I am tempted to say that this was the most predictable movie I had ever seen, but Pearl Harbor I had pinned down thirty minutes in (not the war part, but the sad excuse of a "story"). If you are going to watch this movie, my only advice is to either do so alone, or with people who don't mind you blurting out what will happen twenty minutes in advance. You will be doing so, as there is not much else to do in the long gaps of inaction. I almost forgot about the insanely slow pace of the movie.

		<fullReview>This film suffers from a number of serious flaws. First, the story is not engaging or very believable. In the middle of a city a gun fight breaks involving at least one machine gun against a horde of body guards and yet no one lifts a finger to call the police, and auto traffic has apparently ceased so as not to ruin the fight, I suppose. Many other similar scenes detract heavily. Second, there is too much gunplay to develop an interesting plot. As a result, several scenes were never completed. For example, the little boy in the train station - why was he left there? What is so significant about the book the little boy is reading through the film that it uses so much of the precious little time remaining after all the gunplay? In summary, technically the film failed pretty badly. Tom Hanks and Paul Newman did well in acting out their roles but these performances were not enough to turn the film into entertainment that is worth seeing.</fullReview>

He seems to be getting over a two-week drinking binge. Paul Newman looks old and listless. It's really sad to see such a great acting talent as Newman's wasted in this junk. What's even harder to think about is that Paul Newman is still racing cars at 81! The movie plot is old and the story is one of the most stupid around. Typical one-man army kills over dozens of foes. Tom Hanks shoots down Paul Newman and 6 of his bodyguards in one of the stupidest shootouts ever seen. Every time there's a gun battle, no one in town seems to notice and the police are no where around. Paul Newman is a top crime boss and he can't kill off one man. The father-son relationship is wooden and cold, and the so-called humorous part of Hanks teaching his son to drive the get away car is milked to death. The whole movie stinks and the ending was seen a mile away. Pure garbage. If you want to see some great gangster films rent The Roaring 20s, Public Enemy Number 1, or Little Cesar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilariously mediocre story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three of Hollywood's softest actors are thrown together into one of the dullest stories in cinema history, playing pseudo-subtle maffiosi. Mob man's family gets killed by his own clan, and the man takes revenge! It's quite fantastic to see Tommy Soft &amp; Serious Hanks playing a tormented maffioso who has to choose between mob loyalty and family (you feel the tension). Add teddy bear Jude Law as a nasty assassin (I couldn't stop laughing), and Paul Newman as the Godfather (can you imagine?), and we have the perfect ingredients for a laugh-kick. Since there is no plot, we must stick to discussing the merits of using perfect-son-in-law actors as gangsters. No workie.I often wondered whether this movie was intended as a comedy, but the more moralistic the story got, the more I understood that Tom Hanks (the moralist of all moralists) must have had the brilliant idea of using himself to prove that maffiosi do have feelings too. Besides deserving an Oscar for worst cast in history, I urge technically minded individuals to investigate whether my DVD laserhead simply spinned too sloooooooooowwwwwwwwwwwwwwly, or whether Mendes was actually serious about this wicked tempo. Awful movies often have a reason to be called awful. This one is too empty to have reasons.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Directorial ego trips have never been more obvious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Has a film ever been more pretentious than this? Sam Mendes, still riding the tidal wave of riches provided by "American Beauty", clearly sees himself as the movie guru of all time. In "Road to perdition" Mendes has managed to bog down an admirable tale about father and son relationships, into a pretentious directorial ego trip that shouts into your face, "OOOO, I've won an oscar!" Mr Mendes has a lot to learn about film. He may know what to do with the camera, but he does not have to place it up one's own rear end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's sad story about revenge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Generally boring. The reason I watched this movie to the very end is Tom Hanks. The Gangsters rule the city and Tom Hanks was one of them until they killed his family. Then He decided to take a revenge cruel revenge. Nothing special.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>moronic trash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Depressingly bad, especially since it has been produced by the same team as the excellent American Beauty. Director Sam Mendes has already gone out of creative juices, Conrad Hall's cinematography is soulless and not up to his own standards, and Tom Hanks' performance is hollow and boring.Very, very, very, very disappointing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Road To Perdition is sentimental, cliched crap, masked by good cinematography. Who actually enjoyed this movie? I think people won't admit they didn't get what was so great about this boring movie because they're afraid people will think they are stupid or unworthy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Road to Perdition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From director Sam Mendes, he follows the outstanding American Beauty with this fantastic period gangster crime drama. Basically for ages young Michael Sullivan Jr. (Tyler Hoechlin) believed his father, Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) was a man who worked for the man who brought him up since childhood, John Rooney (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Paul Newman). With his father, Michael goes to the funeral of one of John's friends, and there a drunk guy makes bad comments at the wake. Curious to know what his "Pa" does, Michael Jr. hides in his car, and witnesses his "Pa" killing the drunk guy, and he is caught peeking. John after this, secretly, hires assassins to kill them. They only managed to kill Michael Jr.'s younger brother Peter (Liam Aiken) and mother Annie (Jennifer Jason Leigh), so now him and his "Pa" are on the run from the mob, and along the way trying to find the man/men responsible. John meanwhile has hired professional hit-man Harlen Maguire (Jude Law) to find and kill them. It is through this journey of robberies and killing that Michael and his son get closer than they ever did before. Before finding out it was John that hired them, he also found out that John's snivelling son, Connor (Daniel Craig, 4 years before becoming James Bond) had been stealing from his Dad. It ends in tragedy though when after killing John, that Michael is gunned down by scarred (from glass) Harlen, before being shot, and he dies in his son's arms. Also starring The Terminal's Stanley Tucci as Frank Nitti, Happiness's Dylan Baker as Alexander Rance and Ciarán Hinds as Finn McGovern. Filled with marvellous action, gun firing and chase sequences, and the teary ending, it is a fantastic drama. It won the Oscar for Best Cinematography, and it was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Music for Thomas Newman, Best Sound and Best Sound Editing, and it won the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography and Best Production Design. Jude Law was number 60, Paul Newman number 16, and Tom Hanks number 3 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Law was also number 10 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, and Hanks was also number 39 on The World's Greatest Actor. Very good!</fullReview>
