		<fullReview>Undeniably Hoosiers would get the win, if they ever polled film buffs and critics asking what the best movie is revolving around basketball. Hoosiers, the movie about a failing Indiana high school basketball team being led to success by their new coach played by Gene Hackman and the drunken assistant coach (Dennis Hooper) has enjoyed its fair share of the spotlight. Granted the field of movies about basketball isn't nearly as deep as say movies with plots concerning baseball or boxing, Hoosiers still generally beats out what little competition there is.However in my opinion the best movie to ever capture the game of hoops is the criminally underrated and underseen White Men Can't Jump, by director Ron Shelton. Shelton also brought us the more popular baseball film Bull Durham and the golf flick Tin Cup. But I'd argue White Men Can't Jump is his centerpiece. The story revolves around two street court b-ball hustlers. One new in town, smooth, and white (Woody Harrelson), undoubtedly to his advantage. The other man, a black, a veteran of the LA courts, and fast-talking (Wesley Snipes). After Harrelson hustles Snipes the two form an unlikely partnership "ebony and ivory" but as always it is on edge and lacks a required amount of trust. For a film that was released in the aftermath of the Rodney King beating and the L.A. riots and just before the O.J. Simpson debacle, White Men Can't Jump is surprisingly mature, witty, light hearted and open-minded in its approach to the race issue. Ron Shelton's dialogue is amazingly rapid fire and smart. It bites and certainly has a sting to it, but it's all in good fun. The multi-flamboyant personalities on the outdoor L.A. street courts hustler each other, crack "yo-mama" jokes with one another, and try to look better than the other. This is the movie that really put Wesley Snipes on the map and showed that Woody Harrelson was far more than just another face in the "Cheers" ensemble. Both provide excellent work in not only playing the characters but also learning how to play basketball and talk like actual street hustlers. There's very few standins here. Both Snipes and Harrelson learned to play the sport as well as any actor could be expected to. Rosie Perez is good as Harrelson's annoying and overbearing Puerto Rican girlfriend. If any one word can describe White Men Can't Jump, that word is "fun." The movie tackles serious issues like hustling, family, relationships, race, life in poverty, and gambling debts. However if Robert Rossen's pool hall film The Hustler presented the dark side of the life, Ron Shelton's White Men Can't Jump shows the flip side of the coin. How hustling can be fun and games. Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"White Men Can't Jump" is an hysterically funny movie that is one of the funniest I've seen. Director Ron Shelton has made other sports comedies before but this is his best one. Wesely Snipes and Woody Harrelson play off each other perfectly and make a memorable team. This film is highly profane but it has very inventive and witty dialoge. A very funny film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A gritty comedy set in some tough LA neighborhoods about two basketball hustlers, one white (Woody Harrelson), the other black (Wesley Snipes). After hustling each other, they finally team up to play in a tournament, where with a combination of skill and trash talk they defeat the two guys who normally would have left them in the dust. The trash talk gets silly at times, while the subplot of underworld characters who are chasing Harrelson for an unpaid debt seems to be there only to explain logically why he hustles in the first place, as if he would do something else with his life. In any event, the games go from Venice Beach to Watts, and the settings are as good as the stars. Especially so are the cheap motels where Harrelson and girlfriend Rosie Perez have to live, and the inner city apartment where Snipes and his wife Tyra Ferrel call home, all of which adds up to a realistic slice of life at the time, which now seems to look quite a bit different. Intelligently written and well photographed, it has laid in the back of the shelves at countless video stores waiting to be rediscovered.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a truly excellent movie! Lots of people have bashed it as a "basketball" movie, but the truth is, it ain't about basketball at all. It could have been hockey, dart playing or curling, it wouldn't matter. It's about human weaknesses and making new friends. Rosie Perez gave probably her best performance ever, and the interplay between Harrelson and Snipes is great. Don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After Billy Hoyle hustles Sidney Deane on the basketball court, Deane offers Billy a proposition about teaming up to hustle the courts of Los Angeles. They are a great team, they are in fact wonderful players, but egos and greed are sure to become a problem, oh and Billy has some rather unsavoury characters after him to return a debt he owes. Can the boys resolve their differences? Can they keep their devoted women happy? All will be revealed in White Men Can't Jump.White Men Can't Jump is a fine sports movie, offering up more than just a basic sport heart, it's funny, sly and really a rather effective piece of drama. The basketball scenes are very well handled by director Ron Shelton, with slow motion spins and beady drips of sweat glistening in the heat, and the chemistry between Woody Harrelson (Billy) and Wesley Snipes (Sidney) is first class, but really it's the power of Shelton's writing that makes this a most engaging picture (see also Bull Durham &amp; the similarly undervalued Tin Cup).After following these two guys thru their very rocky relationship you get to a point where you feel that we are about to wander down formula road, but Shelton pulls a trick to make the final last quarter an excellent, none conformity piece of film, one that judging by the less than favourable rating on this particular site, has not been wholly appreciated. Shame that, because other than Rosie Perez doing her best to annoy the viewers to death as Billy's suffering girlfriend Gloria Clemente, White Men Can't Jump is one of the better sports movies of the 90s. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is well-made: it tells a good story, and maintains high production values. The playing-off of different cultures does not really work, but then again that was not central to the story. The hustler being hustled theme could have done with some more Roald Dahl-like wit, but all in all this is an amusing comedy (it does not reach out enough to be considered a dramedy) and a worthy rental for those boring winter evenings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ron Shelton does it again. He does a great job of capturing the culture of basketball hustlers and how they go from court to court hustling games and making money. He gets everything right even down to the trash talk on the court. Woody Harrelson is perfect as the n'er do well Billy and Wesley Snipes is perfect as the fast talking Sidney. This also to me is the breakout performance of Rosie Perez. Perez is perfect as Billy's kookie girlfriend Gloria. This film is definitely a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lively Basketball Adventure.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You don't have to be a fan of basketball to enjoy this feel-good, humorous, dramatic, and lively story of two very good players, Wesley Snipes as Sidney and Woody Harrelson, and their women, Rosie Perez and Tyra Ferrell.What lingo on the courts! What scurrilous insults are hurled back and forth with no one blinking an eye, what elegant contumely -- "Chump!", "Go on back to Mayberry," "Is your head made out of braille?" The basketball games played on neighborhood courts in LA are well shot, and the slow motion, finally, occupies an appropriate space in the narrative. Snipes, who is black, is a terrific action figure and his insults approach the rococo. Woody Harrelson, who is white, is not quite in the same acting league but manages to carry the part of Snipes' partner in the hustling game quite well. We don't get to see much of Snipes' wife, Tyra Ferrell, who wants nothing more than for her man to get a steady and sufficiently rewarding job to get them out of Vista Vue Apartments, where "there is no vista and there is no view and there sure as hell is no view of no vista." Perez also has vague longings of settling down and gives Harrelson two grand to buy smart-looking suits so he can make an impression in job interviews. (He squirts the money away, as usual.) The game of basketball, although it takes up considerable film space, is really not much more than a tool that allows the film makers to explore the relationship between a white guy and an African-American guy, neither of whom is more than usually predisposed towards racial harmony. There's an entertaining comic argument about whether Harrelson, who enjoys listening to Jimi Hendrix on the tape deck of his dilapidated car ("a classic") can really HEAR Hendrix. It's not enough just to LIKE him. Snipes is nonplussed to learn that Hendrix's drummer was a white guy.The movie is a fantasy. The likelihood of these two oddly matched hustlers making scads of dough on the courts of Watts, and walking away with their body parts intact, never mind the money, isn't particularly high. Three of the characters -- Snipes, Harrelson, and Perez -- are extraordinarily bright and articulate within the limits of their conventions. Perez wins more than ten thousand dollars on "Jeopardy." And the two men are whizzes on the court. The film SEEMS to be about race, but it's not. Except for the insults, race doesn't enter into the story at all. Harrelson might as well be black himself. He not only talks the talk, he dribbles the dribble. The whole issue of white racism and black solidarity is swept under the rug.That's not to denigrate the movie. It's a lot of fun. The air on the courts is foggy with the most gut-churning calumny. It becomes poetic at times. And the movie never turns sentimental. There are no important speeches on how we all have to live together -- men and women, as well as black and white. Thank God for small favors. The friendship that develops between Snipes and Harrelson never turns "warm." Like most male friendships, it turns on instrumental behavior -- joint effort on the courts. And the movie ends on exactly that kind of note.Not bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every chance I get I will watch this movie when it is broadcast. I just love it, if not for the sport, but the characters and the scenery. I feel like I am at a California Beach with them. I love the way Wesley and Woody interact with each other and could not imagine any other actor taking either of their places. I wish they would have made a WMCJ II. Their skill in playing is quite remarkable and very entertaining. Their lines that they hit off each other with immediate comebacks are very witty. The admiration that they had for each other was kept very well hidden until the director decided to let you get a glimpse of their feelings. A great movie with great actors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable Basketball Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Basketball comedy "White Men Can't Jump" doesn't necessitate a love for the all American game that has recently been sweeping the globe in a wave of popularity. This is mainly due to the genuinely funny script which cleverly makes use of white/black cultural comparisons while tastefully playing the two ethnic groups against each other, with enjoyable results.Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes give two fresh, lively performances as a couple of basketball hustlers who go from court to court taking on other hot shot players in high priced games of two on two. Some of their exploits land them in hot water, while Billy (Harrelson) has his hands full keeping his girlfriend (Rosie Perez) happy and staying one step ahead of gangsters (whom he owes money), Sidney (Snipes) struggles to keep his wife and child in the manner to which they would like to be accustomed. Woody's Billy Hoyle and Wesley's Sidney Deane spend a lot of time dissin' (running each other down) and bragging on their own talents. This, and Rosie Perez's nutty antics as a "Jeopardy" crazed flake, provides most of the humour, although watch for "Raymond's" attempt at armed robbery for the definite highlight.Writer/director Ron Shelton has managed a script which is both interesting and funny enough to keep his audience entertained for the duration, and he has thankfully not fallen into the trap of winding up with an altogether happy and predictable ending.Sunday, September 25, 1994 - Video</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Woody Harrelson is a white con artist, in this buddy comedy who hustles basketball games with black players, lulling his victims into the misguided notion that white men can't match up with black ballers. One of his victims, Wesley Snipes, becomes Harrelson's "agent," arranging his various inner city scams. Snipes doesn't feel as though he's selling out his own people; he goes along with Harrelson to provide a better life for his wife (Tyra Ferrell) and son. Crooked gamblers intrude upon the last scenes of the film, but Harrelson is rescued by his girlfriend Rosie Perez, a Jeopardy freak who realizes a lifelong dream by winning big on the game show. I liked this movie, I still laugh at the old trash talk they dish out, if you play hoops this is a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not really about basketball at all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A movie that on the surface appears to be about sport - basketball- has a much deeper undertone if you look closer, a movie that uses the sport as a metaphor for the distinctions between blacks and whites in America. I've always loved this movie, i first saw it many years ago when i was about 14 and felt the wit and chemistry between harrelson and snipes is top notch, now im older i see things i didn't see before. Personally i feel you can take the movie in two ways. you either see it as a buddy comedy or a movie which shows how blacks and whites view each other. the way in which snipes is presented may be a cliché - black man, ultra confident, feels that coz hes black hes better than harrelson - but is this a cliché? most of the black guys in the movie feel that harrelsons character billy is a 'chump', and are quick to put him down. even the movies title 'white men cant jump' is a thinly vieled reference to the viewpoint of black America. this is not a racist perspective, its simply how it is, sidney (snipes) even gets into a discussion with harrelson about jimmy hendrix, about his apparently white drummer and how billy cant listen to hendrix, he can only hear him. billy for his part, uses the fact that hes a white guy to his advantage when he and snipes are hustling. these class colour elements serve to make white men cant jump a far better movie than it is given credit for, and is worth a better look if you think its just another sports comedy.

		<shortDescription>Terrible.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know a movie is bad when the highlight of it is being able to see a brief moment of "Jeopardy!".The saddest thing about White Men Can't Jump is that it had tremendous potential. For several years, I lived in area quite like that portrayed in this film; racial tensions were high, and basketball meant everything to everyone. A film about the members of this "basketball culture" could have been very interesting, but the mediocre acting and poor script in White Men Can't Job left something to be desired.The movie's sequence of events is cyclical. First, Billy either wins or loses money by playing a game of basketball. He then returns to his home and lounges around with his girlfriend; and the process is repeated. Most stories build up to a climax of some kind, but the "climax" I saw was just another sequence in this repetition (this case being "Billy either wins or loses money by playing a game of basketball").In order for a plot to develop, some dilemma must be resolved; and this dilemma must be interesting if the film is going to be interesting as well. Apparently the writers of White Men Can't Jump forgot this rule, as the plot can be summarized as "Billy needs to pay the bills." I appreciated the change of pace from other formulaic sports movies, but -- I'm sorry -- this was just plain awful. I could have cared less if Billy got the money to pay the rent for his apartment.Despite all this, White Men Can't Jump is a successful film. Apparently some adamant sports fans will dismiss terrible writing for a few scenes with a basketball in them. Others, I'm sure, were lured by the big names playing the leading roles. This leaves me to wonder, if the cast was replaced entirely with previously unknown actors, and the basketball theme was replaced with lacrosse, would anyone have bothered watching this movie? I really don't think so.I'll give this movie two stars out of ten; the extra star is for the "Jeopardy!" scene, which kept me awake for a few minutes. Thanks, Trebek.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you like basketball at all, you're going to love this movie. If you like to make fun of your friends, you're going to love this movie. Witty comedy that doesn't offend (that's hard to come by these days). Billy Hoyle (Woody Harrelson) is a street-wise basketball player with something to prove. He heads to Venice Beach to hustle big-time players for money. Hoyle bites off more than he can chew when he meets up with Sydney Dean (Wesley Snipes) and becomes the victim of a hustle himself. However, Dean and Hoyle can't deny the bond of friendship between them, no matter how hard they try. When Billy loses his girlfriend because he loses all of their money and Dean's home is robbed they turn to each other for the solution...The direction is sharp and the cinematography is surprisingly impressive as the mean streets of Los Angeles are caught with striking camera shots. The under-rated screenplay is intelligent, focused, and clever. All in all "White Men Can't Jump" is far from being a classic, but it is still a fine film that is better than many think. The fact that Shelton can lay down such heavy themes in what is otherwise a hilarious romp about street basketball and the fine art of smack talk says volumes about his talent as a screenwriter. He's helped in great measure by both Snipes and Harrelson, who were not only good enough at the game to be practically Division III-quality players according to one of the former NBA pros who served as a technical adviser on the film, but were also good enough to handle the fast pace of the dialogue. Snipes is especially impressive, bursting with energy, in phenomenal shape, relishing the nonstop banter. He handles the (few) quieter moments like a pro, too. The real story; however, is one of loyalty, betrayal and eventually friendship. This is a smart and funny movie that transcends the "sports movie" genre. Overall rating: 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

It turns out that Billy is a former college player. Sidney lives with his very loud girlfriend Jeopardy-obsessed Gloria Clemente (Rosie Perez) on the run from thugs. Sidney suggests teaming up to hustle some real money before competing in a two on two tournament.There are plenty of yo'mama jokes. It's ridiculous. It's irreverent. It's hilarious. Snipes and Harrelson have great chemistry. Rosie Perez is a gem. She's not only a looker but also an explosive personality. This is simply a fun, fun romp. The movie tries its best to make the guys look good on the court. It succeeds for the most part. This is a great trio and a fun time with racial comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Basketball and hustling comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In White Men Can't Jump, Billy Hoyle uses other players' expectations of what a typical street-ball basketball player looks like to his advantage to hustle them. He is a white guy who dresses "like a chump" so that other players doubt that he can play. The first guy that Billy hustles is Sidney, who is one of the best players in the area. These guys join forces as two of the best hustlers to go around and play against whoever is willing and good enough to bet money on a game. The movie very effectively captures the attitudes and atmosphere surrounding this form of basketball, while also incorporating bits of comedy that make the movie more entertaining. As someone who enjoys the game of basketball, this movie was very intriguing to me as it successfully introduced a brand of basketball that I am unfamiliar with. This movie focuses equally on the hustler lifestyle and the everyday troubles these basketball hustlers face as well as the sport of basketball. Sports certainly don't seem to be the only emphasis of this movie, which may steer some viewers away from this movie. If one is looking for a typical basketball movie, then this may not be the movie for you. Although, it still teaches sports fans, specifically basketball fans, about a sports culture that may seem foreign to the majority them, which may be captivating and make this movie worthwhile to others.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Recently I have been so trapped in another round of emotional lows that I can't turn to anybody for any comfort. I am always thinking that I lack talent and that the only way I can be qualified, not successful, in competitions with others is to work harder than them so that my diligence makes up for my weaknesses. I admire the talented so much.With this in mind, I rented WHITE MEN CAN'T JUMP and it made me feel like a new person. Wesley and Woody are great together. The screenplay is intelligent, focused and clever. This is a truly excellent movie, and it becomes poetic at times. Overall, I can give it no less than 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>White Men Can't Jump is a good movie with a well written storyline and a great comedic cast.Its not an outstanding comedy,but it has plenty of funny scenes and there is good chemistry between Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes.The movie is almost two hours long which I think is certainly too long for a comedy like this,the plot definitely felt tiring after a while.Wesley Snipes was a really good comedic actor in this,I liked him even more than Harrelson,which says a lot because I'm a huge fan of Woody Harrelson,Snipes was really funny and confident and he definitely should have starred in more comedies.White Men Can't Jump is a good movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good comedy if they got some time to kill.A con artist who hustles basketball games joins forces with a talented player to double their chances.Best Performance: Wesley Snipes Worst Performance: Rosie PerezIf you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't really know how to tag this one. A crime sports drama? Yes we will call it that, a crime sports drama. This flick is about Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes (two of my favorite actors) who combine their talents to hustle playground basketball games in Los Angeles, Billy all the while trying to maintain the affection of his girlfriend Gloria (Rosie Perez), and pay back mobsters whom he owes money to. Then of course Sidney Deane (Snipes) is trying to maintain a steady income to support his wife. So in short that is a little plot summary. Now onto what I liked about this movie.For starters, I thought that both Wes and Woody fit quite well into these roles. Snipes has always fit well into sketchy, shady, or villainous roles as observed in movies like the Blade Trilogy and Demolition Man, so a sort of scumbag hustler fit Snipes well in this movie. In addition I thought Harrelson was a good add to this movie as Snipes partner. Something about Harrelson's personality and acting makes him a perfect fit for this film.What was great about this movie were all of the twists in the already interesting plot. You have Harrelson, a white schmuck hustling these street ballers for income, the last guy you would expect to get whooped by in a game of basketball, so when he teams up with Snipes, another seasoned hustler it makes for an already great movie. Then you throw in Billy's girlfriend Gloria, an aspiring Jeopardite. Rosie Perez did a great job of keeping the movie exciting for me. Billy and Sydney would win, and then Billy would blow the money. Gloria's reactions to Billy's mistakes were part of what kept this movie entertaining. Then you throw in the mobsters on Billy's tail and you've got yourself a movie that really keeps you interested; interested in what would happen next. Another great thing about this movie was that there was some emotion, and the ending didn't leave me wondering what Bill and Sid were up to next. Now don't get me wrong, I was more than sad when Gloria left Billy forever, but I found solitude in the fact that Billy and Sidney carve themselves out a a promising future together. Chances are if you are reading this review you've probably seen this movie; whether you have or not I encourage you to watch it sometime, A-.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>White Men Can't Jump</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard of this film a few different places, but because of a Channel 4 countdown programme focusing on one of the lead stars, so I had to see if it was a worthy performance, from director Ron Shelton (Bull Durham). Basically former college basketball player Billy Hoyle (Woody Harrelson) makes a living hustling with street ballers who assume he can't well, because he is white, and his most recent play is with black arrogant but talented player Sidney Deane (Wesley Snipes) on Venice Beach. After being defeated twice and losing his money, Sidney thinks he could be useful, so he goes to see Billy and his girlfriend Gloria Clemente (Rosie Perez), who are on the run from mobsters demanding a gambling debt paid. He suggests a partnership to hustle other basketball players for money, but they lose their first game playing together, and Billy finds out that he was conned himself, and Gloria knows this. They go to his house and an appeal is made to Sidney's wife Rhonda Deane (Tyra Ferrell) and they agree to split the winnings and carry on a more trusting partnership, and they do win an honest game together, due to the ability to distract. Sidney does mock Billy about his inability to slam dunk, claiming "white men can't jump", but their friendship continues with playful bickering, but when they lose another game and of course the cash, Gloria leaves Billy. Sidney knows how he can win her back however, he has a friend who works as security for the studio that make the popular game show Jeopardy!, which she has dreamt of being on, and so he arranges it so she can be a contestant, and she gets the subject she knows best, leaving with a $14,100 prize. Billy wins Gloria back, but then Sidney gets burgled, so desperate for cash and knowing he owes a favour asks his fellow hustler friend to play a final game, but Gloria says she will leave if he gambles again, but he goes against her wishes. The end sees Sidney and Billy win this final, and the mobsters are paid, but it appears Gloria wasn't lying about leaving, but the friendship remains, and they walk away having a basketball banter. Also starring Cylk Cozart as Robert, Kadeem Hardison as Junior, Ernest Harden Jr. as George, John Marshall Jones as Walter, Marques Johnson as Raymond, David Roberson as T.J., Kevin Benton as Zeke and Nigel Miguel as Dwight 'The Flight' McGhee. Snipes gives a fun slick performance as the streetwise cool guy, Harrelson is equally great as the pro basketball playing white guy, and Perez also shines as the pro's sassy girlfriend, it is a film to enjoy for the basketball, the dialogue based jokes, and the small moments of serious stuff too, a most worthwhile sports comedy drama. Wesley Snipes was number 96 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is nothing but a basketball match with known actors in it. The characters' refined details, the human soul of it, the hustling.. all of that had been done perfectly, with memorable realism and cuteness. But all of that as well had to be in the back of the movie, sorry the match. It celebrates basketball in visual love poems that ate almost the whole time. So how about someone who knows nothing about it, or doesn't care about it in the first place ?! Resorting to the slow-motion near the end provoked me very. However, it seems to be fun for others. Therefore it's like an exclusive movie for the basketball's fans. And I'm not one of them. I'm the one who felt sad for a buddy story, hustlers' movie, and human comedy I couldn't enjoy here. Simply the match was on, long, and boring enough to hamper the movie. So eventually : being uninterested won ! Still the top of this movie is the shot in which the 2 leads, in Wesley Snipes' flat, express their hate to each other talking in the same time non-stop; Snipes there delivered what I consider as one of the best comic moments ever. So bad he didn't make comedies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'White Men Can't Jump' borrows from several well-worn movie genres: the con-trick movie, the sports movie, the odd-couple movie; and plays with racial and sexual stereotypes as well. But Ron Shelton's film, about a pair of basketball hustlers, buzzes with such energy and fizz that you really don't mind, and the cast led by Woody Harrelson (who plays a man frequently as stupid as he looks) and Wesley Snipes (a huckster with a day job) play off each other with aplomb. Moreover, there's a fundamental honesty behind the comedy: the film's treatment of racial subjects may be lightweight, but not false. There's even a fun soundtrack as a bonus; I found it an unexpected pleasure to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Snipes and Harrelson in the latest 'buddy' movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the years there have a been a number of memorable white/black screen partners, perhaps the best of recent years being the pairing of Gibson and Glover for the Lethal Weapon series. Now add Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson to the list. In White Men Can't Jump they are basketball con-men who 'cheat' the predominantly black Californian teams out of their money. Problem is they do come unstuck and spend much of the film without rather than with money in their pockets. As a secondary storyline Rosie Perez plays Harrelson's girlfriend whose ambition is to get on the game show in which you tell them the question to their answer. She seems to think that she will win buckets of money and their financial troubles will be over. It's fast-paced, witty and well written by Ron Shelton, who also directs. White Men Can't Jump? Well, maybe, but like most things there are exceptions, and this is one of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>White Men Can't Jump could have been very good, but it was instead only very average. The story centres on a highly talented white basketball player (Woody Harrelson) who hustles a cocksure black guy (Wesley Snipes) on his own court. The two then team up and hustle the local courts, raking in some big dollars. There is plenty of wisecracking, but the "your mama" jokes wear a bit thin. One of the film's biggest irritations is Harrelson's on-screen girlfriend: she moans endlessly in a very, very nauseating high-pitched whine, at one point bitching that Harrelson has brought her a glass of water when she complains of thirst. She is truly one of THE most annoying female characters ever to appear in cinema and ruins the film beyond redemption. There is a side-plot in which Harrelson has to clear some debts to two gangsters, but they are "off-the-shelf" lifeless caricatures. The film concludes with Harrelson having lost his girl (a blessing, to be honest) and asking Snipes for a job. Not quite the action-packed conclusion you might have expected. A shame, because Harrelson and Snipes have both appeared in some excellent films. White Men Can't Jump wasn't one of them...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining? Yes. Realistic? No.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a comedy. This is a Basketball Jones fantasy. It's gritty and full of low rent district locales in SoCal: Watts, Venice Beach, South Central L.A., maybe East L.A.. There's a lot of trash talk and mother talk, some of it funny. This is about a white dude who is black even though he is as white as Gomer Pyle. And about as smart. This is about being white in a black world. It's about being a loser as far as women are concerned. This is about being a loser period.Woody Harrelson as Billy Hoyle is the loser. Wesley Snipes as Sidney Dean is the hotshot, hotdog, street wise hoops hustler who sees some value in an undersized white guy who plays better than he looks, although he can't jump. In a sense this is a buddy movie, 1990s style. They team up and hustle two-on-two pickup basketball for cash on outdoor courts with metal nets. They're good and they usually win.This is also about their relationship with their women. Rosie Perez plays Gloria Clemente who is a bit too smart for Billy. She spends her time imbibing endless trivia in prep for being on TV's Jeopardy. Tyra Ferrell plays Sidney's wife. She's also smarter than her man but long suffering in the ghetto. Some real life hoopsters make an appearance. I spotted Marques Johnson and Nigel Miguel, both of whom played for UCLA. Ron Shelton, who wrote and directed the excellent baseball movie Bull Durham (1988) wrote and directed here. He does a good job although I do have some points to make.One, you can't hustle hoops in the manner depicted. The main problem is the officiating. There is no way to settle disputes about fouls and who touched the ball last when going out of bounds. I played pickup basketball all over the South Bay area of Los Angeles for decades and I can tell you that when the games were close every missed shot was a foul, and the only way it got settled was to "shoot for it"; that is, the guy who claimed he was fouled when he missed the shot had to "do or die" from the free throw line or (more often in the bigger games) from the top of the key. If he makes it, his team gets the ball out of bounds. If he misses, the other team gets the ball. If you're playing for some serious money, these disputes would go on forever, not to mention the fact that somebody might just lay some hard fouls on somebody and what you would end up with is the bigger, tough guys winning. In fact, if one team is about to win against a bigger, badder team they might NEVER get a shot off.A secondary problem is the white ringer deal only works once.In reality there is enough ego involvement in these pickup games that you don't need to put any money on the line. Your self-identity as a basketball player is already on the line. Additionally, most guys who play pickup basketball play it for recreation, for staying in shape, for camaraderie. And yes there are some VERY serious pickup games with some very good players all over the Los Angeles area, although the best of them are played in high school, JC or college gyms indoors. Incidentally, by the time this movie was produced (it came out in 1992) most of the games in the L.A. area were played full court, not two on two; and before that, going back to the sixties, the default half court game was three on three.Well, in a Hollywood movie a realistic depiction of a milieu usually isn't the point. The point is entertainment, and in this sense White Men Can't Jump does alright. Snipes and Harrelson, by the way, can play a little, although it's mostly the camera work and the slow-mo that makes them look good.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"

		<shortDescription>Still On Point After All These Years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently caught White Men Can't Jump and, after the joyful nostalgia for my youth wore off, I couldn't help but feel sad that more than a decade on, all the white/black misunderstandings and tensions remain. For the film's sake, that's good, as the jokes and quick-witted dialog remain relevant, but still....White Men finds Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes living hand-to-mouth as hustlers on the early 1990s LA street ball scene. Knowing a good con when he sees it, Snipes's Sidney Dean quickly convinces Harrelson's character to team up so they can exploit the perennial myth that white men can't play basketball. The relationship throws front-and-center each character's (mis)perceptions about the other's race, the permanent divide between men and women, and the crazy logic us dudes will often apply to justify taking a risk "just one more time."Great on-court scenes and sharp-tongued wordplay between Snipes and Harrelson keeps the movie on track. Definitely worth the time. Too bad it never helped spawn any sort of real-life dialog on race and class in this country.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good in all areas, but great in none</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of different ideas come together in 'White Men Can't Jump'. Essentially, the lead character tries to succeed in something that, due to his appearance, demeanour and background, few would expect him to be good at. The twist is that he's a white guy playing basketball. Having been duped out of $7800, he takes to hustling the black neighbourhood players, getting them to bet big money that they'll win, on their naíve assumption that a white man can't be a good basketball player. Adventure, plus a fair share of hilarity, ensues.I liked the minor prejudices Hoyle and Deane had against each other's races, especially Sidney refusing to believe that Jimi Hendrix's drummer was white. The Brotherhood event is funny, especially the "this could cost us our sponsors" reaction. The Jeopardy satire is neat - it's a good sign that Alex Trebek agreed to have the show's integrity questioned like this. The whole role of money in an impoverished community is tackled in this film - the lengths you go to for it, the risks you take in the process, and the way it may not be everything.The basketball scenes are filmed impressively, with lots of high-angle shots, and feature what appear to be smart tricks (I'm not much of a basketball watcher, but I gather that the coach who worked with Harrelson and Snipes said they reached college standard, despite both being short for basketball players). The trash-talking is believable and occasionally funny, although I find it juvenile as a concept (although it reminds you that 2Pac and Shakespeare may be more alike than most would assume).The choice of title is brave, and successful - society has put an inbuilt 'block' on Hoyle, much as it has for non-whites in many areas, and his determination to prove others wrong becomes an undoing. Sexual differences are touched on as well; the film notices the way men are generally more obsessed with victory than women - it is Sidney's wife Rhonda who finds a solution to their initial problems, despite Sidney and Billy's macho attitudes.It all amounts to one of the few quality sport-themed films, a tight but not over-serious look at race in early 90s America. Parts of it are a little dated, but most of the humour and action still shines through.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That of course, if you like basketball. More precisely, street ball, cause I wont presume to know what those involved in the making were trying to achieve, but it makes you laugh, it makes you think, and if you ever feel the Epiphany in sports when you dunk, goal, KO, complete a 40y pass, or whatever puts color in your face, well its exciting to watch. A very risky choice to cast Rosie Perez as the girlfriend, but I believe she did fine. And the ending, to me, seems the best way to end a picture where you think you know where this is going before opening credits are done. I specially enjoyed how accurately women-men relationships are pictured, and please, do not try to make racist issues out of the title. If I had to choose a single best value from this movie I'd take that things are not what they seem.</fullReview>

This should be higher then 6. 2 in my opinion, and the scene where Wesley hustles Woody out of money was actually kind of shocking to me! especially with the way Wesley acted around his friends about it, plus Wesley and Woody's constant bickering was amusing. I have watched parts of this on TV quite a few times so it was cool to see the full length for the 1st time!, plus it has some great laughs in it too.

There has to be an end to racism and this film helps in the fight against that by the amount of stereotypes which are broken down throughout this emmence film. (gotta say Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson surprised me with their basketball skills those 2 really are very good players in real life obviously) Wesley played the typical over-confident "brother" on the playground with his great street wise banter and was very humorous and at times genius but towards the end of this film it was Woody who became the "brother" giving out his own banter to his opponents and being very funny and turning the tables showing we're all the same in the end.The title in itself is a racial barricade which is broken down i imagine most white people to not bother now about this title which is of course a racism idea but it is taken in a joking form and is said in a way we can speak about and not just push it into a dark corner call it racism and never speak of it again. The people of America did this very well (the African/American sub-section that is when they started calling each other the "n" word i won't say as i still don't feel comfortable as a white man saying this to them but they have broken down the barrier and spoke about such things brought it out into the open and allowed for us to integrate in my opinion and be less taboo about such subjects.This film has it all people and for me its an absolute 10/10 i've seen it now around 60/70times (no joke) and its still absolute shear excellence! get it! buy it! just freakin watch it man its absolute genius and will always be remembered!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hip-Hop Basketball movie is good entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>White Men Can't Jump stars Wesley Snipes, Woody Harrelson, and the quite sexy Rosie Perez. Filmed at the height of the hip-hop era, this movie is a basketball based comedy/drama that challenges some popular stereotypes.The story begins as a dorky white boy, Billy played by Harrelson, becomes part of a street basketball scene in LA. He hustles the street smart black man, Sidney played by Snipes, by winning a 5 shot free-throw bet. Afterwards Sydney tracks down Harrelson and they begin basically what is a street basketball hustling operation, which they'll ride all the way to the top, or so it seems anyway.There are a few sub-plots in this movie, which give a nice break from all the slow motion screen time of street basketball matches. The story features betrayal of many characters, with some mildly interesting situations.The end is surprising, and I won't spoil it for you but things don't quite work out the way you think they will.This movie has good production values, and enjoyable script and story, and solid acting by all characters. Perhaps the worst character in a way was Billy Hoyle, who was almost so stupid you'd never believe he could be good at anything. But for the movie's sake, it all works out and overall is a good enjoyable movie that doesn't really deserve any rewards, but will reward the viewer with a couple hours of good entertainment.Except for the very brief nudity, I really see no reason for this movie to be rated R. There is vulgarity and adult situations as well. I really see no reason why teenage viewers would have a problem with viewing this movie, at most it would probably make them want to go play some basketball.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Sidney Deane is beaten by goofy looking white boy Billy Hoyle he realises that he has been hustled. He seeks out Billy and the two of them strike up an uneasy partnership where they trade on his goofy nature to hustle on courts around LA. As their relationship grows, Sidney agrees to help Billy when he gets into trouble with some local gangsters whom Billy owes a lot of money to. However while they are sharp on court, neither of the pair have a great deal of luck or skill when it comes to their relationships with their female partners. I must be honest and say that part of the reason I stopped playing/refereeing basketball in local leagues and playing on outdoor courts was because of the trash talking: good players who insist on every point and every call being the cue for insults and back chat instead of sportsmanlike behaviour. So I wasn't sure, watching it again after many years, that I would still like this film since so much of it is based on these very things. Despite my dislike of it in real life, it is actually the boisterous, fast talking, foul mouthed basketball matches that make this film fun to watch. The actual story is pretty weak when you look at it and it is easy just to see it as a basic frame that allows the on-court action to occur. The stuff involving Gloria and Rhonda is not as fun and not as convincing as the rest of the film. The stuff about the gangsters is also unlikely and is simply a plot device to set up an enjoyable tournament that serves as a fitting end to a series of one-off hustles. Of course, if you dislike basketball and dislike 'yo' moma' style banter then there will be little for you here, but I enjoyed it for what it is (even if it is starting to show its age in terms of dialogue, attitude and, most notably, the clothes!).In fitting with the material, the male cast outshine the female cast. Snipes and Harrelson have good chemistry ? so good in fact that they thought it could carry the rather poor Money Train (it couldn't) but here it works. They both give as good as they get but, given the 'goofy' nature of Harrelson's role, it is Snipes that comes off looking a lot better. Perez is a little annoying but no as much as she has been in other films and Ferrell doesn't make too much of a mark ? only acting as a plot driver for Sidney to help Billy late in the film. Minor roles from people like Cozart and Hardison are very minor roles but generally they do their 'street-ball' clichés well enough. Overall this is not a great film because of the weaknesses in actual plotting, however it is fun and energetic mainly because it never goes too long with some fast-talking basketball action. The games are well shot, funny, exciting and skillful and, if you like these, then you'll enjoy the film; otherwise, there isn't that much to tune in for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is a four word phrase synonymous with disgustingly awful?- White Men Can't Jump</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes team up as hustlers on the basketball court. Okay, that sounds all right there. It leaves lots of room for good comedy and a good story. But no such event took place in the many following boring minutes of this pathetic attempt of a film. This movie became redundant, retarded, and ridiculous after the first twenty seconds had gone by. Woody Harrelson played one of my favorite t.v. characters, Woody from Cheers, and I was looking forward to seeing him in this movie. But after seeing his " acting performance " I have come to the conclusion that he should stay playing dumb country hicks who bartend. His acting was as dull and poor as the movie. Another actor in this unreal film was Rosie Perez. I have liked movies with Perez before, but I have decided that the reason I have enjoyed other works in her career was that she was not a main character and didn't have that many speaking lines ( Do the Right Thing ). But now in White Men Can't Jump she was made a central character with many lines, thus meaning that the audience has to put up with her incredibly annoying and whining voice. So after seeing this film ( term used loosely ) and hearing Rosie Perez for much more than appreciated I can now say that I'm a white man and I'm getting ready to jump . . . off a twenty story apartment building.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting Despite All-Sleazy Characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a popular movie probably because of the humor in it, the fast-moving story, an underdog character who shuts up all the loudmouths, etc. Funny thing is, you probably couldn't make a movie with this title if you substituted anybody but "white" as anything else would be deemed racist by the PC police. Nonetheless, Woody Harrleson as the white guy who turns out to be as good if not better than any of the black basketball players, is interesting as is his main counterpart Wesley Snipes.Snipes had a lot of funny put-down lines, providing much of the humor. The bad part of the film - which doesn't bother a lot of people - is the extreme profanity in here and the sleaziness of all the characters. That includes Woody's girlfriend, played by Rosie Perez. There are no really clean, nice people in this movie. For that reason, I can't honestly recommend the film, at least not to friends or those who are offended by a lotof profanity</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting and often engrossing character drama, a covering of two males complimenting and foiling one another in an amusing and often erotically charged manner.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>White Men Can't Jump is a fanciful but ultimately effective meshing of a number of things to overall formulate a satisfying picture. Its amalgamating of inner-city grit which comes complete with hearty, tough minded souls looking to intimidate and endorse masculinity is mixed up with a buddy genre comedic slant that comes in addition to a romance plot-line as well as particular undercurrents of race relations drama. The conventions and content happen to blend and mesh together with one another rather well, all of it formulating together on their own levels to create a decent piece. Additionally rife with elements of queer theory, the film is principally one of which a relationship must exist between two characters which will then go on to be vital for both its and their successes, and although on face value this is one of a heterosexual ilk that might exist between one of the leads and his New Yorker girlfriend, it is actually one of which exists between the two leads, of whom are both male. It's in this sense that the film is ultimately about the rivalry and potential for danger which exists between two men; the understanding which the pair of them undergo of this that exists between, as well as the acceptance of one another which their misadventures and particular relationship drags them toward.Like varying recent films of a similar ilk, ranging from Tony Scott's 1986 film Top Gun to Zack Snyder's highly stylised, 2007 postmodern war film 300; White Men Can't Jump is about the bonding men undergo and the manly activities in which they partake in the apparent hope at forging masculine identities. The two men in question are Woody Harrleson's Billy Hoyle and Wesley Snipes' Sidney Deane; two fairly young and wholly fit males whom enjoy the sport of basketball so much so that it will come to act as the manly catalyst for each of their respective on-screen plights, just as engaging as a fighter pilot did for the leads in Top Gun and engaging in warfare did for the scantily-clad warriors of 300. Featured in all three examples are loose sub-plots to do with the supposed connection to that of a female character whom only feels predominant, and is often sidelined for the ties the men have with one another which are able to push through. Here, the most interesting material to do with relationships features its two leads; the case-in-point being that by the time the film has veered somewhat off piste and into a sequence encompassing a TV game show which serves only to endorse the film's lone heterosexual relationship, we are not as interested nor engaged as we were when its two male leads were on screen clashing with one another, on one occasion bickering during a match like an elderly couple.Hoyle and Deane live locally and maintain relationships with their female partners which come complete with mites of discontent, although Hoyle is additionally in trouble with some gangsters to whom he owes a fair amount of money and believes himself to have escaped to here: Los Angeles' Venice district. Their first encountering of one another is indeed on the highly masculine and ego-centric basketball courts of Los Angeles' Venice Beach, as sinking shots from the dusty tarmac for large sums of money before gloating is the order of the day. Where Sidney appears loud mouthed and full of himself, Billy is more reserved and restrained; his victimisation at the hands of Deane and his companions sees them drag class as well as race into the situation when Hoyle, being white, has a "country club" tag attributed to him and deemed unworthy within the sport's field. Hoyle promptly beats Deane and his crew, with the minimum of fuss and we are able to visibly see Deane's slight wilting under the pressure as he becomes the victim to his own manliness.As Hoyle leaves the courts, his worn and sweaty figure is captured post-workout by Deane's gaze: he is wholly impressed by the man's abilities; so much so that following him home and coming in to exclaim his true feelings occurs. Away from the courts, Hoyle's girlfriend Gloria (Perez) is a hardened academic, buried in encyclopedias and academia in an apartment which has been decorated by pictures of famous people. She comes across as being on another level to him, both literally or spiritually in this sense as well as academically; their only true link to one another that of a healthy sex life, since Hoyle is unable to truly engage in her brainier characteristics bar offer her the odd compliment to do with his belief she'd be able to win a TV game show. Hoyle's eventual tryst with Deane will see them both occupy a realm upon which basketball acts as the all-linking catalyst which sees them click, and this is easier and more familiar for him than that of his girlfriend's demands. Crucially, White Men Can't Jump goes on to document the failing of a bond with a woman that one of the main characters has; a telling sequence nearer the end encompassing the pair of protagonists practically walking hand in hand being symptomatic with the newfound homoerotic understanding.Director Ron Shelton has an eye for the on screen basketball, of which he has of sorts rendered a ballet in that there are degrees of dance or presentation behind the characters' lyrical boasting and verbal jousting before the physical stepping up to play the sport finishes the performance off. There is enough to get involved in, overall; the looming sharks provide ample threat for Hoyle as Deane attempts to get on with his real estate career and finding a proper home for his family. The film is a mixed bag of sports movie clichés; interesting insights into the lives and minds of basketball hustlers and droll formula linked to past-tragedies; epiphanies and moral choices but it all hangs together and works on the whole.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's hard being this good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Surely you will know of a sandwich shop somewhere in your neighborhood or the city you live in that, when viewed from the outside, holds little promise. There is no way to tell if they sell anything out of the ordinary, to say it is properly decorated would be an insult to the very craft of decorating, the menu is unclear and priced so low it can't be any good and on top of that, the patron doesn't look very inviting. But since it is cold and you're hungry, you go in and order that Daily Special that with a grunt from aforesaid patron is prepared for you. You sit back and take a bite. And then it happens. Wow. How can something this lame looking be this good? This review comes rather late in the day, given the fact that this movie was released already a while back, but every time it's on TV I take a bite and marvel at how bloody entertaining it is. This is no Oscar winner, no earth moving experience, but just proof that an entertaining story might just come careening around some corner you didn't expect it to come from. Don't expect a social commentary on the black 'n white boundaries and life in the ghetto or a senseless showcase of how entertaining great basketball is to look at, although Snipes and Harrelson surely deliver. Be prepared to be taken into the world of a group of characters that do need a little effort to identify with. And see how from the fairly uninviting premise of the blacktop of ghetto basketball courts, two very cocksure basketball hustlers, mating the naive and the somewhat worldwise, a girlfriend obsessed with Jeopardy and the ever so strange ethics involved in wagering bets, a frankly heartwarming story is squeezed, juggling fast-paced and often hilarious dialogue with life-turning -nasty-tricks drama, that is so utterly recognizable that at one point you wish you could hug Harrelson's character. Oh, and play ball like Snipe's. There is chemistry here people, both on the funny and the dramatic side, and it's a shame they didn't manage to repeat it on The Money Train. It is brought to the screen using unpretentious, almost nonchalant directing showing a clear love for great ballplay. Don't be deterred by Snipe's recent duds and Harrelson's somewhat beyond-your-grasp acting choices. In the words of Snipe's character, don't listen, but hear. Go rent this or switch to that channel and take a bite. You won't regret it.</fullReview>

The action sequences make basketball seem pretty exciting and the on-court dialogue is fast, snappy and funny. Unfortunately, off-court the main characters are generally irritating. I had very little sympathy or respect for the characters played by Woody Harrelson and Rosie Perez. Unltimately I couldn't care less what happened to them so my attention wandered towards the end of the movie. There is a sub-plot involving debt-collecting gangsters which is unconvincing. The performances from Wesley Snipes and Tyra Ferrell are excellent (I wish Tyra would do more.)</fullReview>

White Men Can't Jump is a story of two men named Billy (Woody Harrelson) and Sydney (Wesley Snipes) who both think they are the best players on the court and hustlers in basketball on the streets of Los Angeles, so then they join forces in a two-on-two basketball championship. So nothing can stop them now except for each other! To add to their problems, Billy owes money and is being chased by a pair of gangster types and trying to get his girlfriend to come back to him. While, Sydney is trying to get his family moved out of his apartment into a bigger home to raise his family else where. This is another one of my favorite sports movies of all time and one of the best movies of 1992!BOTTOM LINE: THIS MOVIE IS A SLAM DUNKING HIT COMEDY!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exciting basketball action in "White Men" can't jump over inextricable plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>White Men Can't Jump (1992): If this movie, written and directed by sports-film guru Ron Shelton, consisted entirely of basketball scenes, it would rate a perfect 10. The story of con men Billy (Woody Harrelson) and Sidney (Wesley Snipes) teaming up to hustle opponents on the court is only a small part of a convoluted script, which is merely a mess of unimportant subplots rather than one solid storyline. For instance, two Italian heavies pursue Billy and his bitchy girlfriend Gloria (Rosie Perez in an ear-torturing performance) over gambling debts throughout the entire picture. She later dumps Billy after he loses $2,500, and everything slows to a crawl as he embarks on a quest to get her back. Plus, she is busy trying to get on Jeopardy, because Lord knows Alex Trebek can never get enough publicity. Little things like that serve to build up an anticlimactic conclusion. It doesn't help either that the characters badly lack development and are given such flat dialogue. Billy is so annoying that it's hard to believe people like Sidney ? and the equally irritating Gloria ? would actually befriend him in the first place. Despite the film's title, the subject of racism never comes to the fore through the jumbled plot; the act of swindling opponents who believe the white guy can't play is scarcely a serious anti-racist message. Plenty of plot holes as well: A gun Gloria points at Sidney at the beginning is never seen again, and she's also an alcoholic, but that's conveniently forgotten as the movie progresses. Many ballers (like myself) will enjoy the great court action and the humorous trash talk, which is the film's only saving grace. Look for former NBA stars Marques Johnson and Freeman Williams as two of Billy and Sidney's opponents, and the late Los Angeles Times sportswriter Allan Malamud as a Jeopardy contestant. While the aforementioned basketball spectacles are a slam dunk, it's unfortunate that the rest of "White Men" throws up an airball. 6/10</fullReview>

There is nothing much more I can really say , apart from that well I really was not expecting much but I was generally not pleased with what I got in the end .
