		<shortDescription>One of the most important films of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To Kill a Mockingbird is the movie based on the Harper Lee novel of the same name about Scout, Jem and their father, Atticus Finch who is an attorney in a small southern town. It is both a coming of age story about the children as well as a hard-hitting drama, as Atticus defends a black man who is on trial for the rape of a white woman. This review is not an easy one to write, despite the fact that I have seen this film at least 10 times. The reason it does not come easily is that this is one of the most personally important films I have ever seen and is in my personal `Top Five of All Time'. I'm certain there is nothing that can be said about the film that has not already been repeated a multitude of times, so I guess the best thing to do is explain why the film is so important to me.I first saw this film several years ago and was so profoundly affected by it that I immediately watched it again. Of course, the defense of a man wrongly accused of a crime is a common story line, but To Kill a Mockingbird stands out as an exceptional example for several reasons. Among them, the date that the film was released: 1962, on the cusp of the civil rights movement in America, and the fact that it takes place in the south in the 1930's. It is also far from the first film to explore the experiences of children and their own personal growth, but To Kill a Mockingbird stands out because of its sheer honesty and natural performances by the child actors portraying these rich characters. But most of all, this film is special because of Gregory Peck's portrayal of Atticus Finch, a true hero. At the risk of sounding histrionic, my heart aches when I watch him on screen because he is such an incredible man, and is so inherently good. No matter how many times I have seen this film, I smile when I see his interaction with his children, and I well with tears when I see his incredible strength of character. (No easy feat to break through the armor of this cynical film geek who, if given the chance would remake at least a few dozen films with tragic endings.) I was sitting in my car listening to National Public Radio recently the day Gregory Peck died, and I'm not ashamed to admit that I sat and cried hearing the retrospective they offered ? mainly because the man who portrayed my own personal cinematic hero was gone, but also because Peck lived his life with the same conviction as his best known role; a fact that makes Atticus Finch all the more tangible. The American Film Institute recently named Atticus Finch the number one hero of all time, a choice I consider both brave and insightful in an age where our heroes generally either wield weapons or have super human physical strength. Atticus Finch fights evil as well, but with his strong moral fiber and his mind. To Kill a Mockingbird is generally required reading during the course of one's education. If you have not read it, do so. If you have not seen the film, do so; and share it with others. It is an exceptional film that stands the test of time and will remain an important addition to film history for as long as the genre exists. --Shelly</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful Social Classic That Echoes Issues of Its Day...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is presented like a play in three acts. It is also from the children's perspective. Through the kids, we find that racism is a learned attitude or feeling. We also see a delightful coming of age drama as the young kids realize that there is no Boogeyman down the street and their father is capable of doing a lot more than they think. The great Gregory Peck plays Atticus Finch, a pillar of nobility, social conscience, and, rare for 1930's Americana, a single parent. Peck is such a strong presence, you believe everything about him. It is something you can compare to America's trust in TV anchorman Walter Cronkite. We always took his word for it.Act one puts Atticus in the background and allows the kids to flourish. Director Robert Mulligan was able to get such realistic performances from non-professional kids. They are amusing and fun to watch. The big mystery lies in the house down the street in this small Georgia town. Who is the monstrous, "6 and a half feet big" legend living in the end house? Some light suspense ensues, while the buildup to a stirring act two is happening. Atticus must defend an African-American man for the alleged rape of a white woman.After threats galore, an unshaken Peck takes to the courtroom jungle in, without a doubt, one of the top 5 court scenes in motion picture history. Brock Peters lends the film its best moments as the accused "negro" on trial. This man has a face chiseled with suffering and deep, deep sorrow. We know Atticus is a good man, a decent human being with a soul. He sees this in his client as well, and in a closing argument that must have roused the civil rights movement, implores the jury to vote justice. An all-male, all-white jury in the 1930's were tough listeners. Peters' breakdown on the stand is one of the most realistic, emotionally saddening moments you'll ever see, especially in Hollywood films of the 1960's. The scene when Peck leaves the courtroom is now legendary as well.Act three produces a tragic death, an unlikely hero, and the bringing together of a family. The filmmakers have such a passion for the material, they seem to handle it with gentleness. Racism is a hard-boiled subject and it is depicted and dealt with through grace and patience. TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD poses the injustice of race relations in the 1930's as a front for the events happening in the 1960's. The film came out during turbulent times and was also an adaption of a literary classic. I am one to judge a film solely by film only. The book is a separate art form and should not be compared to the film, an art form itself. It is important, it is enlightening, and it has not aged. Watch it.RATING: 9 of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Enough good things can't be said about this movie. It is undoubtedly one of the best and most moving films ever made. No other racial injustice or discriminatory based movie can even compare with "To Kill a Mockingbird". This movie not only makes you sympathize with those who were being discriminated against, but also those who fought for those people. One of the most moving parts of the movie is when Atticus Finch is leaving the court room and Reverend Sykes tells Scout to "stand up your father is passing".Gregory Peck has always been one of my favorite actors. This is definitely one of my favorite roles that he has ever played, and he does an excellent job at it. Mary Badham and Philip Alford are excellent as Jem and Scout. Mary Badham became the youngest girl to receive an Academy Award nomination for best supporting actress for her role as Scout. Although it had a short time on screen, Robert Duvall's portrayal of "Boo" Radley was one of his very first roles on screen and what better movie than "To Kill a Mockingbird" to kick off your acting career.A great movie of all times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Unforgettable Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hoo boy, am I a sucker for courtroom dramas. The wrangling of legal points and the investigation into the truth just gets my cinematic blood pumping (I s'pose it's in response to my own dashed hopes of becoming an attorney)."To Kill a Mockingbird" rises to the top of the pile easily.Yes, the courtroom proceedings are nail-bitingly engaging. But played out against the tapestry of bigotry and hate make the legal goings-on even more compelling.The writing here is so beautiful, so lyric, so poetic. The Harper Lee-based screenplay captures wonderfully a time and a place that are absolutely real--where big brothers could solve the universe's problems in an instant and all the treasures of the world could be contained in a cigar box."To Kill a Mockingbird" also contains three of the most impressive child performances I have ever witnessed--there's not a false or affected moment in any one of them. Until seeing "Ponette," a movie I would highly recommend, the kids in "Mockingbird" received my best child performance ever awards. "Ponette" has ratcheted them down one notch, but that doesn't diminish the achievement here. The scene in which Scout dispels the mob simply by identifying its individual members is one of the most powerful moments in filmdom.Peck more than deserved his best actor nod. His quiet dignity is a definite asset. Brock Peters, too, is terrific in what could have been a cliched role.If you are a moviegoer who has a bias against black and white movies and who has therefore never seen "Mockingbird," I pity you. You've passed on one of Hollywood's most unforgettable experiences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not just film, but film history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw To Kill A Mockingbird was at a drive-in theater. I was probably about ten or eleven at the time. Even at a young age I was captivated by this seemingly simple story told through the eyes of children that I could easily relate to. Perhaps also it was the fact that the part of the story that dealt with Boo Radley, held a kind of mystery and an eeriness for me, much in the way a ghost story would. I'm not about to make the pretense that I understood the social significance of To Kill A Mockingbird at the age of ten, or even the greatness of the film. That would come later in life, after having viewed it in one of it's first network television broadcasts.One of the things that makes To Kill A Mockingbird a truly great film is the love and respect everyone involved in bringing Harper Lee's novel to the screen had for the original source material. It shows up on screen in every single frame. Each performance in this film is beyond reproach. Gregory Peck had many fine performances over his storied career, but none every approached the perfection he brought to his portrayal of Atticus Finch. As Atticus, Peck brings us the depth of understanding as to how his love for Jem and Scout enables him to treat his children with respect and honesty. He never talks down to them, but approaches them on a level in which children of their age can comprehend and learn from his own wisdom. Yet, he is still able to retain the same no nonsense approach as other parents. Atticus is also a man who believes in the integrity of justice, yet recognizes the failings of our justice system. When called upon to do his duty, he does so, despite the hatred and venom brought to bear upon him and his children by the citizens of the town in which he lives.In casting Jem, Scout and Dill, Producer Alan J. Pakula and Director Robert Mulligan faced a daunting task. So much of the success of To Kill A Mockingbird depended on the pivotal role these characters would play in the film. For Jem he chose Philip Alford, for Scout, Mary Badham, and for Dill, John Megna. Alford and Badham were both southern natives who had never been in films before. Megna was a New York native but was also inexperienced. It is this inexperience and lack of polish that enables all three to shine on the screen. Mulligan began filming by letting them act as if making a film was like recess, allowing them to play on the set, and only moving the camera gradually as they became accustomed to their surroundings. It paid off in every way imaginable. None of the three ever appear as if they are actors acting, and bring a childlike wonder and presence to their roles that I had never seen before, and will unlikely witness again.Brock Peters as Tom Robinson, the black man falsely accused of raping a white girl, also gives a performance which he would never again surpass. You will not find anywhere a more memorable scene in any court room than when he testifies on the witness stand. Because he dared to care about a white girl, he now faces almost certain death if convicted, and perhaps even if not convicted. It is the first time I was able to begin to understand the effects of man's prejudice and hatred of a man simply because of the color of his skin. Just as Jem and Scout came of age, and realized the significance of the injustices of racial hatred, so did I.Equally significant, is Collin Wilcox as Mayella Ewell. She makes it easy for many to hate her, but like Atticus, we see in her a person to be more pitied than hated. She is a product of not only the times in which she lives, but even more so of her wretched upbringing. Mayella is what she is, but only because of the deep cutting prejudices of those around her. To Mayella, being caught enticing a black man into your house for relations, is the ultimate crime and the penalty for doing so is unthinkable to her.In his screen debut as Boo Radley, Robert Duvall also brings to life the mysterious neighbor that once frightened Jem, Dill, and Scout so much. Though on the screen for a short length of time, without uttering a word, Duvall shows us a man tortured by years of cruelty, mistreatment, and the gossip and whispers of neighbors. He is a man who wants only to live in his own way, yet the bond that links him to Jem and Scout is significant. They are the childhood he had never really known. Just as Tom Robinson, he has never brought harm to anyone, yet suffers significantly just for the right to be able to exist.The care with which To Kill A Mockingbird was brought to the screen can also be seen in the Art Direction by Henry Bumstead and Set Decoration by Oliver Emert. They indeed bring to life what a small Southern Town would have been like in the early thirties. Cinematographer Russel Harlan's black and white photography brings it all vividly to the screen, especially in the way he captures the foreboding of the Radley house, the moments when Bob Ewell approaches Jem when he is left in a car alone, and even more noteworthy near the end of the film when Jem and Scout are walking home from a school play. Elmer Bernstein's score is never boisterous, but yet is as important to setting the mood of many of the scenes played out before us.There have been many eloquent words written in many of the comments on this board about To Kill A Mockingbird. Many of the words are far better than those that I have written. Then again, maybe a few simple paragraphs cannot truly describe the significant achievement in film making that To Kill A Mockingbird is. It will be forever remembered, long after you and I have departed from this world. It is at this point that I usually grade a film. I will skip that here, simply because there is no grade that I can give that could possibly do justice for To Kill A Mockingbird.  </fullReview>

		<fullReview>"To Kill A Mockingbird" is truly a much loved and critically-acclaimed film. It is a perfect portrayal of childhood innocence, racial prejudice, moral tolerance and courage. No other words can describe this film except marvellous. The film is so wonderfully done that the audience actually feels as if they were in Alabama during the 1930s.

		<shortDescription>Amazing film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After hearing nothing but critical acclaim for this film, and the book it was based on, I finally got to see it. I am quite amazed at how well done this film is, and how timeless the theme is. I haven't read the book, but I'm considering it, just to see if there are any details that were left out. The story is amazing and exceptionally told. As far as I know, the film is as close to the book as it could possibly be; some call it the most accurate book-to-film conversion ever. The plot is very good, it takes a timeless problem and presents it to us, through the innocent eyes of a naive child. The pace is very good; apart from The Godfather(the first one) and one or two other exceptions, this is the only drama where there was truly not one single moment that I found dull, boring or unimportant. Nothing seemed trivial in the film. The perspective that is forced upon us is that of a young child, naive and innocent. This is a brilliant idea, as the eyes of a child is without a doubt one of the most impressionable things in the world, and the film handles this perfectly. What really makes the film, apart from the brilliant and possibly unique perspective, is the fact that the children are likable, credible and charming. You couldn't help but like them; believe me, normally I really dislike children. I find them annoying, loud and egotistical. But with this film, I couldn't, for one second, muster up any tiny amount of aggression, or even annoyance. They come off as so likable, charming, and, most importantly, *real*. Almost every kid in any Hollywood movie is either a completely ridiculous stereotype/cliché of a brat, who does nothing but destroy things around him, or the exact opposite, a little angel. Everyone knows that no child is the latter all the time, and even I will admit that there probably doesn't exist too many children who are the first, either. In this film, the children are completely real. They are naive, innocent, they disobey what their father tells them, but ultimately, they obviously love and respect their father, and they never do anything, anything at all, with the intent to hurt or harm someone or something. That is what a child is; innocent. They do what they do because they do not know better. This film provides a perfect view into their world, or, rather, their perspective of it. The acting is excellent. The child actors exceed all expectations. I was amazed at how professional and convincing they were. The other actors all give great performances as well. The cinematography is excellent; once again, it gives a perfect perspective on what your surroundings look like when you're a child. The characters are well-written, credible and well-casted. The dialog was well-written. The script was excellent. A very memorable and beautiful film, should be viewed by almost anyone. I recommend this to anyone who likes dramas, and just about anyone who for one reason or another might enjoy this. Don't be scared off by it being over forty years old, or it being black and white; it's an excellent film, and just about anyone would enjoy it. Don't miss this perfect film. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It does the book justice.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After studying the outstanding book of To Kill A Mockingbird at school, I viewed this film, and was on the whole very impressed. Scout and Jem are portrayed brilliantly, considering the ages of the children who played them, and they, as with everything else in the production, are true to the book's spirit. Gregory Peck is perfect as the unflappable Atticus Finch, and deserved his Oscar. The music is worthy of praise, especially for the climatic scene, and the raw emotion and feeling of the book is amply conveyed. All of the cast are well cast, and it's interesting to ponder how much this film, at the time, would've shocked. That the book explores racism and outsiders in a southern town, through the eyes of a child is genius and works very nicely here. The only problems are minor- much of the book's counter-balancing humour was left out, certain characters are omitted (Dolphus Raymond and Aunt Alexandra), and some of the book's early characterisation is missed. Aside from these gripes, this is a magical film and a "must-see," as a companion piece to the classic novel. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Remarkably Simple and Simply Remarkable Masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very rarely, it happens that movies are made that are very simple in expression but possess monumental appeals and significant life lessons in a style only of the kind of their own that, we can't expect even. This fact is truthfully exemplified in this movie. It's not just a movie or even just a promising story in general, but all it portray's is "Innocence". A girl's recollection of her childhood days which are still at their full bloom in her mind, depicting the innocence of juvenile as well as as adult minds, a period where mostly immature minds become curious to the racial bigotry and sometimes mature minds become its prey and a time when harsh realities of life like intolerance, hatreds, prejudice and adversities of society gradually dawn upon them.Atticus Finch ( Gregory Peck ) is an absolutely Gentleman Lawyer whose wife has passed away and he has a son and a daughter. A Black man Tom Robinson is wrongly alleged of raping a poor white woman. In fact, he a victim of white woman's effort to hide her guilt by targeting his innocence and utilizing favors of racial attitude of unsocial society towards Negros. Finch decides to defend him on his principles realizing that the narrow minded society will turn against him and so it happened and townspeople started making his life agonizing. The whole story is masterfully out shined by the ingenuousness, purity and innocence of his children with with a unique inspirational interaction with their father.Boo Readly who lives in the town is mentally retarded and is sidelined by the society. He is a mark of fear and curiosity for children because he is different from others. But he is the one who marks the ultimate climax of this emotionally crafted masterpiece.It's a must see movie for all ages in all times because it gives many priceless emotional and touching lessons for those who are sincere and perceptive.A Remarkably Simple and Simply Remarkanble Masterpiece!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An utterly moving film, made perfect by the outstanding performance of Gregory Peck. Must see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'To Kill a Mockingbird' is one of the best books ever written but this film does it justice. The performances throughout are stunning, especially that of Gregory Peck (Harper Lee was so impressed she gave him her late father's pocket watch, a prop he uses in the film, to keep). This film will make anyone think hard about how they treat others and it is really heartwarming without being soppy. It isn't necessary to have read the book before seeing this film but it might be advisable. This is one of the classic films of its generation and very few films of nowadays come close to matching it either. A real must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Every bit as good as they say (B&amp;W). Still POWERFUL. 10/10. Spoilers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Horton Foote's Oscar-winning screenplay is so good, it really supplants the 1960 Harper Lee book. I've recently re-read the novel, and it seemed weighed down and paced with backwoods vernacular and situations right out of the 1930s, that are shockingly removed from the 21st century. My goodness. I hope it doesn't strike others so, because the book is a gem too. It's just in need of ...updating perhaps, which is what the 1962 movie excels at; it translates the Depression Era for us. The characters (played, eg by Gregory Peck and Brock Peters in their signature roles) seem so much better-depicted on screen than merely in my own imagination from having read the book!Only Arthur/'Boo' Radley (a peroxided Robert Duvall) seems at first a jarring casting choice to me; but in the end all seem terrific.Now THESE child actors, Mary Badham ('Scout'), Philip Alford ('Jem'), and John Megna (as 'Dill'), should've won Oscars. I'm sure they're all better than Haley Joel Osment, who strikes me as 'studied'. These kids are just natural, completely oblivious of the camera. Unbelievable. Actually, I wonder what genius DID do the casting, because the film gives no casting credit. I guess in 1962 the CSA didn't exist yet... That casting director deserves an Oscar too.This is what great filmmaking is all about; when several areas of perfection are jointly present a film that reaches into your heart and yanks you up and down. Those were real acting jobs, not the cretinous drivel passing for 'work' these days. The reason we don't see too many better movies than Das Experiment is because post-modernism has long encamped in Hollywood (it set up a Starbuck's years ago).The first scene instantly captures Scout's world. She's learning fast at the shoulder of her loving widower lawyer father that she shouldn't embarrass people who are even poorer than they are; and Jem is tantrumming up a tree because he can't brag about his dad's non-existent cool to his friends. Jem demands Atticus play football(!) for the Mets, or more uproariously as Scout tells it, for `the Methodists', hahahaha. (Can we picture Methodists in a sackrace? How many Methodists does it take to change a lightbulb?)The Boo Radley story arc is much better paced in the movie than the book; but because I want to focus on the race-relations arc, I will only make passing comment on Boo: he is gently painted in both the book and movie as another previously dismissed but highly virtuous person, who deserves to be analogized with the fragile, hopeful beauty of the mockingbird.The harrowing exploration of entrenched injustice through various acts of racist violence are adult themes that really couldn't be explored well in a book constrained by the first person narrative of a 7-yr-old little girl. The movie is able to show the Tom Robinson court case much more objectively. Robert Mulligan's direction quickly telegraphs Bob Ewell's shifty creepiness with the scene of his slovenly leering at Atticus' children in the car. Collin Wilcox is also heartrending as Mayella, the ignorant, uneducated and abused daughter of Bob Ewell. Inexplicably, Gregory Peck's cross-examination scene is not quite as sensitive as Atticus is in the book; Peck never reveals that flash of pain at having to destroy Mayella's false testimony.Little Scout's key scene, where she embarrasses the lynch mob (collectively no better than Tom Ewell alone) just with her amiable child's chatter, is EVERY BIT as powerful and stressful as in the book. Probably more, because body language is a much better form of expression for a scene like this.Brock Peters' Tom Robinson is the archetypal decent black man who, YES, felt sorry for a brutalized white woman, as we all ought to. Don't bother debating `what if he was guilty', because TKAM is not a whodunnit; it's an expose of what used to happen WHEN a black man was innocent. The heartbreaking destruction of Tom Robinson's proverbial mockingbird is our collective shame, even now, because similar dismissive laziness still happens. It's every person's character that matters, not whether they're `Methodists'.We do construct our identities as part of various groups. But no group membership, or belief about it, makes any person categorically virtuous. That still hinges on a person's strengths, and crucially, their weaknesses. A person's bad character will overwhelm whatever beliefs they hold; their good character will enhance them. We are all free to act better, or worse, than our beliefs; we're NOT powerless over them, so no-one should ever die over a belief. Cooler thinking than mere violence must rule, or else objective justice will never materialize. And it's only justice if the judgement is accurate; but accuracy requires the abolition of the sort of intellectual/societal laziness that regularly befalls the weakest subgroups of society. Well, we all saw the intellectual rigour of that lynch mob. Would you trust them to tell the time? You might not feel happy trusting even the sheriff (Frank Overton), testifying in court but no better than a hick himself: `Oh, I guess that would make it her LEFT'. Those powerful imbeciles stood in judgement over some societally fragile people, like Tom, and yes, like Mayella.It's still powerful how Tom's hammering as sarcastic legal argument by the prosecutor (William Windom) served to bring home Tom's societal fragility; and we're humbled at the quiet dignity of the entire black population who soberingly stood in the rafters to honor Atticus' failed attempt. The movie was made in 1961, some 7 years before the martyrdom of Martin Luther King Jr, yet in the light of recent gang-related violence, it's clear there are still many who think their group belonging excuses/masks their brutality as people. It does not. And the brutality came first.This movie needs to be seen by the young, to open their hearts to humanity, and their standards for their own personal character, for the rest of their lives. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Our Greatest Film Hero</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the American Film Institute polled its members and they selected Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch as the greatest hero on film ever, the selection was met with very few dissenters. I'm sure not going to argue the merits of the choice. But I do have a theory as to why.Gregory Peck for the most part played decent honorable thinking men in his films. A few films like Duel in the Sun and The Boys from Brazil have him as a villain, but the public never accepted him really in those parts.Few of us in our lives can be Horatio Hornblower or spike the Guns of Navarone or command a submarine as in On the Beach. But Atticus Finch in To Kill a Mockingbird is well within our grasp. He's a small town lawyer, raising his children as a single parent and most of all trying to lead them by example. The performances of Mary Badham and Philip Alford show the kids have learned it very well as does the uncredited narration of Kim Stanley as the grown-up Scout.Atticus Finch is a very attainable ideal. It is I believe the secret of the popularity of both the book and the film. To Kill a Mockingbird is the story of Atticus Finch and his family during the Thirties in rural Alabama. The action takes place over several months of a given year. The most important part of the film deals with Finch defending a black man for allegedly raping a white woman. It's a thankless task and Finch knows it, because he knows the attitudes of the people there, those who would make up an all white jury. Still he proceeds with courage and determination. His summation to the jury is a film classic and Peck's innate decency is nicely counterbalanced by William Windom's prosecutor who smirks through out the trial knowing he just has to play the race card to win.Other outstanding performances are Brock Peters as the man Peck is defending, James Anderson as the father of the girl he's accused of violating, and Frank Overton as the county sheriff.This film was the debut of Robert Duvall in the part of Boo Radley who plays the autistic neighbor of the Finches. No dialog at all for Duvall who conveys great and pained emotion with a series of expressions that are unforgettable. Duvall played a similar role in another Peck film, Captain Newman, MD.Gregory Peck got the Best Actor Award for 1962. He was up against some very stiff competition that year. Peck beat out Jack Lemmon for Days of Wine and Roses, Burt Lancaster for Birdman of Alcatraz, Peter O'Toole for Lawrence of Arabia and Marcello Mastroianni for Divorce Italian style. No doubt sentiment did play a part in the final award. Lemmon and Lancaster had already gotten Oscars and O'Toole and Mastroianni were relative newcomers. But I sure think the Academy selection that year has stood the test of time.This film has sure stood the same test.</fullReview>

Every once in a while I stumble upon such a masterpiece which moves me to tears, because it reminds me that, all bad things aside, there is good in all of us - we just have to help each other search for it and bring it to light.This is definitely one of the best films I've ever seen. Mary Badham is absolutely wonderful as 'Scout', and I think she deserves just as much credit as Gregory Peck for this picture.The rest of the cast are great as well, and a special mention goes to Elmer Bernstein for his delicate and so appropriate score.I love this movie and recommend it to anyone. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life in the Deep South during the Depression...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this movie, and read Harper Lee's prize-winning novel, when I was in High School. And the subject matter has stood the test of time...'To Kill a Mockingbird' would have to be one of the classic on-screen court-room dramas and Gregory Peck once said that his award-winning portrayal of Atticus Finch, a small-town lawyer during the Depression, was his crowning achievement as an actor.The other character dominating the movie is 'Scout', Atticus' school-age daughter, who seems like she would rather be a boy at times. Her adult character (never seen on screen) acts as a narrator, quietly reflecting on and interpreting some of what we see.'Jem' is Scout's older brother. Jem and Scout's mother had passed away previously and there is a touching scene early in the film where the children quietly remember their mother and are overheard by Atticus. At the same time Sheriff Tate arrives to offer Atticus the most difficult case of his career -- that of Tom Robinson.Tom is an African-American and race relations in the 'Deep South' is another major theme of the film. Tom has been accused by a white woman, and will face a white judge and white jury. Some might say that the movie points to social inequalities and the fallibility of our judicial system.The movie is filmed in black and white and this seemed wholly appropriate given the subject matter and austere setting. It's a poignant movie that can be enjoyed many times over...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Healing View of Fatherhood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm surprised that there aren't more comments on Peck's amazing depiction of Atticus Finch, the father. In this era of absent fathers, preoccupied fathers, abusive fathers, immature fathers, etc, etc, Peck's Finch gives us all a soothing view of the best of fatherhood. Where else do we get to watch a man sit up with his ill child, stand firm in his convictions, show patience and gentleness with his children, demonstrate an appropriate level of humility, communicate righteous values to his children, and give his children a picture of integrity to emulate. Every time I view this film I wonder how Peck was able to pull this off. Every time I view this film, it gives me hope for the future of fatherhood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that's close to my heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About ten years ago, a year or so after I was married, I became quite ill and was bed-ridden for almost two weeks. I was in so much pain I could not sit on the sofa and look at television; my eyes hurt so badly from my fever that I couldn't even lie in bed and read. It was Christmas season and my husband, working in retail, worked extra long hours. With no way to entertain myself or even to sleep, the long hours spent alone were almost unbearable. Then I had an idea: I had seen that our public library had books on tape. I asked my husband if he would find something interesting for me, not having any idea what sort of "books" they might have. He chose To Kill a Mockingbird.I had, of course, always heard of the book but apparently it was not on our required reading list in high school. Remembering how I had loathed so many of the books I was forced to read in school, I had mixed feelings when he brought it to me. Still, I welcomed ANY distraction to help pass the time. What an absolutely wonderful book it turned out to be. (If my memory is correct, it was read by Meryl Streep. What a beautiful job she did of it!) Looking back at it now, I'm glad I got so sick that winter, or I might not have had the opportunity to "read" it. What a comfort it was to me during a painful, difficult time.A few years later I ran across the movie on television. I was so very pleased to see how well they translated it to film. No film ever captures EVERY facet of a book (or we'd have an awful lot of eight hour films out there!) but the book was definitely given justice. Having grown up in the deep south myself, even having myself attended segregated school and seen INTENSE prejudice amongst the privileged white upper-class, I applaud the book's writer and the film's producer all the more for producing such works during a time of indescribable social struggle and upheaval.To Kill a Mockingbird is a strong, quiet film of great dignity... qualities that are sadly lacking in almost every film made in this country today. To me though, having first come across the book in the isolation of of sickness, listening to it hour after hour in the dim light of my bedroom, watching the grey winter clouds pass by the window as I listened, it will alway be my own special, personal film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterful transformation of book to screen, evokes the better angels of our nature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Exiled to Pennsylvania for four years, I read this book to then later watched the film with my children because I saw it as the best gift I could possibly give them from my heritage. TKAM showed a whole generation of southerners how we might live up to our ideals and grow out of our bigotry. This is film making at its unpretentious best- unlike Kane or the Godfather, or Kurosawa, this film isn't about the director or even the actors; it is about a story whose poetry and truth have the power to change people. In that sense it renders powerful testimony to what film making can be. Cleverness and "genius" in making films will, at best, only rate an "8" from me. This film represents what I think a "10" rating should be about.Gregory Peck's performance fits the intent of the film perfectly- quietly dignified and accessible because of his ability to get himself out of the way. Not every book deserves or even affords film makers the luxury of making a movie that so closely reflects the feel of the book, but TKAM is one of those films that understood the book it was based on and the dream of the author who wrote it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some scattered thoughts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers warningI bought the DVD for `Mockingbird' recently, remembering the courtroom scene where the defence attorney Atticua Finch (Gregory peck) throws a glass to Tom Robinson (Brock Peters) the defendant, asking him to catch it with his right hand, and then again with his left hand. After watching the DVD, I still cannot remember whether I've seen the film before. The above scene I might have seen in a trailer but I do have some vague recollection of the `scary' visits to the strange house. The strongest themes that come out of the movie would undoubtedly be racial injustice and the law enforcement system purportedly originated from Camelot. The film does not stoop to poetic justice on both counts, which puts it one notch above your usual courtroom thrillers. Do not forget though the title of the film. The mockingbird alludes not to the wronged black defendant, but a mentally disturbed young man who appears only at the very end. Most ironically, the injustice is vindicated not by the machinery of the legal system, but rather by a `crime' committed by this mentally disturbed youth. This is the most thought provoking aspect of the film.Gregory Peck won his Oscar in this film. Recently, we have witnessed more and more cases where an Oscar is won by bawling and howling on the screen, augmented by helps from the general political atmosphere, best exemplified by the year 2001. Peck won his in 1962 purely on the merit of his performance.The moving spirit of Mockingbird is in the trio of kids, brother and sister at (about) 12 and 6, plus a little guy of 7 in neighbourhood, who appears at the commencement of every summer holiday. While both guys are excellent, it's Mary Badham who stole the show playing the little girl. Of all the child stars that I have ever seen, she is the only one that does not suffer in comparison with Haley Joel Osment (`Six sense' etc). I would love to see this pair together on screen, except that they are in real life almost 40 years apart. A wild and crazy thought: could she have been his mother? One delightful final surprise, noticed only when I checked into IMDB, is that Boo, the mentally disturbed young man, was played by none other than Robert Duvall !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How I love this movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film takes my breath away. It's a perfect drama! It is so unpretentious, profound, simple, truthful, and elegant. It is absolutely timeless. It seems to deeply move everyone who watches it. I own this movie and bawl my eyes out every time I see it. But it's a good cry. To Kill a Mockingbird (TKAM, I'll call it) both breaks my heart and inspires me, because it reminds me of human beings' capacity for decency and bravery.Has there ever been a more touching character than Atticus Finch???? Not a perfect man, not a God, but just a person who respected the rights of other people and tried to do the right thing; he was a "decent" man. He tried to live his life according to the saying "do unto others as you would have them do unto you." Such quiet dignity! I can see why Atticus Finch was recently named the #1 movie "Hero" of all time by the American Film Institute. Just thinking about this movie brings tears to my eyes. The only other film to affect me in such a deep way has been The Shawshank Redemption.Gregory Peck would be forever known as Atticus Finch, and he expressed how honored he felt to be associated with such a character. I saw an interesting documentary about Peck's life, and in it he was doing one-man shows around the country. These shows were question-and-answer sessions with the audience, and the majority of questions and comments were related to TKAM and how portraying Atticus Finch had impacted Peck's life. It was so interesting and touching to hear people talk about how the film and that character affected them. I remember one man standing up and saying that TKAM inspired him to become a lawyer, and that he named his son Atticus. I've read here and there about the favorite movies of various celebrities, and have been amazed that of all the movies out there in the world, there's one title that pops up frequently as a favorite - and that's TKAM. And it's the favorite of all kinds of people, both young and old. I almost fell off my chair when I read that it was Madonna's favorite movie. Didn't think she has such good taste! Anyway, how extraordinary it must have been for G. Peck, Robert Duvall and all the other people who were part of TKAM to realize that they created something really, truly impacted people - and could inspire people to try to be better human beings. Wow. Such a legacy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"To Kill a Mackingbird" -- Memorable Because of What It Doesn't Purport to Being</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After forty-three years, "To Kill a Mockingbird" (TKAM) remains one of the most effective testimonials to the ravages of ignorance and prejudice ever recorded on film. Asking myself why this gracefully paced narrative has left such an indelible impression on so many, I've concluded it's because the film isn't about what most of its supporters and detractors claim it's about. Not about race or prejudice? . . . No. At its core, TKAM is about "neighbors" and "community", which concept forms the basis for the gravity of its message in the matter of Tom Robinson.Other films have followed on the familiar theme of racial bigotry and its well-documented devastations. These films have been consistently less effective because we are not asked to think so much, or to connect the history depicted with the histories of our own lives and our own communities.I've performed in two stage versions of TKAM, neither of which benefited from the brilliant input of screenwriter, Horton Foote. Both plays focus, almost exclusively, on the racial element of the story. They, like so many films of later years, come off as "heavy-handed" or "in-your-face" regarding this element. Well . . . "If you think this way -- you're bad." End of story. In TKAM (the film), we see a community of poor, unique, and apparently respectable people helping one another through a Depression. In stark contrast (and beautifully prepared by the film's creators) the injustices meted out to Tom Robinson and his family represent a dramatic anachronism of unthinkable proportions. And, it's as routine, in this gentle Southern community, as a child's fear of a mysterious neighbor, or a shy but happy exchange of hickory nuts for legal services rendered. Memorable? Most emphatically. Think about it. It's what director Mulligan wants us to do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Essential.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Undoubtedly a classic hallmark in cinema, To Kill a Mockingbird dealt with social issues when social issues were still very much an issue in society, much more so than today although some of the same basic feelings are still present. Being younger than the film itself, I can only imagine the impact it had on people when it first came out. And seeing how the film has not been forgotten after the decades since it's release, I think it's safe to say that it had quite an effect as it continues to do so. Having read the book in high school, the film seems fairly accurate to the story except for a few very minor things that are mostly the result of a book being condensed into a much shorter journey.Gregory Peck is perfect in his role as Atticus Finch and apparently I'm not alone in that opinion as he won an Oscar for the role. All three children in the movie are also quite impressive and entirely convincing. I particularly enjoyed seeing Robert Duvall in his first film appearance as the ambiguous Boo Radley. It's very difficult to give reviews for older films, particularly ones that were made prior to my existence, mostly due to the inevitable fact that like everything else films also age, sometimes weakening the original potency. But to be honest, the only thing that I can see that has noticeably aged is the music, which is entirely understandable and is to be expected. And given the fact that it's over four decades old, that is quite a statement. It all boils down to a very important film about a very important and popular book in which social issues were dealt with and still holds relevance today. Like many classics, it's not just a movie, but a film with a message. A heart warming classic and an essential notch in the belt of film history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are two highlights of this film: One is, as could be expected, Gregory Peck's portrayal of Atticus Finch as the rock of his family, the law, and even the entire Maycomb County. The other is the sharp, focused direction by Robert Mulligan. Hopefully, every movie-lover has seen at least one or two films in which every single camera angle is perfectly done. This film is one of them for anyone who has seen it. The silences and long pauses (almost Ingmar Bergman-esque in their magnitude) accompanied with some of the sharpest b &amp; w photography in American Cinema make this a film that sears its images into your brain.The story, as anyone who has read Harper Lee's novel can say, is both sentimental and powerful. The screenplay by Horton Foote is good, but only as long as it follows Lee's clearly stated boundaries.To Kill a Mockingbird is a film with a brilliant lead performance, sensible, savvy directing which, when mixed with Lee's touching, fulfilling story of American values, is not going to be forgotten for a long time after the initial viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Generally, I prefer to review movies I dislike, because I am better able to quantify negative opinions than positive ones, but "To Kill a Mockingbird" deserves a review as few other movies I have ever seen. I probably cannot make any statement about this film that has not already been made many times, but it really is one of the most beautiful and moving films I have ever seen. I first read Harper Lee's lovely novel when I was a young teen, and it was one of those books that gave me an experience that changed the way I perceived the world and my own family. The movie stays true to the wonderful, innocent prose.Every time I watch, I see my father in Atticus Finch. He, too, is a southerner who respects people and defends his beliefs. He also has always respected his children and treated us the way Atticus treats Scout and Jem. I also see other family and friends in various characters in the film, because we have such strong southern roots. Even the negative aspects of racial antipathy and loss of childish innocence bring certain memories to mind. Those who did not grow up in the south or with southern families might not see parallels the way I do, but the movie would be a gem to anyone. Gregory Peck put in the performance of his career, and the children acted in the least forced manner I have ever seen. The cinematography is also beautiful, and the script is perfectly balanced-not too sparse, but also not dialogue heavy.The best thing about "To Kill a Mockingbird" is that it preserves the spirit of the novel that resounds with so many people. This film stands as one of the best ever arguments for tolerance, loving families, and the beauty of life through a child's eyes. Everyone who watches movies ought to see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a beautiful movie about innocence and racism.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To Kill a Mockingbird is one of the best movies that I have ever seen. This movie shows some of the problems between blacks and whites. These differences between two races make this story so special. The characters adaptation was very interesting, starting with Atticus Finch and his children. Also, I love how this story was told through the eyes of one child.In this movie were many things that make it interesting such as the characters, the theme, plot and mysterious elements. First, the main actors had a very good representation on their characters, for instance, Atticus Finch, Scout and Jem. The theme of this story was based in prejudice and was showing the differences between blacks and whites. Also, the plot was very detailed and exciting because Boo was scary and mysterious. Finally, Tom Robinson also brings to the plot the essentials of the movie.Although the movie To Kill a Mockingbird is very exciting, some things do not show the truth of the story. One of these things is when Mr. Radley cemented the tree's knothole and the children get down without knowing the cause. Also, something needing to change may be the Ewell family because they are an evil family without any feeling toward other people. The trial of Tom Robinson is conspicuous and sad because the movie itself makes him an important character. But knowing all these things, this movie is still great.To Kill a Mockingbird is a great movie where you can find one of the most recognized actors of all time, Gregory Peck. Mr. Peck stands out in all his qualities that are made by his values. One of the foremost qualities of Gregory Peck is his courage to confront the goals of his work and his personal life. Atticus Finch and Gregory Peck have a different life and feelings, but they are both moral men. Finally, both conduct themselves with dignity.In conclusion, To Kill a Mockingbird is a beautiful movie that I will like to recommend to everybody to watch. In this movie one learns about the social class, the good and evil. One thing that I really liked was to know about Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch. Also, I felt empathy with many situations in the movie that reminded me of similar times in my life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To Kill a Mockingbird (1962) ***1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the classic novel by Harper Lee, this wholesome adaptation stars Gregory Peck in an Oscar-winning part as Atticus Finch, a righteous defense lawyer during the depression era down South. He's a loving single parent who tries to instill values into his two children, Jem (Philip Alford) and his younger sister "Scout" (Mary Badham). The story is told as a flashback from the perspective of a now-grown Scout (who narrates) during one memorable summer in her youth where her father elected to defend a Negro farmhand named Tom Robinson (Brock Peters). At a time when black people were not well respected in small southern towns, Finch stands alone in his plight to help the innocent young man who has been wrongly accused of raping and beating a white woman. Brock Peters is highly sympathetic as the good-natured Robinson during an unfair courtroom trial, with Gregory Peck as his well-meaning attorney with the odds stacked against him. Fine acting also by young Alford and especially Badham as the children learning about bigotry through their dad in addition to the ongoing trial. Robert DuVall makes his very first motion picture appearance in a small but unforgettable part that remains crucial to the success of the story. ***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRDAlthough I am not a huge fan of trial movies, TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD was a very different and amazing movie. To me, this movie was really realistic in that it shows us a little bit of the prejudice that the United States lived back in the 1930's. All students should watch this movie to have a better understanding and learn the importance of fairness and treating everybody the same way. That might be a good method to learn more about realistic fiction.After seeing the movie I understood how important it is to acquire knowledge about different themes that directly or indirectly can affect us. TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is an excellent movie that was pretty much like the book, written by Harper Lee. It is a realistic film that includes idioms and symbols to give to the audience a better idea of the book and also a better understanding. The movie emphasizes in the trial scenes but also in the history that was going on with the children and Boo. It gives us an idea of how different the world of the kids is and makes us understand that even though they are children they also understand what is going on around them and with the innocence and truth they can make adults understand them. The characters of the movie were definitely well played. The actors were really into their roles and made all scenes to be realistic to have an impact on the audience.The movie counts with an amazing group of actors that portray their characters in an excellent way. However, the actor that I liked the most is Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch; who is a great person full of grace, greatness, style, and more. to me the most important virtue is his immense humanity. Gregory Peck was a person that knew how to treat people and was always worried about others. All his efforts brought him to the Kennedy Center Honors in 1991 where he was honored for all his achievements in life. People close to him showed love and respect to this great actor who taught us that we have to have a great heart to succeed in life like he did.Although I really liked the movie TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, in my opinion there are many things that I would definitely change to make it even better. Something that I think is really important is to include the scenes from the book that were left out, like the part were Mrs. Maudie's house got on fire or when Jem damaged Mrs. Duboses's garden. Personally I think that it would be more interesting to the young audience if the movie were in color, so definitely I would make it in color to attract people's attention and make them interested about the movie. The characters were well played by the actors but over all I would change some of them for others that I think would do it better and more realistically. Making changes in a movie is not an easy thing and might work or not. Some people would think that the changes you made were really good and you would really see the difference but you also have to be prepared to be rejected and criticize, even though those are some changes that I think would work for teenagers.Rating the movies you see is really important because it would help you to know what kind of person you are and what type of literature are you inclined for. As reader of the book I can compare it with the movie and I rated it also as a viewer. The movie shows the most important things of the book and emphasizes really well on the main ideas of it. They use good vocabulary that is easy to understand and itself explanatory, helping the viewers with symbolisms and idioms that are in the book. The movie is definitely better for a person that prefers it instead of a book, however it is very important to read the book first and then watch the movie to compare and understand better.TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is a great movie that teaches us a lot about life; it shows reality and cruelty that makes us change our way of thinking. Racism and prejudice are present in our society, not as in the 1930's, but still here. I think that by watching this movie everybody would understand that life is hard to live in a society that rejects you and discriminates against you all the time without a valid reason, so I strongly recommend this movie to everyone. you will have goose bumps.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well-made film from Harper Lee's controversial but justly-celebrated book with Gregory Peck standing pensively tall and mighty as Atticus Finch, one of the most warmly regarded literary figures of the past century. Mary Badham does sterling work as a young white girl in the South watching with interest as her lawyer-father defends a black man on trial for raping a white woman. The coming-of-age dramatics and the rural atmospherics are ladled smoothly but thickly, and the juxtaposition with the heated courtroom theatrics is a bit bumpy; still, all the trial scenes are riveting, and Peck certainly earns his Best Actor Oscar with his fatherly approach and quiet grace. The film is difficult at times and perhaps tries too hard at others (it has a heavy spirit), but it's also quite rich as a character-study and it has a profound affect on many people. *** from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted to be a lawyer after I saw this movie. Gregory Peck was astounding ;now that is acting, letting your face, body language, silences and actions speak the entire gamut.I followed the stories here through three different generations, the older generation Atticus Finch's set; watching him try to be a good example to his children while integrating himself into their lives, teaching them values unconsciously while setting standards and boundaries for discipline is a delight to watch. Miss Crawford and the old lady who was dying and Jem had to visit her, these bring an extended family element.The middle set : Boo Radley, whose eyes and vision is what follows the children round the neighbourhood ; living his dreams through them and bearing their heartaches as well.And the children ; Scout Finch is a most poignant storyteller; she relates the most significant things with colour and life. When they find the wax dolls in trees, the importance they attach to it, the feeling that Boo is watching and when she gets to meet Boo, she isn't at all scared, it's been so long that the anticipation of meeting him turns into respect. We grow with Scout at Atticus' knee, with Calpurnia, with Aunt Alexandra, with Jem &amp; Dill, and finally in that epiphany scene with Boo (when she walks him home), she ages and time stands still and even when she returns to the present, she has become an adult in many ways; love, honour, sacrifice and selflessness all hold new meaning for her. She was never going to see the world through a child's perspective again.Boo was supposed to be scary, I'm thoroughly thrilled to know that it was a very young Robert Duvall.The storyline is simple but gripping, racism &amp; prejudice burn long and slow and it takes the honour and faith of men like Atticus Finch and the sheriff to diffuse this or deal with it. When Boo kills Jem's Attacker Tom Ewell, the sheriff fabricates a story to protect Boo's privacy and the fact that he acted in defence of the children. As Miss Crawford says "it's a sin to shoot a mockingbird as they sing all day and give us sweet music" there are two mockingbirds; Tom Robinson and Boo Radley who have done nothing but try to co-exist and bring peace to their little world.The language belongs to the era; the settings are stark depicting the harshness, simplicity and "beauty" of those times. The themes of racism, superiority/inferiority complexes, sacrifice, respect, integrity and honour all resound strongly. It is a lesson in morals but a picture; a signpost for the future!! To Kill A Mockingbird reverberates with hope, while there is injustice, there will be those who believe in justice. Racism may always exist but there also those who believe in free will and equal; opportunities. At times all it takes is the simple voice of a child to remind us who we are.!!10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good story but not that well told</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Told in hindsight by Scout this is the story of how she and her brother remember one summer in the Deep South when their father, Atticus Finch defends a black man (Robinson) who has been accused of forcing himself on a white girl and then beating her. Atticus finds himself in a battle for the truth in the face of racism and intolerance and also defending his children from the impact of the same on them.I first read the book in school and have re-read it several times as it has really stuck with me. Since then I have seen the film a couple of times but have never felt that it really reaches the same height as the book does. The telling of the story is at it's strongest in the courtroom as it takes on the principles of a courtroom thriller however outside of this central piece it is almost a Southern cliché ? with the kids, the community etc. It still works but it feels like a postcard compared to the reality of the South in the intolerance of the courtroom.The film doesn't totally bring through the themes of the books ? instead focusing on the specifics. This is necessary to make it all fit into the 130min running time but it is to the subject matter's detriment as it loses much of it's significance. That's not to say it is not impacting, because it still is. I do have a problem with the first half and the end of the film where the focus is entirely on the children before sudden jumps into the main plot. In the book it is all part of the same thing, here it does feel like it is a different chapter.Peck is good in his usual moral indignation role and he is well supported by the two child actors who both seem natural ? Badham (sister of the director) and Alford. A very young looking Robert Duvall is in the film briefly and adds a bit of interest to the generally good supporting cast. It is to the film's credit (considering the period and the setting) that the black characters are not just limited to `yessir' stereotypes although at times they come close.Overall I enjoyed this film and the courtroom scenes are pretty tense even knowing where it is going. The narration of the grown up Scout is a little weak and some of the film appears to be wandering to no effect but it is still a good film. I, however, would still rather re-read the book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must-watch classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"To Kill a Mockingbird" centers mainly around three characters: Scout, Jem and their father Atticus, who raises his children to the best of his ability while defending a black man accused of raping a white women.I first saw "To Kill a Mockingbird" shortly after reading the book in my high school English class. Being born less than 20 years ago I'd lie if I said I was not slightly put off by it being in black and white; how stupid was I. The book itself was great and to my surprise the movie portrayed Harper Lee's story excellently. To those still wondering whether to watch this 1962 classic, do it! The cinematography is excellent, but what really makes this movie is the performance put on by Gregory Peck; our hero in this movie and perhaps the greatest film hero ever!There are some powerful scenes which showcases Atticus's moral outlook on life and the story of how he defends a black man whose fate has already been sealed is sad yet inspiring. One line that stuck to me from the novel is Miss Maudie telling Scout after the trial had been lost: "I thought, Atticus Finch won't win, he can't win, but he's the only man in these parts who can keep a jury out so long on a case like that." This pretty much sums up Atticus's determination to give Tom Robinson a fair trial despite what the rest of the community may think.The child acting was impressive and the characters of Scout and Jem were portrayed as children should. They were naive and silly, doing stupid things and disobeying their father time and time again. But during the three year time spine in which this movie plays off you see them growing, taking more of Atticus's advice in along the way. Scout is of course our main protagonist and she and her brother were highly relatable and contributed to the success of this movie.Conclusion:I recommend this to almost everyone. Young lawyers, movie-lovers and most importantly to all the fans of the novel who haven't seen this film: You won't be disappointed!www.250moviereviews.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best ''BLACK AND WHITE'' movies of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To Kill a Mockingbird is a wonderful movie, which is based on Harper's Lee novel and it is mainly about ''racial differences" through the innocence eyes of Atticus's children ''Scout and Jem''.The film is depicted in a simple way which makes it even more interesting in a sense where the problem is showed in a so implicit way.The story occurs in the 1930 in old Maycomb town, ''Scout'' curious and inspirational daughter of the loyal and humble father ''Atticus'', the latter in charge of the defense of the black man Tom Robinson wrongly accused of raping Ewell's white woman.Atticus Finch famous lawyer of the county had to face the curiosity of his children most importantly ''Scout'', she was disturbed by what was happening and it was depicted in a naive way to show us how stupid the problem was, a problem which come from a grey nothingness that is unacceptable and understandable by the children minds and as it is better explained in the novel ''there is something in our world that makes men lose their heads''.Atticus '' Gregory Peck'' amazingly played the role of the lawyer, a white lawyer who's defending a black man against prejudice during an epoch when the black people suffered an incomprehensible discrimination, The court room scene where Atticus is seen so keen to defend and show that ''Tom Robinson'' is not guilty through a meaningful speech in which he pointed out the evidences.Robert Mulligan did a good job to convert the so famous novel into a wonderful movie even though the novel still has some more interesting discussions and actions but still the movie reflected that climate and image the county was in at that time.All in all, the movie panned out to convey to the audience the racial problems that occurred at that time and making it one of the best ''BLACK AND WHITE'' movies of all time.Highly Recommended!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Good &amp; Bad Of 'To Kill A Mockingbird'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For some reason, it took a long time before I ever gave this movie a look, and when I finally did last year I was very pleased and saw why all the fuss was made over it. Then, I watched it again about six months later and got disgusted with some of it. Maybe I should have waited another 40 years between viewings! (Only kidding)THE GOOD - Well, I can start with the fine acting and interesting characters, led by Gregory Peck as "Atticus Finch," one of the more noble characters ever put on screen. He is single father taking care of two adolescents and is a strong moral man who stands for all that is right. The main theme of the movie is racism, and I'm sure this much bigger impact 44 years ago than today. It wasn't long after this that the U.S. was embroiled in numerous race riots. It was a tumultuous decade, to say the least. There also is a tiny sub-plot in this story which involves another kind of bias, one against the mentally-ill or simply against pre-conceived notions we might have of people who are different from us.Not only is Peck outstanding, but kudos to the kids in here, too, beginning with Mary Badham as young "Scout." She only made one other movie and never acted as an adult. She's a great kid in here and winsome in a tomboy-ish way. Her brother "Jem" (Philip Alvord) also is good, and has a wonderful scene in front of the courthouse protecting his dad against a mob. New-found friend "Dill Harris" (John Megna) has a much shorter role but completes the trio of youngsters who all prove to be capable actors. Kim Stanley narrates the film as grownup "Scout" looking back on those days. Brock Peters is good as the black man accused of something he didn't do, and it was interesting to see Robert Duvall in, I believe, his first movie role. He had done TV for a couple of years prior to this film. His role, however, was right at the end of the film and he said very little, if anything, as the misunderstood "Boo Radley." This is a very nicely photographed film with great lighting in here. The whole thing was shot on a Hollywood set. It looks super on the latest special-edition two-disc DVD. I enjoy watching the great black-and-white images in here but then again, it's easier to produce perfect lighting like this rather than going on actual location and adjusting to the conditions. Still, it's a visual treat.BAD - In the filmmakers' zeal to show the ugliness of racism they were insultingly biased in the courtroom finale and unrealistic in portraying the lead male racist. Being "fair and balanced" was not something shown in coverage of the trial since the most dramatic parts - the final summations - are wonderfully and powerfully presented by defense attorney Finch but we never hear the prosecution summation! What happened to that speech? We only hear one side! At least give us viewers credit for having enough common sense to know what's right after we hear both sides. The film world rarely treats the moviegoers intelligently, preferring to hit us over the heads with their agendas instead. And, showing this redneck "Bob Ewell" (James Anderson) going out all alone and ranting and raving in front of house full of blacks late at night is ridiculous. Nobody, but nobody is that stupid: white, black or any color. But, once again, the filmmakers do everything they can to manipulate their audience and this film is extremely manipulative. OVERALL - Nonetheless, despite the obvious bias it's still a good, powerful story with great moral lessons. It also gives us something we don't see much in modern movies: an ideal father figure, not just in the way he handles his kids but all adults, too. You can't find a much better role model. I'd like to see more of this types of people on film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To Kill A Mockingbird is probably one of the most over evaluated movies of all time.The first hour is absolutely boring to death, endless and in the end pointless. The scenes follow one another very disjointly, with no binder, and it goes nowhere. There is no soul and one is close to a flat electroencephalogram watching these children play, because this is almost exclusively what it is about.Then comes the second part dealing mostly with the trial. This is what kind of saves the movie, and still, even if you get more or less carried away by the testimonies and demonstrations with the underlying themes of racism and segregation, it remains rather weak qualitatively.But what is the most disconcerting is the lack of coherence of the feature with the association of two parts that almost have nothing in common. One is under the impression of watching two completely different movies: chronicle of a childhood or anti-racist pamphlet, a choice should have been made...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I got on a kick of watching two things recently: 1) good courtroom dramas and/or 2) classics. imo this is neither.maybe way back in olden times this movie was something special but all I kept thinking was "why are these kids in every scene?" and "when do we actually get to the court stuff?" the former is apparently what the movie is about and the latter came and went before I knew it. I guess I could complain the court drama was too short but in hindsight that was actually a blessing.the afi top-10 all-time court dramas incomprehensibly has this as #1!! are you kidding me?? I mean I'm not a totally unsophisticated person but not only does the court portion come very late in the movie, almost as an afterthought, it was as thrilling as peeling potatoes.see this movie if you must but I hope you know more about why you want to see it than I did.ps anyone that actually was looking for an old-time court drama, "witness for the prosecution" was fantastic. quite corny in parts but good drama, very good legal stuff and charles laughton was riveting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Old Gray Bird Ain't What She Used To Be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One hates to be the skunk at the garden party but this movie simply isn't as good as its reputation might suggest. It is extremely dated and calculated in ways that are now obvious but probably worked back in 1962. The dialogue has a tendency to go on for too long in almost every scene, as points are hammered home continuously, didactically, but aside from the scenes that belong only to the children the film is dramatically leaden and top heavy in what were at the time 'dangerous' and 'radical' ideas about racism and injustice (though they were fashionable in Hollywood), and frequently the movie feels like a sermon, and a self-congratulatory one at that.As the story of children growing up in the Deep South during the Depression the film works fairly well. It is beautiful visually and the photography by the underrated Russell Harlan is flawless. The performances of the actors who play the children are superb. Had the movie stuck to being their story it might have been a masterpiece. The part about the elusive, ghostly Boo Radley struck a chord, and I suspect that most of us can remember a spooky neighbor or two and the stories we used to make up about them. So far, so good. But when the black man accused of rape entered the picture a different movie emerged: preachy, obvious, self-consciously genteel about bigotry being the preserve of poor, ignorant rural folks, and above all obvious. This is when it becomes a star vehicle for Gregory Peck, who delivers an extraordinarily self-righteous summation to the jury complete with "for the love God!", and I stopped believing what I was watching and I began thinking about some of the shabbier Rod Serling Twilight Zones of long ago, with their 'messages' about 'little people' at the end. The film shifts into high gear in the last act, with the attack on the children, which I still find frightening, but the damage had been done, and even with Boo (blessedly) back in the story the poetic mood of the earlier parts of the movie was recaptured only fitfully, and I had a feeling of having been set-up.Some of the problem with the film is obviously the Harper Lee novel it was adapted from. Miss Lee wrote a good book but as a writer was a far cry from Faulkner or even Eudora Welty, and having reread large portions of it a few years ago I must say that it dates as badly as the movie. She was trying to do too much with her wistful story, and got her politics and poetics mixed up, and the result is an unsatisfactory stab at greatness, though I must say it's a good try. But alas she missed the mark, and so does the film. There's a good deal of sponantaneous feeling in the stuff about the kids, but when it shifts to grown-ups neither Miss Lee, director Robert Mulligan or screenwriter Horton Foote seems to know how to make things work. Suddenly the story turns moral with a vengeance. It's not easy to treat the issue of a man falsely accused of rape any other way, for sure, but it ruins the magical tone so meticulously built up in the earlier scenes. Yes, the world of childhood has as much to do with imagination as reality, and especially with imagination applied to reality as a means of interpretation, which in adults seems the preserve of artists and no one else. The move from childhood to adulthood is often tragic, as life's unpleasantries become unavoidable. Art at its best provides a respite from this as well as another way of seeing life, of feeling things differently and of thinking deeper thoughts. In art we have the opportunity to recapture at least some of the affect of childhood, but to do so with wisdom and understanding.In To Kill a Mockingbird we see a liberal take on childhood, as imagination is tranformed, in the course of the narrative, into a sense of civic responsibility. Children, mockingbirds and black folks are metamorphosed into a kind of helpless class. Only they, it seems, are truly in touch with nature, truth and the meaning of life. The adult whites are either good or bad, interesting only inasmuch as they have all the power and often use it badly. The trick, as the film implies, is to get these blinkered white grownups to appreciate the pure world of freedom and ease that the children, mockingbirds and blacks enjoy, and all will be well, or at least a whole lot better. But alas the reason the white grownups are so dull and moralistic, in good and bad ways, come from their sense of responsibility, which comes with power, and which children, mockingbirds and blacks don't have. When they do get power (viz. Lord Of the Flies) they prove as capable as adults of doing foul, nasty things. I think that Lee, Mulligan and Foote are aware of this contradiction, if only subconsciously, which is why the prevailing mood of the story is one of sadness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic movie about a small-town Southern advocate including intense court drama , atmospheric scenarios and superb interpretations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Splendid and flavorful rendition based on bestselling novel written by Harper Lee , being perfectly scripted by Horton Foote . The film takes place from the summer of 1932 to October 31, 1933 , Atticus Finch, (Gregory Peck's favorite work , who earned a deserved Academy Award) , a lawyer in the Depression-era South, defends a black man (Brock Peters) against an undeserved rape charge . Meanwhile , he attempts to explain proceedings to his kids (Mary Badham , Philip Alford) , trying to understand life and against social prejudice . The most beloved and widely read Pulitzer Prize Winner by Harper Lee now comes vividly alive on the screen in this magnificent picture , being leisurely narrated and stunningly filmed . Interesting and thought-provoking screenplay by Horton Foote who also earned an Oscar along with Gregory Peck . Well realized and deliberately paced ; being a powerful retelling , including evocative settings , appropriate cinematography in white and black by cameraman Russell Harlan and rousing musical score . Extraordinary acting by Gregory Peck as a small-town advocate at law who defends an African-American accused of rape . Support cast is frankly well ; cast members such as Mary Badham (Scout), film debut by Robert Duvall (Boo), Frank Overton (Heck Tate), Collin Wilcox Paxton (Mayella), Ruth White , Richard Hale , Paul Fix , and William Windom (Mr. Gilmer) , being narrated by Kim Stanley . Mary Badham became the youngest girl to receive an Oscar nomination, ironically losing the award to another child actress, Patty Duke in The miracle worker (1962). Special mention to Brock Peters , as an inmate , wrongly accused as rapist ; he started to cry while shooting the testifying scene, without rehearsing it this way, and Gregory Peck said that he had to look past him, instead of looking him in the eye, without choking up himself . With the death of Rosemary Murphy (Maudie Atkinson) on July 5, 2014, Robert Duvall (Boo Radley) is the film's last surviving adult cast member . Sensitive as well as evocative musical score by the great Elmer Bernstein ; the piano in Elmer Bernstein's score was played by John Williams . Adequate production and set design , as Art directors Alexander Golitzen and Henry Bumstead had an entire reconstruction of the fictional town of Maycomb, Alabama, built on the Universal backlot at a cost of $225,000 , as the set contained more than 30 buildings . The motion picture was magnificently directed by Robert Mulligan . Robert's way of handling his child actors was to let them play together while keeping the cameras as unobtrusive as possible. It is the first of six films director Robert Mulligan made with his producer partner, Alan J. Pakula . Director Robert Mulligan and producer Alan J. Pakula traveled to Harper Lee's hometown of Monroeville but found it unsuitable for filming , the town had been modernized ; therefore the production team constructed their own ideal version of Monroeville on a backlot at Universal . Robert Mulligan was a good filmmaker expert on dramas such as he proved in ¨Bloodbrothers¨ , ¨Baby the rain must fall¨, ¨Kiss me goodbye¨ , ¨Same time , next year¨ , ¨The Nickel Ride¨, ¨The man in the moon¨ , being his greatest successes the followings : the eerie tale of supernatural titled ¨The other¨, the adolescent drama ¨Summer of 42¨ and this ¨¨To kill a mockingbird¨ . The latter ranked #1 on the American Film Institute's list of the 10 greatest films in the genre "Courtroom Drama" and in 2007, the American Film Institute ranked this as the #25 Greatest Movie of All Time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read the book. That's the reason why a film with an 8.5 average gets a 5 from me. I read the book. If I didn't, it would still be an OK film, there are so many scenes that feel out of place, and so many important characters that got cut out, and the characters that they DID leave, were not developed. Another reason was, that the actress who played Scout (I don't care what her real name is, just read) was annoying, really really annoying. Every time she spoke in that false southern accent, it made me cringe. The person who played Mayella Ewell was enjoyable though, and I thought Tommy Wiseau was a bad actor. Now the majority of praise for this film was Gregory Peck as Atticus, and... it really didn't do that for me, not that it was bad or anything, but it was all in a personal preference. In the end, if you want to see the film, see it first. This is one of the only times I will tell you this because it works.

		<shortDescription>Brings tears to my eyes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every once in a while, there is a movie that successfully brings tears to my eyes, no matter how often I watch it. To Kill a Mockingbird is at the top of that list. The scenes of Scout being shown by Atticus what she will inherit when he dies, of Scout finally meeting Boo Radley, and most of all, that most important journey through the woods by Scout and Jem -- these are the key tearjerker moments for me.(COMMENT: I have read many of the previous comments. As with so many other movies, I am tired of hearing comparisons to the novel. You simply cannot do in a movie what you can in a novel, and conversely, you cannot accomplish in a novel what you can in a movie. This film is so intense, so innovative in cinematography, acting and music, and you simply could not get that out of the novel. That's why there are novels and that's why there are movies. It's a different experience! I recall people complaining about how major plot elements from the novels Dr. Zhivago and East of Eden were left out of the movie versions. Well, duh! Look at the sizes of those novels! There is no way you can cover it all in a theatre! You must choose what is most important to the main theme, and go with that. This is what happened in To Kill a Mockingbird, the movie. You do know, by the way, that Harper Lee loved the movie, don't you?)I remember the first time I showed the video to my youngest son and his best friend. They were about Jem's age. They were literally transfixed. They were glued to the screen. One of the elements that helps keep us so emotionally caught up in the viewing of the film is Elmer Bernstein's exceptional soundtrack. Then, there's the opening credits set inside the cigar box full of childhood toys, possibly the most original I have ever seen, and definitely a brief commentary on Boo Radley's childhood and on the loss of innocence. The theme of innocence is so integral to this film. Boo is innocent. Tom Robinson is innocent. Scout and Jem are innocent now, but we realize that someday, they could be like all their bigoted neighbors...except for the superb example their father is showing them. Atticus Finch is indeed one of the outstanding heros of American film. What he does is not much in the grand scheme of things, but he puts his neck out for an innocent black man, knowing the consequences of his actions. And yes, there are awful consequences. This is his heritage to his children. You know they will be like him some day. I appreciate knowing that the character of Dill was based upon Truman Capote as a young child, as this was a semi-autobiographical novel by Harper Lee, who knew Capote. This helps us understand Capote a lot more. This movie is a masterpiece. It moves me, and I take it that it moves many others. (By the way, I have a new CD of the soundtrack by Elmer Bernstein, re-recorded and with the orchestra directed by Mr. Bernstein. I highly recommend it. It goes from sweet and lovely to downright frightening. If you've seen the movie at least twice, you can follow the story just by hearing the music.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The most interesting part of this film in my opinion was the court scene. It didn't quite sit well with me, considering that the man was guilty after his lawyer proved his innocence. The obvious reason the man was seen to be guilty was based on his race. His lawyer basically got a confession that the woman lied about being raped, yet the court still found the man to be guilty. Like I said, this was an interesting scene to me, but it also didn't sit well with me. I hated how everyone in that room was so hateful of a man because of his race, that they chose to go along with a lying woman and her disgusting father. But luckily, the father died at the end of the movie, and I like how the lawyers daughter quoted something her father said towards the end of the film</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't help but wonder what Atticus Finch would be like in today's world and what sort of thing he would stand up against. He might be impressed with how far racism has come since the '30's, but I'm sure there is some other injustice that would similarly upset him. Certainly he would have a thing or two to say about this generation of parenting. I think he would probably not be into a lot of the group rallies and such that go on today, but rather would just try to change people's hearts doing what he does best just as he does in his own setting.Showing the story through the mostly innocent view of Scout and Jem is great for us as an audience. It forces us to look at the injustices shown in innocent and mostly unprejudiced eyes. Jem and Scout are introduced to some of the evils of the world through Atticus' court case, but are still able to help him do his job in their own way. Much of the original story is cut, but I thought the screenwriters did a good job choosing what was most important to show. Tom Robinson's court case and the children's investigation of Boo Radley are the only two plot threads that are fully maintained. The subplots involving various town events and some affairs within the Finch's extended family are chopped. The court hearing is also moved to a later and more dramatic position than in the book, which I wouldn't dispute.Jem and Scout do not take any major actions that move the story, but feel like active characters in their learning the ways of the world and the way people are prone to act. They seem to be good kids, though not always obedient or wise. Still, they seem to respect and understand the reasons behind Atticus discipline of them, which reflects well on both parties. Atticus is almost too good to be true as a person, but I could believe that someone in his position could be as upright a person as he is. I think his saying that he couldn't live with himself if he didn't defend Tom Robinson is proof of his moral fallibility. Most of the other characters, while prominent, are not worth talking about apart from the Ewell's. They are a prototype of white trash that cheat the system and don't contribute to society while taking from those who do. The unseen villains however are the socially pressured members of the jury that condemn Tom Robinson to his death.The three kids did a much better job acting than is usual of child actors. They felt like actual kids and didn't give the impression that they were just being cute for the adult audience members. Gregory Peck also gives a great performance. The Ewell's actors are a little hard to judge since the characters are putting on appearances themselves. I suppose the actors found a sweet spot of believable deceptiveness. Heck Tate, Calpurnia, Maudie Atkinson, and Tom Robinson's actors all give decent showings. Robert Duvall doesn't exactly perform as Boo Radley, but he looked perfect for the character even though I had imagined Boo Radley much differently. The camera work seemed pretty good even though some of it felt a little bit cheesy. The script was adapted quite well and kept the pace up and never lets you feel bored.I would recommend this to almost everyone, though it's not the pinnacle of entertainment. It does make you a more conscious person and calls you to consider what prejudices you might have clouding your judgment. If you don't like old movies or material that seems "boring", I can understand where you're coming from, but would still encourage you to see this through as a form of self-improvement. Overall Rating: 8.2/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inspiring lead character in a very inspiring movie. One of my fav in my top 5.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie when i was a kid. Then again during high school days, then again with my kids. My kids loved it. One of the greatest movie of all time. Even at a young age I was captivated by this seemingly simple story told through the eyes of children that I could easily relate to. Perhaps also it was the fact that the part of the story that dealt with Boo Radley, (ROBERT DUVALL) held a kind of mystery. My daughter kinda got scared of the character BOO. But once she saw the entire film, she too loved it. To me the character, Atticus Finch&nbsp;(GREGORY PECK) remains the top screen hero of all time. The child actors are excellent also- particularly young Mary Badham as Scout, the little girl . One of the most moving parts of the movie is when Atticus Finch is leaving the court room and the Reverend tells Scout to stand up your father is passing. This is a deeply moving and powerful film about right and wrong seen through the eyes of children. Mulligan's direction is flawless. Art Direction by Henry Bumstead and Set Decoration by Oliver Emert are brilliant. They indeed bring to life what a small Southern Town would have been like in the early thirties. Excellent cinematography by Russel Harlan. The use of black-and-white cinematography conveys the mood of Depression-era small-town America perfectly and one of the best things is the music by Elmer Bernstein. Gregory peck's best performance and very inspiring character. Very inspiring movie. Waiting to own it on a blu-ray.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was in 9th grade, we had to read "To Kill a Mockingbird" (I was in an advanced class), and I didn't like it much. I constantly got lost, and even got the title mixed up with "Hunger Games: Mockingjay" (I called it "To Kill a Mockingjay" by accident). So when I heard there was a movie, and how fantastic it was, I said, "Well, I'll check it out". Eventually, Netflix added it to stream, and I finally sat down and watched it. Why didn't we watch this in class? I was able to follow it, and even enjoy it! The court scene is my favorite part. Atticus is also my favorite character. Shocking, huh? Who doesn't watch this movie and pick Atticus as their favorite character? And why shouldn't they? He's a great character! You look up to this guy as much as Scout and Jem do. If you're reading this book in school like I was, take some time to watch this movie. If you're not reading the book, or never read the book, still give it a watch, it's fantastic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The sheer definition of a classic and possibly the most important film ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not the only reviewer to state how important this film is. I have seen it before but its been years. I fell in love with the book when I read it in High School and the film is probably one of, if not thee, most beloved adaptations to film ever made and its easy to see why. The same heart and soul that brings the book to life comes through in the film equally and that is no easy feat. Its a coming of age film, but its also a film completely and utterly indicative of its time and locale. You're not watching a movie, you are completely involved in this little town and in the Finch family. You are standing right there with Scout and Jem and you are in silent awe of the powerful and yet subtle man that is Atticus Finch. Gregory Peck was likely born to play this role as was several of the other characters. The film is so mysterious in the way they approach Boo Radley that you are literally a kid on the street with them anxious and curious about Radley. For whatever reason we don't see the accused Tom Robinson until well through halfway the film. Despite being black and white, there is something vibrant and completely powerful about the setting of the film. And the closing battle in the courtroom is easily one of the most awe inspiring scenes in cinema history period.Gregory Peck was an icon of Hollywood long before this and long after. I'm not sure I've even see other work by him yet. His portrayal of Atticus Finch is easily the most respected performance in cinema and its easy to see why because it is just a natural, fluid performance. He's quiet, stoic, low key and yet behind all of this you see the fire and passion for justice, a wild side of youth, the fierce protective streak he has for his children, the sadness of losing his wife...the performance is mesmerizing. You would think anyone else acting with him would pale in comparison but not the case at all. Mary Badham (Oscar nominated performance) and Phillip Alford give two of the best young person performances I've ever soon. They are completely amazing as siblings Scout and Jem. Their chemistry is untouchable, their performance mesmerizing, and the three of them (with Peck) are unbelievable. Even still this doesn't count on the amazing cast performance from the supporting characters. John Megna, Frank Overton, Brock Peters, Estelle Evans, Collin Paxton, Richard Hale, James Anderson and Robert Duvall (in his debut performance) make what is one of the best casts of a film ever. They make this little dirt poor town come to life and you don't feel empathy for them as much as you just feel like you are there experiencing it.Nowadays when a director comes exclusively from Television, I find that they have a really hard time translating stories into feature length films as opposed to serialized like TV. Director Robert Mulligan did come from Television and yet it seems like he had this ability to take an entire series worth of character development and make these characters come to life in just over two hours. He tells a lifetime of a story in one feature film and its unforgettable. That is what makes To Kill A Mockingbird a classic...you watch it and you will never forget it. Lines that Scout and Atticus speak, Peck's infamous closing dialogue at the trial, Boo Radley's appearance...you can just watch this again and again and take something different away from it or experience it as though you were watching for the first time. If you wonder where Hollywood Magic has gone...watch this and see when that Magic was at its height. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good....But overrated.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now i think this is a very good movie and a very good book. But just looking at the IMDb rating and the reviews, this movie is clearly overrated. I've read the book about 4 times and have seen the movie twice. Some very good things about the movie was adapting the book. It was very well adapted and stuck very true to the book. Gregory Peck did a great job as Atticus. Also Brock Peters did a very good job as Tom Robinson. Most people perform pretty well. That's not why this film is overrated. The movie when looking at it close is pretty bland. I mean the movie itself isn't that great. The movie can be slow at points, not all the characters were good (Dill and Mayella). The ending was different then the book and i liked the book ending much better. And overall the movie just didn't have anything special to offer. To sum it up perfectly. Its a good book adaptation movie (for the most part) with nothing great to offer and nothing bad either. I like it, it just doesn't deserve the praise it gets.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To Kill A Mockingbird-Greg Peck vs. Prejudice Again ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Truly an outstanding film with Gregory Peck once more fighting prejudice as he did so brilliantly in 1947's "Gentleman's Agreement." Peck should have been made the forever spokesperson to promote religious and racial understanding and tolerance among people.With a truly haunting musical score that will be forever remembered,Peck's Oscar-winning performance here is a restrained one, but terrific nonetheless, as Advocate, Atticus Finch, defending a black man accused of molestation. While doing this, he must cope with being a parent to his two children; he is a widower in 1932 Alabama, a time of crisis in America where a campaigning FDR has stated that we have nothing to fear but fear itself.The supporting cast is just marvelous here. Mary Badham, as his daughter, received a supporting Oscar nomination and one wonders why others such as his movie-son, the alleged rape victim and her father were overlooked. How about Brock Peters, the victim of racial prejudice and the supportive judge?The film correctly depicted the anger and bigotry plaguing the country in the 1930s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Any man could become a great father, but few could become a Daddy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone who has had an awesome childhood will find "To kill a mocking bird" a fascinating movie. Moreover, anyone who has had a complicated interrelationship with their father will also be totally absorbed by the film. The movie starts with a delightful chronicle spoken by middle age Scout( Jean louise) .The narrative was both warm and somehow Intellectually nourishing:"(you have) nothing to fear but fear itself."The young six year-old Scout (girl) is curious joyful and really active, able to read before school, asking all the questions that jump into her head and readily greets with neighbors and almost everyone and radically honest and frank in her conversations with people. From the beginning Atticus(father) seems to be a prestigious, self- controlled man and smartness drips drop drop drop from his words from the very commencement:" (I would like to thank Mr Cunningham) but I think it embarrasses him to be thanked." He is a prominent lawyer and is respected by citizens.Jem (boy) shows up on a tree on his first scene. Demanding his father to come and play football while he refuses believing he is too old for that. So the simple conclusion is that Jem is unruly. They meet Dill, conservative coward but thoughtful boy, and a typical childish group establishes. Jem rules the group, Dill is sort of his protégé and Scout's curiosity makes her follow them. then classic secretive house with mysterious and frightening story behind it (Radely place) comes along and ?.A black guy is convicted of raping a white girl and judge appoints Aticuss as his advocate. Though the trial was so lame,both the subject of crime and conversations but Mayella(raped girl) acted a notable scene saying her dialogues passionately in wrath. Moreover the decision of jury was promising for the story, since audience expected Tom claimed to be innocent but announcing him guilty, in my book, was a practical peak in the storyline. besides, when black community stood for Atticus leaving the court even when he was defeated was profoundly effective scene and a great way of teaching respect : "Miss Jean Louise(scout), Miss Jean Louise. stand up. Your father's passing."Overall, since the movie was released on the cusp of the civil right movements in united states ,it could be considered highly influential both in Justice and Racism. attacking prejudice against black people , racism and inappropriate social protocols made the movie an epitome of ideology. In other hand, " To kill a mocking bird" from the children and family point of view is totally a masterpiece. a manifesto of a nice family that has lost the mother. It is almost inevitable to smile when Atticus interacts with his children. As if I will finish with emotionally breath taking conversation of Jem with Scout in their bedroom before they go to sleep: " -jem? -yeah? -how old was I when mamma died? -two -how old were you? -six -as old as I am now? -uhummm -Was mamma pretty? - uhummm -was mama nice? - uhummm -did you love her? -yea -did I love her ? -yes - do you miss her? - uhummm(jem going to sleep) "</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I saw it when I was a child</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this when I was a child at a drive-in movie theatre in Phoenix, AZ (where is was a $1 a car) and I remember it so vividly because even as a young child I understood that what happened to Tom Robinson was wrong. Not because I was precocious but because even as young child I could understand what were the underlying tenants of this movie. The storytelling is straight-forward and yet it plumbs the depths. I didn't know anything at that age about civil rights or the struggle of African Americans. This movie is profound because even if you never had encountered this environment (the South) you would come away with a profound understanding of it in all of its levels and permutations. It has a deceptively simple script that belies it's deep roots and in that way Horton Foote's script truly honors Harper Lee's book. PS--Truman didn't write that book --he would have been the first to claim it --IF he had! It is a genuine, true American movie that never fails to move one by it's deeply human characters and story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unexpectedly great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I'm sifting through IMDb's top 25 movies and happen upon To Kill A Mockingbird. Being a bit of a movie "know it all". I sit down to watch what I expect to be a black and white courtroom drama where the "hero" wins out and they all live happily ever after.Could I have been more wrong?First off it's not a courtroom drama, it has a short courtroom scene but majority of the movie happens from a child's perspective of their fathers court case. Secondly it is black and white but it's bizarre in that having only seen the movie once, 2 days ago, I'm remembering it in colour. Third, it's certainly not a happily ever after movie. It's haunting and has an incredible reality about it.The performances are solid and very well rounded. There seems to be more to each character than is being revealed here and that fact alone makes me want to pick up the novel and find out more.It's a shock to find something so old that is so great and so fresh. I loved it. Robert Duvall's entrance is wonderful too!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To Kill a Mockingbird is an excellent movie based on</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To Kill a Mockingbird is an excellent movie based on the novel by Harper Lee and Screenplay by Horton Foote directed by Robert Mulligan. This movie is about Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck) and his children, Jem (Phillip Alford) and Scout (Mary Badham), dealing with racism. Atticus tries to raise his children to not be prejudice. When Atticus defends a black man Tom Robinson (Brock Peters) who has been wrongfully accused of raping of a white woman, Jem and Scout are confronted with conflict from classmates at school. This conflict raises questions that motivate the children to go on adventures to satisfy their curiosity. They are curious as to why so many people hate Atticus for defending a black man. The children get a dose of reality of how cruel people are when it comes to black people when they enter the courtroom to watch the trial. The children have no prejudice and this is seen when they sit on the balcony with all the other curious black people. The children also encounter a different kind of prejudice when it comes to Boo Radley (Robert Duval). They hear many different exaggerated stories about how scary and insane he is. The kids are terrified because of these stories and fear Boo.There are many themes in this movie but there is one that coincides with the plot and this deals, again, with prejudice. It is seen throughout the movie, more specifically with the trial of Tom Robinson. The trial of Tom Robinson shows the largest amount of prejudice in the movie. It starts with the separation of the whites and blacks with the seating in the courtroom, the whites on the main floor and he blacks on the balcony. The jury is even made of all white men.To Kill a Mockingbird is similar to the movie Crash directed by Paul Haggis. Both movies deal with prejudice, but Crash seems almost worse because it focuses not only on black people, but all races and nationalities. The creation of the movie Crash shows that prejudice is still alive and well today as much as it was back in the era of To Kill a Mockingbird.Lighting and angle enhanced many points of this film. The low-key lighting allowed the shadows to bring fear to Scout and Jem in the forest and at night in their neighborhood. The shadows of the trees looming overhead were spooky. The best low-key lighting scene is in the forest as Jem and Scout were walking home through the forest after Scout's play. She was still in her ham costume that limited her vision. Once they started hearing the footsteps, they knew they were in trouble. The shadows allow the viewer to feel the intensity of the fight even though the viewer doesn't know who is fighting. The shadows playing over Scout during the fight, is frightening because it is so close to her and she is forced to watch what the viewer can't. This is an edge of the seat scene for sure. The angle of this scene also enhances the fear and uncertainty of what is happening. The angle works with the low-key lighting to only show the kids and not the danger. You can see the fear on the kids' faces before the attack begins.There are many forms of prejudice, but To Kill a Mockingbird is a reminder of how black people had to live in fear and little hope for proper justice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robert Mulligan Shoots To Kill</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In depression-era Alabama, two young children (Mary Badham and Phillip Alford) are afraid of a light-skinned White man (Robert Duvall) while their father (Gregory Peck) defends a dark-skinned Black man (Brock Peters) accused of rape. Mr. Peck helps his children maneuver the fear and prejudice that grips us on the verge of adulthood. The prosecution of Tom Robinson, which has become a cliché, is often given as the film's basic plot; but, this is a serious miscalculation as this much more than a courtroom drama. That story is meant to work in conjunction with the one involving Arthur "Boo" Radley; together, they give the story poetic justice.This film is impeccable. The ensemble cast is miraculous (witness John Megna as Truman Capote). The photography (by Russell Harlan) and music (by Elmer Bernstein) are symphonious. And, director Robert Mulligan shoots it as a horror story. This may seem strange; but, when you think about it, "To Kill a Mockingbird" couldn't be shot any other way. It's terrifying. Remember, "It's a sin to kill a mockingbird." If you've never read Harper Lee's Pulitzer prize-winning novel (1960), watching Horton Foote's Oscar-awarded adaptation and reading Ms. Lee's book (in whatever order you wish) are a couple of those things to do before you die.********** To Kill a Mockingbird (12/25/62) Robert Mulligan ~ Gregory Peck, Mary Badham, Phillip Alford, John Megna</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heartwarming Production</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Heartwarming production is a loving recreation of Harper Lee's novel concerning wicked racial prejudice in a small southern town in the early 30's. It's easy to see that both director Robert Mulligan and screenwriter Horton Foote were much taken by the original source.Having said this, the pair do allow the film too much time to get started and so it outstays its welcome just a touch. Most of the time though it's lighthearted good fun and strong human drama.The children bring us a great deal of laughter in this film, however it was Gregory Peck who was the Oscar winner as the small town lawyer who must defend an African-American against a trumped up charge in a very "white" trial. Peck is assuredly solid as the single father who must explain the ways of the world to his children while trying to ensure justice is served.The winning combination of Mr. Peck's showing and Mr. Foote's Academy Award winning screenplay make "To Kill a Mockingbird" a most enjoyable picture.Sunday, November 1, 1998 - Astor Theatre</fullReview>

I didn't think they brought out enough of the actual rape case early enough. Yes I know it was from the kids point of view, but still...Minor point as I said. This holds up quite well and is worth your watching. You just knew Brock Peters was going to get it, so clearly was he a martyr.**** outta **** do check this one out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD opens with a female narrator describing the small town she was raised in, her poetic drawl and the lilt of her language dropping us smack in 1933 Alabammy - "recently told we had nothing to fear but fear itself" - just after the crash heralding the Great Depression; you know, the REAL Depression.From the 1960 Pulitzer Prize-winning book by Harper Lee, this movie, this tale itself, at first seems like a stream of Southern consciousness reminiscence, as we follow 10-year-old Jem (Phillip Alford) and his younger tomboy sister Scout (Mary Badham) on their daily adventures, with big-eared pal, Dill (John Megna). But MOCKINGBIRD is a crafty coming of age tale; what the kids believe to be their comforting haven - the tired town of Maycomb - turns out to have whitey fangs, and the person whom their wayward fantasies paint as a lunatic killer of children - their unseen neighbor, Boo Radley (Robert Duvall) - is ultimately a mundane dark angel.Lording over the proceedings, Gregory Peck as Jem and Scout's respectable pater, Atticus Finch - wise lawyer, moral pillar, the father we all wish we had; this legendary role cementing him so powerfully as the subdued, majestic voice of reason, at times it seems like Atticus Finch is doing Gregory Peck.To the kids, Atticus is an old fogey, too timid to let Jem wield a gun like the other kids, never letting Scout fight at school - until new-found respect dawns in their eyes when Atticus shoots down a rabid dog with one shot, Sheriff Heck extolling him as the "best shot in the county"; until Atticus represents a black man in court, the black community standing silently, poignantly, in respect for him, "Stand up, Scout. Your daddy is passing." The title is a metaphor for the main plot. Atticus tells his kids of the sin of killing a mockingbird. "They don't do one thing but sing their hearts out for us." A person who would kill a mockingbird must be a special kind of crazy. Tom Robinson (Brock Peters), the black man whom Atticus defends, is accused of raping a white woman, and after all evidence points to the woman's father beating her, after Atticus gives a racism speech that would make Obama proud - yet Tom is convicted. "And the all-white jury agreed." Before Atticus can request an appeal, Tom is killed for trying to escape.Jem and Scout sit through the whole trial, their respect for their father growing as large as their disillusionment with the justice system.In what seems like a coda to the movie, Boo Radley's identity is revealed, robbing the kids of the last of their illusions. The child actors are magnificent, even outpacing the great Duvall in his first film role playing nothing more than a gentle, enigmatic mute.TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is vibrant with the spirit of America - everything that made America - the intolerance and the acceptance, the killing of innocence and the crushing of human spirit; the poverty and the small towns where that poverty emanated from; and the children who would see injustice and one day work to thwart it.--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful and Stunning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A movie that shows the ugliness of ignorance, poverty and racism in the Deep South of the 1930s hardly seems a premise for a much-loved movie but this is exactly what you have in "To Kill a Mockingbird." Although this is told from the memories of a now-adult Jean Louise "Scout" Finch, this movie is multi-dimensional. You see the events from the points of the children, the adults, the victims and the so-called superior whites. It is a stunning and shattering revelation that one group can think itself superior and give little or no thought to those who are "inferior." And when one man - Atticus Finch - dares to do just that, he is vilified and literally spit upon by one of the seemingly superior whites, who, in reality, is a lout, a boor and a drunk. Most reviewers have praised the performances of the children and of Gregory Peck and most rightfully so. But to me, the performance that stands out most is that of the gentleman who portrays Rev. Sikes. When he says, "Jean Louise! Jean Louise! Stand up ... your father's passing" - it is the most riveting scene in the entire movie. No matter how many times I see it, it tears me up inside. Wow! Another riveting scene to me is Brock Peters as Tom Robinson, as he testifies in his own behalf. With tears streaming down his face, he tells what happened at Mayella's house. The pain in his face is palpable. But what I remember about Brock Peters, however, is what he did off screen. At Gregory Peck's funeral, Mr. Peters, who died 2 or 3 years later, praised Mr. Peck for his performance and he thanked the late actor for the privilege it gave him to work on TKAM. That was 40 years after the movie and yet Mr. Peters still praised Mr. Peck. THAT was classy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a movie buff, a movie lover to the fullest and I don't know why I had never watched this film. I watched it last night and it kept me hooked.I cant say anything great about it that hasn't been said but this drama had so much to offer.I honestly didn't even know the story, I thought it was about a black man being on trial for something he did to a white person and he was falsely accused. That is what the movie is about, but that is not the story the movie tells.I am all about hating racism and wanting the world to see the ugliness in judging people, this movie taught a lesson in that but I also admit I don't think you can tell someone that something is wrong without telling them why its wrong and what is right. This movie did a great job of showing so much about a man, about a human being and about how little we know about people. You cant know a man unless you've walked in his shoes.A movie with no horror, no violence, no romance, no big banner telling you what its about, but you walk away feeling that you understand it better than anything spelled out for you or explained to you. Its not deep its not complex or complicated, it is not simple or taken at face value either, it is just an emotion, an innocent look at something we never see in the people around us...the soul.The accused can be innocent yet be guilty of seeing himself through the eyes of his accuser and letting fear make him feel he is guilty. A child can be scared and yet brave because curiosity is stronger than fear. A shy man can be a hero and people can turn their backs on doing whats right in favor of doing whats expected.I cant talk about the movies plot without telling too much, I just tell people to watch it. The movie makes you want to like it. The characters are likable and you watch all that goes on and it just sucks you in. A drama with suspense and a touch of comedy and a lot of heart.The acting was perfect, those kids were just great and Peck was in this movie what every actor in Hollywood wishes they could be. The directing was so good the way it used the light to build up suspense and the way it took a movie made in the 60s and made it feel like it was made in the 30's. The music was great and it was just a wonderful experience.Boo Radley is one of the greatest characters ever in a film, I was on the edge of my seat wanting to know more about Boo and I was right there sneaking around and breathing hard with the kids, I was in this film feeling it, I was in the courtroom and in the woods and in the schoolyard...I liked this film a lot.I found a few little flaws in this film but thats always gonna happen and I know I shouldn't bring that up without explanation but I had to say it wasn't a perfect 10 to me but it was close.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A British survey once rated the novel "To Kill a Mockingbird" as one of the absolute must books you should read while on this earth. I think it would probably not be an exaggeration to say that this is also true of the movie adaptation of this novel -that it is one movie you should definitely see while on this earth The beauty of the plot and script of this movie is that it captures all the heartfelt emotion, passion and depth of the book and conveys it beautifully throughout the film while also exploring the important issues and themes contained in the novel in a way that gets the message across as powerfully as the movie did.I have very rarely seen such an entire cast do such a wonderful job of accurately portraying the characters that were assigned to them from the novel. Each actor and actress in this movie proves adept at making their characters come to life and giving them the same amount of depth and dimension that they do in the novel. Gregory Peck's portrayal of Atticus Finch is so perfect and flawless that it makes the viewer wonder whether he is really acting at all or whether he is just portraying his true character and persona in the guise of a another name and another occupation. I have rarely ever seen child actors as brilliant as the three children in this film -they portray their respective characters with a much greater depth than I have seen in most grown-up actors. The supporting cast equally does not disappoint -from Brock Peter's portrayal of Tom Robinson to Rosemary Murphy's portrayal of Maudie Atkinson to Estelle Evans's portrayal of Calpurnia. I have never seen a movie adaptation of a novel so perfectly cast This is a truly moving, powerful and heartfelt movie that is as challenging as it is beautiful.

This movie is without a doubt a masterpiece. Atticus is played perfectly. We also have the rare, unexpected, and perfectly executed knife scene with Boo Radley, which is every bit as good as The Shower Scene(thats saying something). There are only two other movies that have caught the courtroom and made it as dramatic as this movie. One, obviously, is 12 Angry Men, and the other is A Few Good Men. There is one enexerable truth, this movie deserves every bit of the hype given to it and more. I would recommend everybody(even people who do not like movies) see this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intriguing slice of Americana from living memory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on a Pulitzer Prize winning novel, this movie combines truth with fiction to illustrate a certain time in America's history. It takes a while to suss out the nature of this movie or what it's about. So, we're sort of like the nominal central character of the movie, "Scout" (Mary Badham), the young daughter of Atticus Finch (played by Gregory Peck), a hick town lawyer in America's Deep South (in the 1930s). Therefore, the early part of the movie has Scout be the centre of attention along with her childish concerns and relations with her younger brother and a new friend who is visiting.Later, this child centred point of view comes to encompass more adult concerns and, particularly, a legal case Atticus Finch has decided to take on...the defence of a black man charged with raping, I think, a white woman. At first, Atticus, seen from the children's' point of view is nothing special or exceptional. One of the pleasures of this movie is how their father transforms into someone to celebrate.Brilliantly evoking an America which existed even as little as 40 odd years ago, this movie and the book it was based on must have seemed a pebble in the shoe to a country which eulogised itself and its virtues.Finch, in court, is a quiet and smouldering figure exemplifying integrity and the pursuit of justice. Perhaps the court scenes aren't the most realistic ever filmed but the evidence conveyed is plausible and lucid. In fact, it's superior to the jury deliberations found in "12 angry men" which are somewhat logically jumpy. In other words, this movie seems to want to keep the court room evidence to a minimum for fear of boring us. It's brevity isn't a major flaw though.Sensitive issues are dealt with subtly in Mockingbird, but I do wonder if the fate of Finch's client was glossed over superficially without Finch type analysis from the film makers...or author?In black and white. Check out "The curse of the Cat People" which I review here and also deals with the world of childhood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The definition of excellence.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have come to the conclusion that the only way to rank films that are at the very pinnacle of movie-making is to get very picky and imagine what tiny facet or detail could be changed to improve them. With this criteria in mind I can think of only two movies that meet the challenge of being flawless, "To Kill A Mockingbird" and "The Godfather". I give the edge to "To Kill A Mockingbird" as the superior film because of the powerful social statement and Gergory Pecks incredible portrayal of the archetypal father figure, Atticus Finch.This is simply the finest overall display of movie-making I've ever seen and remains my favorite movie of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>well i've saw quite some arguments comparing the book and the movie...i can only say they are different, and it's hard to compare (sounds cliche, man^^). i like the book better, personally, but the film is excellent in its effort...i like the opening credit much with the great music by Elmer Bernstein, and Mary Bedhem was an excellent Scout (liked her hair style^^), and not to mention that lo~~~~ng but exciting speech delivered by Atticus on the trial (i told my friends that i wanted to be a lawyer after i watched it). this is the first film that made me think about equality and courage...and of course, to know that one must stand upright. i guess some people prefer the book probably because that literature provides a better room for imagination, and it's very disappointing if the movie doesn't turn out as what we expect. but as a movie it is great, and everyone should watch it as a movie, not as reading a novel...different medias, after all.NB. and on Elmer Bernstein's music...i agree that he's done a great job again^^</fullReview>

You also get to see Scout and Jem, all grown up.I expect this film continues to be used in schools as a platform for discussion of contemporary social issues.It would be a shame, however, if the movie were to be used as an simple substitute for the book, which explores a greater number of issues besides that of race. In addition the book nicely employs a couple of literary devices, which, in the hands of a skillful teacher, would be accessible to unexceptional high school students. And of course the story is riveting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay i think this was a pretty good movie. I also think it was a good book as well. But seriously this book and movie gets way too much credit. I hate to say this but i didn't like Scout's character in the movie. She was great in the book, but in the movie not so much. The movie seems rushed and kind of boring. Kind of a generic story. The characters were good and accurate to the book (especially Atticus)but Scout was terrible. She was annoying, very hard to understand, and had no emotion at all. This was a good movie but people treat it like it's the best movie ever made. COME ON! Im not saying it was bad, but if i were the director i would have done a better job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Please Don't Remake This Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harper Lee created a classic in her novel. This film adaptation is probably the best novel to film ever. It stars Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch in his Oscar winning role. Mary Badham plays the unforgettable Scout. One of the main reasons that I purchased the film was to see Ruth White in her performance as miserable Mrs. Dubose. Sadly she had a much bigger role in the novel but for everybody involved in this film classic, it was worth any minute of time. Alice Ghostley is also in the film as one of the mother and neighbor. Rosemary Murphy plays Maudie Atkinson. The film is first rate and classic which should never be remade even for today's audiences. It stands on it's own much Godfather and Citizen Kane. Please don't remake this film with today's stars.</fullReview>

He said that this was his favorite movie, which says a lot when one considers the quality work that Mr. Peck did during his career. There were no a weak performances by any characters--major or minor. The outstanding storyline of To Kill a Mockingbird allows the audience to interact with the key players.

		<shortDescription>Stand up, your father's passing?To Kill a Mockingbird</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While enjoying many novels that I read during my stint in the public school system, Harper Lee's classic To Kill a Mockingbird was always one of the most memorable. The story was beautifully told and showed a great example of moral fiber. Atticus Finch is the epitome of class and trust. He sees past age, race, intelligence and instead views the soul. After watching this film you might start believing that people really are inherently good.Perusing through the list of films that director Robert Mulligan sat behind the camera on shows me that maybe this film was his masterpiece. I have never seen nor heard of the rest of his filmography, (not to say he doesn't have any other gems in that list, I just wouldn't be able to tell you their names). He seems to be a very capable director, however, as the movie is shot quite well. The contrast of the black and white during many night scenes is effective and he does a good job framing the actors as they do their thing. There aren't any effects shots or skewed angles; Mulligan allows his cast to carry the film and that is a good move. The story is strong and the words are what matter most.Gregory Peck is just as good as everyone says he is here. He embodies Atticus completely, as a strong willed man of the community, a shrewd and moral man of the law, and a caring, loving father. Peck displays the many facets of his character as he treats all with the same care. His children call him by his first name and wander around the town alone. To Atticus, they are just as independently responsible as him?how can he second-guess his own children? Speaking of those children, it is hard to believe that both Scout and Jem are played by first-time actors. The kids, Mary Badham and Phillip Alford, are amazing. They act well beyond their years, showing the teaching that goes on at home behind the scenes. Not only are they intelligent, but they can watch out for themselves. Scout is not afraid to pick a fight if she believes someone close to her has had his/her honor called into question, and no matter how much Jem chides his sister for being too much of a girl, he is always there to defuse hostile situations and make sure his sibling is unharmed. Both child actors are very effective in their line delivery and most noticeably in their facial expressions. It sometimes appears that their reactions are about to go over the top, but they have the ability to keep it all grounded to reality. The most fun is their stubborn fear of neighbor Boo Radley, whom they've never met. Although shown very briefly, and without a single line of dialogue, Robert Duvall, also making his film debut, (which surprised me as I thought his premiere was THX-1138 since it almost seemed like a collegiate film, but in fact was filmed nine years later), is very convincing as the troubled young man who has come out of seclusion to help resolve the incident which takes place at the movie's finale. Talk about speaking and emoting through only your body language; one knows exactly what Boo is thinking thanks to Duvall's performance.To Kill a Mockingbird never drags throughout its duration. Even for someone who has read the novel, everything occurs with suspense and spontaneity. While yes, the climax in the courthouse is the shining moment, all that bookends the sequence is just as enjoyable. Gregory Pecks' closing statement to the jury is magnificent however. His powerful performance almost made me want to stand with those watching on screen as he left through the door upon the verdict. Atticus Finch truly is the greatest screen hero of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect For Black &amp; White</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of my friends know that I prefer black &amp; white movies to color. Black &amp; white can be very visually expressive, with its brilliant foregrounds and its deep shadows. It can also be perfectly suited to certain subject matter. TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD examines the difference between good and evil. For this, we need infinite shades of grey.The story takes place in a small Alabama town during the Depression. The central characters are Jem Finch, his sister Jean Louise (nicknamed Scout) and their father, Atticus (Gregory Peck). At first, the movie seems innocent. It concentrates on the children's attempts to get a glimpse of Boo Radley, the local recluse. This sense of quiet innocence is about to be shattered.Atticus, a lawyer, is appointed to defend a black man wrongly accused of raping a white woman. The man, Tom Robinson, is an honest, hard-working field hand. The accusers, Bob Ewell and his daughter Mayella, are the town pariahs. Bob Ewell is an unemployed drunk, an abusive father and, as we will discover, a liar. His daughter Mayella is a truly pitiable character: she must deal with her drunken father and care for her siblings. In expressing sexual attraction to a black man, she has broken one of the deepest unwritten laws of her society. She lies both to cover her feelings and to avoid her father's wrath. Tom Robinson has also violated an unwritten law: he has felt pity for a white woman. Thus Tom is punished for a virtue while the Ewells are rewarded for bearing false witness.Atticus Finch seems untouched by the rampant prejudices of Southern society. Compared to the other characters in the film, he seems impossibly noble. Many of the film's adult characters claim to be Christian, but Atticus is the only one who seems to live by Christian principles. He has a choice between the easy thing to do and the right thing to do. As the story develops, we come to see him as a hero battling to the end against impossible odds. Still, every hero has an eventual Ragnarok. Though Atticus proves Tom's innocence beyond all possible doubt, prejudice has stacked the deck completely against him. Tom Robinson is found guilty and eventually killed.Still, we must honor the hero, even in defeat. So Stand up, Miss Jean Louise. Your father's passin'!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawless and poignant portrait of racism, integrity, and childhood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I must confess to not having read Harper Lee's novel, this movie might possibly rank with me as the greatest cinematic drama ever. It paints a vivid picture of the incredible injustice of racism in the 1930's South, a character study of a very principled lawyer, and a bittersweet view of childhood's innocence.The film relates the story of a widowed Southern lawyer named Atticus Finch, as seen through the eyes of his tomboyish young daughter, Scout. Together with her older brother Jem and their sidekick Dill, the children explore the goings on of their local neighbourhood in Macon, Georgia. They also witness the South's entrenched racism in their own hometown when their father takes on the case of defending an innocent black man, Tom Robinson, who has been accused of raping a local white girl. Of course the jury is all male &amp; all white, and many of the prejudiced townsfolk do not take kindly to Robinson's defending lawyer, even extending their outrage to Atticus's children. Meanwhile, the youngsters are inquisitive about their reclusive neighbour Boo Bradley, rumoured to be a dangerous madman.It would be difficult to imagine a more compelling and personal depiction of racism than this false accusation laid against the harmless, kind hearted Tom Robinson. These trumped up charges in fact result from the victim Mayella's own sense of guilt. Brock Peters perfectly captures the quiet humanity of this utterly sympathetic, despairing defendant who faces a predictable verdict from jury members who see all black people as liars. The scene where he breaks down on the witness stand will haunt you forever. Robinson's humble home and anguished family round out the portrait of this travesty of justice. Atticus Finch is surely the most principled, gentlemanly fictional character ever conceived, masterfully portrayed here by Gregory Peck, himself such an endearing gentleman. He brilliantly captures Atticus's sense of justice and morality as he takes on the unpopular and even potentially dangerous task of defending Robinson. This is a kind and modest man who treats everyone with equal respect...black and white, rich and poor...the white Sheriff, his black housekeeper, his unjustly accused client, his children, his neighbours, the poverty stricken but proud farmer who pays him with vegetables for past legal services. Atticus never appears more dignified than during his controlled response to a churl who spits upon him. He displays patience and understanding with his two motherless children, as he quietly tries to teach them true values of fairness and decency. If only every child had a father with the integrity of Atticus Finch to emulate, this world would surely be a wonderful place.The three children are engagingly portrayed by marvelous, perfectly cast young stars, the entire story depicted through their eyes. Scout is a feisty tomboy, unwillingly forced to don a dress for her school debut and later prone to fighting with any schoolboy who offends her. Her older brother Jem is fiercely protective of his father, displays endless curiosity about neighbour Boo, and mockingly accuses his sister of 'becoming more like a girl every day'. Their chum Dill, a funny looking and comical fellow, describes himself as 'little but old'. What an appealing and amusing trio they make! Atticus's black housekeeper, Calpurnia, is a concerned and respected mother figure, who takes Scout severely to task for her rude manners toward her young lunch guest! The 1930's Southern small town neighbourhood is perfectly captured. Many of the scenes occur on the porches and in the yards, with the kids up to their assorted shenanigans. Their tree house and tire swing bring back childhood memories, and I can still hear those crickets. Unfolding events compel these innocent youngsters to face the sad adult realities of racism and injustice. Boo teaches the children a valuable lesson about the dangers of preconceptions, and gives the adults an unforgettable sense of true justice. Unexpectedly, he proves to be part of the title's mockingbird allusion.The atmosphere in the small town courtroom is brought vividly to life as the spectators fan themselves against the stifling Georgia heat. William Windom (from Murder She Wrote) portrays the smirking prosecutor. The trial is itself gripping and Atticus's concluding remarks riveting and inspiring. During the final courtroom scene, the local black townsfolk reveal with great dignity their respect and appreciation for Atticus. This film is a moving tribute to those who fought against the evils of racial discrimination and an incredible masterpiece that no one should miss. Though tragic, it proves ultimately uplifting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not since Mark Twain have we had such a compelling essay of childhood, superbly brought to the screen by the young members of the cast, with the bonus of the courtroom drama and the eloquence of Gregory Peck in his finest role. This is superbly crafted film which beautifully explores a nostalgic period we would all like to revisit perhaps, the idealized family of our youth. Certainly a fine adaption of Harper Lee's remarkable book, and it is the masterpiece of the 60's, which was a great period in cinema. There is a dark side to life in this sleepy Southern town, moral dilemmas, and racism, as seen through the eyes of the children, with the lightness of touch that endears us to the characters, and a wonderful feeling for the mood of the early 1930's. A great American film and a must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Harper Lee's novel is required reading for many school students, and with good reason. It is a terrific exploration of childhood, growing up, the individual and what the individual can achieve, the justice system and human values. Atticus Finch is surely one of the most heroic and true characters ever created, and Gregory Peck does a marvellous job portraying him in the film version of 'To Kill A Mockingbird'.His interaction with the kids is the thing I enjoy most about this film-how both the adult and the child grow to understand each other through the course of the film's events. Atticus is a great father figure, in the fact that he isn't perfect, but strives to do the best he can, as a widower, by his children. When I was a child, I used to sit and watch this and pretend Gregory Peck was my real father instead of my own (we don't have a very close relationship), because of his sincerity and goodness of heart. Peck's understated qualities as an actor perfectly suited the role, it is one of the best male dramatic performances you'll see.The child actors are excellent also- particularly young Mary Badham as Scout, the little girl whose eyes we see the action with. The use of black-and-white cinematography conveys the mood of Depression-era small-town America perfectly, and Mulligan's direction is almost flawless. The courtroom sequences are some of the best ever put to the screen; filled with high emotion as Peck, the town's most upstanding citizen, puts his reputation on the line to defend a black man accused of rape. Due to the town's (and America at large)racial prejudices, the trial is a foregone conclusion even though the black man is obviously innocent, but Atticus' true character and faith shine through.This is an amazing film adaptation of a powerful novel.10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great family drama through children's viewpoint</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is unique in it's viewpoint, being that of the children in the movie and especially that of it's narrator , the girl "scout".With that viewpoint, the film deals with mature adult matters as seen through the children's eyes. It thrusts us into their world with their playfulness and fears, especially from their mad next door Neighbor.There are certain scenes that are depicted as horror with the right lighting and music to accompany them , for it is the childhood fears that are depicted there , thus letting us experience it through their eyes.The children are there in almost every scene, whether as witnesses or as the main attention. The child actors give some of the best performances I have ever seen of actors their age. They truly behave like kids do, and not like child actors acting as children, they are truly believable. And let's not forget Gregory Peck giving one of his best performances as the loving protecting father on one side, and the protector of justice on the other, as he is defending an innocent black man in the racist American south.In conclusion a great family drama, told with tenderness and care, depicted through the eyes of the children.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly Heartwarming, Despite The Hatred</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quite a few of the Video/DVD stores in my town have the 35th Anniversary version of "To Kill A Mockingbird" in stock (this came out in 1997). At the end of the movie there is an excellent documentary about the making of "Mockingbird". There were two statements from this documentary, which really impressed me. First, Gregory Peck, then in his early 80s, stated that it was the luckiest day of his life, when he was picked to play Atticus Finch in this film! Second, Elmer Bernstein, who composed the film's music (he was also the same man who composed the alma mater band song for "Animal House"), explained how he came up with the theme song. He said that, since "Mockingbird" was a story told though a child's eyes, he tried to come up with a tune similar to what children do at a piano (simply playing around, haphazardly, with the keys). Out of that crude dalliance came one of the most beautiful and touching signature songs (once he magically polished it up with violins and other sentimental instruments). "To Kill A Mockingbird" is about a lawyer and his children, who paid dearly for his (Atticus Finch's) decision to do what was right. His acceptance of a case to defend a Black man, falsely accused of raping a local White woman (in early 1930s Macon, Georgia) certainly did extract some HEAVY COSTS on him and his children. As good and as noble a man as he was (and as respected as he was in his community), this trial and its aftermath turned his household UPSIDE DOWN! There was a great deal of pain, even before the trial, as well. We see the Finch family, at the end of the film, picking up all the shattered pieces and moving on with their lives, as best they can. We see Atticus, every bit as much the loving and dedicated father that he was throughout the entire story. This is why (for me, anyway) the very touching and moving theme song is like a song of TRIUMPH and COURAGE (as they prepare to move into the next chapter of their lives). What a wonderful father Gregory Peck's Atticus was (especially as a widower, and a very busy lawyer, raising two children). Of all the moving and powerful interactions he had with his children, what impressed me most was how he reasoned with them as if they were little adults (rather than "children"). He never seemed to talk down to them. He tried to talk (and negotiate) with them, as he would with one of his peers (a very interesting irony, since both children called him "Atticus" rather than Dad or Daddy!).I was also quite mesmerized by Peck's dramatic voice in the courtroom; especially when he was giving his closing arguments for the defendant. In addition I was quite struck by the statement of one of his neighbors (to his son, Jem):"Some men are born to do our unpleasant tasks..........Your father is one of them!"In a small way I saw a symbolism of Christ, when I heard Atticus described that way. Though he did not die for doing what was right, it took an incredibly heavy toll on him and his loved ones. The first time that I saw this movie, I was with a family member who felt uncomfortable about watching it. Her reason for feeling this way was because she thought that it would be "depressing" to watch something about racial strife between Blacks and Whites. I come away with so much more than that, every time I watch "Mockingbird". I would venture to say that it is my favorite movie of all time! </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A flawless adaptation of a perfect book (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To Kill a Mockingbird was the first book I ever connected with fully. I had lost myself in a story before, but never so completely, never with such an emotional response to the characters and their fates. For the past few years my health has stopped me from reading, and this is the book I have missed the most.Seeing an adaptation of a book you love is always hard, because you have to trade your imagination for that of the director and screenwriter. I know what Scout looks like to me, I know what Jem and Dill and Atticus sound like, I know what it was like to live in Macomb and to be scared of the Radley house. I was nervous watching the movie, hoping the producers would not lose or betray the spirit of the book, but their imagination was mine and everything in their adaptation was near-perfect.Like the book, the film is narrated by Scout and is played to perfection by Mary Badham. She captures Scout's tomboy spirit wonderfully and is at the absolute centre of the film. It's always refreshing to see a child actor who isn't sickly or over-cute or wooden, and the same can be said for Jem and Dill. Gregory Peck's Atticus was as he should be; quietly idealistic, passionate without really showing it. He won the Oscar for his performance, and while it was probably deserved, the kids outshone the adult cast effortlessly.It would have been easy for the film to have followed only the trial of Tom Robinson, an African-American charged with the rape of a white woman, but it would have killed the spirit of the story; the trial was just another part of Scout's childhood. She played with Jem and Dill, she saw the trial, she went to school for the first time, and she finally met Boo Radley. This approach gives the movie its quiet, understated morality and gentle dignity that made the book everything it was.It brings with it the powerful contrast between the innocence of childhood and the uncomfortable realities of the adult world, most famously in the scene where Scout talks to a lynch mob on its way to kill Robinson. It makes these points perfectly, never overstating them, never forcing them down your throat, telling only the truth.The story's power comes in its refusal to find easy answers, in its willingness to bring tragedy to its characters, and the movie captures this perfectly, with the same kind of understatement. It is really a wonderful adaptation.Inevitably, some details of the story were left out, but most of the important ones were there, with only the children's growing friendship with Boo Radley given less attention than it may have deserved. That is the only criticism I can offer.Until I can read again, I'll love this movie as I love the book. It was a peerless adaptation. If you don't love it for its gentle storytelling and quiet, understated idealism, your name is John Grisham and its depths are wasted on you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not an old movie about a black man on trial in the south.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an old movie about a young girl growing up in the south. Her father is a lawyer involved in what turns out to be a very interesting side plot. Yes, a side plot. I know this movie is touted as being about an important civil rights trial during the depression, but the film is all hers.This is a coming of age film that will make you wish you lived with her and her brother while you were growing up. The book, "To Kill a Mockingbird"(1961) by (Nelle) Harper Lee, paints a perfect little picture of home life. The movie lets you slip into that black and white house without feeling the transition. There is enough tension and adventure to keep things interesting though, this homestead is only a backdrop for the happenings all around their old fashioned suburb.Comparing movies to the books that came before them is getting old. But a comparison in inevitable. While watching this movie I was given the luxury of revisiting these characters again, without many of the familiar complaints that usually accompany a made form a book movie. The movie is indeed, as interesting as the novel. And furthermore, the movie is well worth seeing on it's own merits. Which, by the way, include Best Screenplay and Best Actor at the Academy Awards, a 1961 Pulitzer Prize winning book to inspire a screenplay from, and a warm involved story with very enduring characters. The movie is well worth seeing period.You will find this one in the "Classics" section, so go there and get it. Those old movies only rent for a dollar or so, and this one is worth a New Release price. But all in all, if you are going to a deserted island any time soon, bring the book if you have to choose one or the other. It just has more time to give you the feeling that made both the book and the flick so worth your time. And it's in colour too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Give it up for Elmer Bernstein</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't say enough good things about this film. It's one of my personal top ten films of all time. One of the best things is the music by Elmer Bernstein. He was veteran film music composer; he scored over 200 films. I don't mean to ignore the great story and the on-screen performances here. Browse the other user comments for those raves. I want to zero in on the quality musical score. It really drove home the emotional impact. Bernstein captured the curiosity and fear the kids had for Boo Radley, that later became understanding and appreciation. Other films with great Bernstein scores: The Great Escape (1963), The Magnificent Seven (1960), and The Ten Commandments (1956). Hats off to you, Mister Bernstein.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The basic plot: A weaving of the lives of the Finch family, southern society, and Atticus Finch's attempts to defend a black man in a legal case.The praise: Basically an untwining of depression era southern society , it sets the lives of Scout( Mary Badham)and Jem(Philip Alford) Finch, as they live their lives along the backdrop of depression-era southern society, in which their father, Atticus ( Gregory Peck) must defend a black man in a rape case. A film which presents its setting excellently, it boasts beautiful,crisp,detailed black&amp; white photography. Gregory Peck is at his ramrod peak in a demanding role as Atticus Finch . Everyone else is good too, including Robert Duvall in his debut as Boo Radley, a reclusive neighbor. It also shows that logic does not always win over prejudice, as Atticus, a lone individual, does not win the case.It touches the themes of racism and childhood coming-of-age and seeing people for their hearts and not for their outside behavior together, and in a very good fashion.must-see.The flaws: none.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the few films that is as good as the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To Kill a Mockingbird has always been a favourite of mine. I may have done myself a favour years ago when I decided to read the Harper Lee book before watching the film. It still amazes me to this day how exactly similar Robert Duvall's Boo Radley was to the one I pictured in my mind.Mulligan directed a fine film using a well established movie-star (Gregory Peck) and two children who hadn't been in any films previous to this. The performances of the children is of something beyond acting and it is this aspect that makes the film work so well. The film isn't overly long (which it could have very well been) especially throughout the courtroom scene.The issues dealt with during the film were still very touchy at the time this film was released. Perhaps the fact that this film is seen from the young girls viewpoint helps to be almost completely unbiased. The scene in which the lynching mob tries to get at Atticus and Tom shows the innocence of Scout, especially during her discussion with the father of one of her classmates. The whole basis of this film is the innocence of the children and how they make their way through the adventures and fears of the summer.I fully recommend this film to all.9/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh boy this movie is so awesome you will find yourself flying among the Angels when you watch it, or roughly about as high as they fly. This movie is so great it's like finding out your brother is famous.This film is based on a book, but that doesn't mean it's boring like all that other rubbish. In this case it means that the film is even better than possibly all other films based on books, but possibly in a different way to the way you might be expecting.The movie is all about a raper who must face his crimes and stand trial (as was traditional in the time and place where the movie takes place, and in that time too). The man who defends him as his attorney is a man with three kids, only one of them lives next door.The focus is on his kids as they fool around with rubber wheels and various other machinations. The film is told through their eyes, even though they are WAY TOO YOUNG to be attorneys.I have found it possible to think that this film is one of the most beautiful films there has ever been in the world. Even though I cried during the duration of this film and I usually don't like that at all (in fact I hate it if a film makes me cry because I feel like a baby), in this case I can forgive it because when I cried I had a lot of joy in my heart that made it swell up and make me cry from my eyes. But I did have a big smile on my wet face when I was crying. You will feel the same too if you see it, like dancing with your Grandfather.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film may have been great once, but today it feels rather dated.Sure enough, the film looks and sounds great even by today's standards. It has a sort of fairy-tale feel to it, which is also pretty nice, but it's essentially a 1? hour kids film with 30 minutes of courtroom drama oddly spliced in there. Therefore, I can't help but feel that the story and the way people act turns very naive at times (Little girl to angry lynch mob: Please, don't be mean! Angry lynch mob: Well... alright then.).And while the movie deals with racism, it does so with such stereotypes that it looses the edge. The blacks are humble good people (saved only by the grace of white super-dad Peck), and the most whites are a bunch of snarling rednecks. The kids are surprisingly good actors, and Dill may be one of the coolest kids I've seen on film, but after an hour of them running around playing, you grow tired of it. Peck (as the best, most caring, fantastic single parent in history) does one of those performances that you're supposed to really admire, but I think it's pretty stiff and stilted.Overall, it's good in parts, but it lacks that "something special" that can turn it into a classic.

		<fullReview>(Possible spoilers) Surely Harper Lee's morality tale was an impressive filming of an essential novel in 1962, but from the vantage point of four decades-plus it's an old-smoothie job -- respectful, careful, and entirely too pleased with itself. It's in black and white, and so are its issues -- you know from the first shot of the Ewells, from costuming, lighting, and angle, that they're white trash; you know from the first ennobling look at Tom Robinson that he's an innocent victim. You never have to think -- the movie tells you what you're supposed to think and feel at every juncture.Peck's Finch is a plaster saint; I suspect that the praise heaped on him, and the Oscar, has more to do with the quiet heroism of the character (who wouldn't want a father, a lawyer -- heck, a President -- like Atticus Finch?) than any great acting on his part. The storytelling strains credibility at some crucial junctures: Surely the redneck lynching crowd wouldn't be dispersed that readily by The Simple Wholesome Innocence of a Child, and does Atticus have to be, on top of everything else, a crackerjack rifleman? There's Elmer Bernstein's treacly scoring to underline the already over emphatic pontificating, and the photography, handsome as it is, pretties up a small Southern town in the Depression perhaps more than necessary. On the plus side, yes, it's an unusually up-close and incisive look at the growing pains of early childhood, and Mary Badham's Scout hits remarkably few false notes. Pauline Kael once dismissed it, scornfully, as "a movie the industry can be proud of," and I know what she meant -- its prime function seems to be to allow non-bigots to congratulate themselves on their open minds. The fact that its viewpoint is right, proper, and laudable doesn't make the movie any less smug.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Huckleberry Finn -- For Stupid People</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first glance this movie/book seems like an innocuous little HUCKLEBERRY FINN knockoff -- the pitch is seemingly the same, i.e. "cute kids battle racism." But look a bit closer and you see a great deal of smug, fatuous hypocrisy in the way race and class are presented in this dreary, pious and interminable sermon of a movie. Blacks are mistreated. Who's to blame? Why, those no-account white trash Ewells who live down by the dump. Who comes to the rescue? Why those affluent, civilized Finches. You don't need to be a genius to figure out that whatever the Finch family has comes from generations of exploitation and racial as well as class privilege. They are the first family in Maycomb because their ancestors owned the most slaves. Whatever goodwill they feel towards blacks now does not require any self-sacrifice or self knowledge on their part. They have the luxury of doing what's right while holding onto all the privileges their ancestors won for them by doing what was wrong. The Finches don't make sacrifices to end racism, they just punish the Ewells -- the whites who have benefited least from racism do all of the dirty work and take all of the blame. It is for just this reason that this movie/book is so popular with clueless types like high school teachers and liberal columnists. (Hello, Cynthia Tucker! Hello, Anna Quindlen! Hello, Kathleen Parker!) Unlike HUCKLEBERRY FINN, this book lets well to do white folks off the hook by reassuring them that it's only the white trash who will have to pay the price for racial justice. The thing that keeps HUCKLEBERRY FINN controversial after 150 years is that it questions both race AND class privilege. (Wealthy Widow Douglas is just as brutal in her racism as ignorant Pap Finn.) TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is a tired, cynical attempt to defend the status quo while pretending to challenge it. As Aunt Maudie puts it (with no sense of irony at all) "it's the people of BREEDING who must do something to stop this." The unpleasant fact that it was people of "breeding" who promoted (and profited from) slavery in the first place is rigorously suppressed -- and that is why this book is a wholesome classroom favorite while bad boy HUCKLEBERRY FINN remains as dangerous as ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Here is a film that is impossible to view as it was intended. That is because its effect was dependent on the cultural context in which it appeared. It was bold, working to explicitly redefine decency during one of the periodic self-examinations of the country. I saw it in 1962, and both of us are quite different now.Judging it now, apart from its historical significance, there seem some major inadequacies. In my mind, this is very much like `How Green Was My Valley,' which was wonderfully photographed and staged, but which had a hokey, romanticized story and some unrealistic acting. Here too. Peck may have been a loved performer, but he just doesn't have the stuff for this role. Everyone else who is on screen outacts him, is more real. More rooted in place. More naturally motivated.The book uses the thread of the story (sexual frustration, false accusation, cowardly herd condemnation, resentful attack, salvation by an innocent guardian) as mere chickenwire into which is woven many terrific small chunks of language. That language is not poetic in the sense of using the familiar to define the unfamiliar; instead it works the other way and is shocking and effective. To appreciate the book, you have to know Truman Capote's manner of enlarging the small, finding decision points inside characters and stringing them together in an external logic. Lee's approach to writing is to add another layer of observation: essentially she is reporting her view of what his view would have been. (The Dill character is Capote.) The mockingbird is a mimic who reports the songs of other birds found in its territory. It is fiercely territorial and seems to define its own identity as definer/reporter of that place.The film jettisons all this to give us a simple morality play. What a scandal. If the primary tone of the book is the respect for the richness of tradition in place, that respect is trampled by Hollywood. Well, nothing new there.But what we do get is some very interesting staging of the children. These kids are so formally choreographed, it is almost balletic. There is some movement, sometimes rushing movement, but everything is toward the goal of getting them in lovely group positions. Very theatrical, and I must say, very effective. None of their movements are natural, all come from the director's mind. But they perform them naturally, and this carries over the philosophy of how the story is told in the book. Some of the spooky staging is from "Meet Me in St Louis."This film has a very high rating in the IMDB system. I suppose most of these votes come from schoolchildren who are assigned this film as homework. The level of the morality play is just right for them, and they feel enobled.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

Everything happened so fast and many things were lacked while they were concentrating too much on the court-day and the emotions were floating. I myself think that Atticus is okay but his playing took over Scout was a big mistake. Scout is very cute but she and Jem seemed too strained and Dill's role is too flat.I'm not disappointed.

		<fullReview>Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck) raises his kids as he defends an innocent black man in a rural town full of racial prejudice.The audience sees To Kill a Mockingbird through the eyes of one of Atticus' children, Scout (Mary Badham). The older version of herself narrating makes us see Atticus as Scout sees him in her memories. The film is a collection of protective love and courage from Atticus, and admiration from his two kids.Gregory Peck's performance in To Kill a Mockingbird is the only one he won best actor for. Atticus is his definitive role. Peck was always an actor of great subtlety - he had a way of writing emotion on his face to make his characters so penetrating. He had such potency as an actor that he didn't even have to say a word to make a scene great. For example, in "12 O'Clock High" (1949) when Peck sustains one look on his face for about 5 minutes, you get more of a sense of the horrors of war than in most classic war movies. In To Kill a Mockingbird, there is something that sends chills down your spine when Gregory Peck does the simplest of things. When he authoritatively and calmly shouts "Scout!" to calm his daughter, there is a feeling of intense love radiating from Peck's character because of his facial expression - his straight but passionate face takes over the room, portraying Atticus' undying care. And Peck maintains an astounding level of consistency with the same passion throughout the entire film. To top off an already emotionally loaded film, Robert Duvall makes his first appearance ever as an actor as Boo Radley in To Kill a Mockingbird's Kodak moment. Radley saves Scout's brother Jem from an attacker in the woods. Radley, who was thought of as a weird, scary man, brings Jem home. Scout sees Boo standing in the corner and walks him home, finally considering one of Atticus' greatest remarks - "You never really knew a man until you stood in his shoes and walked around in them". To Kill a Mockingbird is one of the most powerful movies ever made about the human connection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story takes place during three years (1933?35) of the Great Depression in the fictional "tired old town" of Maycomb, Alabama, the seat of Maycomb County. It focuses on six-year-old Jean Louise Finch (Scout), who lives with her older brother, Jem, and their widowed father, Atticus, a middle- aged lawyer. Jem and Scout befriend a boy named Dill, who visits Maycomb to stay with his aunt each summer. The three children are terrified of, and fascinated by, their neighbor, the reclusive Arthur "Boo" Radley. The adults of Maycomb are hesitant to talk about Boo, and few of them have seen him for many years. The children feed one another's imagination with rumors about his appearance and reasons for remaining hidden, and they fantasize about how to get him out of his house. After two summers of friendship with Dill, Scout and Jem find that someone leaves them small gifts in a tree outside the Radley place. Several times the mysterious Boo makes gestures of affection to the children, but, to their disappointment, he never appears in person.Judge Taylor appoints Atticus to defend Tom Robinson, a black man who has been accused of raping a young white woman, Mayella Ewell. Although many of Maycomb's citizens disapprove, Atticus agrees to defend Tom to the best of his ability. Other children taunt Jem and Scout for Atticus's actions, calling him a "nigger-lover". Scout is tempted to stand up for her father's honor by fighting, even though he has told her not to. Atticus faces a group of men intent on lynching Tom. This danger is averted when Scout, Jem, and Dill shame the mob into dispersing by forcing them to view the situation from Atticus' and Tom's points of view.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just Watch This Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To Kill A Mockingbird has always been looked upon as an instant classic because of its very important themes dealing with race during the 1930's Alabama, a time where racism was rampant all across the United States especially in the southern states. The film itself, based on the popular and timely novel by Harper Lee, was released in 1962 which was during the civil rights movement. Some critics called this film an innocent film because of the time it was released. It was released back when people were more relaxed, but in the fifty years since then, society has gotten more uptight due to everything that has been going on. Despite a loss of innocence, this is a fantastic movie that has very important themes, even by today's standards. This is one of my all-time favorite movies.This movie can be divided into two mini-movies. One movie is a coming-of-age story told through the eyes of a six-year-old girl named Scout. Scout and her older brother, Jem play in the hot, hazy Alabama sun every day and they have adventures with their next door neighbor, whom they just met. They tell each other tales about another neighbor of theirs named Mr. Radley, whom rumor has it chained up his son, Boo every day. I believe this part of the story was told extremely well, and it returned the memories of my childhood where I used to go off on similar adventures.While the children play, their father named Atticus Finch goes to the courthouse every day, and that leads us on to what the other half of the film is about. This can also be perceived as a courtroom drama, an effective one to boot. The basic story goes that Finch is asked by the town's sheriff to defend a black man who has been accused of rape. The townspeople request Atticus, who is a white man, to stop defending the black man, Tom Robinson. But Atticus believes everyone has a right to be defended, so he decided to continue along with the case.The courtroom scene is the most powerful scene of the movie. There is no doubt about that. The speech Atticus gave talking about ideals and values to show why Tom was innocent of his accused crime is the most powerful speech you'll hear in any movie. I won't deny there were some tears running down my cheeks as I listened to those tender, powerful words. The movie made clear it was on Atticus's side. Through the evidence and the witnesses in the trial, it was clear Tom is innocent, But given this is Alabama in the 1930's, the all-white jury had other ideas. Another extremely powerful scene is after the jury gave its verdict. The black people were segregated from the white people of course, but as everyone cleared out, they all stood in silence watching Atticus. A sign of respect for what he did for their cause. It was only one man, but now it was clear that there were people out there who believed in equal rights. Not just people, but white people who believed.The first half of the movie was all about Scout and her adventures, before it transitioned to a courtroom drama. But after the courtroom drama ended, you would expect the movie to be over. Actually, we transition back to Scout who finds herself in trouble from a racist man named Ewell, whom her father gave a hard time during the trial. Ewell is actually the father of the supposed rape victim and he was doing anything to make sure Robinson was guilty. But this is the time where the mysterious Boo Radley comes into play, where he shows he is not the person the whispers across town make him out to be. This is the part of the movie where the title comes from. I really loved this story. It may be a clichéd story in today's world, but it was something fresh back in 1962. Despite all the clichés, it is all about story execution. The screenplay and the direction by Robert Mulligan are rather light, but I felt for each character. I rooted for Atticus, Scout, and even Boo the entire movie. You know a movie is great when that happens. In other words, I loved the proper people and I hated the proper people. Another thing to look at in getting to know the characters is how the actors bring them to life. In this movie, the actors brought Harper Lee's words to life and gave that life meaning. Gregory Peck won Best Actor at the Oscars for his wonderful, stirring performance as Atticus Finch. But his performance throughout the entire film was a reserved, quiet performance. A performance that resembled the real-life Gregory Peck. Mary Badham gave a terrific performance as the young tomboy, Scout. She gave the film a sense of adventure and she was very supportive of her father, despite her limited understanding of what was going on. She was an incredible part of this movie's success.Overall, To Kill A Mockingbird is a very powerful, effective movie that came out at a time where hope was in the air. Hope for the black people to finally receive equal rights. Thematically, this was a very important movie. It was one of the earliest movies to actually portray black people in a positive light from the view of white people. Looking at events occurring across the world today, the themes of this movie can still be considered important. The acting and the story received the most praise from me. But let's not forget about the wonderful black-and-white cinematography nor the beautiful piano score by Elmer Bernstein. This is a movie for all movie lovers should see.My Grade: A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece, a splendid cinematographic voyage:</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A fabulous screenplay, brilliant performances, masterful direction, beautiful cinematography and production design. "To Kill a Mockingbird" (1962) is one of a kind of an experience in the art of cinema.Atticus (Gregory Peck, Academy Award of best actor) is a lawyer of a small town in Alabama, in a Great Depression era. Judge of town assigns him to defend a black humble man, Tom Robinson (Brock Peters, fantastic) unfairly accused for the rape of a white maiden, Mayella (Collin Wilcox Paxton, a well-directed standard actress).What follows is a background for a fundamental Socratic question: Is It possible to be fair, in a unfair city? Question imposes itself in two crucial moments of the story, and it is answered by two different ways, exposing tears of racism and other awful prejudices. Peck is heart touching, empathic, dramatic but not ridiculous. In that very year, his contenders where not less than Jack Lemmon (Days of Wines and Roses), Peter O'Toole (Lawrence of Arabia), Mastroianni and Burt Lancaster, a titanic setlist that enlightens even more his (nevertheless well deserved) victory. His speech at court is mesmerizing, one of the greatest performances on screen, featuring only one cut in more than nine minutes. His sons are beautifully lived by Mary Bradham (herself a nominated), and Phillip Alford, bringing even more light to the perfect screenplay.Atticus by itself is not a aleatory name: it means "Man of Attica", region of Athens, in Ancient Greece, where Socrate flourished and took the most important step in thinking history, philosophizing about the Human Being, instead of Cosmos. Moral questions faced by the principal character are answered sometimes by himself, sometimes by others, named the scene where his daughter gives to the men of the unfair city a exquisite lesson about to be righteous. "To Kill a Mockingbird" is a unmissable movie, a proof of the wonderful transforming capacity of cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cultural masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To Kill a Mockingbird, adapting the Harper Lee novel released just two years earlier, is centered around Jean Louise "Scout" Finch, the six-year-old daughter of defense attorney Atticus Finch, who's given a case defending a black man in an Alabama town and culture favored heavily against them. The movie both follows the events leading up to and culminating in the trial predominantly from Scout's perspective, maturing from the experiences. Outside of the trial, the movie also depicts everyday life for its main characters and the culture they follow. Right from the beginning the movie starts out strong and keeps it up to the end; establishing themes of tradition, appearances, and societal pressures. The actual trial the movie revolves around doesn't start until more than halfway through the movie. Instead, we see thoughts and ideas established, including the infamous urban legend of Boo Radley, a story Scout and her brother Jem take a liking to. It's exciting and somewhat tense in the beginning as Scout has fun chasing ghost stories and following her father's lessons, but things take a turn when she realizes firsthand the effect her father taking a controversial case has.Atticus Finch is hands down one of the greatest characters in fiction and Gregory Peck fully defines him with his performance, but that's easy to say when he's a great father and his kid is telling the story. Even so, his willpower in staying principled and just against such large cultural adversity is admirable and bold. It's not hard to tell he's a dissident to the traditions of the times: just the fact of Scout calling him by only his first name "Atticus" is enough to suggest his relationship with his children is far from strict. Sure, he's never seen openly advocating desegregation, but as a lawyer he's bound to serve and defend to his best abilities all accused without bias, and that he does.But Atticus also isn't entirely in contradiction with the mood of the times either. He keeps up appearances, maintains unspoken agreements, and has a clear grasp on the particular ways the community functions. This fits with the movie's position on cultural traditions as a whole: tradition can be good, but just because something is tradition doesn't make it good. A toxic tradition like racism causes useless conflict that drives what are usually good, upstanding people away from what is morally right. A message like this with so much chance for a sloppy execution is handled subtly and deftly here.Everything on a technical level is first-rate; the black-and-white color scheme to immediately establish the bygone era the movie takes place in, the musical direction that perfectly encapsulates the tone of a scene, even the cinematography is at the top of it's game, with some fantastic shots and memorable scenes. But in all honesty, a lot of that can be forgotten in the mix when the story is this amazing and told as smoothly as it is here.To Kill a Mockingbird, a story taking place in the 1930's, was released in 1960 with a message that's timeless. It only serves right that the movie adapting it would be just as timeless and acclaimed for many generations to come. It would be unnecessary to call the message of To Kill a Mockingbird "more important than ever", when it's message will always be so important for all cultures. It's not just about a lack of hate or holding a critical mind to tradition; it's about remembering yourself, and remembering others as well. A shared empathy and respect we should all have.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To Kill a Mockingbird - 10/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adapted to the big screen from Harper Lee's groundbreaking novel To Kill A Mockingbird, Robert Mulligan's dramatic masterpiece is one that truly improves with age. The film begins and ends with narrative from the youngest daughter of the film's protagonist, Jean Louise, or more commonly referred to throughout the film as "Scout", portrayed by Mary Badham. The focus of the movie shifts, however, and is seen through the lens many of the films beloved characters. To Kill A Mockingbird was actually the film debut of both Mary Badham and Philip Alford, who played Scout and Jem Finch, respectively. Both played their role with considerable charm and amiability, slowly learning of and becoming accustomed to the bigotry of their community. Roger Ebert, my undisputed, and certainly many others, favorite film critic, uncharacteristically gave a review for the film many of his readers disagreed with. Ebert gave the film 2 1/2 stars out of his usual 4 star rating, indicative of an adequate but not a particularly great film. Roger criticized the film's tendency to marginalize the stories of some of the black characters and, at times, replace their characterization with more of a focus, if at times even superfluously, on the white characters. For example, the wife of Tom Robinson is a character who perhaps we could have gained more insight from, or any at all for that matter. She was credited with a non-speaking role, rendering her character and development a bit of an enigma when the film is finally over.I found myself unable to agree with Robert on this one, something I have never said in the past. Many agreeing with Robert's opinion on the film's characterization, or perhaps lack thereof, might also refer to the scenes following the deliberation process in the courtroom, where we learn that Tom is unjustly served a guilty verdict despite an astute, and ingenious, effort from Atticus to prove his innocence. Atticus receives a call later that night that Tom was shot down and killed after trying to run away from the cops "like a crazy man". Atticus accepts this and doesn't question its validity; at least, on screen he doesn't. Could he have so much as inferred otherwise? Definitely. In fact, while the film doesn't make it apparent, it's very possible Atticus believes the death of Tom Robinson was an act of unprovoked aggression. We are never told of this and it is ultimately up to us to decide what Atticus believes. I believe the omission of many details relating to many of the black characters was a choice by director Robert Muligan that one shan't take at face value. Under the surface, is it too contrived to think that this perceived 'neglect' to character development could be akin to how both the case, and Tom Robinson, were neglected? That, just like the portrayal of these characters, the verdict leaves us wanting more of an explanation and of details that, because of its time, will be tailored to favor the white man? Perhaps this is too far-fetched, but nonetheless an interesting idea to ponder. Gregory Peck deservedly earned his Oscar, one of many stellar performances. The kids portrayed by Badham and Alford were phenomenal as well, especially when you remember this was their debut on the big screen. Tom Robinson, played by Brock Peters, elicited hope from us as the viewers that he would be 'saved'. He gave a moving performance, one that I worry will go unappreciated in many moviegoers' eyes. Robert Duvall also made his debut in this film as Boo Radley, played to perfection. Estelle Evans as Calpurnia, James Anderson as Bob Ewell also shine. There were simply many great performances that masterfully captured the essence, and abhorrent nature, of that time. One of my favorite films from the golden age and one that will certainly resonate with many for a long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If only everyone would see and understand this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on a book of the same name by Harper Lee, To Kill a Mockingbird takes place in Alabama in the 1930s. It centers around two young protagonists, Scout (Mary Badham) and Jem (Phillip Alford), but it's really the story about their father's, Atticus Finch's (Gregory Peck), struggle to prove the innocence of a black man accused of rape and assault. And this during times when to even suggest such a thing was almost unthinkable.I admire how the story is told. It's a heavy theme to explore. To state that all people should be seen as equals, especially in the eyes of the law, which should stand above as all. To hold to your conviction, even in the face of universal spite and mockery. But to further the exploration, we view this question and dilemma through the eyes of children. And all of a sudden the issue becomes quite simple indeed. Difficult to achieve in practice, but simple in principle. And we're left wondering alongside the children, why is it so hard for everyone?There are some side stories, dealing with the children's lives and adventures around the neighbourhood, but the courtroom drama is the heart of the film and the one thing everyone knows it by. Although I do think that the final scene, which gives the film its name, is also very nice and poignant, even though it doesn't necessarily have all that much to do with the courtroom case. Thematically, certainly, but otherwise not so much.Aside from that, it's a nice film all around. The child actors are surprisingly talented and Peck is magnificent as an uncompromising and fully moral attorney father. It's also shot well, told well, scripted well and even though its pace is rather measured and even slow, you're not going to be bored during any single minute.Definitely one of the classics for a reason.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Faulkner vs Harper Lee</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don 't really understand why people prefers Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird to William Faulkner's Intruder in the Dust. A white lawyer tries to free a black man falsely accused of a capital crime. OK. But watch Clarence Brown adaptation of Faulkner's play (1949!), and you'll see a challenging and thrilling drama, with young actors at their best. The white paternalism of Atticus in "to kill a Mockingbird" is no longer acceptable. To fight racism is better to defend Lucas Beauchamp than Tom Robinson. Mockingbird seems to be censored in 1962. We have here a simply and easy morality, things are not like that, but it's better for the soul.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful, moving story of injustice, prejudice, family and growing up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Small-town Alabama, 1932. Atticus Finch (played by Gregory Peck) is a lawyer and a widower. He has two young children, Jem and Scout. Atticus Finch is currently defending Tom Robinson, a black man accused of raping a white woman. Meanwhile, Jem and Scout are intrigued by their neighbours, the Radleys, and the mysterious, seldom-seen Boo Radley in particular.Based on the Harper Lee novel, a powerful, moving story of injustice, prejudice, family and growing up. The examination of "justice" based on racial lines is particularly profound and relevant to its time. The racism that forms the background to the trial is also incredibly gut-wrenching.Just the justice/injustice/racism angle alone was enough to make this movie great. The court scenes, and Finch's closing argument, are among the most powerful ever committed to film. However, tipping the movie over into the masterpiece category are the scenes involving the children.Showing Atticus Funch's family life creates a great sense of engagement with the characters and the town in particular. The children bring a wonderful sense of innocence, boundless vitality and the wonder of discovery and growing up to the movie, and provide some great comedic moments. They also bring some great drama, especially towards the end.Gregory Peck deservedly won a Best Actor Oscar for his stirring, emotional portrayal of Atticus Finch. Incidentally, this was his first and only win, on his fifth and final nomination.Mary Badham, at 9/10 years old, did a great job of playing the hyper-energetic, tomboyish Scout and got a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination for her efforts. At the time she was the youngest ever nominee in the Best Supporting Actress category.Good support from a great cast, none of whom put a foot wrong. Robert Duvall made his feature film debut in this movie and, although he has no lines and little screen time, his performance, especially his opening shot, is very memorable and powerful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stayed true to the book!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Mulligan did a really good job of keeping true to the book of which this film is based, that was released only a short 2 years prior. Through brilliant framing, subjective pov, and long takes that often included monologues; this told and showed the story that has been a staple in America's history. It was highly culturally significant when it was penned, and it remains something that we look at today, because it dealt with more than just race, but also the stereotypes we place on people and how those are usually wrong (easily seen in Boo Radley's case). The film shows strength, cruelty, bravery in all of the everyday ways in which it as experienced, and that teaching doesn't end at with youth. That the student can just as easily learn, and then become the teacher. The best example is Atticus to his daughter Scout, who then speaks to Mr. Cunnighamn. She does so calmly and casually; she reminds him who he is when he isn't filled with hate and rage, and that her and her family are people just like him, reminding him that his son goes to school with her and of her father saying "thank you" after an act of surprise kindness he had done a while ago. She learns and grows throughout this experience, and is the vehicle through which the learning curve can be taught and seen to an audience that would have been conflicted during those times (the 1960s).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To Kill a Mockingbird is one of my favorite books, and it was amazing to see the characters come alive on the screen. Gregory Peck is absolutely perfect as Atticus Finch, the intelligent and kind father of Scout and Jem, and Robert Duvall is able to depict Boo Radley's deep pain without saying a word. One amazing thing about this film is the way that it is from the perspective of a child. Director Robert Mulligan is able to flawlessly translate this from the book, and ensures that it does not falter throughout the movie. The black-and- white cinematography is evocative of the 1930s Deep South, but To Kill a Mockingbird is not just a period piece. Unfortunately, its portrayal of racism and a corrupt legal system are still relevant today. It is an important film in terms of style and content, and one that I will definitely be seeing again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now i think this is a very good movie and a very good book. But just looking at the IMDb rating and the reviews, this movie is clearly overrated. I've read the book and have seen the movie twice. Some very good things about the movie was adapting the book. It was very well adapted and stuck very true to the book. Gregory Peck did a great job as Atticus. Also Brock Peters did a very good job as Tom Robinson. Most people perform pretty well. That's not why this film is overrated. The movie when looking at it close is pretty bland. I mean the movie itself isn't that great. The movie can be slow at points, not all the characters were good (Dill and Mayella). The ending was different then the book and i liked the book ending much better. And overall the movie just didn't have anything special to offer. To sum it up perfectly. Its a good book adaptation movie (for the most part) with nothing great to offer and nothing bad either. I like it, it just doesn't deserve the praise it gets</fullReview>

The acting is certainly spot on and every actor and actress that was cast certainly owned the character they were assigned. The cinematography had to be the best part of this film. It really focused where the action was making it easy for the viewers to see the action or keep them in suspense until later on in the movie. The lack of light in some parts of the film also helped to heighten this film's intensity. As someone who has also read the book, I am surprised at how some of the cinematic characteristics have stayed true to what was written in the book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was some bold subject matter, and it is semi-autobiographical. The movie came out two years after the book, and the fact that Civil Rights was still going on is why this was all such a big deal. What really shows the risk factor, is how such a divisive issue is shown through the eyes of Scout, and not Atticus. It's a great idea, and really gives some thought provoking insight by framing such a big issue through the eyes of a young, precocious child. This also serves as a great way to educate children on the issue. The performances all around are brilliant. The kids are great and likable (which is quite a rarity), Robert Duvall makes a stunning film debut, Brock Peters is agonizingly sympathetic and compelling as Robinson, and then we get the man who really shines above all: Gregory Peck. This was a much deserved Oscar winning and career defining performance for him, and it really is one of the greats. He's wonderful through the whole thing, and he comes off as the kind of dad a person would love to have as their own. What seals the deal though is his lengthy courtroom monologue. I get all kinds of shaken and emotionally stirred up every time I watch that scene. It's some of the most powerful, riveting, and memorable acting ever put on film.</fullReview>

His performance is the best of the film. Also the story is very good but if we consider that this is based in a book and in a real history, the film was not necessary. In my opinion the film fails with the bad guy, Bob Ewell. The actor makes an excellent job but the character is too spiteful, he won the judgment and spits Atticus, so why he want kill the childs? I don't understand! Despite this, the film is good, the children's make an great and moving work, and Tom Robinson will always be for all innocent. Much to learn from this film...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wonderful film version of the classic Harper Lee, correct in practically every detail. The decision to film in black and white, the recreation of Depression Era Alabama, the individual casting, sure-footed direction and above all, the acting itself, in particular by Gregory Peck and the two young child actors (neither of whom, surprisingly, seemed to stay long in films thereafter) playing his children, all come together in this deservedly much-loved film.The film takes some time to come to the main plot strand, being the trial of the young black man Tom Robinson, but in so doing takes us firmly into the children's world from whose viewpoint the events will be mainly shown and of course subtly introducing the Boo character whose presence will have more resonance later on.Although the film is measured in its progress, taking as long to get going as Peck's Atticus Finch takes to finish a sentence, nary a shot is wasted, although as a dog-owner myself I could have done without the scene where he shoots dead the rabid dog menacing the neighbourhood, but many others stay in the memory, like when Atticus (with Scout's unwitting assistance) defends Robinson against a lynch-mob, Robinson's emotionally-charged testimony in court, the "victim's" redneck father spitting in Atticus's face and of course the climactic scene when the children's saviour is revealed at the end.Peck deservedly won the Oscar for his commanding performance as the imperturbable Atticus and as I said earlier I don't think I've ever seen better child-acting by the three here. A subtly evocative and provocative movie showing Holloywood film-making at its best, one can't help but think it may have had some impact on public opinion in the then Civil Rights debate in early 60's America.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that showcases the brilliance of Gregory Peck's acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To Kill a Mockingbird is the acclaimed adaption of Harper Lee's novel, which until this year was the only novel the author had written. It quickly became a standard text, taught routinely in schools. Set in 1930's Depression era Alabama, it focuses on a principled lawyer called Atticus Finch, who takes on a case to represent a black man accused of raping a white woman; in the subsequent trial Finch raises serious doubts about the legitimacy of the accusation. The story is told through the eyes of his young daughter Scout.The story is an autobiographical one to some extent, with Scout being a fictional version of the young Lee. It must've been a particularly pertinent film in the 1960's in the middle of the Civil Rights movement, when there were other films addressing the issue of racial discrimination in different ways, such as Guess Who's Coming to Dinner? (1967). Unlike that one, this one is a little more intense, as it is set thirty years in the past in the deep south, at a time where lynchings were not uncommon. The courtroom drama part of the story actually only occupies a quite small portion of the film, with much of the runtime devoted to character development showing small details of life, both before the pivotal trial and later after the fallout. For me though, it was the court scenes that were the real highlight, with some stellar drama and acting. Of the latter much credit has to go to Gregory Peck, who brings to life Atticus Finch with extreme skill and measured understatement. He was definitely one of the top actors of his day and this film really shows why. The child actors were also very convincing also, which is hardly a given. It was also the film debut of the great Robert Duvall who appears late on in the picture as the mysterious Boo Radley.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Important Movie in American History</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To Kill a Mockingbird, based on the novel by Harper Lee, is a movie that is iconic, on the order of the Wizard of Oz and Star Wars. Unlike these other movies, the subject of this movie is the deadly serious topic of racial injustice. The movie and the book highlight the perverse nature of this injustice be letting it be seen through the eyes of children, the main characters. Their ordeal of witnessing the (most likely) unjust prosecution of a black man for rape represents a fall from innocence for the kids and a stark commentary on the sick nature of American racist society.To Kill a Mockingbird is a great film. It accurately depicts human nature both at its most virtuous and most ugly. Gregory Peck plays Atticus Finch, an amazing character that lets us believe that we as human beings are capable of great compassion and love. Peck understates it but plays it with great passion, and the effect is extraordinary. On the flip side, James Anderson plays brilliantly Bob Ewall, a drunken bigot of the type we know that most likely beat up his own daughter and blamed it on Tom Robinson, the luckless defendant. The child actors, Mary Badham and Phillip Alford, playing Scout and Jem, are terrific and take us along for their trip out of innocence.In my view, the most important thing about this movie is that it stands beautifully on the cusp of a key battle of ideas in the 60s-- the question of whether racism in any form is justifiable. The film is iconic because it provides a strong answer--NO.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Incredible Masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To Kill A Mockingbird is a film that could very well be two films. It's a drama about growing up and coming of age during an era of civil rights unrest. But that civil rights unrest also is the subject of the second "film," a courtroom drama featuring a black man wrongfully convicted of a crime. This is a fantastic movie and one of the best movies to come out of the 1960's. But the racial themes underlying this film is still relevant today, and perhaps people should pay more attention to Gregory Peck's speech at the end of the movie regarding racism. There have never been more truer words spoken on film. I loved every aspect of the film from the very tense drama to the excellent black-and-white cinematography to the satisfying ending to the excellent score by Elmer Bernstein.Robert Mulligan's film takes us to a Depression-era town where a poor lawyer named Atticus Finch lives with his two children, Jem and Scout. Finch is assigned to a case where this black man is convicted for the rape of a young woman. The town gets riled up about the case, and Atticus and his two kids may find themselves in danger.It's funny because a film based off a beloved novel would gain more of a well-known cast. But the only star here is Gregory Peck and he does a wonderful job as Atticus Finch. I think that speech he delivers in the end gave him that Oscar. Mary Badham does a wonderful job as the young Scout, and I am disheartened that she stopped her acting career soon after this film's release, because she gave such a magnificent performance. Also, this film is Robert Duvall's first screen role and with limited screen time, his character as Boo Radley is another memorable character this movie offers.Overall, To Kill A Mockingbird is one of the best films of the 1960's or even in the history of cinema. Not only is it an effective drama, it has racial themes that occurred during the height of the Civil Rights Movement. This is one of the films that actually put sympathy towards the movement during this time period. One of my favorite scenes involves Atticus standing guard against a mob in which Scout comes to his rescue. That was a very moving scene and one of the many memorable scenes in the film. A fantastic movie that is part of our history and one for every generation to see.My Grade: A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In general I like movies from the 1950s and early 1960s, especially in B &amp; W. Maybe I'm lazy, but they usually have a simple moral which is easy to understand and not hard to empathise with. This was no exception, even though it had periods when it was overly melodramatic and others when it was uninteresting - possibly, the book's written words held attention but didn't translate well to the screen.The big thing that let the movie down was the background music by Elmer Bernstein. Did I say BACKGROUND? At times, you could hardly hear the dialogue and the music's mood didn't match the action, added to which, it was tuneless to the point of being awful. It's difficult to believe that it was by the same composer as The Magnificent Seven, just a couple of years earlier, which is a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of Course, the Villain of the Piece is the Drunken, Child Beater, Ignorant, and Awful Human Being and He is a Mad Dog and had to be Put Down. The Hero is the Inspirational, Heroic, and Almost Perfect Atticus Finch. Gregory Peck's Oscar Winning Performance is Generally Considered One of the Most Admirable Fictional Characters of All Time. He is Called to Defend a Black Man in the Deep South Accused of Raping a White Teenager.This Film is an Early Sixties Take on the Racial Divide and Desegregation Concerns Gaining Headlines Across the Nation. George Wallace, the Governor of Alabama, Infamously Said Loudly and Proudly..."Segregation now, segregation Tomorrow, segregation forever."The Best Selling, and Only Book, from Harper Lee Certainly Made its Mark Culturally and the Film Did the Same. Consistently on Top Ten Lists and Has Been a Favorite Film Forever. It is Done with a Warmth and Subtle Power that Comes from the Innocence of Children and the Aspirations of Good People Everywhere.The Message is Clear, Unfettered, and Undeniably Liberal but Fair. It is Faction for the Masses with its Appeal to the "Better Angels". The Whole Cast and Production are Magnificent and Unpretentious. The Now Ultra-Familiarity with its Concerns and the Constant Exposure Today of the Still Racial Divide, Can't Diminish the Power of This Picture and it Can Be Seen as a Time Capsule of Not Only the Setting (1932 Alabama) and Production (1962) but Timeless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderfully adapted classic to the big screen. Atticus personifies the true American hero</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Miss Jean Louise, stand up. Your father's passing."To Kill a Mockingbird is one of those rare classic films that actually manages to hold up to its source material. Harper Lee's novel is so touching and powerful that it would've been a shame if the film didn't do it justice, but after 50 years I can honestly say that it holds up as a true classic. The story is told through the point of view of a young innocent girl who sees her attorney father as a hero and that is what makes this story so easy to engage with. It's a film that focuses on social injustice and it is told through an innocent child's perspective which gives it a fresh spin. The courtroom scene is powerful and moving, but everything that leads up to it is also very fascinating. Watching the children play and gossip about their mysterious neighbor is sort of a parable for the social injustice that the story tackles on later in the film. It's as if Lee were trying to show us how primitive and childish society had become during that time of racial segregation. The film is wonderfully directed by Robert Mulligan and perfectly adapted by Horton Foote. After I return from my vacations I will try to write a more thoughtful and insightful review, but for now I wanted to point out some of my initial thoughts about this inspiring movie. I can finally understand why this is Clark Kent's favorite movie because Aticcus FInch is simply the personification of that superhero. Gregory Peck gives a masterful performance, but he did have a great character to work with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well-adapted story about Morality.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'To Kill A Mockingbird' is a well-adapted story about morality. I like how half the movie establishes the different characters, and the remaining half deals with the case and town's attitude. The movie maintains proper pace and doesn't seem to be in a rush, and that really works for it. The acting by everyone involved is quite commendable; in this film, we see the dashing young Robert Duvall for the first time. I really like how it shows how a parent's attitude towards certain things really shapes a child. Our attitude towards things are always shaped by the people around us.AFI named Peck's character as the number one hero of all-time; their choice was really interesting seeing the age of heroes (different kind) we live in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent story of the prejudices of the past</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To Kill a Mockingbird is an excellent story of a girl named Jean Louise, or Scout, Finch in a small town in Alabama called Maycomb. Scout grows up here together with her older brother named Jem under the vast wisdom of her father Atticus Finch. Atticus Finch is one of the town's most respected lawyers. In her adventures with her brother and other various friends, Scout learns the sometimes grim realities of the world she lives in. When the trial of Tom Robinson comes about, a black man accused of the rape of a white woman, the viewer learns the harsh realities of the time through Scout's childish ignorance. She cannot comprehend why it is that the townspeople hate her father for defending this man, or why they are bent on convicting a man who clearly has not committed the aforementioned crime, yet it becomes painfully obvious to the viewer just how racist the town of Maycomb is as the plot builds. To Kill a Mockingbird teaches us how one can rise against the injustices of the time in order to make justice prevail. This classic film will serve as a reminder of the past and as a representation of what true heroism looks like.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fairly engaging, just a rather old movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To Kill A Mockingbird was fairly engaging considering it was a movie that was shot in the 1960s. Although I will say that it does start off rather slow but right around when Tom Robinson's court case starts the movie starts to pick up and become a more interesting movie. Another good thing about this movie is that other than skipping a few parts it was a lot like the book that was written and the book was very well done as well. I think the only weakness of this movie is that it was shot in the 1960s so being so old the acting isn't always as great and it was in black and white which can also be less appealing to some people, mainly teenagers that haven't been exposed to black and white movies and might not like them as much. All in all, it was a pretty solid movie, Gregory Peck did a very good job acting as Atticus Finch, although the rest of the acting wasn't that great but that wasn't all that relevant because Atticus was really the main guy to watch in the movie. I'd say give it a watch unless you aren't interested in black and white or old movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Touching story that will bring you back to the troubles of the time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To Kill a Mockingbird is a story that encompasses the racial issues of its time. Although it is a serious and, "grown up" topic, the movie is easy to follow and relate to for all ages. Atticus Finch is a well-to-do lawyer, who goes against social norms by representing a black man, (Tom Robinson) who is falsely accused of rape. There is dramatic irony in the sense that the audience is aware that Tom is innocent, but people in Alabama don't want to believe it. This is a gut-wrenching factor, as you can feel nothing but sympathy for the mistreatment this innocent man faces. I find the most moving part of this film to be the morals that Atticus works to implement on his children Scout &amp; Jem. Although they are growing up in a highly segregated era, they are open-minded and kind to all who are kind to them, regardless of the stereotypes surrounding them. The movie does an excellent job reflecting the time period, through the use of derogatory language and clear separation of the races. For example, in the courthouse, blacks mustn't sit on the first floor. Instead, they are to watch from the balcony. Moreover, the most obvious example of separation is the fact that Tom Robinsons guilt is hardly questioned. And although the defense does an excellent job exposing the true culprit, Tom's ethnicity is enough to label him a rapist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film depiction of the novel "To Kill a Mockingbird" is an inspiring story of the heroism and courage of those in support of the civil rights movement in the south. Much of the story focuses on the point of view of children observing the civil rights movement and the call for justice and equality for all races and the naivety that a child would have. The film was released in 1962, a time of intense racial segregation and prejudice in the United States. The movie could be seen as an eye opening experience for the viewer on the hardships faced by the African-American community and in all likelihood contributed to the achievement of racial equality. All in all, the film is an uplifting tale of the morality of the human spirit and the fight against the wrong doings committed by the United States south in the early decades of the 20th century.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To Kill A Mockingbird is a popular novel required to read by nearly all students in public schools in my area. I can merely remember in ninth grade when this book first caught my attention. This was the first time my teachers had addressed the issue of discrimination and we were able to, as a class, openly discuss about it. I was excited to see that this intriguing tale came to life in a movie! To Kill A Mockingbird is set in Alabama in the 1930's. The film was released in 1962 however, and it is interesting enough that this was also a time of major movement for civil rights in America. In the movie, Atticus Finch is a young attorney with two young children, Jem and Scout, and he chooses to defend a black man who was being accused of raping a white woman. Although this sounds like a horror story, this was actually a major issue during this time. Whites were falsely accusing black men of things they were completely innocent for primarily because of the increasing use of discrimination. Discrimination was becoming increasingly more common during the 1950's and 60's because of many new reforms against segregation. Blacks were gradually rising up against the white for equality, Although it was working, whites (especially in the south) were so angry with these changes that they would do anything to put a black man away for good even if the man was completely innocent. This was a crazy time period in our American history and To Kill A Mockingbird greatly reflects on those issues. To Kill A Mockingbird is hands-down a must-see film! It is such an incredible story that every American should hear and understand... To me, it really grasps the idea of how times used to be and also goes to show how things have changed. It fascinates me how much progress we have made in America concerning equality among blacks and whites. I would recommend this film to everyone!!!</fullReview>

I remembered simply adoring this novel, and this movie was no disappointment either. It brought me back to all the beauty and magic that this book revealed to me the very first time I read it. The characters are as unique as they are relatable and the message of the novel is as poignant as ever. It gave a beautiful book new life on the screen, in a accurate and relevant way (which is hardly ever done in Hollywood now-a-days.)

		<shortDescription>Proper representation of the fight for civil rights</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To Kill A Mockingbird is a movie that effectively shows the evils of racism in the nineteen thirties in the south. Gregory Peck plays the calm and collected lawyer, Atticus, who valiantly defends a black man in racist Maycomb Alabama. He does a wonderful job of portraying the Atticus Finch as he struggles to prove the man's innocence. He plays the character as Harper Lee describes him in the book, which is a great factor for me. I love that the book and the movie are very closely associated. I was very impressed with Mary Badham's performance as Scout. She properly displays Scout's innocence and that is a huge theme in the book. Scout's discovery of the racism within her town shows the malicious behaviors of the white people and the mistreatment of the black community. This movie properly represents the mistreatment of the black community and that is another factor that is appealing to me. It shows the cruelty of the whites and creates empathy within the viewer. I highly recommend this film for any person interested in civil rights. This movie and book shows the start of the fight for equal rights for African Americans in the United States. Go see it! It's great!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Effortlessly Poignant Social Commentary!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To Kill A Mockingbird is a hauntingly nostalgic portrayal of childhood mischief set in a racially divided Alabama town in the 1930s. If the film's tone seems overly righteous, it's offset by a poetic lyricism that is difficult to resist embracing.At the outset, it plops us down serenely in the comfort of a grubby Southern town at the time of the Great Depression, before 'desegregation' was even a word. Gregory Peck plays incorruptible lawyer Atticus Finch, a widower with two loving, if rambunctious children - 10-year-old Jem (Phillip Alford) and a thoroughly beguiling 6-year-old tomboy Scout (Mary Badham). We are immediately squeezed inside the skin of Scout and Jem as they go racing and tumbling around the neighborhood, shrieking with childish defiance at crusty old Mrs. Dubose, skirting with awe around the creaky wooden house where the mysterious Boo Radley (Robert Duvall) lives, who according to neighborhood legend, is crazy and chained to his bed by his father. While the kids play, Atticus has been chosen to defend a young black man accused of rape. As the trial looms and the townsfolk attempt to enact street justice against the accused, Atticus' pursuit of justice remains unwavering. As the trial ensues, Atticus, Jem, and especially Scout learn as much about each other as they do about their own fears and prejudices.Its success is in part due to its source material - Harper Lee's best-selling novel tells a fierce story. However, Lee's child's-eye view of southern bigotry gains something in its translation to the screen by Robert Mulligan, who knows exactly how to capture a child's subjective experience. Mulligan achieves a bewitching indication of the excitement and thrill of being a child. There is so much feeling for children in the film, so much delightful observation of their spirit, energy and charm as depicted by two superb discoveries, Badham and Alford. Mulligan even wrings a remarkable performance from Gregory Peck. As Atticus, his performance is the bedrock of this classic film, one of those rare instances when a character perfectly captures the essence of its source material without compromising it in any way. It's a simple, controlled performance of passion and restraint which turns out to be curiously effective.To Kill A Mockingbird is effortlessly engaging as a social commentary, while the sobering subtext gives the film a heart and soul that most filmmakers would kill to replicate. This is storytelling at its very best!</fullReview>

I find the film is an accurate expression of the book, with nothing left out and nothing added in. The atmosphere is tense at times, but as the stories main characters are children, the tension is rightly relaxed, as we see the world through their eyes. The book was banned in southern states, but it and the film do not portray the southerners in a bad light. I like that there are no political overtones or finger-pointing as some modern films are apt to do, it simply reflects the culture of 30s America and lets you form your own opinion.</fullReview>

The book is one of the most critically acclaimed works of literature ever and it was brought to the screen with great success. Atticus is one of my favorite characters of all time. He's a hero who strives to serve justice to an unrepresented minority. And the scenes where he talks to his kids about different things are great too.

		<fullReview>An outstanding movie with Gregory Peck, To Kill a Mockingbird is based on the Harper Lee novel set during the Depression of the 1930's. While it has a strong civil rights message that is the core of the film, it is also a great family story. This comes out early in the film as Jem and Scout, Peck's two children, meet up with Dill, the boy staying next door for the summer. It is a small town where children play and explore the neighbourhood. We see a mad dog that Atticus shoots to spare his family from any attack and a house that the neighbours avoid out of fear of what lies within it. Mary Badham and Philip Alford are Scout and Jem, the two children of Atticus Finch. Atticus is a single father and a lawyer whose wife died several years earlier. Atticus spends time with his children and answers their questions in an honest and loving way. When a judge comes by to ask him to take on a case of alleged assault by a black man, Atticus knows he will be taking on a huge burden in a town where blacks are up against bigotry and ignorance. Yet, he agrees right off. No discussion with a judge...just a simple yes to the judge's question. It is clear that the accused black man is innocent but justice for blacks does not come easily with the climate in this town. During the trial, all the black people look down from the balcony above in the segregated courtroom, symbolic of their distance from laws that govern them. At the end of the trial, they all stand in unison when Atticus leaves. Atticus is a great role model for his community, a lawyer and parent who raises his children and fights for justice in his own town. There is a lesson in how to be a good neighbour toward the end that puts an end to a neighbourhood fallacy. This is one very moving and inspiring film and a great achievement for director Robert Mulligan (Up the Down Staircase, Love with a Proper Stranger).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched To Kill a Mockingbird again for the first time in at least 20 years. I was stunned and very emotionally moved. This movie is a masterpiece. This move elicits an emotional reaction and attachment that is hard to explain. The music perfectly embodies the mood - from innocence and carefree to brooding and climatic. It is one of the greatest scores I've ever heard. Gregory Peck is stunning but Mary Badham as Scout is the true star to me. She had no prior acting experience and should have won the best supporting actor Oscar in 1962. At times her acting seems so real, almost like she's not acting. Her facial expressions alone show her natural talent - sublime. Robert Duvall ( in his first role ) is a silent force as the misunderstood, gentle giant Boo Radley. The plot of racial injustice and false accusations in the Great Depression-era deep south is tough topic to broach. America's constant struggle with the ghost of slavery and the indignation suffered by African Americans intertwined with the plot of the accused, Tom. The cinematography is sharp and beautifully rendered. This is such an important movie that it should be required viewing by all Americans - at an early age. See this movie! A 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Atticus Finch will be there all night, and he would still be there when Jem waked up in the morning. To kill a Mockingbird is a masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember reading the source material for the movie, the Putizer Reward book of the same name by Harper Ferry when in middle school. The film removes a few sub-plots, but still, very faithful to the book. It's still long with a few boring moments, but whenever, the character of Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck) got on screen, it was a joy to watch. This is Peck's best role. A lot of people might remember, this film for the court-room drama, as Atticus Finch find himself defending a black man, Tom Robinson (Brock Peters) accused of rape, but the movie directed by Robert Mulligan and written by Horton Foote; is also a coming to age story, teaching tolerance and decry prejudice. Without spoiling too much, the story covers three years of the 1930s, showing Jean Louise "Scout" Finch (Mary Badham) and her brother Jem (Phillip Alford), undergo big changes in their young lives. I like how Atticus Finch help them on the way, being a good father figure. As a Southern Gothic and a Bildungsroman, the primary themes of 'To Kill a Mockingbird' involve racial injustice and the destruction of innocence. You also see the movie dig deep into the issues of class, just/unjust laws, and Southern morals. A lot of woman believe it, touch on women's rights. I can see it. The patriarchal South does have a history that kinda made white men the dominant group, and women and blacks deemed in more subordinate roles. A lot of LGBT supporters believe that the book is gay or lesbian "coming-of-age" tale. Indeed, the movie dealt with gender roles in the American Deep South. Scout does acts more like a tom boy and show more a masculine side that feminine. She does not respond positively to anything girly, but it's really hard to prove that she is a closed lesbian or not due to the age. Scout hasn't reach adolescence yet. If Scout was based on Harper Lee's childhood, we still wouldn't know because Lee was an extremely private person and there is little information on her even in major biography databases. It's hard to prove, if Harper Lee is gay or not. Others people have look at this theory, by using Dill as an example, because Dill was supposed based on Harper Lee's childhood friend, the openly gay Truman Capote. While, there is no clear evidence supporting this, other than the fact that Capote was a childhood friend of Harper Lee. I really don't really know. After all, Lee, in turn, is the model for the Idabel character in Capote's first novel, 'Other Voices, Other Rooms,' which seem more like a heterosexual heroine. While, Dill and Scout seem to have a somewhat romantic relationship during childhood, who knows where their sexuality lies. A lot could change if a sequel to the book was ever written, which Harper Lee most likely, will not do. She hasn't wrote a book in years. This issue also brings the rumors of authorship. Some people believe it was written by Truman Capote; while others believe Harper Lee wrote Capote's best novel, In Cold Blood. Who knows? One thing for sure, is the plot is based on the unsuccessful legal defense by Harper Lee's attorney father, during the 1931 landmark Scottsboro Boys interracial rape case. The movie has a lot of heart &amp; humor, despite dealing with dark themes. The film is widely considered to be one of the greatest films ever made. The film won three Academy Awards, including Best Actor for Peck. In 1995, To Kill a Mockingbird was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant'. Still, some people might hate this film. After all, it has a scene where Atticus shoots a mad dog. Some people see that scene, as he basically is a hypocrite, because he just killed a mockingbird; because Tim Johnson wasn't doing anything it was literally standing there. It wasn't charging at him or the kids. I can see where they are coming from, but the dog was suffering. I know PETA wouldn't like that, but it had a lot of symbolism with the dog scene. Perhaps, it's just one of examples of Atticus doing tough things he doesn't want to do. Is rabies supposed to represented racism? Atticus does refer to racism as "Maycomb's usual disease." In addition, while Atticus does not protect the children against racism, he does shoot down racism. Is the dog shooting, an allegory? Is it saying black people are dogs? Is the film saying it's alright to kill black people if they're suffering? Who knows? Maybe, I'm oversimplification it. Perhaps it's just the feeling Scout has. The sick horror at what's happening in front of her and how over complex, violent can be. Was this scene, needed? Maybe- not. Despite its good themes, To Kill a Mockingbird has been subject to campaigns for removal from public classrooms, often challenged for its use of racial epithets. The film does stereotyped blacks as superstitious, poor, and poorly education blacks who to some critics believe were "contented slaves". Some criticized the movie for focusing less on the blacks, and more on the story how honest, white man save them for racism. Surprising, there is some truth to that in the film, but the white savior narrative in film since this movie had indeed, went a little overboard. I didn't mind it, too much in this film. In recent years this idealization of Atticus Finch has been challenged. He is accused of having an élitist and paternalistic attitude towards his client and women, while some have asked how this "father-knows-best" could have so casually overlooked the Depression South's appalling record of racism, sexism and class exploitation. Still, there is no greater good guy than Atticus Finch in my opinion. Atticus Finch served as a moral hero for many readers and as a model of integrity for lawyers. Overall: It's a must watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A MUST see Classic!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simply put, To Kill a Mockingbird is one of the best racial and discriminatory based movies in the industry. I'm amazed how the movie forced me to empathize with black people who were being discriminated against. There were multiple times during the movie that I felt a deep sorrow and anguish towards an individual. One of my favorite scenes, and arguably the most compelling scene of the movie took place when Atticus Finch was exiting the courtroom. When court was adjourned, out of respect, all the black people remained in the courtroom and stood up as Atticus Finch exited the courtroom. The appreciation and gratitude that was demonstrated by the black people towards a white man that fought for them was stunning and packed full of emotions.To Kill a Mockingbird was produced in 1960 by Alan J. Pakula. The director, Robert Mulligan, faced an overwhelming task of transforming the famous novel into a film. The film's success was due in large part of the spectacular job that Pakula and Mulligan did with developing the roles played by the characters. There were three children that played major roles in this film; Jem was played by Philip Alford, Mary Badham as Scout, and John Megna played the role of Dill. I learned that all three of these youngsters had minimal experience in the acting business. I would have never known this to be true; the director did an amazing job of filming the scenes with the children. It was as if the director allowed them to be natural opposed to acting from a script.One of the main characters was Atticus Finch, played by Gregory Peck. Atticus is an attorney in the film, and represents the black man accused of raping a girl. In the film Atticus is a man of integrity and is highly respected in every aspect of his life. He is highly regarded as a professional, father figure, and is well respected in the community. Another main character is played by Brock Peters; he plays the role of Tom Robinson, a black man who is falsely accused of raping a white girl. Tom faces the death penalty if he is found guilty of rape. Even if he isn't found guilty, I felt that he was going to be killed either way. This message hit home with me, I could relate to the power and hopelessness that prejudice can have on someone.When Atticus Finch makes the decision to lawfully represent a minority in Tom Robinson, I knew immediately the type of person Atticus was. A white man representing a black man in the deep south of Alabama during the 1930's was unheard of. It took someone with courage, dignity, and compassion to stand up and do the right thing; Atticus Finch was the perfect man for the job.There was not a better man that could have represented a minority during this time period. The courtroom proceedings will have you sitting on the edge of your seat. Atticus Finch does not disappoint as he uses a strategy to unveil Tom Robinson's innocence. The children make a surprise, yet sneaky court appearance to watch Atticus represent a minority. The children sit in the balcony with all of the black folks; this was a marvelous way that the director uses to demonstrate the children's innocence towards racism. The director's main idea in doing this is to demonstrate that racism is a learned idea and attitude that is developed based on ones' surroundings.The way the movie is filmed allows an individual to feel as if they are in the movie themselves. The acting presented in the film is very natural, and is aided by the simple film angles that are used. From the humanized characters, to the simplistic film angles, the director does a great job in making To Kill a Mockingbird a personable film. This personal down home feel allows viewers to indulge themselves into the movie. This indulgence makes it near impossible for the viewer not to relate and sympathize with the black community. The one scene that demonstrates this best for me was the scene when the white man spits in Atticus' face for representing Tom Robinson. I was so indulged in the film, I literally felt that the white man spat in my face. I felt the disgust and the hurt that Atticus must have been feeling. Faced with a tremendous amount of disrespect, Atticus was true to his character, and was the better man in turning and walking away. Even though Atticus was a white man he could now directly relate to how the black community felt.I cannot recommend To Kill a Mockingbird enough. While children in their innocence may not be able to sympathize with the movie, this is a great movie for young adults and adults alike. The film represents humanity and equality at its' greatest. The character of Atticus Finch alone is an adequate reason to watch this film. If you want to learn about true character, dignity, humbleness, and respect, just watch the character of Atticus Finch and be prepared to be blown away. I have a feeling that this film will be a classic for many years to come, and will remind Americans of their past time and how far society has come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To Kill a Mockingbird is about the changes happening in America during the 1930's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>such a good film and shows a lot of problems and issues that were happening in the time era. As the film goes on it gets a lot more interesting and shows the effect of the great depression that was happening in America in the 1930s, which many people don't really know about. Atticus Finch is a very 'different' character as he believes in equality for his children as he believes Scout should be aloud to wear trousers and play with her brother. Atticus also makes the decision to defend a black man in court, when during that era was unusual, however Atticus believed that people should be equal and was against the way black people were treated which is why he defended Tom Robinson in court.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A 1960s Look At The 1930s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck), a lawyer in the Depression-era South, defends a black man against an undeserved rape charge, and his kids against prejudice.What seems odd about this film is how it was made in the 1960s, looking at the 1930s. What would the same film have been like if it was made in the 1930s? Would the tone be different if not made during the civil rights movement? And, in some small way, did this film help push that movement forward? Now, this is not to say it is a bad film. It is a very good, and very timeless film. Bigotry is not dead, not by a long shot. And the belief that everyone deserves a strong defense should never go away, whether they are guilty or innocent, black or white, rich or poor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie opens mildly, looking like a children's adventure movie. Then little by little the more serious theme of racial prejudice seeps in and gain more focus until the touching transition scene with Atticus and the country folk after Tom. The scene really was great both emotionally and technically. It transitions smoothly from the children adventure subject to the serious rape charge clouded in racial prejudice subject. Emotionally, the scene may have stirred something in people's minds about what they were doing wrong; the racial segregation issue. Gregory Peck acted quite flat on the expressions, but his dialog and body language parts are quite good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A compelling drama and a best written work for celluloid as far courtroom drama goes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A compelling drama and a best written work for celluloid as far courtroom drama goes.Written as a novel and adapted as a screenplay, made as a film, the century's most widely known novel is one of the finest pieces of writing. Now, you have half job done, the best work is written, but Robert Mulligan as a director has to handle a tougher task, he has to bring a well written and much known work with life and living characters onto the screen. Man, he does this job with flying colors. Firstly, the acting be it a Tom Robinson or a Mayella or a lesser known Cunningham, all have done exceptionally well. Above all stands, Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch, a disciplined father and a lovable one indeed. He brings life to a character of rare dignity that is realistic yet ideal. Told through the eyes of a small girl Jean Finch, this story is one good one to hear or see. It has many moments that give us a lump in the throat. The climax is a befitting one and is symbolism of "Natures judgement". The courtroom acting of Tom Robinson and Finch and Mayella is enough to say that even for a brief 20 minutes of courtroom scene, this movie is still considered as one of the best courtroom dramas. That was the power and passion involved in the making.Acting and writing both are sublime and all else just falls in place, be it art direction or background score, they would have been good anyways, with the acting that we see it is obvious why it is hailed as a textbook for classic acting and same is the case with writing too.I loved it and am hopeful any one who see it will. Neighbors bring food with death and flowers with sickness and little things in between. Boo was our neighbor. He gave us two soap dolls, a broken watch and chain,a knife and our lives. That dialogue summarizes most of the movie. But the very point that is being said is humanism, we alienate humans with our own prejudices, be it a beggar or a toilet cleaner even guards at offices are not treated as humans as we feel as if we are above them, there is only color and it colorless, there is only one caste and religion that is humanity. It's a 5/5 without any doubt and please request all to see it. Have patience though, we have to endure it. Watch it for acting and writing above everything else.</fullReview>

The story is about doing what is right even though it will cost you and your family. The children are affected by the actions of Atticus (the Dad) a lawyer in a small town - where the line between right and wrong is not so clear. The courtroom scenes are well filmed and acted. Even reading the book in Grade 9 English did not seem like a chore. Just great story with a great plot. A medium to make you think of what you would do and how prejudice is rampant in our not so perfect world.

		<shortDescription>A timeless tale of childhood, innocence and the loss of both</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"To Kill a Mockingbird" takes place in Maycomb, Alabama, during the 1930's. Through the eyes of "Scout" Finch we meet her brother Jem and their father Atticus, and behold the effects of the Great Depression on the residents.What seemed to be a quiet summer is suddenly shaken by the arrest of Tom Robinson, a black man accused of raping a white young girl. Atticus accepts being Robinson's defense attorney, a choice that the ordinary people of Maycomb do not understand nor approve. At one point, Scout asks his father why he accepted the case, since it can only cause problems to him. Atticus replies it is the only way for him to walk with his chin high.During the trial, Atticus' interrogation skills bring some contradictions to light, thus arising the doubt about Robinson's guilt, which almost everyone thought initially undeniable. With his final speech, he manages to shake the conscience of his townsfolk, giving Robinson a small but unexpected chance.Every member of the Finch represents a stage of life: Atticus is the adult, the father who tries to rise his children while hoping they will inherit a world better than the one he has to live in; Scout personifies all the innocence inherent to a 4-year-old child; and Jem is almost a teenager who is just beginning to realize how the world really works.The story is based on Harper Lee's novel of the same title, which the film follows very closely, and makes us return to childhood, that time when the world seemed infinitely simpler than it is in fact, wishing that Atticus Finch (a sublime Gregory Peck in an Oscar-winning performance) was our father.</fullReview>

The plot brings us interesting feeling with character's dramatic interaction. Unguilty person has to die. Guilty person doesn't have to die. It is unreasonable but reasonable in that setting. Maybe Lawyer Atticus'effort gains no result but the largest thing he has received is people's respect. "Scout, stand up. Your dad is passing" is an humanity and emotional image. The ending part with the sentence "let's the dead buries the dead" has the same meaning with "we reap as we sow" in Eastern proverb.There is no reason to kill a mocking bird, particularly when it brings no harm but happy birdsong for our life.</fullReview>

The importance and the the details of how grave the case of a lawyer actually backing up black man is lost in translation across the medium.Well, all of that can be forgiven and the film still somehow works along.

		<fullReview>TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is a classic adaption of a classic novel. I remember reading and watching this at school but most of the civil rights-era background when right over my head. Not really worth exploring a movie dealing with mature themes as a kid, but there you go. Watching it again as an adult, it's a delight and as hard-hitting as MISSISSIPPI BURNING, which came much later.I've always liked Gregory Peck and his laconic Atticus Finch is an exploration of a quiet, inherently decent man. It's a subtle performance of amazing strength, with no showy-off 'acting' scenes or the like; Peck's Oscar win was well deserved.I particularly liked the way the narrative develops through the eyes of a pair of innocent children as it adds another layer to the story. The whole sub-plot involving Boo Radley is a classic bit of mischief and I love the way the two plots tie up neatly at the end. The child actors are exceptionally strong and despite the lengthy running time the movie doesn't have any slow spots; it's all relevant and adds to the experience.As I said, this is a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To grow up is to overcome prejudice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To Kill a Mockingbird is a story about the idea that to grow up is to overcome prejudice. It tries to prove this idea with three plots, one of each type:An external plot seeking justice for a wrongly convicted Tom Robinson A relationship plot between the children and Boo Radley An internal development plot of the children's maturation The external plot is the main driver of the story: a black man has been falsely accused of rape by a white woman. Worse, he is wrongly convicted by a jury of white men after having the audacity to declare that he was helping the woman out of pity. This plot results in a failure as Tom is convicted and killed while trying to escape. The plot has a reversal at the end in which the true criminal (and perpetrator of prejudice) is himself killed and his killing is accepted by the law as eye-for-an-eye for Tom.The external plot unfolds in the formative years of the children and has a distinct impact on their relationship with an ostracized neighbor. They begin by fearing, judging and harassing Boo Radley, only to find that Boo has been helping them from the shadows. The plot ends when the children welcome Boo as a friend.The internal plot of the maturation of the children makes steady progress. They demonstrate an innate acceptance of others (in sharp contrast with the societal mores) and end up overcoming their own fear of Boo by accepting him as a friend (when even society has not accepted him).To Kill a Mockingbird is a wonderful story with a great idea: that growing up means overcoming prejudice. It seems to suggest that children have innate goodness and acceptance but can be molded by grownups and society to become blinded or become mature members of society. This contrasts with the idea that prejudice in any shape or form is childish and dangerous trait in adults and society as a whole. The story makes this point by tying together the three plots at the end: Boo kills the man who embodied prejudice to bring late justice for Tom Robinson, Boo does this to save the children, and the children accept him as a friend even though society still shuns him.It's a great movie.My only beef is the children's internal arc does not have many negative turning points. Their fighting (seemingly negative) is based on justifiable defending of their father's reputation, their jeering at Boo seems playful and child-like rather than childish and their talking Mr Cunningham out of the lynch mob and taking Boo's hand at the end feels a little caricatured and cringe-inducing. Maybe that's just my own feeling. Overall the point of the story is well taken and appreciated.My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca.</fullReview>

This movie is about Atticus Finch and only him. most other characters are introduced just to show how heavenly the man is.Of course the movie is very joyful and should be commended. Gregory Peck puts on a performance that we never see this days. Their is absolutely nothing that signals his an actor and not Atticus Finch. the photography is breath taking and i am thankful that the movie was shot in black and white and not in color because i think i would have barfed if it was in color.But is is the things that the movie is insinuating that i just don't get. Who is the mockingbird? Is it the black man? Is it Boo? Early in the movie we are told that mockingbird are the only kinds of birds that shouldn't be shot because all they do is good things for us. Are we supposed to believe that the black man or Boo shouldn't be shot because they are creatures like mockingbirds that shouldn't be harmed simply because they know less and do everything for the benefit of others???I have decided to watch the movie another time again but for now all i feel is a 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed reading dweck (An Unforgettable Drama, 9 December 1998) and sylviastel@aol.com (Please Don't Remake This Film!, 23 February 2008)."To Kill a Mockingbird" is an acting showcase, where everyone who appears is very good. Three actors I have enjoyed from "Star Trek" and "Twilight Zone" and who fit into the landscape here are Paul Fix, Frank Overton and William Windom. Phillip Alford as Jem and John Megna as Dill are good children actors. James Anderson and Collin Wilcox Paxton as the Ewell father and daughter are both filled with spite. Brock Peters is convincing as the accused rapist. Robert Duvall makes a memorable appearance as Boo Radley very late in the show.The two acting standouts are Gregory Peck as Atticus and Mary Badham as Scout. Peck immerses himself so thoroughly as Atticus that it is difficult imagining anyone else appearing here. Atticus is cinema's limit as the dignified and moral lawyer struggling to prevent mob rule from holding sway.Mary Badham should have won the supporting Oscar she was nominated for. She has great depth and range for a child actor. (It is a pity her career was so limited.) The credit sequence is pretty interesting. Elmer Bertstein's music, with jazzy piano, is also well done.The trial scenes are effective despite how easy it should be to defend a man accused of being a left-handed rapist who can't use his left arm at all.The only weakness that 'Mockingbird' has is the direction. There isn't a single image from director Robert Mulligan that is uniquely memorable. He's competent but not elite. His Oscar nomination is difficult to understand.'Mockingbird' is an important film for people to see today. Before Guantanamo Bay eviscerated it, America used to be a Constitutional Republic. In the 1960s there were many cultural references on behalf of the US legal system. While America continues to advance the use of illegal, extra-Constitutional star chambers (e.g., Guantanamo Bay), 'Mockingbird' shows us that it was once considered shocking for justice to be so clearly denied.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To Kill A Mockingbird</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To Kill a Mockingbird, a screenplay written by Horton Foote, known for his other works based off of novels, such as Of Mice And Men, highlighted the major events from Harper Lee's original story, of the childhood, and coming of age, of Jem and Scout Finch, along with Dill Harris. Many aspects of the novel were portrayed in a "screen friendly" way, to show more of the action, and to display the main motives of each character. For example, the Radley house was accompanied by the use of sound effects to personify the character of Boo and Arthur Radley. The film was well-written, and well directed. The director, Robert Mulligan, chose wisely the actors of the film, Mary Badham, who played Scout, showed the personality of the young Finch very well, and Phillip Alford, who played Jem Finch, brought out the age difference between the Finch children. The film begins, showing the quiet town of Maycomb, which was an obvious choice by Mulligan, to show that Maycomb was like any other town at the time of the movie. The movie was set around the 1930's, and involved the Finches fighting for the freedom of Tom Robinson, a Negro accused of raping young Mayella Ewell. This trial was the main conflict in the film, between the Ewells and the majority of Maycomb, and the Finches. This conflict shaped the movie, and novel as a whole.The director chose many themes throughout the film, one of them, being what appears to be, and what is. This was shown throughout the movie, especially in the presence of Boo Radley. What Scout and Jem thought, and what Atticus, played by Gregory Peck, knew was entirely different. This sparked much of the conflict in the movie. Mulligan also chose to show the true personalities of people at the time, which may seem more vulgar to the people of today's society. There were also some hidden symbols found throughout the film. The introduction of the movie highlights many of the symbols. For example, the marbles during the opening credits show the conflict between white and black. These themes played a pivotal role in the film. The plot of the story is simple, yet real at the same time. The racial conflict was a daily problem in the society of the 1930's. The plot was easy to follow and showed how the theme of appearance vs. reality tied in to the story. The actors set for the roles of each character played their parts perfectly. However, due to time and money constraints, there were a few key characters left out of the script (Ms. Rachel). The movie cinematography was impeccable, the director employed many camera techniques to show different actions. This caused an enhancement to the movie, in a way you would not expect for the time it was made. There was also a great use in lighting and sound, which drove many of the actions in the story, especially Jem's run-in with a mysterious shadow. The musical score created tension which would otherwise be unable to be felt in the film. Overall, To Kill a Mockingbird highlights Harper Lee's timeless novel in a thoughtful way. Robert Mulligan directed the film beautifully, incorporating all needed aspects of the film. This gives the viewer a second look into the film, and shows some of the true meanings behind each character. The film is a must-see, and brings To Kill a Mockingbird to life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful movie based on a wonderful book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To Kill a Mockingbird is a wonderful story written by Harper Lee that deals with some very important issues of that time in a beautiful way. To add to that, it is a story that serves as a model for rectitude and moral righteousness. Gregory Peck's delivery of the case summary, pleading not guilty to the jury, was just the icing on the overall brilliant performance throughout the film. While it started off as a feel-good movie where the children seemed cushioned away from any vile forces that existed, it was far from being like that throughout. The acting by the children is genuine and true to their parts, with all the three child actors pleasing the eye at all times. The movie deals with the issues of slavery, dealing with ethical conundrums, tolerance and acting as role models for our young ones. The courtroom scene was so well played that there is not a single moment when the viewer is not glued to the screen, ever so eager to know more about the case and judge for themselves the verdict of the case. The scuffle at the end and the suspense that ensued was riveting. And finally, the character of Boo Radley, that was constructed over the course of the movie through the interaction of the children with Atticus and the neighbors, and their own forays into exploring the dark and the unknown, cumulates into one with one final act committed by him: a selfless act, a courageous act, a virtuous act, yet an act of a Mockingbird. The message that goes across is that selfless and virtuous acts are always respected by everyone and if we stay true to the moral education imparted to us by our elders, we can all make a difference and make this world a better place to live in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Up in Canada, To Kill A Mockingbird was our novel studied in the eighth grade. I don't remember too much about Grade 8 now, and even less about the book, except that it was dreadfully boring for a 13-year old: I was too preoccupied by Lord of the Flies. Not even the movie could gather my interest.I'm a bit older now and a lot more educated, so it was time to really take in this treasured film. And wow, what a difference a few years makes. This film, extraordinarily faithful to the source, grabs the atmosphere and setting of the film and spells it out on screen. TKAM is a wonderful story of adult issues through a child's eyes, under the watchful eye of moral hero Atticus Finch.In just over two hours the effects of the Depression in the South is seen, as well as the lingering racism and prejudice of the Civil War, the vivid imagination of children and the effect a strong parent can have on children. The themes have very positive stances: this is no Grapes of Wrath. The film is family-friendly except for several contextual uses of the N- word.Though it is a positive film, it is not an easy viewing. Like any great example of any medium, To Kill A Mockingbird is dense and not extremely easy to follow, due in part to its age and content- there's virtually no "action" and the one true scene of physical conflict is weak compared to the rest of the film. Another way to say it is that if you have a meeting with a film buff and you want to appear smart but haven't seen many classic films, don't start with this one. I remember seeing the AFI's Heroes and Villains list and being a little put off by Atticus' place... but I can't now. He's a model parent and an inspiration to all- he has integrity and a calm persona, never letting his temper flare. Peck's voice is so assuring, and he just looks like an upstanding citizen who knows that kids are kids and that it's more important to go with what you believe is right than what others would try to make you do.Seeing To Kill A Mockingbird is to read the book- a slow but expansive look at a slice of time through young eyes. It's a shame this came out in the same year as Lawrence of Arabia- one year either way and it may have received the awards to place it physically in the halls of time, if not our hearts. 9.3/10</fullReview>

To Kill A Mockingbird is epic when it comes to the story just like the book. If you have mindset of the 21st century then you might not like this and won;t enjoy this. But let me remind you why it is epic: the story, the peculiar case, the elements of life that are depicted is mind-blowing and even in today, we fail to shadow such unwanted situations, all blame to the lifestyle.WATCH OUT FOR: Gregory Peck!Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

		<fullReview>This screen adaptation of Harper Lee's outstanding novel ought to have won the Best Picture Award of 1962, though it didn't. Gregory Peck was his pleasant, calm self, but he was a man of courage nonetheless. He was definitely brave: to defend a Negro in the 1930's South, especially in Georgia, did definitely require a plethora of courage. Brock Peters showed prowess as the black falsely accused of a heinous crime. I liked seeing Paul Fix as the local judge. As for the small part of Robert Duvall, who would have ever thought that nine years later he would be portraying a very capable and shrewd Mafia lawyer? As for the setting and the life style of a small southern town, I could identify myself with that: I was raised in a small town in central Kentucky, about five thousand in population at the time (the 1950's) where everybody knew their neighbors well. How could the point of the story not stick well to the viewers' minds? And with all the negativeness of the Great Depression, the small town lifestyle was, in its own strange way, appealing. A very drawing movie.</fullReview>

Indeed, its simplicity does not bode well for film critics.Cute kiddies are always a good bonus as well. A story told through their eyes becomes more powerful as it contrasts the aggression of the adults with the innocence of the children and the impact of the unjust prosecution of the "negro" on the lives of the children at school and home.Overall, very enjoyable film, though a bit simple at times. Has an epic speech in the end as well. That surely added a point to my vote.I will have to include it as one of my top 100 favorite films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think too much can be made of the civil rights issues in this film. They are brilliantly rendered, as so in the book. They point to an attitude our parents held that was abhorrent. As a significant plot feature, its give the book an all too apparent thesis. Too much can be made of Boo... too.Reading the book and seeing the film, nothing that happens is significant except in as much as it is something that Scout addresses AND the brilliance of the book and the movie is the structure allows us to witness her witness it all, both as a child and as a nostalgic adult concurrently.It is impossible to not love Scout. Her embodiment in Mary Badham is extraordinary. It is fun to view some of the documentaries about the film. Mary was every bit the tough tomboy that Scout was. The jewel of the film is witnessing Atticus turn her, and Jem, into loving and moral adults.. by himself and according to his own convictions. When Scout curls up in her daddy lap.... a daddy like me feels all of that love of and for a child once again. One scene.. the one about the watch is just lovely.I won't discuss the movie making other than to say it so speaks of the era in every detail and of a time that, apart from the wretched treatment of our black brothers, must have been a great time to live.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time i watched this movie when i was in the final year of school, i considered it totally boring. The second time i watched it(an year later), i didn't understand why it was voted the Greatest Courtroom Drama ahead of 12 Angry Men. So i decided to read the book by Harper Lee before watching the movie next time. It is one of the finest piece of Literature i've read and the movie is equally good.The movie is narrated by Scout, played by Mary Badham. Scout is the younger child of Atticus Finch, played by Gregory Peck. The movie focuses on the childhood days of Jem and Scout and what kind of a man their father was. The movie is set in the backdrop of a depression-hit Alabama of the 1930s where black people were subject to prejudice, ill-treatment and the laws of the state that were biased. A major part of the movie is about the kids Jem and Scout, until Atticus Finch dares to take up the case of a 'colored' man wrongly convicted of raping a white-woman. Atticus Finch is a father who is unmatched when it comes to taking care of his motherless children. He holds no discrimination against the 'colored' race and forces(after pampering sessions end) his daughter to apologize to their domestic servant; he also invites a 'colored' boy to dine with them and advices his daughter not to ridicule the way in which the kid ate. When Atticus Finch actually tries to prove the convicted man innocent, he gets threatened by the complainant's father and is despised by the people of the town. The man spits on Atticus' face. Normally you'd expect a six-foot plus tall man with a broad frame to strike the other man down but Atticus takes his handkerchief and wipes off the spittle. Such an inspiring character he is and AFI rightly called him the Greatest Hero of all-time. He, despite knowing the fact that the 'colored' man wasn't convicted and had firm evidence to substantiate his argument, he loses the case thanks to the prejudiced laws of the state. When he is despised by the people of the town, an oddball who has been deserted by everyone comes to the rescue of Scout when a drunkard attacks her.The first half of the movie is enjoyed not only by kids but by everyone who has been a kid and reminisce the sweet memories of being innocent, playful, stubborn, and the umpteen petty fights one had had. The second half of the movie, i call it from the time of Atticus taking up the case, is better appreciated by someone who is grownup.</fullReview>

The film lead, Atticus Finch is listed on AFI"s list as the #1 Hero, which I agree with fully. This film brought emotion to me that many films can't reach. I was genuinely upset when it was announced Tom Robinson was shot. This film was really, really good. Gregory Peck play's Atticus Finch to perfection. And the film also hold some of the strongest child performance's I have seen, along with a strong narration from Kim Stanley. There is also a beautiful message in this film, and it touches down on the issue of racism. I am a fan of Courtroom Drama films and To Kill a Mocking Bird is the best one there is.

		<fullReview>Enough good things can't be said about this movie. It is undoubtedly one of the best and most moving films ever made. No other racial injustice or discriminatory based movie can even compare with "To Kill a Mockingbird". This movie not only makes you sympathize with those who were being discriminated against, but also those who fought for those people. One of the most moving parts of the movie is when Atticus Finch is leaving the court room and Reverend Sykes tells Scout to "stand up your father is passing".Gregory Peck has always been one of my favorite actors. This is definitely one of my favorite roles that he has ever played, and he does an excellent job at it. Mary Badham and Philip Alford are excellent as Jem and Scout. Mary Badham became the youngest girl to receive an Academy Award nomination for best supporting actress for her role as Scout. Although it had a short time on screen, Robert Duvall's portrayal of "Boo" Radley was one of his very first roles on screen and what better movie than "To Kill a Mockingbird" to kick off your acting career.A great movie of all times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Depression-era Film On Race,Prejudice And Justice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To Kill a Mockingbird is a drama film adaptation of Harper Lee's novel of the same name directed by Robert Mulligan. It stars Mary Badham in the role of Scout and Gregory Peck in the role of Atticus Finch and marks the film debuts of Robert Duvall, William Windom, and Alice Ghostley.Set a small Alabama town in the 1930s, the story focuses on scrupulously honest, highly respected lawyer Atticus Finch, magnificently embodied by Gregory Peck. Finch puts his career on the line when he agrees to represent Tom Robinson, a black man accused of rape. The trial and the events surrounding it are seen through the eyes of Finch's six-year-old daughter Scout. While Robinson's trial gives the film its momentum, there are plenty of anecdotal occurrences before and after the court date: Scout's ever-strengthening bond with older brother Jem, her friendship with precocious young Dill Harris (a character based on Lee's childhood chum Truman Capote and played by John Megna), her father's no- nonsense reactions to such life-and-death crises as a rampaging mad dog, and especially Scout's reactions to, and relationship with, Boo Radley, the reclusive "village idiot" who turns out to be her salvation when she is attacked by a venomous bigot. To Kill a Mockingbird is a time capsule, preserving hopes and sentiments from a kinder, gentler, more naive America.But I consider that a minor shortcomings in a rewarding film.Since its release, this intelligent, atmospheric film has been warmly received by audiences responding not only to their own childhood, but also to the heroic image portrayed by Peck, a shining example of citizenship and affectionate fatherhood.Furthermore,Gregory Peck delivers an Oscar-winning performance as a righteous lawyer in one of the best American films of the 1960s, a Depression-era chronicle of race, prejudice, and justice-- and coming of age.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many cinemas offer repeat performances of great films of the past in remastered digital form. What a joy for those of us who missed these gems first time around for all kinds of reasons. These digital presentations are of high quality. This film inspired by the novel of the same name awakened in its day sensibilities of the outrageous racism still prevalent in 1962 America even though the story is set in 1932 Alabama. Remember the Civil rights Act was passed in to law only in 1964. This film has lost nothing of its relevance today and doesn't give in to blatant innocence so common in American cinema of the era, largely influenced by the Disney studios. This film is in no way complacent and very watchable by today's standards. But what makes it most remarkable is the children's portrayals. The story is largely told from their point of view, especially that of scout, the wonderful and mischievous little girl, son natural and endearing. She was even nominated for an Oscar which would have made her the youngest winner at 10 years old at the time. We can see where Steven Spielberg got his inspirations for films such as ET, Super8, etc? A great film to see or to see again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No wonder, Atticus Finch is chosen as the number one movie of all time. He deserves it. Gregory Peck with his unassuming, responsible performance really makes us wonder the potential of these actors. Scout is the upper- threshold of cuteness. Her cute presence makes the movie even more enjoyable. Especially her words to Mr. Cunningham make you jump out of your seat get on the screen and pamper Scout. The hallmark of this movie is, even though its extremely adored by all class, say children and adults, the script is strict and concentrates on accomplishing what started in the title card. The court proceedings, the fear and stealthy games of children makes this movie one of the best ever. The values which the movie stress upon are phenomenal. These classics remind us as to how much we miss those simple story telling and have gone into wild abstract ways in the name of sophistication. Appalling!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece about childhood, racism, prejudice, integrity and love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"To Kill a Mockingbird" is one of the few examples where novel and movie for one really have something to say and where both versions are outstanding achievements in their own right. Harper Lee's bestseller won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, and the movie - made with Lee's full support and produced with the same love for the material - received eight well deserved nominations for the Academy Award. The film won three, including Best Actor for Gregory Peck, a portrayal tailored so convincingly after Harper Lee's real life father that a lifelong friendship between actor and writer developed. Even Peck's granddaughter would bear the name "Harper", to appreciate the mutual appreciation. Family is also on the forefront of the film: Peck really epitomizes the role of the Southern lawyer Atticus Finch who is set to defend a black man accused of raping a while girl, convinced of his innocence. Finch has two children he needs to teach values of humanity, and these are based on compassion, courage and fighting for the right cause - against all odds. Actor and character shared these principles, and it shows.What makes book and movie so special is that everything is seen through the eyes of the children rather than from a more objective perspective. That way the storytelling provides an unusual and fresh angle when we find ourselves stumbling into events more or less by accident and learn what's really at stake as the youngsters go along. Yet while Atticus' fight against prejudices may seem to be doomed, hope never dies - and it is a given that the viewer will walk away deeply moved by this picture. "To Kill a Mockingbird" is a masterpiece about childhood, racism, prejudice, integrity and love, and it excels in dealing with all of the mentioned categories. Whether in form of the novel or the film, "To Kill a Mockingbird" should be integral part of anyone's education.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To Kill a Mockingbird is a classic film. I'm sure most of you know the story. Atticus, an attorney, is appointed to defending an African- American being accused of raping a white woman. I read the book when I was in 8th grade and was not a huge fan of it. Then again, I wasn't a huge fan of any book I read in school, which is one of the reasons why I detest the schooling systems. But before I go into any more of a rant, I shall share my thoughts on the film.For me, the strongest aspect of the film was the acting. Gregory Peck played the difficult role of Atticus, but did a great job with it. I think that Atticus is one of the most well liked characters in film history. Robert Duvall was spot on with his short, but important role of Boo Radley. And finally, Mary Badham and Phillip Alford gave two wonderful child acting performances as Scout and Jem.One thing I did not expect from this film was that a relatively small amount of time was spent in the courtroom. I think this was a smart move by the filmmakers, as it avoided any slow parts. Instead, it produces one of the best and most dramatic scenes in the entire film that is quick and to the point.The only weakness I found in the film was emotion. This may have been because I already knew the story, but either way, I felt that there was little to cheer or feel bad about.Overall, a great story and great acting makes this film a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very sad, but for 50+ years this film has always remained on top</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To Kill A Mockingbird, considered to be one of the all time greatest movies that everyone just adores. The reason this film stands out to me is because it was the first time we read the book in high school but never watched the movie afterwards, don't know why. But anyhow I watched it today and I cannot believe my teacher didn't show us this great film. What truly steals the picture is Gregory Peck's performance as Atticus. He so deeply got into that role and gave it such passion which you couldn't argue his Oscar award for it. Dealing with the harsh reality of racism, the cruelty and seeing it through the eyes of an innocent child was just heart breaking. As a child we see things so black and white(no pun intended) and don't want to see the bad in certain things. We look at a human being past the age, sex, race or religion and as we grow older certain prejudices take place as the world can be cruel or raised with certain premonitions. To Kill A Mockingbird takes a look at the time where a black person was considered not to be human and reminds us that sometimes there is still good in those who stand against such ignorance.Scout Finch and her brother Jem, live in Alabama, during the 1930s. They begin as innocent children, who spend their days happily playing games with each other and spying on Arthur "Boo" Radley, the town bogeyman. Through their father, Atticus' work as a lawyer, they begin to learn of the racism and evil prevalent in their town, and mature painfully as they are exposed to it. The kids follow Atticus to watch a rape trial, in which an innocent black man, Tom Robinson, is wrongfully found guilty, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary and even after Atticus' earnest pleas to the jury for them to cast aside their prejudices against Blacks and instead to focus on the evidence of Tom's obvious innocence. The town turns against Atticus and his family claiming that they are "N" Lovers and torture the children only to be surprised at who is on their side.This film made me cry, not easy to do on the first watch, but there is a moment in the court room after Tom Robinson's unfair verdict and the blacks are sitting in the balcony above. As Atticus sadly packs his things leaving the court room, everyone leaves but the black folks above and they stand for him out of respect and love. It proves there are no small parts, only small actors and that scene was absolutely incredible. Also the moment where Atticus has to tell his wife that Tom Robinson is dead and she just falls in Atticus' arms almost killed me. Then to have this racist bigot come up to Atticus when you think he might have a shred of dignity to give Atticus some credit on a well fought trial, he instead spits in Atticus' face. Poor Atticus and Tom Robinson were never given the proper chance because of the color of his skin which still exists today in America sadly, we're just not as "out loud" about it which could be worse on some level.My only complaint about the film is that the beginning is a little slow paced for my tastes, I understand that they are trying to show the children's lives and what they like to do, but it didn't hold my interest too well. Then the scene where they see a rabid dog, Atticus comes and shoots it, why? What was the purpose of that scene? I might have missed it somewhere but I hate to see animals killed or injured and that scene was a bit much for me. Maybe it shows though that when he hears of Tom Robinson's death and the way he was killed, he has a little bit of guilt in the way he was so quick to shoot the dog like it was nothing. That's the only thing I could come up with at least. Otherwise, I think this film is still important today, even for 50+ years it holds true. Wonderfully acted and a terrific story, this film is as great as I expected it to be.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well made but arguably hurt by a lack of focus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"To Kill a Mockingbird", like the source novel of the same name, is considered to be a timeless classic. Set in the southern U.S. during the Great Depression, it centres on morally upright lawyer Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck), whose defence of a black man raises the ire of those who would prefer to take the law into their own hands.Horton Foote's adaptation of Harper Lee's novel may have won an Oscar but, to me, it wasn't all that impressive. Presenting most of the events from the point of view of the children was skillfully accomplished but it also made the courtroom scenes seem out of the place as a result. Also, the conclusion of the main story arc (ie. the court case) ought to have signalled the end of the film. Instead, the movie continues on listlessly for some time in order to connect the two plot threads in a not altogether convincing fashion. The ending represents one of a few plot points that seemed pretty contrived to me.One of the film's other Oscars went to Gregory Peck for his leading performance. I didn't think it was that spectacular, though, at least in comparison to a handful of other memorable performances of his. I certainly don't think it was the equal of Peter O'Toole's performance in "Lawrence of Arabia", though I wouldn't begrudge Peck his only Oscar. Besides Peck, young Mary Badham also received an Oscar nomination in support. Both she &amp; Philip Alford did quite well alongside their more experienced adult cast-mates.As for the direction, Robert Mulligan received an Oscar nomination for his efforts, which I would say was warranted. The film also featured a memorable title sequence designed by Stephen Frankfurt along with Oscar-winning black-and-white cinematography. The Oscar-nominated Elmer Bernstein score is also quite good, though not as iconic as his scores for "The Magnificent Seven" &amp; "The Great Escape".All in all, "To Kill a Mockingbird" is worth watching though I felt that the story left something to be desired. As far as that goes, it may be that I'm being overly hard on the film due to its classic status. While my (lack of) appreciation for that part of the film is subjective, it's hard to argue with the craft behind the visuals, music &amp; acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the most worthy book to movie adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gregory Peck portrays Atticus Finch in the movie adaptation of To Kill a Mockingbird. A role in which he won an Oscar for. Highly deserving because his role in this film is not only packed full of responsibility and loyalty, but he portrays one of the most iconic book characters of all time. To Kill a Mockingbird is considered a literature classic. It was written by Harper Lee, and published in 1960 with this film to follow two years later.The book is almost an essential read to high schools across America. Much like Atlas Shrugged being a popular read in College. It is a well developed, honest coming of age book about three youths growing up in the racially divided town of Maycomb, Alabama. It captures the time where blacks were equal, but not treated like it. They were still left out and treated unfairly. This is depicted well in the court scene of the movie. But unfortunately it isn't depicted as deeply as the book.The film leaves out a lot of emotion from the crowd and jury in the court scene. Atticus is defending Tom Robinson after being accused of raping a young woman named Mayella Ewell. Her father is the despicably nasty Robert Ewell who is not only extremely racist, but an abusive drunk who thinks he is doing the town a favor by wrongfully convicting a black man but really just causing more notoriety to a town not deserving.The emotion in the courtroom was empty. It should've at least focused on more people rather than Jem, Scout, and Dill. As you can see, I'm not making an effort to state the plot because I feel people reading this have read or seen the film. If not, a short quick character analysis will do no harm.Aside from that, the film is delightful and colorful even in it's black and white state. It still has a charm that newer books lack. Reading the book for the first time in my Freshman English class felt very fitting because not only did I want to read the book, I felt I needed to read the book. I contemplated a book review, but I felt a film review was more up my ally.Some kids despise the book for it's small print, thick stature, slow start, and text marking, but you're doing it for a good reason. It is not an easy read. It can be complex and left for the reader to imply some events. But it also gives you the freedom to be more involved with a novel. Harper Lee doesn't tell you what happens, she wants you to figure out what happens.In the early stages of the book and the movie the children's fascination stems from a creepy old house down the road. The house belongs to Arthur "Boo" Radley. Nicknamed because of his unknown personality and rare appearances, the children make up stories and try to assume what goes on in that shack. He is almost shunned out like he is a black man in a town of whites.It's not until soon after Atticus discovers the kid's fascination with the house that he utters a very meaningful and memorable quote; "You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view - until you climb into his skin and walk around in it." That quote, along with many others, makes To Kill a Mockingbird a wonderful book, a thorough movie adaptation, and a great story.Starring: Gregory Peck, Mary Badham, Phillip Alford, and Robert Duvall. Directed by: Robert Mulligan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A breath of thoughtful air..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first watched 'To Kill a Mockingbird' when I was about ten. At that time my big hero was John Wayne who would normally be the good guy that would gun down the baddies. Yes, there were the offerings of right and wrong in these films and were, as ever, compounded by violence, which was,as it is now, an attraction TKAB has it's hero in the guise of Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck), a lawyer in a racially divided Alabama town. To me, at my tender age, this character became a different hero who portrayed strength and conviction without violence or aggression. I was continually drawn in by Peck's wonderful performance as the Lawyer Finch. The guidance, patience and moralising he offers to his young motherless children, Jem and Scout. His display of unwavering duty in the face of adversity whilst preparing to defend a young black man who is accused of rape. Also,Finch offers great restrain in situations that would have given John Wayne the right hump. All in all, I was able to take on board the goodness of this character, not in a 'Goody-Goody' sense, but seeing another way of being tough and strong. There are good performances from Phillip Alford and Mary Badham who play Jem and Scout. They are central to the whole story and their characters offer a blend of honesty, naivety and adventure not to mention a strong sense of curiosity, particularly concerning the goings on involving their father who they continuously refer to as Atticus. I saw the film for a third time just recently, and loved it just as much as when I first saw it. I would also recommend the book by Harper Lee on which the film is based.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a wonderful, wonderful film.And terribly brave for 1962. Ms Badham was the best tomboy ever. Peck would have got my vote, if I had one, for President. However, by the law of unintended consequences, To Kill a Mockingbird has persuaded generations of idealistic young persons to go into a legal system which is not interested in searching for the truth, and which requires them to deploy the techniques of sophistry, i.e. the art of lying.By the time they realize that, it is too late: they have to pay off the mortgage, and calculate how many bottles of Krug they can fit into the boot of their Maserati.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An absolute ten! Based on a 1962 Pulitzer winning novel by Harper Lee and an Oscar-winning script by Horton Foote. Gregory Peck's Oscar winning performance, his best part ever; embedded in memory since I first saw it in the 1960s. Brock Peters gave a very good performance as Tom, and Robert Duvall started his career in this film as a very interesting character. Mary Badham as Scout was absolutely magnificent, Phillip Alford as Jem was very good, and Estelle Evans as Calpurnia made a strong impact. The story itself is so piercing and heartbreaking, in that it combines a severe social problem of the American deeply rooted racism, as well as depicting an exemplary father figure and tenderly describing the people and events that affect a child's education. The fact that the story unfolds in a small town, helps to put the emphasis on the fact that every human being contains an amazing universe of its own. Definitely a must see for any film aficionado.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enjoyable film but some interesting scenes omitted from the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To Kill a Mockingbird is a very enjoyable movie with great acting though if you have read the book before seeing it you will probably, like me, be disappointed that some of the scenes in the book are changed or omitted.For that reason I would recommend seeing the movie before reading the book, if possible. It is filmed in black and white, which is perfect for giving a sense of the time the film is set in.The story is about two young children in small town 1930's Alabama, learning about life mainly from their widowed father. Their widowed father, Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck), is the hero of the film. He is a quietly spoken lawyer but is determined to set a good example by how he deals with people. The plot comes to a head when he is appointed to defend an innocent black man from an accusation of rape from a local white girl. The racial prejudices that were always just beneath the surface in the town come to the fore. The trial scene takes up a good portion of the film. This makes sense, as it is a perfect cinematic set piece and has some great acting from Peck and the supporting cast.A great bonus on the DVD I purchased is an excellent 90 minute documentary titled "Fearful Symmetry". Made in 1999 it has interviews with Gregory Peck, the director Robert Mulligan, writer Horton Foote and producer Alan J. Pakula. There also interviews with other cast members such as Robert Duvall, who played the crucial character of Boo Radley, Brock Peters, Collin Wilcox Paxton and the now grown up child actors. There are some great insights and anecdotes about the filming. This film is also a documentary about Monroeville, the hometown of the author Harper Lee. In the book she used Monroeville as a basis for the town of Maycomb and there are interviews with residents who lived in the town in the period the film was set in. These have plenty of examples of the famous laid back Southern way of life we hear so much about. There also interviews that discuss the significance of the book and the film in highlighting the racial discrimination of the time. At times the narration becomes quite wordy but overall the documentary is well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still a classic 20 years after I first watched it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To Kill a Mockingbird is a film based on a novel by Harper Lee. Atticus Finch played by Gregory Peck, is an attorney in Alabama in the 1930, hired to defend a black man, Tom Robins, who is accused of assaulting and raping a young white women. Along the way, widowed Atticus' children Scout (Mary Badham) a six year old tomboy and Jem (Phillip Alford) her ten year old brother and their summer friend Dill (John Megna) learn valuable life lessons which become the theme of the film. Lessons of innocence, injustice and prejudice, of maturity and growing up, and of friendship and acceptance. In the film, the children are innocent young individuals, Tom Robins is a falsely accused man, and Boo Radley is also not what he is accused of being. The children witness the prejudices against Tom Robins when he is unjustly accused of raping a white woman. They also see their father courageously trying to defend an innocent man despite the opinions of those who believe he is guilty just because he is black. The children also learn to accept and befriend the mysterious shut-in Boo Radley that saved their lives. The children thought he was a monster and were fearful of him only to find that what they thought of him was very wrong. Throughout the film, unknown to them, Boo looks out for the children. He leaves them gifts, and helps them. When Scout and Boo finally meet, he seems as afraid of her as the children have always been of him. The sound effects and music in the film definitely add to the mood and atmosphere. The music was fairly simple but contributed to the feel of innocence and energy when the children were on screen. The music didn't get overpowering during the suspenseful scenes, more mischievous than scary. When Boo finally appears in the movie, he is hiding behind a door, his face fully in the shadows. The lighting accentuates the mystery behind the stranger. Scout eventually takes his hand and brings him into the light without hesitation or fear of the man that was so misunderstood. By the end of the film, the children certainly aren't as innocent as they started out. The lessons that they learned were life changing and profound. The saw what prejudice and injustice can do to a man and a community. They also learned to accept something that was so misunderstood, mysterious and feared for so long and gained a friend in the process.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To Kill a Mockingbird (1962)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of good things can be said about this movie. I have never watched any other racial injustice or prejudiced based movie that compares to "To Kill a Mockingbird". This movie not only influences you sympathize with those who were being discriminated against, but also the ones who stood up for those people. When Atticus Finch is leaving the court room and Reverend Sykes tells Scout to "stand up your father is passing" was one of the most remembered parts of the movie.Gregory Peck was a great actor who played Atticus a lawyer who is widowed, Mary Badham and Philip Alford are excellent as Jem and Scout. Mary Badham became the youngest girl to receive an Academy Award nomination for best supporting actress for her role as Scout. "Boo" Radley was one of Robert Duvall's first roles on screen and "To Kill a Mockingbird was a great movie to start his acting career.The movie starts out by scout age 6 who now a grown woman thinking back and telling a story from her childhood. Jem short for Jeremy is her brother. Calpurnia is their housekeeper that helps with the children. The children meet Dill Harris who is visiting his aunt for the summer. Scout, Jem, and Dill have some great adventures. It seems children used their imagination more than they do today.Gregory Peck who plays the part of Atticus Finch is portrayed a Gentleman Lawyer whose wife has passed away and he is left to raise his son and a daughter. Tom Robinson, a black man is wrongly accused of raping a poor white woman. He becomes a victim of a white women's attempt to hide her guilt. She had been asking favors of Tom Robinson and even tried to seduce him. When he rejected her she targeted him knowing his innocence but also living in an unsocial society towards Negros. Realizing that the narrow minded society they live in will turn against him, Finch decides to defend him. The townspeople did try to cause harm to him but Scout recognized the man who was paying her father with pecans for some service he couldn't afford. Without thinking with the angry mob standing around she asked him to tell his son hello because they went to school together. The innocents of the child changed the attitude of the men and they decided to leave. The movie is based around the innocence and purity of his children and their relationship with their father.Due to society Tom Roberts never had a chance of being found innocent. The community had already made their minds up only because Tom was a negro. If it had been a white man with the lack of evidence he would have had a better chance of being found innocent.Boo Radley was the climax of the whole story. After a couple of years the children wanting to see him and even accepting the gifts from the tree, Boo comes to their rescue. When Scout realized who saved her brother she knew he was a good man and instantly became friends. The sheriff knew what society would do if Boo had to go to trial so he chose to say Bob Yule fell on his own knife.It is unusual that a movie is very simple in expression but teaches significant life lessons. This movie reflects the innocence of a child. A young woman thinks back to her childhood days which were a time where mostly immature, curious minds dealt with the racial bigotry, hatreds, prejudice and adversities of society. In today's society a lot of prejudice still exists but it seems as if people of a different race get a fair trial just as any white person would. Look at OJ Simpson he was found innocent of murder when a lot of Americans had already made their minds up that he was guilty.I think Atticus done a very well job of explaining the situation to Scout. Expressing his dislike for the word "Niger" he explained to her negro was a better word, and that he did not want her fighting over what anyone said to her about him or the case.Even though I had to read this book in the 5th grade there was a lot I had forgotten about. This movie really brought the book alive. It was very much like the book. I found it hard to watch a black and white film without getting sleepy through the movie, but It was such a well made film it kept me interested.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps Gregory Peck's Greatest Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harper Lee's famous novel came out in 1960 and this film adaptation followed only two years later, by which time the book was already starting to take on the status of a classic. The story is set in the fictional Maycomb County, Alabama, during the depression era of the 1930s, and is told through the eyes of a young girl named Jean Louise Finch who, for some unexplained reason, goes by the nickname Scout. She and her older brother Jem are the children of Atticus Finch, a widowed lawyer.As in the book, the film's central incident is the trial of a black man, Tom Robinson, for the alleged rape of a white woman, Mayella Ewell; Atticus is Robinson's defence attorney. Harper Lee was using a classic thriller plot- the fight to prove the innocence of a man wrongly accused- to explore racism in America's Deep South. (William Faulkner had done something similar in his novel "Intruder in the Dust", later made into an excellent film by Clarence Brown). Although Robinson is clearly innocent of the charge, the all-white jury nevertheless vote to convict him, largely because to admit that a white woman, even one as sluttish as Mayella, was capable of making false accusations against a black man would force them to abandon their cherished ideas about the purity of Southern womanhood.Lee's novel is more than just a courtroom drama, more than a study of racism in the Deep South. It is also a coming-of-age novel in which Scout and Jem, who begin as innocent children, are forced to confront the evil which lurks in their tranquil-seeming town and in which they learn important lessons about tolerance. A favourite saying of their father, who believes that most people, when you get to know them, are essentially kind, is that you should never judge a man until you have stood in his shoes and walked around in them. Atticus applies this principle not only to racial issues but also to various acquaintances whom his children dislike or disapprove of for one reason or another. Most importantly he applies it to Boo Radley, a simple-minded and reclusive neighbour, who is regarded by the local people with either fear, suspicion or mockery but who turns out to be inwardly brave and kindly.The title of both book and film refers to a saying of Atticus that it is a sin to kill a mockingbird because they never do any harm, but it is a phrase which also refers to his philosophy of life. At various times several characters in the book- Robinson, Boo Radley, the children- can be seen as "mockingbirds", harmless creatures in need of protection.Like most movies based upon novels, the film makes a few changes from the plot of the book, and omits certain episodes such as the subplot about the cantankerous, elderly Mrs. Dubose and her battle to overcome her opiate addiction. Its few faults are generally those of the book as well. For example, I have always felt that Lee never really explores the tension between Atticus's liberal philosophy of life and the problem of human evil as exemplified by the book's main villain Bob Ewell, Mayella's father. Ewell is neither misjudged nor misunderstood but just plain wicked; not only does he give perjured evidence in the hope of getting an innocent man sent to the gallows, and encourages his daughter to do the same, he also makes a vicious and cowardly attack on Atticus's children. Trying to stand in such a man's shoes would not, I feel, be a very productive exercise.Nevertheless, the film is for the most part a faithful adaptation of the book and, most importantly, remains faithful to its spirit. Its faults are greatly outweighed by its merits, chief of which must be the performance of Gregory Peck, perhaps his greatest ever, with the possible exception of "The Big Country". Peck was himself well-known for his liberal opinions, and Atticus Finch- kindly, rational, tolerant, gentlemanly and both physically and morally courageous- was the sort of role he excelled in playing. Of the other acting contributions the one that stands out the most is from the young Mary Badham who makes an enchanting heroine as Scout. Robert Duvall is also good in his film debut as Boo Radley.Peck deservedly won an Oscar for his performance. The film itself was nominated for "Best Picture", but lost out to "Lawrence of Arabia". Although that film has its merits, including another great performance from Peter O'Toole and some spectacular camera-work, I have always regarded it as a rather diffuse, sprawling work, lacking the concision and emotional power of "To Kill a Mockingbird". Perhaps David Lean's film won out because in the early sixties it seemed to represent the way the Hollywood was going. After the success of the likes of "Bridge on the River Kwai", "Ben Hur" and "Spartacus", it looked as though the future of the movie industry lay with the grand epic. (That style of film-making, although it produced some great movies while it lasted, was starting to look outdated by the end of the decade).Robert Mulligan's film, by contrast, probably looked rather old-fashioned, with its more modest scale, small-town setting and monochrome photography. (Two years earlier the Academy had given "The Apartment" the last "Best Picture" award it would ever give to a film in black-and-white, apart from "Schindler's List" more than thirty years later). Today, however, we can recognise "To Kill a Mockingbird" as one of the cinematic achievements of 20th century, a moving human story, well-told and well-acted. One of the things the cinema does best. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Timeless Treasure with Universal Appeal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With its tight opening study of a tattered collection of cigar box treasures accompanied by the playful sounds of a child quietly at play, "To Kill A Mockingbird" elegantly captures a specific time and place. The Elmer Bernstein score soon introduces not much more than a piano and clarinet, but the effect remains timeless, perfectly describing that innocent age that children once shared universally. Even as Bernstein's orchestrations become more complex or playful, like Copland, the music delivers a delicately nostalgic tone throughout.The night this film first premiered on network television back in the late 60's, my parents weren't willing to let me stay-up to watch it. They were afraid that Harper Lee's coming-of-age story dealing with racism, rape, social justice, and other issues would be a tad too adult for my early adolescent mind. They didn't know that I had already read the book. As luck would have it, our house was on the market, and my teacher stopped by for a showing that very day. She petitioned my parents on my behalf and persuaded them to allow me to watch it. Which I did, with them. I wish I could remember the name of that wise woman, but I've tried to pay it forward.I have since taught the book, and reinforced it with the film. Truly, "To Kill A Mockingbird" is one of those rare films whose screenplay adaptation (Horton Foote) beautifully realizes Lee's masterpiece. The performances are unadorned, and respectively courageous or outrageous without ever dissolving into caricature or melodrama. The chiaroscuro effects achieved by the black and white format allows the viewer to imagine a world when color often undermined the best intentions of good people.This is a film to share with your children, or their children. I am very happy that "To Kill A Mockingbird" is a prime-time feature this Father's Day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Picture of 1962</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am absolutely a fan of the Oscars Best Picture winners, and I make sure that i only purchase a DVD copy of the winners. However, my perspective changed when I stumbled upon a copy of "To Kill A Mockingbird". I've heard it from a certain TV show and I immediately got interested. Little was to know that I would consider it as one of the greatest pictures I've seen so far. The story is simple but the moral is timeless. The execution is flawless, and the cinematography is somewhat nostalgic. It really made me cry in the scene where Peck is leaving the courtroom. It made me feel sad, confused and mad at the same time. I haven't seen "Lawrence of Arabia", but i bet that "...mockingbird" has put up a good fight. (both were nominated for the Best Picture category of 1962). I definitely will recommend it to my children someday.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"You never really understand a person... until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'To Kill a Mockingbird (1962)' has stayed with me since the time I first saw it, perhaps because the film caught me at an impressionable age. This was in 2004, not a particularly long time ago, but it feels an age away. High school greets you at a young, idealistic age, when the world sits at your fingertips just waiting for you to take it. Having just read Harper Lee's Pullitzer Prize-winning novel in English class, we followed it with Robert Mulligan's film adaptation, which scored an Oscar for Gregory Pick and would have won Best Picture had David Lean not hustled in with his masterpiece. Even when lamentably broken up into fifty-minute intervals, 'To Kill a Mockingbird' left me captivated by its magic ? and, yes, there is magic. Though typically celebrated as a statement on racial prejudice in the American South, the true core of both Lee's novel and Mulligan's film is distanced from Tom Robinson's rape trial, and lies in terrible, wonderful and beautiful experience of growing up.The film, as in Lee's novel, is told through the eyes of Scout Finch (Mary Badham; voiced by Kim Stanley as an adult), the tomboyish daughter of small-town lawyer Atticus (Gregory Peck) and younger sister of Jem (Phillip Alford). Along with visiting neighbour Dill (John Megna), the two siblings whittle away their summers obsessing over local recluse "Boo" Radley, an agoraphobic, mentally-ill man towards whom the children develop both a fear and fascination. Meanwhile, Atticus is appointed to defend an African American (Brock Peters) accused of raping a white woman, and his determination to give the man a fair trial leads to heated racial tensions in the bigoted Southern township. 'To Kill A Mockingbird' follows Jem and Scout as they go about the processes of growing up, learning of the bitter immorality and prejudice that lurks beyond the security of their home. Ironically, the film is weakest during its narrative crux ? Tom Robinson's courtroom trial ? as Mulligan strains to keep the story focused around the children, though Peck's virtuous performance compensates for the lapse.I've never quite been able to put my fingers around why 'To Kill A Mockingbird' is, to me, such an emotionally-draining (and fulfilling) picture. Perhaps it's Elmer Bernstein's musical score, sad and wistful, like the lamentation of a fairy-tale punctuated by reality. Childhood itself is not unlike a fairy-tale, a time of infallible ideals and black-and-white ethics. Mulligan justly celebrates the steadfast moral courage of Atticus Finch, but the overriding emotion at Tom Robinson's sentencing is instead one of sinking disillusionment: while Scout watches on, uncomprehending, Jem buries his head in his arms, his childish conviction in the goodness of adults irreparably shattered. Yet, even then, hope survives for those who, like the Finch family, preserve their moral integrity. The film's fairy-tale mood, at times reminiscent of Laughton's 'The Night of the Hunter (1957),' is enforced most strongly in the children's' final walk through the forest, described as their "longest journey together." Arthur "Boo" Radley, a mockingbird who might have been destroyed by less sympathetic souls, ultimately becomes their saviour.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's one of the longest &amp; finest courtroom trial scene of my movie watching experience. Watching the facial expression of that black man named Tom Robinson on trial sitting on the confession chair just melts my emotions deeply. Next to those goddamn natural expressions you witness a mind blowing speech delivered by Gregory Peck as defending lawyer Atticus Finch (It reminds me the great climactic speech delivered by Pacino in 'Scent of Women'). The scene ends with touching standing ovation of all the black men in the court for the white lawyer who's the last man vacating the court &amp; it's a moment where you feel to shout- What a scene!! Based on Harper Lee's classic book the film is a moving story of thirties Southern America. Its classic story of a lawyer with the principles living with his kids &amp; defending a case of a black man named Tom, falsely accused of raping a white woman. Although the jury gave racial verdict in the favor of the white woman &amp; innocent Tom got killed himself in his attempt to escape from cops. There's also fine &amp; equally interesting sub plot in the film between the children &amp; mysterious neighbor Mr. Boo (surprising Robert Duvall).Gregory Peck has played many fine characters but none of them is as rich and as controlled in performance as the character of Atticus Finch- a responsible widower father of two kids &amp; a lawyer with integrity to his profession. His impeccable performance was honored with Best Actor's Oscar for this film. Apart from him the acting by all three kids as non professional actors is really praiseworthy.A Timeless Classic.Ratings-9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beyond the classic book and classic film, "To Kill A Mockingbird" indulges us to stay on our moral toes, without preaching. As a nation, and still a young one at that, we have endured growing pains that has left us with far too much blood on our hands, as well as embarrassment and shame. But that's not all we are. We live in a nation where our revolution has never ended, because we continue to move forward and work diligently make things right - for all Americans. And for a moment, this film, through the actions of a great man in Atticus Finch, does his best to bring common sense, reason and wisdom to a place where the true power of our freedoms has taken a back seat to bigotry. But this isn't one man's fight, many others agree with the upstanding lawyer, thus avoiding any stereotypes.This excellent film is powerful in its subtlety. Watch it and think of how far we've come as a people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heartbreaking Prejudice and Injustice Through the Eyes of Children</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Few films adapted from acclaimed literature live up to the spirit and poignancy of the original source material. Winning the Oscar for best adapted screenplay, "To Kill a Mockingbird", based on the novel of the same title, is one of a handful of Hollywood gems that not only unabashedly adheres to the parent story but captures its atmosphere. The cast seems to have stepped right out of Harper Lee's prose and onto the screen being exactly how you would expect them. Gregory Peck (in an Academy Award-winning performance) appears to have been born to play Atticus Finch although the production of such a film would have been unimaginable when Peck came into the world in 1916. Brock Peters as Tom Robinson is equally as fine a choice, and honorable mention should go to James Anderson as the morally corrupt and spiritually void Bob Ewell. The children are equally superb, particularly Mary Badham in an academy-nominated performance as Scout and Philip Alford as Jem. Instead of watching a movie, you feel like you've moved into this town.The magic of both the book and the movie is that it is not just a story about prejudicial and racist attitudes in the South, although these ideas are certainly at its heart. It is these attitudes and behaviors as seen from a child's perspective. Jem, Scout and their summer-friend Dill Harris (John Megna) see the clashes and the controversies of the adults and do not quite know what to make of them. They are old enough to understand what is going on but still too young to understand why a black man would be wrongfully accused of raping a white girl, Mayella Ewell (convincingly portrayed by Collin Wilcox). Or why some of the townsfolk frown on Atticus for defending an innocent man who happens to be black. Their friend Dill also has some tall tales of his own, bragging that his father is a railroad magnate. The other storyline involves a kind of "secret admirer" of the children that has been giving gifts to Jem in a knot-hole of a tree a few blocks from the Finch's, near the home of the Radleys. The Radleys are a reclusive family and the subject of many tall tales grown and fertilized by the townspeople, particularly Boo Radley who is characterized like a small-town devil through rumor. The Radleys are the target of community scorn, although not with as blunt an instrument as against African-Americans. We get the picture that this story is about untruths, from little innocent fibs like Dill's to the fabrication of the circumstances surrounding the trial.In one brilliant scene, a lynch-mob gathers to take Tom Robinson from his cell. The mob seems compelled by some traditional sense of duty rather than flaming passion as the Ewells are not well-loved in the community. Atticus, forewarned of the plans, sits outside the front of the jail house as Robinson's only defense. Before there is an escalation of violence, little Scout Finch arrives on the scene. She notices the people in the mob are acquaintances and she begins having polite conversation with them as if they were at a social function. Her presence and friendliness deflates the resolve of the mob, almost as if they have been found out, not by the police, but by a child. How could they possibly explain to her what they are doing? A large part of the story is the trial of Tom Robinson defended by Atticus Finch in a courtroom drama that is unlike most other Hollywood courtroom dramas. Here, the defending attorney Finch is fighting a losing battle where facts cannot penetrate deep-seeded hate and prejudice. Although the jury members dislike the Ewells, keeping the African-American community "in their place" takes a higher precedent. The climax involves how the outcome of the trial collides with the mysterious children's admirer. Notice the names "Finch" and "Robin"-son, both birds, like mockingbirds.This is a masterpiece of film-making that defies most Hollywood conventions. Both the book and the film continue to appear on "Best of" lists, and deservedly so. There are few pieces of literature that have helped foster social change, not through a step-by-step objective plan, but simply through the innocent eyes of children witnessing and trying to make sense of injustice and prejudice. For some reason human beings tend to engage in hate more than love. But maybe when the child within us sees the pain and sorrow of unjustified prejudice, that's when we will change our attitudes. A tissue box and a loved one are also highly recommended when viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To Kill a Mockingbird is one of the greatest movie experiences ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In commenting on African-Americans in film in chronological order for Black History Month, we're now at 1962 with the release of the movie version of Harper Lee's novel, "To Kill a Mockingbird". The crux of the story is lawyer Atticus Finch's (Oscar-winning performance of Gregory Peck) defending black farmer Tom Robinson (Brock Peters) against the testimony of Mayella's (Collin Wilcox Paxton) accusation of her rape by him. These scenes are some of the most touching and intense I've ever seen of a movie made while there was still a Production Code in effect (though the rules of that Code were relaxed by this time compared to the '30s and '40s). Peter's testimony and, especially, Peck's closing statement were especially touching. Since we're talking about black performers, here's a few more I'd like to mention from this movie: Estelle Evans as Peck's housekeeper for his kids-this actress is the sister of Esther Rolle from "Good Times", David Crawford as Tom's son David, Jester Hairston-who I remember from "Amen"-as Tom's father Spence, Kim Hamilton as Tom's wife Helen, and Bill Walker as the Rev. Sykes who says perhaps the most famous line in the movie, "Jean Louise, stand up, your father is passing." (I had earlier misquoted this line in a review of the "Our Gang" comedy, Young Sherlocks, which starred his wife, Peggy Cartwright, as a child) Others in the cast are Kim Stanley who's Scout as an adult in narration, Alice Ghostley and William Windon in their film debuts, and, as the children, John Megna-brother of Connie Stevens-as neighbor boy Dill, Philip Alford as Finch's son Jem, and Mary Badham-whose brother John would become a movie director-as Finch's daughter Jean Louise, better known as "Scout". Then there's Robert Duvall in his scene stealing turn as the silent Boo Radley. What else can I say about this movie produced by Alan J. Pakula, directed by Robert Mulligan, with screenplay adapted by Horton Foote except this is one of the best ever made in my lifetime! Everyone I've just mentioned was just superb and the score by Elmer Bernstein was a most wonderful addition to this great movie from 1962. Kudos to Ms. Lee for the only novel she ever published that turned out to be one of the most exhilarating movie experiences I've ever had. So on that note, I definitely recommend To Kill a Mockingbird.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've now seen "To Kill A Mockingbird" about a half dozen times, and it didn't strike me until today's viewing how much of the story revolves around Scout and Jem, the children of the story's hero, Atticus Finch. Perhaps that's because the picture hooks us with it's courtroom drama and the overt issue of racial intolerance in 1930's America. Maybe it's because Gregory Peck is so brilliant in the role of the hero that it's easy to overlook all of the supporting characters. In any event, this is a strong and stirring film, I consider it must viewing for any serious fan of great cinema. It is simply perfect in it's execution, with character portrayals that are as real and endearing as any in film.Watching today, it helps to consider how important this movie was in breaking down racial barriers on the eve of the Civil Rights revolution in this country. It's not difficult to imagine lone, solitary heroes like Atticus Finch in far flung small towns of the South standing single minded against hatred and bigotry. The values instilled in his children are personified in the movie by young Jem, for whom the experience takes on a defining coming of age. Jem experiences first hand the fear of bigotry, yet with glowing pride comes to understand that his father is a true hero, not only accepted, but honored by the black community in his small town for showing courage and humanity in the face of overwhelming opposition. For her part, Scout (Mary Badham) shines in one of the story's most forceful scenes, facing down a veritable lynch mob by being nothing more than human, causing her father's adversaries outright shame and humiliation. One gets the feeling that perhaps Atticus himself learned a lesson that day. In accepting the American Film Institute's Lifetime Achievemant Award in 1988, Gregory Peck issued a challenge to the entertainment industry, one of 'elevating the quality of films and TV shows'. Sadly, that challenge has gone largely unanswered, as movie makers go for larger and louder special effects, and an increasing appeal to the lowest common denominator. Fortunately, films like "To Kill A Mockingbird" live on to work their magic on succeeding generations who can appreciate and put into perspective the struggles of a nation coming to grips with equality for all. This one has been on my personal Top Ten list for a long time, and is in no clear danger of being replaced. It's one of the few movies I can revisit yearly and continue to take away meaning and importance time after time. Clearly recommended for one and all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps the ultimate coming of age story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To Kill a Mockingbird is based on the novel by Harper Lee, is directed by Robert Mulligan and stars Gregory Peck, Mary Badham, Brock Peters, Phillip Alford, Paul Fix, Collin Wilcox, James Anderson and Robert Duvall.Gregory Peck is the embodiment of human goodness here as Southern lawyer Atticus Finch. Finch is raising his two children alone following their mothers death. Peck won a Oscar for his performance here and what makes him more memorable is that in real life he was so very much like Atticus and was a kind and moral man.If every person around the world was more like Atticus it's no stretch of the imagination to say that our world would be a much better place.A coming of age tale told entirely through the eyes of children.By showing everything from their point of view the lines between good and evil are glaringly obvious and we see how a cranky old man can seem like a scary old monster, or how a father can be the greatest hero of all.The film like the book is told from the point of view of three children The six year old daughter of Aticus,Scout(Mary Badham)his older son Jem(Phillip Alford) and their neighbour Dell(John Megna).Atticus is asked to defend a black farmer Tom Robinson(Brock Peters)who is wrongly accused of raping Mayella Ewell(Collin Wilcox)a white woman, Atticus stands up for him against the angry town residents who all think he is guilty.Brock Peters is nothing less than breathtaking as Tom his face conveys the multitude of emotions that Tom is going through during the trial.Although sadly(given the time and place it's set in)the outcome of the trial is a foregone conclusion, the sight of Atticus making his plea to the jury is one of the most unforgettable scenes in film history. Finch fights for Tom with all his heart and reminds us we are all equal and certainly should be treated so under the law.This is a deeply moving and powerful film about right and wrong seen through the eyes of children. Gregory Peck is superb as the decent lawyer who always tries to do the right thing. There is fine support from Collin Wilcox as the accuser of Tom Robinson, her outburst in court is pretty intense and her performance very memorable. James Anderson is also very memorable as the despicable father of Mayella. A young Robert Duvall has a memorable appearance towards the end of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very Good Book and Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was first introduced to Harper Lee's "To Kill a Mockingbird" in it's book form. This was required reading in 9th grade English class. There were so many elements in that narrative that drew the reader into a world dictated by the narrative efforts of Scout. Small town southern America is where I grew up.The daily discoveries, challenges, curiosities, and coming of age scenarios were key elements of my childhood. The mysterious ways of adults was real. The allegiance to my kinfolk was real. The unseen terrors of the night were real. For these things I admire Harper Lee for a work well done. In addition to this, this wonderful bit of literature made a remarkable leap to the silver screen. By the time I first saw it, I had read the book several times. The premise of the story never faltered. The magical changing of the seasons, the night of the school program, and the comment Scout made about it being "the beginning of their longest journey together", caused a back-of-the-head tingling of warmth and nostalgia.So from the start of Scout's narrative, where she commented on the poverty of that small southern hamlet, toward the end where Sheriff Tate tells Atticus to "Let the dead bury the dead this time Mister Finch!", this cinematographic effort has earned a well deserved place in the archives of celluloid splendor.Finally, as I consider the many years of viewing this film, I can not help but notice that the scene depicting the young white woman trying to seduce Tom Robinson has been omitted from any VHS or DVD that one may add to his/her collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece that resonates as strongly today as ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps somewhere in the very far future when African Americans and Caucasian Americans have finally learned to see each other as brothers and sisters and not a human of color, then looking back on this film will seem strange and wistful. Until that time, we can do no better than to sit down and read the book and then watch this perfect movie adaptation.There are other great books and movies that cover the depression years in America. "Grapes of Wrath" comes to mind. Harper Lee's book and this film focus not on the displaced as much as how one person can rise to the occasion, show a strong moral spine and true courage. It would have been too simple to say that the film was about prejudice. Coming to the screen as it did during the rising cauldron of the Civil Rights movement, this film was a perfect mirror for the haunting specter that refused to shed its shadow over the south. In the aftermath of the ruinous Civil War, southern states, especially the Carolina's which led the revolt, suffered very badly during and after the war. In some places poverty and destitution never left the land. What did people do to get by in the depression era? Did they fall back on old ways and use scapegoats to satisfy the blame game? Certainly and that is where the story here begins.The audience watching this film in 1962 was familiar with prejudice but rarely had it seen a white man treat an African American with respect and a resolute commitment to seeking justice. There are other sinister themes that rise to the surface. The implication of a daughter being beaten by a drunken father, the taboo of a white woman seducing a black man, the injustice done to a mentally handicapped man by shuttering him like a prisoner in his own home; these are all hot buttons that would have made an audience squirm and disquiet their comfort zones. Even more ugly was the false accusation of an honest man, a person that was expected to be found guilty even by his own peers simply because he was a visible minority; this was the deep south and prejudice was so widespread. The richness of the story gives depth and detail to the lives of Atticus Finch and his fiercely independent children as they explore their lives. With several subplots swirling around the main trial, the audience is given constant stimulation in vivid colors of human drama. Shot in black and white and blessed with a superb script, one of the greatest male actors in the English speaking world, a sublime musical score by Elmer Bernstein, two child actors who were so natural that they became Atticus's children in a real way.....this film is iconic in American cinema and for so many good reasons. Perhaps Gregory Peck's greatest role, this film is unforgettable and has taken on a tinge of greatness that is entirely worthy of its craft. If you must own one Peck film, this is the one. As the saying goes, they simply don't make them like this anymore; what a pity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Greatest films ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To Kill a Mokingbird is one of the best films that America has. It contains values and morals as far as justice. I felt in love with the character of Scout, She portrayed a brave little girl with an attitude of a boy. Atticus Finch a single father that was racing a boy and a girl going through everyday problems and teaching them about the injustice of discrimination among every single individual. The movie had two mystery's, who Boo Radley really was and if Tom Robinson was guilty or innocent. Atticus Finch as a lawyer believe in Robinsons innocence and decided to defend him, knowing that he was going to win enemies by defending a negro over a white man. Atticus stayed firmed and went on with the case. I you watch this movie you can learn a valuable experience from two kids witch portrayed innocence, purity , and curiosity of how the world revolves. Amazing Movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Elegant and heart warming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just finished watching this great movie, and I am wondering what took me so long to rent it, and why so few of my friends have seen it! The plot of the movie is simple and uncluttered. There are two main stories, which quite possibly could be independently told (of course at the cost of snatching away a lot of beauty that comes with putting them together), but still there is a distinct common theme - prejudice. In fact a lot of more modern day movies touch this theme, I believe Crash and American History X would be two good examples. The thing about Mocking Bird is that the symbolisms are much more basic, in a very good way. The other distinctive feature is the strength of some of the characters ? fairness, self-respect, and somewhat more subtle - love for ones family and the instinct to protect or just the urge to stick around to make sure that others are safe.The movie has a pleasant touch to it? the images are gripping from the very start, the first minute of the movie probably puts one in touch with childlike curiosity. And, by the end of it the feature leaves the viewers with a thought. As the movie ended I couldn't help recounting a few instances from my own early days when relatively trivial things meant the world, and unconditional affection was not rare.To sum up, To Kill A Mocking Bird is a brilliant watch, the plot is simple to follow and yet very engaging, it leaves you with some very positive messages that are natural to the storyline rather that being in the face.</fullReview>

It instantly became one of my all-time favorites.Gregory Peck does a great job this film, as do the kids playing Scout and Jem...which is amazing when you consider their lack of experience before this film.Sure, it's in black and white, but IMO, it adds character to the movie...I hope they never colorize it.

		<fullReview>This movie, although in black and white, is a fantastic movie. Although I was slightly disappointed that elements from the book (Aunt Alexandra and Dolphus Raymond chiefly) were not in the film, it is a wonderful summary of a wonderful book. Fantastic acting from Gregory Peck helps make the film work. Mary Badham and John Megna are absolutely adorable as Scout and Dill. I feel Philip Alford deserves special credit for his portrayal as Jem - entirely believable as the boy who wants to help his father. Despite the fact it is an incredibly good movie, read the book first. The movie gives a visual portrayal of characters, but the book has little nuances, little quirks that just capture life. The movie also cuts out Aunt Alexandra, and merges two characters together, and Aunt Alexandra is a key character in the book. So, read the fantastic classic that is To Kill a Mockingbird, then watch the fantastic film</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Excellent Coming of Age Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there was ever a film about the innocence of children and the things they had to go through while growing up, this is that film. It is the quintessential coming of age story and it will never be forgotten.Gregory Peck plays Atticus Finch, the father of Jem and Scout. His wife passed when the children were very young and Scout doesn't remember much about her. Atticus must serve as father and mother to both of them while still trying to maintain dignity and respect as he defends a black man in 1930s Alabama.The film is based on Harper Lee's book of the same name. There are many differences between the film and novel, but the main points are kept in tact. The book had many lessons for everyone including racism and equality. The film takes those two main points and marvelously tells a tale of the prejudices inside us all.Not only is racism a factor, but also just how we look at the social classes and even people who are just different in mannerisms. To Kill a Mockingbird is many lessons wrapped into a two hour movie, but those two hours pack so much of a wallop that you'll be shaken and engrossed at many parts of the film.Each character is developed exactly the way Lee intended. Robert Mulligan's direction is nearly flawless and Gregory Peck's performance as our hero is one of the greatest in all of cinematic history. It's definitely the best film of 1962 and one of the five best of the '60s. If you have any compassion for your childhood, I urge you to see this excellent film.</fullReview>

I'm 18 years old, and not from the south, but the kids' playing reminds me a bit of playing with my brothers and sisters when I was growing up. Everything was a mystery and adventure. The kids did an excellent job of acting, and the little girl who played Scout had never even acted or been trained in acting before! There was a great depth to the characters and a great mysterious aura to the Radley house. Gregory Peck, as usual, did a great job in his part, and the man who played Tom Robinson did, too. For me it was a riveting movie, though there were no explosions or shoot-outs or high-tech graphics. It was plain and simple but effective. There were some funny moments, some scary moments, some emotional moments. I saw it in the original B&amp;W on DVD...At first I wished I could see it in color, but then I thought making it in B&amp;W gave it more mystery and interest. The "Fearful Symmetry" (making of the movie) was very interesting, too, talking about what we have lost as a country, even while we have gained things. After watching the movie, I think I'll have to read the book, and I'm sure it won't be a waste of time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without waxing too rhapsodic, film doesn't get any better than this! Evocative, touching without being saccharine, and -- a dying breed -- a movie that's ABOUT something. This is one of those films that never gets old either in its message or its style. Unlike many other films that rely too heavily on voiceover narration, the film uses just enough of the poetry of Harper Lee's first-person tale to set the stage and bookend her poetic fable. And the characters are not stereotypes, nor even mere archetypes. Gregory Peck is splendidly dignified and understated as Atticus Finch, and Mary Badham and Brock Peters are first rate. Robert Duvall's "Boo" Radley is one of the great performances in all of film. The lyrical score (Elmer Bernstein), black-and-white cinematography (Russell Harlan), and beautifully detailed art direction (Henry Bumstead) support Robert Mulligan's deft direction. Parents, take your children to see this film! -- at a revival or repertory theater if possible, or if not, rent the widescreen version of the video. This is better education in social values than can be had in classroom -- and can't help but touch young people at their core without being preachy or self-righteous. For audiences of all ages, "To Kill a Mockingbird" more than survives repeated viewing. Without a shred of sentimentality, this film leaves not a dry eye in the house.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this movie in English class in 9th grade after reading the book, witch is a classic of course. I think I'm the only one in my whole class who enjoyed the movie, Mr. Peck was wonderful in the film, which led to his winning of the Oscar for his role in the movie. It's very good and sticks to the book fairly well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best films on Social Tolerance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie really gave me a sense of what it must have been like to grow up in the 1930's. We follow a young girl's development as she takes the lesson from her father on how "it's a sin to kill a mockingbird" and later starts applying it to people, and develops principals of tolerance of others, from the poor to their outcast neighbor. I love the message of this movie, especially Atticus Finch's monologues on justice and the rule of law. There are some flaws to the film story itself though, such as the movie doesn't really say what Mr. Ewell's motivations are in regards to Atticus' children, among other things. Despite minor flaws I would highly recommend this film to anyone. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warm, beautifully-realized piece of Americana, and now a part of Hollywood's treasured classics.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The warmth and affection generated by Kim Stanley's brilliant, thoughtful narration in the Oscar-winning "To Kill a Mockingbird" couldn't capture better the essence of Harper Lee's semi-autobiographical novel. I could swear hers is the inner voice I heard when I first read this book as a young teen.A woman recaptures a single childhood summer during the Great Depression, a period she recalls with great fondness despite the difficult times. As seen through the eyes of an impressionable tomboy (nicknamed "Scout"), the story, set in a drowsy, dusty Alabama community, initially centers comfortably around typical adolescent escapades, until the town is jarred by a grown-up incident in which an indigent black man is accused of raping a white woman. Scout's widower father is given the daunting, disputatious assignment of representing the already condemned man.Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch is exemplary as the father we wished for as a child. A tower of quiet strength, he is a man of utmost integrity, a steady voice of logic and reason, a man of disciplined, yet tender reserve. A father you can count on to defend you against mad dogs or pervasive demons that disturb your sleep at night. Too perfect? Maybe. But in that perfection Atticus represents everything we aspire not only in ourselves, but for mankind as well. He is a reassuring factor that man, in spite of his flaws, is innately good and decent -- his saintliness accentuated by his offspring's loving reflection. Peck's utter sincerity in this role is never doubtful for a minute. And for once his sometimes stiff, sobering demeanor meshes beautifully with a character that has become his signature piece.The superbly talented "young 'uns", Mary Badham and Philip Alford, play the children Scout and Jem. They may not have had longevity in their acting careers, but here they make an everlasting imprint with performances so natural, triggering sweet memories of our own lost innocence. Their simple joys and fears are exquisitely realized and instantly become our own. They and the late John Megna, as their rather frail, awkward summer-time friend, touch the heart with their simple discoveries, theories and revelations.The trial aspects may seem overblown by today's standard but the dramatic tension and poignancy is not lost. Brock Peters gives a deeply felt performance as defendant Tom Robinson, a man rife with fear, yet able to muster shaky courage and dignity throughout his ordeal. On the other side of the coin, James Anderson gives despicable meaning to the term "poor white trash" as the bigoted, redneck father of a piteous rape victim, played with neurotic intensity by Collin Wilcox. Atticus's closing argument and the trial's denouement are only two of many highlights, with Peck's speech one of cinema's most memorable soliloquies. Slow-minded recluse Arthur Radley, who is taunted by the nickname "Boo" (a compelling Robert Duvall), serves to represent the fear in all of us...fear of the unknown. He becomes a phantom-like symbol for those who have ever been unfairly judged or persecuted due to prejudice, gossip, opinion, and/or ignorance. His final scene with Scout remains etched in my mind. Director Robert Mulligan evokes welcoming sentiment without the saccharine in this sensitive Horton Foote adaptation. "To Kill a Mockingbird" never fails to open my heart, mind and tear ducts.A triumph of the human spirit. It is a treasure to be sure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is based on the prize-winning book of the same name by Harper Lee. It is semi-autobiographical, and so it cannot be dismissed or taken lightly as a work of pure fiction. In my opinion, the movie is very faithful to the book. Hats off to Gregory Peck for a superb acting job as Atticus. Robert Duvall has a small but very pivotal part in this movie. He does an excellent job as well. On another front, the musical score soothes its way into your heart from the start of the movie and stays with you for a long time afterwards. The message of Love and Compassion is the central theme of this movie, and by my estimation, it has rarely been so well communicated. One has to be made of stone not to be moved (and hopefully changed for the better) by it. Thank you to all who took part in the making of this, to quote Keats, "thing of beauty"!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So many mockingbirds</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While Harper Lee's drinking problems most likely played a large role in why none of her other works were successful, To Kill a Mockingbird stands as testimony to the fact that she was a great American talent. How this movie could ever rate anything below a 10 is beyond me, although I do know that everyone has their own taste.The casting was perfection. I cannot imagine anyone other than Gregory Peck playing Atticus Finch. The role of Scout was also done extremely well.The message of the story is timeless, and in fact, perhaps more important today than ever before. Some sad aspect of human nature causes us to reject what we don't understand as being dangerous. The worst part about it is that we live such complicated lives that those we reject are often, not only harmless, but simple, gentle creatures. I content that there are two mockingbirds in this story. The persecution of a black man and the persecution of an emotionally disturbed white man stand side by side, not only as the persecuted, but in many ways as the pure of heart. To kill a mockingbird is a crime because it offers only the beauty of its "simple" song. This movie does an outstanding job of portraying what happens when we attack what is simple.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favorite films about small-town America</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of Gregory Peck's finest hours. It's a moving, thoughtful portrait of a rural town during the Depression years. The story is told as seen through the eyes of Scout, the daughter of a small-town lawyer (Peck). The child's narration imbues this film with a sense of wonder, adventure, love and innocence that help the story work on several levels: as an adventure and morality play for children; as an absorbing social commentary on racism; as a way for adults to rediscover the joys and wonder of those childhood years; and as a celebration of all those things that make families the bedrock of a civilized nation. Two more good things about this film are: 1) It was filmed in glorious black and white, and 2) The soundtrack music (by Alex North) is beautiful. Reminds one of Aaron Copland music. See this film and give thanks for great directors and even greater stories.</fullReview>

No matter what role he has every played, you believed what he said. His remarks in the courtroom scenes were so heartwrenching. Atticus Finch was a wonderful character. He stood up for what he believed in even though he was being ridiculed by his friends!In this age of technology, I sincerely hope that someone doesn't "remake" or "colorize" this classic film. To do so would be to destroy a truly magnificent film. To all those studio executives in Hollywood, please listen to your public ---- please, please do not remake this wonderful film.You owe it to yourself to see this film.

		<shortDescription>When a Book and a Movie Knock It Out of the Park</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is something so sensitive yet intense in Peck's portrayal of Atticus Finch. He is a man of great honor and true humanity. He takes it all inside, dealing with the realities of what he is facing. He ignore the threats and sees a man for a man. However, he is doomed but represents an action out of time. I was especially impressed with the children in this movie. They are not scene stealers but rather show the future if allowed to grow up. As the trial moves along, it is obvious that there is little that can be said to counteract the hate that is there. But like most of us, Atticus and look in the mirror at the end of the day and say he did what was right. Gregory Peck was a top ten actor and wandered smoothly from movies such as "Moby Dick" to "The Omen." He was masterful in psychological thrillers such as "Spellbound." This was, however, his finest hour. The man with the rumpled suit and the big heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Arguably the strongest bond of any relationship between two human begins, more than; the husband and wife, more than two sister and even more than a mother and her daughter. The strongest of all bonds is the one shared between a father and his son. The father being the mentor, whose job it is to help his son, to guide his son through the unsteady, turbulent and sometimes painful sea that is life. His kind words of encouragements must act as sails boats to guide us into man hood. Well Mockingbird is not strictly just a father and son relationship, there is also a daughter added to the mix, but despite that, Atticus Finch is the perfect illustration of what a good father should be as with stern love and mostly importantly education, he teaches his children to love in a world full of hate, and for me that's the greatest lesson any father could teach his children. And To Kill a Mockingbird is the perfect illustration of a true American classic. Based on the Pulitzer-Prize winning masterpiece novel by Harper Lee (Her only novel), writer Horton Foote and director Robert Mulligan, ingeniously guide us through a painful period in human history for all those involved, a period of economic turmoil and the very apex of racial tension in the deep south, Maycomb, Alabama, in 1932 to be more precise. But what makes the film the even more compelling is how we are shown a world filled with so much ugly, but at the same time we are lead to a single red rose of beauty, because we are shown the world through the eyes of 6 year old girl called Jean Louise "Scout" Finch (Mary Badham) a high spirited and precocious young girl, who despite her innocent smile, you certainly don't want to find yourself on her bad side. On her journey she is accompanied by Brother Jeremy Atticus "Jem" Finch (Phillip Alford), neighbourhood friend Dill Harris and last but not least farther Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch. But it's through Scouts eyes we see her father a nigh-on perfect, eloquent and intelligent lawyer seeks to uphold what is true and just, in a world that seeks to abuse and belittle a whole race of people, as he puts it upon himself to protect a black man in court against the bigoted arm of injustice. The black man is Tom Robinson and he has been accused of raping a poor white girl named Mayella Violet Ewell, but as you would expect in 1932, an all white jury sees him as guilty even though the film consistently paints him a positive light, suggesting he is innocent. Despite this, Atticus still endeavours to protect a man he firmly believes is innocent, leading to one of the most impressive and compelling (and longest) courtroom scenes in history. The two things that stood out to me the most was, for one Gregory Peck performance as the father, which I felt he defiantly deserved his Best Actors Oscar for his performance, because as many times as I watch the film back I can't help but fall in love with it again and again, because peck is able to take a onion layered character who one point his a pacifists, loving father, then a second later he shots down a dog 100 meters away with just one bullet, as if he was in a Clint Eastwood film. And it's this ability to take such a complex character, with so such juxtapositions at his core, and be able to do Harper Lee's character a great service with a gentle, controlled and fine paint brush flick from a true artist. The second thing that stood out for me was the three young actors who made the film such an enjoyable and funny watch, each brought passion and enthusiasm to the role, which helped Foote's script truly come alive. Ranked 33rd greatest American film for a reason! An intoxicating watch, I strongly recommended it as viewing for all occasion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Most Overrated Films Ever Made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Widely considered by many to be one of the finest films ever made, this so-called "Greatest courtroom drama of all time" has only one segment set in the courthouse while the rest of it concerns a couple of annoying kids &amp; their everyday life, which doesn't even have anything to do with the case. In addition to that, it's an insufferably boring film to sit through!Based on the novel of the same name, the story of To Kill A Mockingbird is set in a fictional American town during the 1930s and concerns a respected lawyer &amp; his family who faces a backlash from his society when he agrees to defend a young black man who is accused of raping a white woman. Through the trial, the racial attitude in town's society is exposed.Directed by Robert Mulligan, it is surprising that the first half of the film doesn't even feature anything related to the case, which itself surfaces very late into the story. Maybe this movie isn't a courtroom drama after all, maybe it's more about the loss of childhood innocence &amp; stuff like that but that's not what I was looking forward to after having heard so much praise about it.Set pieces do carry an authentic feel of its timeline &amp; location. The whole drama is captured in crisp black n white and even the night scenes are brightly lit. Editing unfolds its story at a slow pace which becomes a pain to sit through if, like me, you were expecting a customary courtroom drama and ended up with whatever this is. However, its theme of how prejudice can blind an entire society is effectively handled.Coming to the performances, the cast of To Kill A Mockingbird comprises of Gregory Peck, Mary Badham, Phillip Alford, Brock Peters &amp; Robert Duvall in what is his acting debut. Peck is definitely the show-stealer here for his performance as the righteous lawyer is very down- to-earth &amp; impressive, plus that summation speech from him in the courthouse is an instant classic moment, but that same level of commitment is missing from the rest of the cast.Badham &amp; Alford play the two kids whose journey this film is probably about but they utter their lines as if reading from a wall in front of them, that too with blank expressions. Peters does fine with what he's provided as Tom, the convicted black man. Duvall's debut work is nothing special for all he is supposed to do in this film is to show up at a particular moment &amp; then disappear once again. However, Crahan Denton does justice to his white trash character.On an overall scale, To Kill A Mockingbird shouldn't even be classified as courtroom drama when it is something else entirely. Its #1 ranking in the AFI Top !0 Courtroom Dramas is the very reason why I was intrigued to check it out in the first place but to find that part in such a small dose &amp; the story being more inclined towards those kids than the case at hand was both disappointing &amp; frustrating. Overlong &amp; tedious for the most part, this isn't the movie I was looking forward to. Greatest courtroom drama, my ass!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An American Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harper Lee is the literary equivalent of the musical term one hit wonder. Her fictional book was faithfully adapted and is still considered a classic in both genres. Gregory Peck is Atticus Finch, a lawyer in segregated Alabama of the 1930s; or the good old days. His two children, Jean and Jem, are typical kids, running around the neighborhood playing with friends and living comfortable lives. All is going smoothly until a black man, Tom Robinson, is accused of raping a teenage white girl. The racial antagonism is vicious and an innocent man is railroaded despite a vigorous defense by Atticus. His son and daughter are in the courtroom as their father wishes to teach them a lesson about fairness and the evils of prejudice. The town turns against the barrister for his work on behalf of a colored man. Gregory Peck was the best possible choice for the lead role and he deservedly won the Academy Award for best actor. He gives a towering performance. To Kill a Mockingbird is great achievement in filmmaking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With three wins among eight Oscar nominations, this is one of the best pictures of all times. Gregory Peck won one of those Oscars for what is certainly his best performance.It was Mary Badhams first film, and she received a well-earned nomination for her performance as Scout. It was also Phillip Alford's first film. Both of these children performed as well as many actors with years more experience. Of course, Horton Foote's Oscar-winning screenplay, based upon Harper Lee's novel contributed immensely, but the two young actors really made you believe you were watching real characters.In an interesting note, it was also Robert Duvall's first film. He was the "Boo" Radley referred to throughout and not seen until the end.The summation given by Peck has to be one of the greatest of all times, and he truly was, in the words of Miss Maudie, "born to do our unpleasant jobs for us..." Which, of course, includes reminding us of when we fall from what we should be a humans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, I know that's a silly word to start a review with but really, wow! I watched this film for the first time ever last week and I am still thinking about it. So powerful and moving. So beautiful and poetic. So gritty and real. So difficult to review... but I'll try.It's set in a bad time when most white people believed that black people were inferior beings. It demonstrates this beautifully without making it rule the film. It also shows how one man believed in fairness and equality on all levels, and how he managed to change the way others thought about this too, even if he couldn't change the minds of the jury.Gregory Peck is fantastic as Atticus. He is a true hero in my opinion, and as a 27 year old man who has just become a father for the first time he is a role model. It is very easy to almost go along with things you don't agree with in life just so as not to go against the majority. In work and other places we all come across people who opinions and values differ from our own and it is so easy to not agree with them, but to not disagree either. This film should teach you that standing up for what is right can never be wrong.This film has so many strong points and almost no weak ones. I occasionally noticed the young actors mouthing the lines so as to keep up/not get lost, but they did a brilliant job despite this and it did not take away from the film. My favourite scenes were when Scout calms down and almost disarms an angry mob by talking to an individual. This seems to embarrass the whole group who then leave. The other is when the whole upper tier of the court room stand and the reverend says to Scout "Stand up. Your father's passing". This scene is so powerful and moving, without being overdone and cheesy, which would have been so easy.There is an early appearance from Robert Duvall who's only in the film for a short while but his character is mentioned from the start.If you haven't already, please watch this film. It is a true great and deserves to be even higher up the top 250.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Harper Lee's Pulitzer prizewinner is a terrific book (he observed, somewhat unnecessarily) - it tells the story of 1930s liberal Southern lawyer Atticus Finch's defence of a black man accused of raping a white woman, as seen through the eyes of his young daughter Scout.Robert Mulligan's 1962 film adapts the story well, preserving the dramatic beats of the story, conveying a strong sense of time and place, conveying much of the childlike point of view of the novel, and doing so by way of some superb performances.Gregory Peck's Atticus is at the heart and, to me, Peck embodies all the qualities of Lee's character - thoughtful, intelligent, dignified, brave, and always very human. We never forget that he is not simply a lawyer, he is also a father.But all the other players are excellent, too, so much so that it is hardly fair to single out specific performers for mention. But the children are charming and natural, and the film sees an early appearance from Robert Duvall as the mysterious and scary Boo Radley.This excellent film is as good now as it was 40 years ago, and I recommend it heartily.</fullReview>

It cannot be improved upon, and there are precious few films about which that can be said.I have seen and read many stories about the ugliness and hypocrisy of prejudice. None touches upon the subject more poignantly than this one.The children are prejudiced about a mysterious neighbor, based on fear, not fact.The town is prejudiced about Negroes, based on fear, not fact.I could watch this film every year and never tire of it. This is a movie I will make sure my grandchildren see, and a book I will make sure they read.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this movie for the first time. I read the book about a year ago and i am glad i waited to see the movie. Although the movie is a bit different from the book, it is one of the best screen adaptations i have ever seen (along with Mystic River) and i am awed all over again by the underlying message in this movie!I am thrilled that i have to read this again in High School simply so i can make sure i have gathered everything there is to get out of both the book and the movie. This is definitely a timeless classic that will be kept in my collection forever. Even my younger brother who usually has no tolerance for movies like this, much less something in black and white, sat through it and actually got something from it. I would watch this movie 100 more times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess balance would be the right word to sum up this movie. Be it direction, screenplay or acting, everything seemed to be balanced in this movie. I had read the book before watching the movie and doubted if the movie could live up to the book. But it certainly does. Gregory Peck is as though he was born to play the role of Atticus Finch. More like he's not acting but just living the role. That dash of subtlety needed for the role was perfect, at the same time maintaining Atticus' dignity without coming across as too stern or adamant. I thought he was amazing. The kids did marvelous jobs too. Their acting didn't seem forced or exaggerated. All in all a nice movie to watch. Not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A True Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To Kill A Mockingbird is one of the best movies of all time. It may be difficult for others to agree with this statement because many people were forced to watch this moving as part of their high school education. However- the first time I ever watched this film was in grade 10 English class. It has been one of my favourite movies since that very day.I read the novel TKAM when I was very young, with my father. I understood the content of the book and asked my father constantly why Tom Robison was treated that way(I don't want to spoil). Now, I alway judge a film differently after I have read the novel, and usually I'm disappointed in the quality and consistency of the movie. THIS IS NOT THE CASE! Not only was the film true to Harper Lee, but it also took the story to a whole new level. Gregory Peck is at his finest is this film - every child wishes he could have a father like Atticus. This film offers so much more than a good story told by great actors - it allows oneself to look inside themselves, as well as where we have come from as a civilization. It shows us too, how much farther we need to go. As I watch TKAM over and over (I'm surprised the DVD still works) I am able to relate to Scout, Jem, Atticus and even Boo. Any film that is able to invoke so much emotion within myself, portray true heroes with brilliant acting, and have such profound insight, deserves a number one in my books.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peck's Bad Boys</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's often a mistake to revisit a film that one has enjoyed, admired or even loved in one's youth as so many times a second visit makes you wonder what you ever saw in it first time around and if, in the meantime, a film has achieved cult status the odds against it holding up grow progressively slimmer. What a relief, nay, what a JOY to find that this film has, if anything, grown in stature moving me once again to tears. Having always admired Gregory Peck and been bemused by how underrated he was I was delighted when this magisterial performance was rewarded with an Oscar, one that he could have picked up for Twelve O'Clock High, The Gunfighter, Roman Holiday and post-Mockingbird Captain Newman, MD. Like Jack Lemmon and Alan Ladd - who, it has to be said, was an actor with a limited range - Peck embodied decency so that in many ways Atticus Finch, the father everybody wishes he had and/or SHOULD have had, WAS Gregory Peck in period costume. Like all great films the strength begins with the writing and here a perfect novel that belongs up there with The Great Gatsby becomes a perfect film, transposed from one medium to another with great finesse by Horton Foote. Not since Mickey Rooney learned the major lessons of life at the knee of Judge Hardy in another small town has moral education been so easy to take; it's difficult if not impossible to find anything negative to say about this masterpiece which glitters and gleams from the opening credits and first bars of its haunting theme. Beyond praise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic screen adaptation of a great American classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of us are familiar with Harper Lee's classical novel by this name about depression-era racism in the south seen through a child's eyes, so the first question that comes to mind about this movie is 'does it do justice to the book?', and the answer is a resounding 'yes!'.Gregory Peck delivers a great performance as Atticus Finch, the conscientious lawyer who defends a black man against false rape allegations. His children, Jem and Scout, played by Philip Alford and Mary Badham are extremely well-cast and act very naturally. Brock Peters is right-on as the accused Negro, with James Anderson doing a phenomenal job as the villain, Bob Ewell.Although this a story which is probably better fitted for a book than a movie, it does not lose any of its heart on-screen, thanks in part to screenwriter Horton Foote. Although filmed on a Hollywood set, the rustic ambiance of the old southern town is brought to life very vividly.The Bonus Features on the DVD include the academy award best-actor acceptance speech by Gregory Peck, as well as an interesting recent interview with Mary Badham.In the Two-Disc Special Edition the bonus features include an extensive interview with Gregory Peck, as well as a long documentary about the movie and its production. Almost the entire cast comments on different aspects of the film-making, including Philip Alford and Brock Peters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I always thought that "To Kill a Mockingbird" was nothing more than a court-drama. A predecessor of "A Time to Kill" if you like, however the movie turned out to be much more than a court-drama. The movie is truly about and told from the point of view of the children, growing up in the depression-era of the '30's in a small racial divided Alabama town.The story is told beautifully and takes it time to tell the story in a good suitable slow pace. The emotions of the movie are truly gripping and all have a very real, realistic feeling. The fact that the story is told through the eyes of a child makes it even more effective. All the scene's with the children feel very realistic and should bring back some childhood memories. The way their playing outside with each other should is especially recognizable.The movie has several subplots. The scene's with Atticus Finch and his defense of the black man who is accused of raping a white woman is one of them but the movie never looses its focus on Atticus his two children Jem and Scout who truly are the main characters of the movie. The children have to deal with the loss of their mother, their fears and prejudices. The way these things are handled make "To Kill a Mockingbird" a powerful and important movie.Gregory Peck is mostly excellent as the ordinary but yet highly admirable Atticus Finch, who besides his own personal problems and that as a lawyer also fights to hide the ugly things of the world for his children. Also really excellent were the child actors. Especially Mary Badham as Scout deeply impressed me. It's no wonder that the then 9/10 year old received an Oscar nomination. Peck received a nomination and unlike Bedham he also got the take the statue home with him. Other Oscar wins for this movie were Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Black-and-White and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium.Also of course worth mentioning is the very good musical score by Elmer Bernstein. This one is among his best work of his lifetime.Is there nothing wrong with this movie? Unfortunately yes, even though I still consider this a classic and one of the most memorable and impressive movies it is not a perfect one. It's obvious that this movie is based on a book and some typical book elements are present throughout the movie that don't really work out the way they're supposed to, such as the entire 'Boo' Radley (played by Robert Duvall, in his very first movie role!) story at the end of the movie. Also the whole 'Boo' Radley thing feels a bit old fashioned and perhaps a bit too over-the-top.A movie that you should experience at least once in your lifetime.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly, my all-time favorite film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...and I see a LOT of movies. There are so few films that transcend merely entertaining or provoking thought and actually make a difference to at least some people. To Kill a Mockingbird is one of them.When I look at movies, I frequently look at messages and values. A movie doesn't HAVE to have these (AIRPLANE! is also pretty high on my "all-time" list), but to be considered truly "great", I think there has to be some substance.Some of the messages in TKAM are fairly obvious: Jim Robinson's trial displays the ugliness of racism, and Boo Radley shows how easy it is to misjudge people and dismiss them. But there are more subtle, richer, messages as well: Atticus Finch doesn't just love his children, he respects them; Atticus also demonstrates by representing Jim Robinson that a good man isn't just "good" for some and not for others.The messages in the film--even the most obvious ones--are presented with an air of dignity and understatement, many through Gregory Peck's character of Atticus. The characters are believable (Jem and Scout rank among the most unaffected child performances ever captured on film), and they present a marvellously moving story.I consider myself a fairly sophisticated film-goer, and I have my favorites among foreign film, documentaries, action flicks, and even animation. But for me, To Kill a Mockingbird is like an old, dear friend due to its sincerity, and its charm.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a sin to destroy the music of loving kindness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD; 1962, ROBERT MULLIGAN (9 out of 10)The film deals with racial relations in the American South in the shadow of America's peculiar institution, about seventy years after its formal demise. It manages to condemn racial bigotry without being preachy or demonizing the victims of culturally instilled racism who are otherwise decent and reasonable people. The leading protagonist, Atticus Finch, played by Gregory Peck is a father of two (a young boy and a girl), a widower, an attorney and one of the town's most respected citizens, who defends a black man falsely accused of beating and raping a young, poverty-stricken white woman. At the trail it becomes obvious that the accused is innocent (indeed, that a rape did not even take place), and without directly accusing anyone, Atticus makes it abundantly clear to all who is truly responsible for beating the poor, illiterate woman.The background story is about a mysterious recluse who lives in the home next to Atticus', an obviously kindhearted and generous person who leaves gifts for Atticus' son to find in a rotted-out knot in a tree on the property. The story is sparsely narrated by Atticus' grown daughter in voiceover, so we only see her as a child as she describes her life, the people around her and the events that take place over a period of roughly seventeen months. Ironically, the little girl's older brother has the more prominent role in the story, and since it is he, not she, who is present at some of the story's most important happenings, we must assume that her brother later described these events to her when they were children.This is a story about the magic of small-town life in America and the sweet blessings of healthy familial love in the face of human nature's irrational tendency which drives people to fear and to envy those who are different than ourselves. It suggests that loving kindness is our only effective weapon against this dragon though the outcome is always uncertain; that we must be wise enough to see the world as it is and foolish enough to live our lives as if the world were something else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Farewell Atticus. You will be missed. Gregory Peck 1916-2003</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems sad when you think that all that is best in a man, personal integrity, nobility, generosity, tolerance, self-sacrifice for family and friends, a willingness to put one's entire reputation on the line for others, was never more eloquently expressed than in the pages of a book in the character of Atticus Finch in Harper Lees' To Kill A Mockingbird'. Sadder still because there was only one actor born to play him on the screen, who, like Atticus, embodied all those qualities in every characterization he brought to the screen. And that actor has gone. Whether he was a young priest struggling with ignorance and poverty in post war China in 'Keys to the Kingdom' (44). Become loving father to both his son and an orphaned fawn in the Florida wilds in 'The Yearling' (46) or an idealistic journalist out to single-handedly fight religious intolerance in 'Gentlemen's Agreement' (47). A tough as nails upper echelon flight commander expecting no less than perfection from his men in '12 O'Clock High' (49). Or at home with light comedy 'Roman Holiday' (53) and 'Designing Women' (56). Gregory Peck was spot on everytime. And it has been said of him that he was one of those rare talents incapable of giving a bad performance. He may have been the wrong choice for the part as his Captain Ahab was in John Huston's 'Moby Dick' (56). But even when he went over the top, it was always at the right pitch as in 'The Boys From Brazil' (72) or 'The Omen' (74). But it was his honest portrayal as Atticus Finch which will long be remembered. The everyman who became the voice of the American conscience at a time when the civil rights issue was weighing heavily on our minds. Sad because there will never be another character so uniquely American and so perfectly heroic in literature. Nor another actor capable of epitomizing Atticus with such tenacious force that is only found in the human spirit when the highest ideals we cherish are to be compromised. But, perhaps, that's not a reason to mourn. For each time we read Harper Lee's book we think of Gregory Peck, and, each time we view Peck's Oscar winning performance we think how accurately he came to Lee's indomitable Atticus. A fact recognized by the American Film Institute's tribute to the 100 all time greatest screen heroes with Atticus/Peck # 1 on the list. After all, how many of us will ever be able to say, 'now that's the way I wish to be remembered'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my favorite movie ever. I think we are all often greatly impacted by movies we see at a certain age. I was about 10 the first time I saw To Kill a Mockingbird (I had already read the book twice), and I have probably watched it 15 or so times since then. It is really 2 movies in 1. First, it is the story of Jem, Scout, Dill and their childhood in a small depression era southern town. Second, it the story of Atticus and Tom Robinson, and the relationship they developed during Tom's trial. The musical score by Elmer Bernstein is one of the most effective scores in developing the mood of the movie. If the scene near the end of the movie where Jem and Scout are walking home after a Halloween play at their school doesn't send chills up and down your spine, then you must have been de-sensitized by the packaged horror techniques of the modern horror flicks.Unfortunately, in this day of special effects and movie gimmicks, a movie like this will probably not have the same impact on an impressionable child like it did on me.

		<shortDescription>A MEMORABLE MOCKINGBIRD</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since its publication in 1960, Harper Lee's novel TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD has attained the status of a classic work of American Literature , and rightfully so. Winner of the 1961 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction , it has become one of the most beloved books of all time ; indeed, one survey has claimed the book's popularity as being second only to The Bible ! However open to question those statistics are, there is no denying the charm and power of Ms. Lee's prose in telling a story of the Depression Era South ( fictional Maycomb, a "tired old town" in Alabama.) I first read the novel in the Spring of "63, just prior to seeing the film version which was soon opening at my home town's local movie theater. As an impressionable 14 year old, I was hooked by the book's Southern Gothic atmosphere, which seemed strangely alien to a middle class High School freshman living in upstate New York. As narrated in the first person by Jean Louise Finch (nickname Scout) , TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is a remembrance of things past, at times humorous, often rueful and sometimes terrifying. It is also a memorial to Scout's father Atticus Finch, a middle aged trial lawyer who defends a local black man accused of raping a white woman. Scout's reminiscences cover alot of territory, and it is Harper Lee's special gift to be able to give the reader a succinct but substantial history of the Finch family tree, a short but important history of Maycomb County and its environs, and an evocative description of the Finch home and neighborhood surroundings. The novel's greatest achievement is giving voice to childhood joys and fears as delivered through the mind's eye of the older Scout , who sounds like a sophisticated, female variation of Huckleberry Finn ; older, wiser but possessing the charm, compassion and raillery of Twain's immortal character. And Lee's foray into Huck Finn territory is brilliantly displayed when Scout, her older brother Jem and friend Dill pursue the mystery of Boo Radley , a reclusive tenant who lives in the ramshackle house down the street. There's a bit of the Hardy Boys and Penrod on display here coupled with unnerving suspense, and a hint of the dangers that lurk just outside the imagined safe world of childhood. In adapting MOCKINGBIRD to the screen, veteran playwright Horton Foote was faced with the unenviable task of trying to preserve as closely as possible the outline of Lee's novel and to recreate as many memorable scenes and characters that had captivated an enormous reading public. This is usually a Herculean task, and right from the outset Foote started eliminating several characters and incidents in the book. Gone was Atticus's judgmental but well-meaning sister , Scout's Aunt Alexandra ; childhood friend Dill's Aunt Rachel was transformed into Aunt Stephanie , a more eccentric character to no doubt provide a little comic relief ; and Atticus's amiable brother Jack, an M.D. A striking sequence depicting a house fire was scratched, along with a memorable visit to Aunt Alexandra's house at Finch's Landing. What emerged on the screen was the basic story whittled down to it's most important elements : Atticus's decision to defend Tom Robinson , culminating in the trial itself ; and the childhood adventures of Scout, Jem and Dill and their obsession with the unseen Boo Radley. What is immediately obvious is that the film is not the book. There really is no substitute for Lee's indelible narrative. Scout's first person commentary is relegated to a few sparse musings, albeit expertly culled from the book. Since the narrative voice of Scout is basically missing, the movie is guided along by a more conventional story, and incidents that happen to and are observed by Scout (the great , often riotous classroom scenes) are mentioned as off stage happenings. However, the movie is a significant achievement and memorable in its own way. Producer Alan Pakula (who went on to become a topflight director), director Robert Mulligan and Mr. Foote have been faithful to the novel's essence. The screenplay includes the major plot points and retains as much of the original dialogue between characters as is possible in a film running a little over two hours. The stroke of genius in the production lies in the casting. Gregory Peck IS Atticus Finch. Not only does he fit the part like a glove ; he brings tremendous nuance to the role. It's a brilliant performance, one that speaks volumes even when the actor doesn't say a word. The inspiration continues in the roles of Atticus's children, superbly played by Philip Alford as Jem and Mary Badham as Scout. Badham's performance is particularly memorable. She beautifully captures Scout's tomboyish nature while exhibiting the tender qualities needed for her scenes with Atticus. Indeed, some of the movie's most unforgettable moments consist of father and daughter alone together. A scene where Atticus lets Scout handle his pocketwatch is indescribably moving, as is the subsequent bedtime dialogue between sister and brother concerning their deceased mother. As long as TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD stays rooted in the childrens' experience it remains a sublime entertainment. Unfortunately it hits a rough patch about halfway through when it comes to the trial scene, a crucial part of the story, but one the nearly undermines the steady filmic narrative that has gone before. In the novel Tom Robinson's trial is seen through Scout's literary eyes and ears. In the movie that voice is missing and we see Scout as part of the crowd in the balcony above, only when the camera decides to focus in that direction. As well acted as the trial sequence is, as beautifully as Gregory Peck conveys the earnestness and acuity of a smalltown defense attorney trying to save one man's life, the trial sequence stops the film dead in its tracks. Lasting a half hour in screen time , it is the film's one major caveat. And yet it is hard to figure what would have worked better. So much pertinent information is given here, the inherent prejudices of the townspeople , the underlying behavior of the witnesses on the stand : all crucial material. Once the trial ends the movie quickly gets back on its feet and as it draws towards its conclusion it becomes an unforgettable experience. One of the most beautifully lyrical and frightening scenes ever filmed is Scout and Jem's fateful nightime journey home through the woods. In a forest right out of Hansel and Gretel , the two children take their precarious steps in a moonlit shadowy landscape that rivals anything done by the great black and white cinematographers of the Silent Era. And then there is that magnificent ending, which I defy even the most hardened viewer not to feel a lump in the throat. When Mary Badham walks down that sidewalk for the last time on her way home,accompanied by composer Elmer Bernstein's haunting music score, you realize what kind of greatness motion pictures can achieve.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterful Adaption</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is one of the few based-on-book movies that actually manages to bring forth an accurate and true picture of the original story (To Kill A Mockingbird by Harper Lee). Too often, the adaption to film throws story elements far off track, loses touch with the author's deeper intimacy or skips key details. Not here. Because of the era this film was made in, there was no temptation to substitute story for technical wizardry.The child actors do well to hold up the bulk of such a strong film, and Gregory Peck's "Atticus" is amazingly genuine. The complex emotions and responses of the children are brought forth very well, considering that they could not be "described" as they were in the novel. The court scenes are also very powerful.If you enjoyed the book, don't be afraid that the film will not live up to your expectations - whilst this concept is usually true, here we have one of the exceptions.The film deals a lot with old American racism and prejudice. It is interesting to compare the methods used in this film to those of Mel Brook's "Blazing Saddles". Watch TKAMB, and expect to be challenged.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers to come...I cannot find a single fault with this movie. I have watched it many times and it never fails to hit all the right notes with me. The adaptation from the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Harper Lee is the best I've ever seen in a film; the spirit of the (equally flawless) book is caught perfectly in the film, and many sections of dialogue and narration are taken word-for-word. Just as with the book, you feel that you are in this town with these people, whom you have known all your life.The casting is serendipitous -- the two unknown children, playing what turned out to be the only major role in either career, fit their roles precisely in looks and manner and acted quite naturally. Gregory Peck has his best role ever (and that's saying quite a lot) as Atticus Finch, the principled lawyer and the father of the children. The supporting cast, from the town sheriff, to the accused rapist, to Calpurnia, the Finch's housekeeper, is equally excellent. The script and direction are perfect, and together with the outstanding Bernstein score, they produce just the right level of understated emotion -- the viewer responds emotionally and yet there's never that feeling of having been manipulated when the movie is over. Some memorable scenes which never fail to bring a lump to my throat:*when Atticus walks beneath the balcony and the minister tells Jem to "stand up, son, your father's passing."*the despair on the face of Tom Robinson (played to perfection by Brock Peters) during the courtroom scenes*Scout's "Hey, Boo," the final summation of all the terror and curiosity that she and her companions had built up around Boo Radley for their whole livesIf you've never seen it, watch it tonight. </fullReview>

Both made quite an impression.And I think Atticus Finch is a hero in his own modest way. A widower raising two kids, on his own, in such hard times, teaching them how to make "what's right", in spite of everybody's else opinion.You can feel how respected he is in Maycomb. Respected the same by the white and black communities, always a gentleman. How Reverend Sykes tells Scout to "stand up, because you father is passing" is so breathtaking. Even though he lost his case, and Tom Robinson had got a guilty verdict, although all the evidences showed he was an innocent man.And you can also feel his disappoint when he's told Tom was shot as trying to escape.I definitely think we'd live in a better world with more Atticuses in it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A flawless film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An absolutely marvelous interpretation of the novel, To Kill A Mockingbird is a classic. From the black and white photography ( lost art) to the perfect casting nothing is missing from this film.The movie opens with a child playing with different items: some carvings, a watch, some foil, and with this seemingly innocent beginning the viewer is caught up in a story that not only reflects Alabama of the 1930's, but the real issues with which we still struggle. The story and its theme are timeless.Casting is superb. Always impressive, Gregory Peck was born for the role of Atticus Finch. The children are perfect, and watch for a young Robert Duvall as the mysterious and touching Boo Radley.A beautifully made film which has long been at the top of my favorite movies list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film is better than I can present it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was happy to find a lot of positive comments about the film I value so high; nevertheless I think it's underestimated. Indeed, it's not only one of the greatest movies ever made, it's a movie which can not come out of date. I would disagree with `Smatysia' from Houston: `The heroic liberal fighting injustice' is a theme whose time has not yet passed. A number of prejudices still live and there are still `a lot of ugly things in this world '. Though such cases as described in the story are impossible nowadays, it's the reason not to forget that they were possible ones, but to be proud of the society's development. We must be very careful and try to understand people considering things from their point of view (`You never really knew a man until you stood in his shoes and walked around in them'). My words may seem naive, but the film does not. It's very intelligent movie without becoming preachy or otherwise sentimental. You come to understanding what is right or wrong simply by sympathizing with the heroes of the story. Furthermore, it's a wonderful example of educating children rightly. Gregory Peck creates a splendid image of Atticus Finch, honest, dignified and courageous lawyer as well as wise and tender father, who is able to explain anything. I can do otherwise but admire him. The scene in the court is especially powerful; it moves me every time I watch it. On the whole, the film is interesting and charming with masterful camera work and beautiful music. The scenery really gives you a sample of what life was like in Southern states during the Great Depression. Children actors are fantastically good. They are so natural, you feel as participating in their small adventures, fantasies, new experiences and impressions. I would recommend this film to all ? youngsters and adults. It's an unparalleled story about right way of living in the world and keeping your head high in spite of prejudices.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I have mixed emotions on the movie "To Kill A Mockingbird"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked the movie "To Kill A Mockingbird," it had very good acting, but there were many parts that were completely skipped over in the movie, but were covered in the book. For example, Mrs. Dubose appeared only once in the movie, but she had a large part in the book. Also, Calpurnia had a much larger role in the book than she did in the movie. Miss Maudie's fire was not mentioned at all in the movie. I know that it would probably take about 5 hours or more to cover everything that was covered in the book, but I think that the movie should have taken as long as it needed to include all of the parts that were in the book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a good film but it's hard to justify its claims to greatness. It deals with racism in simple terms, most of the whites are bigots and all the blacks are simple, honest and virtuous types. There are very few lines for the black actors (which is probably a symptom of when the film was made). What is commendable is the acting of the children. Their antics are all naturally believable and they run rings around Gregory Peck, the actual Oscar winner! The courtroom drama is effective but feels incomplete. It doesn't even bother to present the arguments of the prosecution. Watchable but slightly overrated.Overall 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>what is it that makes this film different and so much better then many other similar films? well first of all it has the great Atticus Finch (Gregory Pack) in it, who delivers an outstanding heroic and historic acting performance, that will make it hard for each and every one to stay indifferent to.second of all, after watching it it will be clear that it is not just one more film that comes to tell us a civil rights story in which the black person turns out to be the victim.in my opinion the whole Tom Robinson story in 'To Kill A Mockingbird' is only secondary.it is a good connection between the children and their fathers enemy that thanks to his attack the real mockingbird of the story is revealed.you can try for hours but trust me this is the only way in which a person like Atticus Finch could create himself a true enemy, by representing and protecting someone that is hated.with Tom Robinson being secondary we are left with the children being what makes this film so great.Jem, Dill and Scout that the whole film is narrated through her eyes.we get the summer adventures of those three children's childhood years and even if this doesn't sound too exciting it is just an extraordinary thing to watch.'To Kill A Mockingbird' is simply unforgettable, a film that will stick with you long after you finish watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A revolutionary film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is obvious from the opening credits that "To Kill a Mockingbird" is going to be a great film. Competing against David Lean's epic "Lawrence of Arabia" at the Oscars in 1962, "To Kill a Mockingbird" would have been guaranteed Best Picture if Lean's film hadn't been in the race that year.Gregory Peck gives his best performance as Atticus Finch, the southern lawyer who takes on the case of a black man accused of having raped a young white woman.Many town residents accuse Atticus of many things for defending a black man, and his children (Mary Badham and Phillip Alford as Scout and Jem) are even attacked at one point.This is not a happy movie, and in fact for its time it must have been rather bleak. The hero doesn't necessarily win; it is the opposite of the typical courtroom dramas where the protagonist lawyer proves the defendant is innocent and the real criminal is put in jail.Without giving away too much of the plot, suffice to say it's not quite so simple in "To Kill a Mockingbird." Not everything works out the way it should.The direction by Robert Mulligan perfectly evokes the era, mixing the racial intolerance with the peachy-clean familiarity of southern America. Peck's portrayal of Atticus was named by AFI as the #1 movie hero of all time. I don't necessarily agree with this, but it is one of the most memorable performances of all time and my personal favorite of Peck's.The supporting cast is excellent - Badham is very convincing and Robert Duvall in one of his early performances (I believe his screen debut, actually) as Boo Radley is effective also."To Kill a Mockingbird" is not the best film ever made and I do think some aspects of it have been overrated - I wouldn't say Atticus Finch is the best hero of all time nor would I say this is the most important film of the century, as some have named it. However, I do think it is a very well-made and effective film that manages to translate Harper Lee's story to the screen without losing its heart. It's a film that should be seen by everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my literature class in eight grade (I'm now a freshmen in high school) we read To Kill A Mockingbird by Harper Lee. I loved the book but I like the movie even more. The part I liked most of the movie was Gregory Peck's stellar performance as Atticus Finch. Peck really became Atticus for the role. I think this is Greg's best acting role. It really pays homage to the book. Also it is the first role for Robert Duval as Boo Radley. It is a simply fantastic film and deserved it's Oscar. A must see for kids and adults alike. It is a movie for any people of any ages, it deeply touches your heart and makes you want to be a better person. I highly suggest watching it</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To Kill A Mockingbird remains one of the best movies ever made. Although some liberties are taken with certain characters in the story, the movie continues to compliment the novel. As I read the book with my ninth grade students, the images of Atticus Finch, Scout, and Jim appear in my mind and my thoughts are associated with the actors in the movie. A then young novice, Robert Duval, becomes Boo Radley. The timely message of the novel and the important events that surround its conception make this movie a classic in every sense of the word. The trial of the Scottboro Boys comes to mind, and I can't help but think that Harper Lee reviewed the headlines and knew the story well. Certainly, we are all obligated to remember the details of that injustice in conjunction with the ever present lesson of To Kill A Mockingbird, "Injustice exists, and it is hopefully never forgotten or forgiven."</fullReview>

Mary Badham as Scout was the youngest nominated for an Oscar until Tatum O'Neal 11 years later and she's perfect, as is Phillip Alford as Jem and John Megna as Dill (based on Truman Capote). In fact, this is the best film ever portraying pre-teen children in any time frame. Brock Peters, Frank Overton, and James Anderson also give definitive performance.A 9 out of 10. Best performance = Gregory Peck. Great opening scene with music and wonderful debut by Robert Duvall as the haunting Boo Radley.

It has many good things: heavenly music, great black and white cinematography, likable young actors (who alas, did not have much of a career), noble purpose, pleasantly slow pacing. But all this does not coalesce into greatness. The drama is too overwrought, long-winded, and there is never any doubt who the good guy is. I especially disliked the courtroom scene with its histrionics revolving around a tawdry subject. It clashes with the film's overall dreamy lyricism. I tend to dislike films based on novels. Their dramatic shape is never quite right. Give me filmed plays anytime. I'm sad that John Megna died young and that there isn't more of him on screen. He had a poignancy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not just about racism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Almost all of the comments focus on the anti racist aspects of the film and honestly, when I read the description, I did not really like I wanted to see this film. But when it came on the TV, I stayed up late to see the movie and was deeply impressed by it. And here's a thought:It is not just about racism, it is about the morality of the people. The title refers to that it is a sin to kill a mockingbird, for those are beautiful creatures. In essence the film (as well as the book) is about the morality of Atticus Finch. You may consider him too idealized, but he is there to represent a morality, and as that he is necessary a stereotype. Furthermore, there is the popular morality and all sorts of private morality that linger through the film. Some examples:-Atticus reminds us: 'shoot all the blue jays I wanted - if I could hit 'em; but to remember it was a sin to kill a mockingbird' (Remember that Atticus is capable of doing quite much, but is not showing off. For instance, he is silent about his good shooting skills towards his children. That's because he has a sort of inner peace and does not need the outside world to really understand him.)-Scout: If you shouldn't be defending him, then why are you doing it?Atticus Finch: For a number of reasons. The main one is that if I didn't, I couldn't hold my head up in town. I couldn't even tell you or Jem not to do somethin' again. -Heck Tate: To my way of thinking', Mr. Finch, taking the one man who's done you and this town a great service an' draggin' him with his shy ways into the limelight-to me, that's a sin. It's a sin and I'm not about to have it on my head. If it was any other man it'd be different. But not this man, Mr. Finch.In the end, this movie is not about social issues, but about moral ones.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This bird don't sing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This much-praised movie is about a lawyer and his children living in a racially divisive South in the 1930s. Although the central theme concerns the lawyer defending a black man accused of raping a white woman, much of the film is devoted to the exploits of the children as they play games and make trouble. Therein lies the problem. Watching the children at play is only mildly interesting. The focus shifts to the rape trial for a while and then its back to the children and a weird neighbor (Duvall), who seems to be from another movie. The film is poorly constructed, lacking focus. Peck is good as Finch, who is portrayed as a decent fellow but certainly not the greatest hero in American cinema as AFI would have us believe. Considering its reputation, a very disappointing film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine child acting, poor direction and story. Extremely Overrated.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I start my explanation of the above statements, I would like to comment that I am an avid Gregory Peck fan and I have also found his work to be of exceptional quality. This movie is no exception. I have also read Harper Lee's novel of the same name and found it to succeed in every area and every issue that it was trying to portray. Unfortunately, this success did not transfer to film, even with Mr. Peck and a cast of exceptionally talented child-actors. Every aspect of the film, with the exception of Mr. Peck and the children, is lacking, misguided, and often tries to pull at the heartstrings of early 1960's viewers with lame set-ups and other devices used to show one side and one man as being absolutely unerring and without vice. The movie takes a while to develop and for the first half-hour focuses primarily on the children. The children do rather everyday things and converse with each other about nothing of consequence on the film. They finally decide to explore a "haunted house" to see the "maniac" that lives within it. While I felt that this avenue might lead somewhere, nothing of any consequence, albeit a small meeting with the maniac at the end of the film, came of this rather long and drawn out plot line. Next, we see that Mr. Peck, who portrays a compassionate, strong father and lawyer, is assigned to defend a black man who has supposedly committed a rape of a white female. Subsequent to this, there is never any conversation among Peck and the defendant, no evidence discussed prior to trial, and no real character development of the defendant and even to a larger extent Mr. Peck. We then see a few scattered scenes of the ultra-racist and completely ignorant father-of-the-victim, who tries his best to cause trouble and say dirty things to black people. Though he is shown as mean and stupid, he doesn't do anything particularly characteristic of an enraged racist father, he merely calls Mr. Peck a "ni$%er lover " and spits a lot. You will notice that he is not even with the angry mob that tells Mr. Peck to hand over the prisoner so that they can lynch him. Finally, we arrive at a trial, where it is unbelievable that this case would have even gone to trial based on certain obvious fact that you will see in the movie. In trying to say any more directly involving the film's plot, I would be spoiling the movie for you, but suffice it to say, if Mr. Peck were not in this film and did not give such a rousing courtroom speech, this movie would have been forgotten long ago. The direction is poor and uneven, plot tangents go untouched or under-developed, and many of the characters and actors seem rather silly. Instead of achieving what the book did in terms of portraying racism in the Depression South and the intriguing stories of the children, the film manages to seem poorly done, even cheap, and the child actors's obvious talents go to waste on dead end plot lines. Even the costuming seems badly done. You will notice that all of the whites wear overalls, while the "enlightened" Mr. Peck and a handful of kind blacks wear suits. In closing instead of being a thoughtful and poignant depiction of racism in the South, it seems contrived. My recommendation is to avoid this unless you are an avid Gregory Peck fan and read the novel. But if you really want to watch a movie close to this subject that is done well, try In the Heat of the Night or any number of Sidney Portier's films. 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fairly engaging, just a rather old movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To Kill A Mockingbird was fairly engaging considering it was a movie that was shot in the 1960s. Although I will say that it does start off rather slow but right around when Tom Robinson's court case starts the movie starts to pick up and become a more interesting movie. Another good thing about this movie is that other than skipping a few parts it was a lot like the book that was written and the book was very well done as well. I think the only weakness of this movie is that it was shot in the 1960s so being so old the acting isn't always as great and it was in black and white which can also be less appealing to some people, mainly teenagers that haven't been exposed to black and white movies and might not like them as much. All in all, it was a pretty solid movie, Gregory Peck did a very good job acting as Atticus Finch, although the rest of the acting wasn't that great but that wasn't all that relevant because Atticus was really the main guy to watch in the movie. I'd say give it a watch unless you aren't interested in black and white or old movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on Harper Lee's Pulitzer Prize winning book, Scout (Mary Badham) is a 6 year old girl living in Maycomb, Alabama during the 1930s. It's a tired old town life with his lawyer father Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck) and his little brother Jem. Then Atticus takes a case to defend a black man Tom Robinson accused of raping a white teen girl Mayella Ewell. It sends the town into a frenzy which only Atticus and the innocence of Scout are able to withstand.It's an American classic. Gregory Peck exudes stature, compassion and dignity. It takes an important book and honors it with an impressive film. The trick of the movie is to look at the issue of race through the eyes of Scout. It also features Robert Duvall as the iconic Boo Radley. There is one point in the movie after the trial is over that always gets me. As Atticus walks out of the courtroom, all the blacks in the balcony stand up. Reverend Sykes tells Scout to stand. "Miss Jean Louise. Miss Jean Louise, stand up. Your father's passing." There is something so poignant and so overwhelming about that moment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Impactful, Thought Provoking Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"To Kill a Mockingbird" is considered by many as one of the greatest and most life changing films of all time, and for good reason. This classic film has left a lasting impact on audiences for several decades, and will continue to do so for several more decades. But what is it about this movie that makes it so special? The answer to this question lies in the memorable characters and thought provoking story.The characters of "To Kill a Mockingbird" are some of the most beloved characters in the history of cinema. Gregory Peck gives an incredible Oscar winning performance as Atticus Finch, a lawyer who decides to defend an African American man he believes to be unjustly charged with a crime due to racial prejudice. Atticus Finch has been called the "Greatest Movie Hero of All Time" by the American Film Institute, and it is obvious why. Atticus not only makes a stand against discrimination at a time when racism was common, but he is arguably the greatest father figure in movie history as well. This is Peck's most iconic role of his career and he pulls it off brilliantly.The same can be said about the performances of both Mary Bedham and Phillip Alford as Scout and Jem Finch, Atticus' children. These two actors gave some of the best and most believable performances I have ever seen from child actors. When watching the film, I did not see child actors playing roles, I saw real children because of the way Bedham and Alford encompassed the mannerisms and speech you see from real children. This adds so much to the film as a majority of the story is presented to the audience from the perspective of Scout Finch. And Robert Duvall's performance? Talk about a performance that leaves an impact! What I personally love about "To Kill A Mockingbird" is that while the film does tackle the issue of racism, it offers so much more. Any film can throw a simplistic "Racism is bad" message at an audience, but "To Kill a Mockingbird" decides to show an innocent and naive child's perspective of her father's stand against prejudice and the intense opposition it brings. The audience grows and learns alongside Scout as she watches Atticus hold firm to what he believes in, despite the fact that many of his peers hate him for it.The pure and real relationship Atticus has with both of his children adds so much to the film as well. A specific scene in which Atticus is tucking Scout in is one of the most intimate and believable scenes between a parent and a child I have ever seen on film. I could have sworn Gregory Peck was Mary Bedham's actual father because of how amazing their chemistry was. Yeah, it is that good."To Kill A Mockingbird" is a timeless classic that absolutely must be seen by everyone at some point in their lives. No film has ever made such an impact on me on such a personal level. That combined with excellent film making is why "To Kill a Mockingbird" is my favorite film of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A timeless classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"To Kill a Mockingbird" is one of my favorite novels and I always enjoy watching a movie right after I read the novel in which the movie was based on. This film did the book justice, which is a story about Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck), a lawyer in 1930s South who defends black man Tom Robinson (Brock Peters) against an undeserved rape charge, and teaches his children, Scout and Jem (Mary Badham and Philip Alford), to go against prejudice.All the actors did great in their roles, delivering solid and brilliant on-screen drama that captures the tension of the still-segregated south, the innocence of the children, the perseverance of Atticus Finch and the mystery of the Boo Radley character (Robert Duvall). The plot goes at a pretty fast-paced, with only the courtroom scene dragging on and on, which might dissuade the audience' attention and can get boring at times. Other than that, this is a suspenseful film, with the scenes of Scout and Jem trying to be fearless in investigating Boo Radley's creepy house being one of the most exciting scenes. And, hands down to Gregory Peck for delivering one I think is one of the most iconic and greatest roles in cinema history.The movie will capture the hearts of many, remaining a classic that had still well over the the test of time.Grade A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'It's a sin to kill a mockingbird, since all they do is sing for us.'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the classic films of its time, and its subject is as valid now as it was then. It is based upon the famous novel by Harper Lee describing her childhood in Monroeville, Alabamba, in 1932, when people were still reeling from the Great Depression and racial tensions were at their height. This film came out at the time of the civil rights marches and it thus became a beacon of the liberal movement. Gregory Peck, solid as a rock, perfectly plays the heroic local lawyer named Atticus Finch. People often wonder about the name. It has nothing to do with Attica in Greece (the region of Athens). In the old Confederacy, there was a tremendous admiration for classical learning, and people were often given Greek or Latin names of famous classical figures, in the same way that they were often named after George Washington. It was a tradition of the Old South. Atticus was the best friend of Cicero, the ancient Roman author and orator, and a very large number of personal letters between Atticus and Cicero survive, so that Atticus is very famous to classical scholars. And that is the origin of the name. The character is modelled on Amasa Lee, Harper Lee's father, who defended a black client in 1923, as IMDb Trivia informs us. This is certainly one of the most famous films made by the magical partnership of Robert Mulligan, director, and Alan Pakula, producer. I never met Mulligan. But I met Pakula a few times. I once asked him directly why he had taken so long to get around to directing but had spent so many years producing instead. He admitted that he was shy and hesitant about it, that although he had always wanted to direct from the very beginning, he was a slow starter. It was easier to let Mulligan go on directing, while Pakula could stand back and produce and learn more about the craft of directing by watching Mulligan do it. This shows what a quiet, modest and unegotistical man Pakula really was. One of the famous and spectacular performances in this film is of course that of the child actress Mary Badham as 'Scout'. She was nominated for an Oscar. So was Peck, and he won his. Mary Badham's swan song on screen was probably her finest performance ever, four years after this, in the stunningly brilliant film THIS PROPERTY IS CONDEMNED (1966, see my review), a film everybody should see, written by Tennessee Williams. One of the interesting aspects of MOCKINGBIRD today is to see all the children of the town wandering round 'free-range' without any adult supervision or concern. That is what life used to be like. We should all take note of this, because we now live in such a degraded and decadent era when everyone is in a permanent state of cowardly terror about everything. Nowadays, children are being raised indoors like hothouse plants. No wonder they are all allergic to everything, as they are never allowed outside their hermetically-sealed bubbles to gain any immunities. They are being programmed to be fearful of all strangers. Imagine what kind of societies will exist when they all grow up and are so terrified of one another that they cannot cooperate or even talk to one another. The future public is being 'atomised' into cloned 'loners'. They are the ones who go and shoot their friends at school, by the way, because they have been turned into pathological narcissists to whom other people do not exist in any real sense, any more than, say, those pop-up people they 'kill' all day long in their computer games. Yes, we are creating a psychopathic world, and it is time somebody said it. This film makes a timely antidote to the imaginary fears at which we all tremble today, and focuses us instead on genuine social problems to do with prejudice. I daresay, racism has not really diminished at all, it has merely gone underground, because people no longer feel comfortable displaying their prejudices, but conceal them. Racism is part of animal behaviour. After all, rival tribes of chimps don't like each other, and small differences of appearance in humans arouse hysteria. It is not for no reason that people who don't fit in are called 'black sheep'. However, growing up as a species and overcoming prejudice is not being facilitated by the Age of Terror in which we now live, it is making things worse. The story told in this film is too well known to need any repeating by me, that is for sure. But how many people like Atticus exist now? I suspect the time is coming when there will be none at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best courtroom drama ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A courtroom drama is a courtroom drama,but you would be hard pressed to find one better than this classic.It is well played from top to bottom.We were on the doorstep of the Civil Rights movement in the early 60's when this film was produced and released,and it no doubt helped move things along in the cause.Gregory Peck is in the top of his form as Atticus Finch,and he is supported well,particularly by Brock Peters as the wrongly accused Tom Robinson,and young Mary Badham as Scout.It's a pity we didn't see her more often in more roles.Just my opinion,but this is quite simply the best courtroom drama ever made.A must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1962. If you read the book or see the movie today, you HAVE to remember that this story was written in a time where the issues covered by this story were not just controversial, but nuclear in their heat. The characters depicted (outside of Atticus Finch and his kids) were not stereotypes, but the mainstream. Harper Lee's story and Horton Foote's adaptation are miraculous. The acting is superb. The subtlety of the scenes, awesome. Citizen Kane, Casablanca, are great movies, but To Kill a Mockingbird transcends all. PLEASE put your mind in that time before you watch this movie and you will see how great it really is. OK, that covers the trial, but then you get to the heart of the story and how Scout brings the innocence we are all born with into fruition. She tells us that Mr. Cunningham and all of us that wander astray can be redeemed. This isn't a story with one aim, this is a masterpiece that brings all things right. There is good in this world and all involved with this production believed that. YOU need to see this movie and believe that, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Film on So Many Levels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To Kill a Mockingbird (1962)**** (out of 4) Robert Mulligan's tender, touching and powerful adaptation of Harper Lee's novel has Gregory Peck playing Atticus Finch in his Oscar-winning role. The film centers on Finch's two youngest children over a years time as they learn some hard truths about life in the South through their lawyer father. I've heard a few naysayers call this film too cute and too sentimental for its own good but I really couldn't disagree more. TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, some people tend to forget, is told through the eyes of the children and its basically one woman's look back at her childhood so the sentimental aspect was certainly needed. I really can't add anything that hasn't already been said about this film but it's certainly one of the greatest ever made and contains some downright magical moments that still work after fifty-years. Of course there's the major view at the racial tensions of the trial that Atticus is involved in and I think this entire sequence has some of the most brutal and dramatic moments that you'll see from any movie. The heartbreaking climax to this portion of the film just grows darker with what follows but then we have a rather remarkable and uplifting ending that speaks so much. Peck rightfully deserved the Oscar and it's neat to see that he's basically just a supporting character for the first 100-minutes or so. However, whenever he's on screen the power of the performance is just undeniable and especially when he doesn't even say a word. Of course, when he does speak he really nails every emotion that the film called for. Brock Peters and James Anderson are chilling in their roles as is a quickly seen Robert Duvall. Mary Badham and Philip Alford are also excellent in their parts as the children. TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is a film that works so strongly on so many levels that it's easy to call it a timeless classic. The film still packs the punches that it did on its original release and I'm sure these will still be lasting a hundred years from now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>best court room drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on Harper Lee's novel of the same name, to kill a mockingbird is ranked the best courtroom by the American Film Institute (AFI), and the protagonist Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck) is ranked number 1 in AFI's 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains.This drama will both inspire you and teach you, it makes you feel all the warmth you have missed over the years of CGI technology. Adding to this movie is the cast of children, whose plain naivety makes the movie a whole lot better.Set in the time where being black was a cause of concern. To kill a mockingbird tells the story of a man Atticus Finch and his kids during a 3 summer period. The story arc spans over 3 years about how Atticus kids Jem (Philip Alford) and Scout (Mary Badham) go through each summer with heartwarming adventures.Their story is wrapped round the case in which Atticus was defending a black man who is being held on rape charge.Guilty or not Atticus defends this man with all that he has in his kitty.The movies screenplay/script is something that you will be able to relate too, making the movie hit home in the first 10 minutes.Directing also was top notch as it all plays well.The script's lose end for me is the character Boo, who in some way I didn't get his full involvement in the movie as the director may have skipped some parts making us understand much of his liking to the kids.Phillip Alford did not initially want to audition for the part. However, when his mother informed him that he would miss a half day of school, he immediately decided to go after all.To say not to watch this movie is like telling you to skip breakfast.www.lagsreviews.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best example in the history of cinema where the plot and screenplay really doesn't matter at all. The movie doesn't let you down at any moment. The kids play their roles in such a way which couldn't be be expressed in words Just brilliant. The movie is narrated by Scout daughter of Atticus about her childhood days in spring spent with her brother jean and dell (her aunts son).Atticus takes up a Afro-American Tom Robinson case who is claimed to have raped Mr. Ewell's wife. Atticus has stand against his own people to save Tom Robinson whom he believes to be innocent. Scout is a little girl who spends most of her time with her brother and Dell.They come across BOO Radley a neighbor a series of events take place (just watch and enjoy don't spoil the fun).3D AND IMAX is the trend today but it only makes a bad movie look worse. No technology can replace the talent of pure acting.If you like to watch a movie which will make smile, think and in some parts thrilling then this is the perfect movie for you. It is a perfect family movie with a lesson and also entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The American Classic That's As Good As You've Heard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I shouldn't have to tell you that To Kill A Mocking Bird is considered to be one of the greatest films ever to be made. I shouldn't have to inform you that this film is based off of the book by the same name, which is met with an equal amount of praise. But what I say now is important: This film is certainly worthy of all the praise. To Kill A Mocking Bird is based off of Harper Lee's book by the same name. It's about a young girl named Scout, and her older brother Jem, and their puny friend, Dill. Scout's father, Atticus (Gregory Peck) takes a case to defend a black man named Tom Robinson, who is charged of raping a white woman. That's really all there is to it. It's a simple tale, but an affecting one. One of the best parts of the film, is the title sequence: A skillfully edited opening displaying wonderful cinematography and a beautiful score. During the title sequence, we see Scout, rummaging through a box of play things. She hums an eerie tune as she doodles with crams, creating a magical opening sequence with a slight creepy tinge. The acting is wonderful. Some of the best I've seen. The kids are very lovable (though Dill may take some getting used to), and Gregory Peck's performance as Atticus, is strong, though I still don't believe it's good enough to win an award (though it did). People say it's an understated performance, but that doesn't change my mind. Peck did well, but not award-winningly well. I briefly mentioned the score, and I will mention it again. It is composed by Elmer Bernstein. The music captures the innocence and wonder of being a child, and accents and punctuates the film's main feel. The score emphasizes on the piano, with good use of the flute, and good use of the violin later on. Towards the end, Bernstein appears to have a fancy for harmonicas, which he utilizes well. To Kill A Mocking Bird's score is one of the best scores I've ever seen. Don't miss it. The film has an innocent, child-like feel, but when Tom Robinson's trial starts, that innocence goes away. It returns, and strongly too, during Scout and Jem's Halloween walk back home. As I mentioned before, the music does wonders for capturing that feeling. The movie is not extremely faithful to the book, however. It keeps the main points, but many things are changed or altered. Most of the character's roles are shrunken, and some characters have been omitted all together. Much of the humor from the book came from the narrating, but without a narrator, much of that humor is lost. Also, the book took it's time with everything. The film is odd, in the way that it is over two hours long, yet it doesn't feel very long. But at the same time, the events go by much quicker in the movie then in the book, but the movie doesn't feel rushed. It retains that laid back feeling. To Kill A Mocking Bird still has humor and charm, but not quite as much as the book. I am not going to lower the score of the film due to the differences between the book and film, but I do want to point it out. There are many characters who didn't get enough screen time, however, and in the book, it wasn't like that. But I digress. In an odd way, To Kill A Mocking Bird (the film, not the book), reminded me of the film adaption of Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events. I very much enjoyed the book series, but it didn't work as a movie. Too much humor is in the narrative, so a lot of humor didn't translate well. Also, the film rushed many of the events, and changed things quite a bit. To Kill A Mocking Bird is very similar in all these respects, but the difference is this: To Kill A Mocking Bird works. Even if To Kill A Mocking Bird doesn't give some of the characters enough screen time, this film is certainly worthy of the praise it has received. Wonderful acting, an incredible musical score, and a meaningful story are only a small segment of what makes To Kill A Mockingbird the masterpiece it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High drama.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this in a drama class, and learned a great deal about story structure and theme, as well as performance presentation. But, beyond all the technical tidbits we were supposed to pick up, it was a compelling story about another time and another place.I was raised in a very egalitarian household and environment. I would hear high ranking bureaucrats comment on societies ills, and what social problems were ailing what populations. Things like blight, social strife, racism, inequality among the sexes, were all ailments of society. "To Kill a Mockingbird" shows us some of those facets in the deep south circa late 40s, early 50s. We see populations not so much at odds with one another, but desiring to keep a certain degree of conformity. And amidst this is a paragon of principle, Atticus Finch. A lawyer from the old school of taking a public trust to defend those in need, like a social knight, a paladin with the soul of mankind as his coat of arms emblazoned on his shield.But no sword or shield can protect all from the anger that boils under those who have nothing but one thing in common with "their betters" (to borrow from the language of the time; e.g. their skin color. And so an old twisted and perverted social code mislabeled and sham-ably so as "southern chivalry", is code for disliking another human being for superficial traits.Atticus bears the soul of the town, and acts as a stop gap to mayhem when he can, trying to shine light on the mid 1900s US equivalent of the European Dark Ages; ignorance and fear residing in all but the most stalwart of hearts. We have Atticuk's children; Scout and Jem, representing the newer and younger generation who are the offspring of this paladin. They are the innocents who see the injustices and see their father do battle with those whose social morays are skewed to privilege. To them it's an adventure. To their father, it is a struggle; a battle against a kind of scaly serpent that knows only survival.To the maid and townsfolk, it is a battle royale, referencing the imagery I just stated. What will rule? The unspoken law, one that no one dares codify in any book, or the principle that which the written law was designed and engineered to uphold, like a charger bearing a man at arms. They are divided. The meek understand the power of the strong, and rely on the social contract founded by the framers of the nation some two-hundred years before. It is a simpler time for simpler ideas. Called "the old South" people are mostly civil to one another. Race is not a factor until conflict rears its head, then lines are drawn, and factions are segmented. But not everyone is so sided in such a schism. There are simple folk who care for others. There are opportunists who seek to operate within the rules of law, but seek their own goal, as per William Windom (known to me as Commodore Decker from the Doomsday Machine episode from Star Trek). We have the man suffering from addiction who holds the biggest secret of them all. And the innocent on both sides of the social divide who are recruited by their own weakness to resist being dragged into a fight that's not theirs.We have a mixture of simple and meager with the wise and relatively affluent. We see the social mingle of various people, and how that is challenged by base instinct. That's what this film is all about.It's high drama. Can we as a species not embrace our warmth for other living creatures and men, or does our inner reptile gnaw at our desires so much to the point of overcoming higher reasoning? And how will the next generation be impressed b this? And for all those high minded notions, how can a simple minded human show us what we truly value?Okay, all of that is pretty heady stuff, but those are the themes that energize and thusly force the story to glow. We're seeing a slice of life of the old south; good and bad. It's a microcosm of America; good and bad; ugly and beautiful all at once. It's a part of America that we don't see a great deal of because there's a kind of shameful beauty there. It's one that's actually universal, but has a unique American flavor to it.Finally, the film is mostly of all simply about memories. Technical notes; the camera work is classic here. The opening sequence is something right out of a 70s or 80s sequence. A confluence of shots that was ahead of its time. The dolly and crane shots are also basic, as are most of the setups. And the sound does not dominate the image. Everything is as like a well balanced Japanese rice paper painting. A kind of basic structure with great composition.A good film.Enjoy.</fullReview>

I have nothing really bad to say on this film.It grieves me to know that in fact the book in its entirety was not filmed and the cuts do not survive only a picture or two of the missing scenes. True book fans would lower the rating for this. I think the movie can stand up without the scenes... So did Margret.Lets be truthful..... Story is a 10, cinematography is a 10, acting is a 10, screenplay adaptation is a 9.899, credits are a 10 (very unusual), music is a 10. Anything else is nick picking.Thats my Mennonite Perspective.....A few notes of change: - Calpurnia taking the children to her church was cut.... - Miss Maudie and Miss Rachel were combined into one character..... Mrs, Debose's death scene was cut.... A character Aunt was left out of the film (Not as Bad as leaving a child out of Gone With The Wind)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Atticus Finch, an honourable man!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best part about this movie is Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch. Such a character! Never does he move an inch from what he stands for, what he believes in, and that is justice! He is amazing in the courtroom, with his children and when coping with everything and everyone. Atticus Finch does it all right, he knows exactly how to behave in every situation. His character alone makes this movie worth seeing.The movie starts with portraying the daily life of Atticus's two children, Jem and Scout, as they run around the neighbourhood mainly daring each other to get as near as possible to the house of a town original. They are two ordinary kids of 10 and 6, most often doing exactly the opposite of what they're told. Sometimes it's amusing watching them do their mischief, but what amused me most was the fact that they always called their dad "Atticus" and not "dad". It made me chuckle more than once.The plot thickens when Finch takes the case of defending Tom Robinson, a black man, from having allegedly raped a white girl. Atticus gets VERY unpopular for taking the case, and even has to sit outside the prison guarding Robinson the night before trial so that the men of the town won't come and shoot the man. From here on comes one powerful scene after another with Atticus Finch's power in front.This movie values equality, justice and strength of character. It shows very clear, yes like many other movies but still, the dreadful injustice racism can give, and has given so many times. Along with Peck's flawless performance, Brock Peters, James Anderson and all the kids also does superb acting. Absolutely worth seeing. 8,5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To Kill a Mockingbird started as a book, and when I read it, I didn't understand what the heck I was reading. It got confusing at some points, and I got mixed up with all the characters. When I saw the movie, I really enjoyed watching it, the acting the amazing for two little kids, and it really affected the deep plot of the story. The portrayal of the two kids showed the audience that these were two little, innocent kids who lived in a world much bigger and more complex than it should be for any kid. Atticus Finch, the dad, a troubled lawyer, who defended people, was no help to the kids, but moved the story along with lots of events. Racism is also portrayed here, involving hate crimes and other racist remarks and actions. Then there's the mysterious and "frightening" neighbors the kids are so curious of. He lives all alone in his old house, and they find out what's going on in there. Like all children, kids are curious of everything and will do anything to find their answers to their dangerous and innocent questions. The cinematography for the film also made it more relaxing, and the story line moved well after the beginning. The beginning goes a little slow, but not enough, hopefully to put you to sleep. To Kill A Mockingbird is probably one of the most important films of all time, because of the plot, acting and it's moral, that teaches all viewers and valuable lesson in life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"To kill a mockingbird" as envisioned by Mr R.Mulligan is an exploration of fear and courage. We are given the indicator early on when,in introducing the characters in voice-over,the grown - up Scout says"We had been told that the only thing we had to fear was fear itself",a quote from an early Roosevelt broadcast. She and her brother Jem fear Boo Radley,a vulnerable neighbour whose father's idea of care in the community to is lock him in the cellar beneath the courthouse. Radley is widely thought to be mad,bad and dangerous to know and despite - or because of this Scout,Jem and their friend Bill go to his near - derelict house and bang on the wall. They are not fearless,quite the opposite;but there is no courage without fear. Their father,Atticus,a widower and pacifist lawyer,is a wise and influential presence in their lives. When he is called upon by the sheriff to shoot a rabid dog,the children are surprised at his skill with a rifle because of his anti - gun stance. Atticus is asked to defend a poor black labourer up on a rape charge and it is soon clear that his decision to take the case on has divided the community,with the poor whites,who hate and fear the blacks,siding against him. The alleged victim clearly fears admitting to her father that in fact she made a move on the man against his will because he was lonely and frustrated. hen the suspect is arrested the sheriff fears a lynch - mob will storm the jail and,armed only with a book,Atticus sits on the porch keeping guard. The three young friends,against his orders,visit the jail and Scout's courage shames the mob gathering outside and they make their way home. Despite clear evidence to the contrary,the defendant is found guilty - to the obvious exasperation of the judge,and whilst waiting transportation to the city jail he breaks free fearing for his life if kept in custody,and is shot dead. Later Aticus's children are murderously attacked by the alleged life-long beliefs.Atticus Finch,slowly and carefully played by Mr G.Peck,is an omnipotent figure in his children's lives. Wise,calm,shrewd and protective,he is everything we would like a father to be.A man of old - fashioned Southern courtesy,he is stubborn and courageous,well - respected in the small town where he lives.The sort of man Norman Rockwell loved to depict sitting in a leather - backed rocking - chair in a wood - panelled office,looking benignly at at spit - licked spiky - haired little boy. His son and daughter are on the thoughtful side of the "gee whizz" All - American brother and tomboy sister school,that quite possibly went out with the demise of the picket fence and auto- tyre swing. The voice - over by Miss Kim Stanley is one of the film's highlights. highlights,mellow and loving,nostalgic but not regretful.It is her brother's keepsakes box that forms the basis of the quite brilliant Saul Bass title sequence,the contents shot in extreme close up,needle - sharp with wonderful use of differential focus. Atticus Finch and his children will live long in your memory, as they have in mine since I first saw "To kill a mockingbird" over fifty years ago.</fullReview>

The kids also tries to have a look a Arthur 'Boo' Radley, who is known to stay at his house without ever coming out.Some scenes were not in the movie that were in the book, which made me disappointed. I know people say that the movie is never exactly like the book but there were really rushing things. It felt like a short movie.Although it has some flaws, I would like to say there were some memorable scenes and great portrayal of the characters in the book. One memorable scene is the court scene, of course. That's the scene where Atticus Finch, Gregory Peck, makes his famous speech.The acting by Gregory Peck is fantastic winning him an Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role. Others like Mary Badham and Phillip Alford are believable, which I really find useless in the book and in the film. Well, perhaps they were to make the film not so dark.This film is fantastic, with great acting but has its flaws. Still, it's one of the best movies and should be seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Man's courage to fight injustice and racial prejudice in a dignified manner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To Kill a Mockingbird, in my opinion, is and will always be one of Hollywood's best productions about social injustice and racial prejudice as well as man's courage to cure and fight against those social ills in a dignified manner. Hence it is a must-see movie.The film, based on Harper Lee's novel of the same name, shot in black and white and released in 1962, opens with scenery of a small "nowhere to go and nothing to buy" town in Alabama. Yet in this sleepy town there lives a white and good-hearted lawyer who not only faithfully adheres to the principles of human rights and social justice but also dares to fight against bigots while defending the noble cause he believes in. He stands invincibly despite mockery and threats.The lawyer, Atticus Finch (played by Gregory Peck), is assigned to defend a black man accused of raping a white woman. During the trial, Atticus establishes an important piece of evidence that the accused Tom Robinson (Brock Peters) is innocent. He shows the jury that Tom's left hand is incapacitated. Earlier in the trial, Sheriff Tate has testified that he saw bruises on the woman right neck after the incident was reported to him, indicating that the attacker must have been a left-handed person. That person is none other than the woman's own father who often mistreats her when he gets drunk.Peck's portrayal as a serious and professional lawyer as well as a widower and loving father is superb. Compared with The Paradine Case, another courtroom drama also starred by Peck who plays the role of a defense attorney of a woman suspected of murder, his performance in To Kill a Mockingbird is far better and more convincing. Understandably that Peck won the 1962 Oscar for Best Actor for his role as Atticus.Good acting is also demonstrated by then child actors Mary Badham and Philip Alford, respectively playing the role of Scout and Jem, Atticus's children who stand tall by their father's side. Indeed, their acting in the film is down-to-earth and captivating.Besides pointing out that prejudice against anyone is wrong and intolerable, the film ? directed by Robert Mulligan and adapted to the screenplay by Horton Foote ? also affirms the importance of understanding and tender feeling in building up human relations. The best example for this is the scene that depicts how Boo Radley (played by then unknown Robert Duvall), considered by the townspeople as a half monster, turns out to be a kind-hearted man who saves Scout and Jem from being harassed by the woman's father who strongly opposes Atticus's undertaking.Lee earned the 1961 Pulitzer Prize for her fiction, and although To Kill a Mockingbird is her only novel, it nevertheless became a best-seller not long after its publication. The novel, I believe, is a literary gem and worth reading ? Oei Eng Goan (enggoano@indosat.net.id) Jakarta, Indonesia</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert Mulligan's 1962 film, with screenplay by Horton Foote, is based on the novel by Harper Lee.Set in the Winston county, Alabama in the 1940's, the story is told from the perspective of a teenage girl, Scout Finch (Mary Badham), who is trying to make sense of the world outside her family home, and the behaviour of the people within it.Small town lawyer Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck), takes on the unpopular and difficult task of defending black labourer Tom Robinson (Brock Adams) who stands accused of raping Mayella Ewell (Collin Wilcox), the daughter of white farmer Robert Ewell (James Anderson).During the course of the trial we get to know both the locality in which Scout finds herself growing up and can't help but become deeply involved in the tense courtroom drama as Atticus seeks to uncover the truth in his efforts to defend his underprivileged client.As the story unfolds and the underlying racial tension builds, we suddenly find ourselves virtually members of the jury and residents of Maycomb.This film is a powerful memoir of childhood in this difficult part of the world. Through the way the story is told, we are both led - child-like - through the obvious injustice and yet we have the special, informal counsel of the defence lawyer expressed in ways that we cannot fail to grasp.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the greatest movie ever made based on the greatest book ever written. I was 16 and convinced by JFK and Camelot that we could change the world. I read the book over and over until it fell apart and then I bought a new one.We changed the world and then came Vietnam and Nixon. Now we have Bush and Iraq.I can only hope I was more like Atticus Finch as a father than George Bush.We can only hope that someone like Atticus and JFK will come along again. This I pray for my children.There were and continue to be brave men like Atticus Finch who reject the common thinking. I hope I have led my life in a way that would make them all proud.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To Kill a Mockingbird is a 1960 novel by Harper Lee, which won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1961. It was made into an Academy Award-winning motion picture starring Gregory Peck by director Robert Mulligan in 1962. A coming-of-age story, it is told from the point of view of Jean Louise "Scout" Finch, the young daughter of Atticus Finch, an educated lawyer in Maycomb, Alabama, a small town in the deep South of the United States. She is accompanied by her brother Jem and their mutual friend Dill.Truman Capote was a lifelong friend of childhood neighbor Lee, and allegedly was the inspiration for Dill's character in her best-seller. Capote frequently implied that he himself had written a considerable portion of her novel, and some have said he ghosted the entire novel. At least one person?Pearl Kazin Bell, an editor at Harper's? has gone on record as believing his assertions were true.Scout and Jem watch as their father defends a black man, Tom Robinson, wrongly accused of raping a white girl in a bigoted community in the 1930's. The story explores prejudice in its various forms, as well as childhood and maturity. Since the story is told from the point of view of a child (Scout), the author is able to present situations without adding an explicit opinion?the reader is left to make sense of events and come to his own conclusion. Nonetheless, it is clear that the author believes strongly that the prejudiced actions of the characters are wrong, even if they are believed by the majority and by those in power.The title of the book is taken from Atticus's advice to his children about firing their air rifles at birds: "Shoot all the blue jays you want, if you can hit 'em, but remember it's a sin to kill a mockingbird". The blue jay is a very common bird, and is often perceived as a bully and a pest, whereas mockingbirds do nothing but "sing their hearts out for us". Metaphorically, several of the book's characters can be seen as "mockingbirds", attacked despite doing nothing but good. The mockingbird represents innocence, and to kill one is to metaphorically kill innocence. Note that the protagonists are also named after birds: Tom Robinson and the Finch family. However, "Finch" was also Lee's mother's maiden name.About some of the characters: Jem Finch is Scout's older brother. Jem undergoes crucial transformations in the work as he becomes a man. The trial of Tom Robinson is Jem's first real encounter with true evil, and the realization of its existence drives him into a sullen state. Prior to this, he had viewed the world innocently, thinking of people as one-sided. He viewed Boo Radley, for example, as a frightening figure. Jem was able to overcome his sullenness due to the strong presence of Atticus in his life, and became a bigger person as he achieved a greater understanding of the world and how to view and treat other human beings.Boo Radley symbolizes destroyed innocence. As a child he was abused by his father, and was driven to agoraphobia. A gentle creature, he is viewed with fear by the children, who do not come to a better understanding of him until the end of the work. He does several heroic things, including giving Scout a blanket during a neighborhood fire, and saving the kids from an assault by the father of the girl that accused Tom Robinson of rape. His misconceived good nature testifies to the message of the story, one of kindness and the notion that people should not make judgment's on others, since human beings are not that simple.Atticus Finch is one of the most important characters in the story. He represents morality and kindness. He defends Tom Robinson because he feels that not doing so would make him a hypocrite. Atticus serves as a guiding light for his children, always calm and patient. He allows them to come to the understanding that, although evil exists, one should not dwell on that but should instead realize that the existence of this evil is a sign that there is work to do, and progress to make. His strong presence in his children's lives prevents them from becoming symbols of destroyed innocence, such as Boo Radley and Tom Robinson.This is the best movie ever made and that won't change. This film is also one of the most important films ever made. Why? It's describes racism so well. Here's an example: Atticus had shown the jury and everybody in the courtroom that Tom Robinsson could only use one hand. And Bob Ewell had said that Mayella was strangled all around her neck. But Tom Robinson could only use one of his hands and it was impossible for him to strangle Mayella with only one hand all around the neck.So there is the proof for that that he is innocent but the jury(all white men) still find him guilty and he is sent to prison. Just because he was black. I think the best performance in this film were the kids.100% PERFECTION!! THE BEST FILM EVER MADE!!! ****(out of ****)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Harper Lee, on why she never wrote another Great American Novel.Some know when to shut up: some don't.This is a Great American Novel if ever there was one. And THIS is the only film that could be made from it.Far more rich and "southern" than any other "southern" novel -- including the overblown, florid "Gone With the Wind" -- this ensemble piece for three child actors and a few adults is a precise as a Bach fugue.Name another film that so blatantly deals with parents / children, racism / humanity, lies / honesty, childhood / adulthood, justice / bigotry as "To Kill A Mockingbird." There are films that cheapen the medium. There are films that enhance it. There are films that go beyond all that's gone before and speak to audiences for all time."To Kill A Mockingbird" is one.Magnificent work from all involved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently read the book, and watched the film, in my English class. I think that this movie is one of the most influential movies of all times. This movie shows the importance of equality, and made me realize how cruel our society really is. Harper Lee, the author of the novel, has a very unique writing style and makes the reader become part of the story. The characters are original and lovable. This movie was an amazing movie with an even more amazing cast. I enjoyed this movie because it was an influential movie for its time, and still is today. I don't think that it was as good as the book itself, but still got the authors point across by adding more comedy, more drama, and more conflict. I enjoyed this film/novel, and I hope that you enjoy it as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are films that are important to understand. And there are films that you understand are important. From the third frame, you know; you know because the tracks to your limbs from the nerve-centre in your brain close down for engineering works, and your attention thereby freed repulses attacks from any other thought-source with vicious ruthlessness. You leave the cinema feeling cleanly dirty. And you can pronounce that how you want.This film is full of people doing noble things. There are some ignoble ones as well, but somehow they don't matter - and it illustrates so powerfully the inability of the liar to sustain his cause under the feeblest pressure that this is only surpassed by the way it handles truth as something to be expressed in between the script.Ah! the script!! In an earlier review of this film, one which bit the dust when my video recorder decided to remind me that I hadn't watched the second half again yet by taking itself off pause, I quoted a few lines. Now I don't want to quote lines any more: context isn't so important, but implication that the script has peaks and troughs is a dangerous business: what can you afford to ignore in this movie? That's if you can take your eyes off Mary Badham as Scout long enough to realise that there are other fine performances in this movie. But somehow, you come out knowing that Gregory Peck is a noble man who deserves the luck of having such a violent daughter with an insatiable appetite for outdoing her sibling. Who, in terms of the Deep South at least, is heroically noble to resist the sort of savagery that we are always left with the impression formed a staple part of the alleged-rape-victim's upbringing. I say alleged because I don't need to say any more. And if you still don't understand that, watch what Peck does after he has proved that Mr Ewell is left-handed. Or what Mr Cunningham does when he is confronted and exposed.I began by saying that there was a class of films that you just know are important. There are films you can find many reasons to watch. But the really great films don't let you find reasons not to make you watch them again. To improve yourself in life? Either make a stock exchange fortune, or imagine yourself getting the reception that Atticus gets when he leaves the courtroom after the verdict.I've gone ten because forty-seven would have been an excess. And spoiled the integrity of this website.I don't normally do positive discrimination, but I'm going to make an exception. Well, it's positive discrimination only in terms of feeling I had to mention something about Tom Robinson, or indeed, the reverend, or indeed any of the other coloured characters. Boo Radley isn't an especial hero in the film; nor Scout, nor indeed Atticus Finch. Poverty for them does not preclude happiness. They are merely doing jobs. Even when Atticus takes it in the face from the alcoholic, it is nothing compared to the suffering of a group of people who are systematically oppressed. The heroes of this film are people under pressure, using their situation to encourage others to create less pressure in the hope of awakening nobler deeds. Try the defendant for size.Peace,Fernsy</fullReview>

Gregory Peck has acted very well and the 2 kids too did their job perfectly.How often do you see such critical issues in a society handled in such a deft manner and how a father wants his kids to never think low of anyone. Atticuc the lawyer wants his kids to have equal respect for all humans and he is a very good example.The evils in the society that existed at that time and the surface cover in the lives of people form the outline and all these are seen through the life of atticus who is a leading lawyer.brilliant movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film for the first time in my late 20's and wasn't sure if I would like it without any major special effects or huge production costs. What I found was a story about morality and justice and the fact that justice isn't always done. This film touched me in many ways and showed how one honorable man can make a difference in the world. This film was made before the civil rights movement really took off in America and yet takes a great stand for the rights of the individual. The fact that the story is told from the perspective of Atticus Finch's daughter was a great twist. The mixture of real life problems with the wonders of a child's summer vacation give this film a great "American" feel. I highly recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Because of this movie (and book), every father figure I encounter is compared with Atticus Finch. The first few notes of the theme song can bring tears to my eyes before the movie has even begun. So much of my life has been touched by this book/film's themes on racism, neighbors, family and discrimination. I adore Harper Lee, and I'm sad this is her only work. Did everyone know, for instance, that the character of Dill is based on her real-life friend, Truman Capote? Does anyone remember the joys of rolling downhill inside a tire (or a cutoff barrel)? Climbing trees? Playing games outside late into darkness? Having one neighbor who scared them, whether it was right or not? Ah, the rural South. So much of this life is now lost ? some of it, thankfully so. But much is missed. Must we lose the graciousness of such a life to get rid of the evil and prejudices?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To Kill A Mockingbird(TKAM)is a timeless classic. It is a story about two children's adventures in a small town in Alabama. Like the book TKAM the movie is unforgettable. My mom rented it for me and I loved it. I have since read the book 7 times, and seen the movie at least 10 times, including one time in the theaters(a local theater puts on old movies once a month). I will watch the movie at any chance I can. Anyone who I have talked to, even if they don't like the book, love the movie. Gregory Pecks portrayal of Atticus Finch is awesome. His act won him the #1 hero spot in the A.F.I. "Greatest Heroes of Film" show. This was also Robert Duval's first film! He plays Boo Radley. His performance is good even though he has no speaking parts. Most definitely watch this movie. It is worth your time! ENJOY!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To Kill has provided me with a social injustice scale for my life.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1962 my mother, a huge Greg Peck fan, took me, my older brother and my dad to see To Kill a Mockingbird. We went to a drive-in movie in of all places Fort Fairfield Maine. I was only 7 at the time and we did not have many opportunities to see highly touted films like To Kill, so off we went with anticipation, the 4 of us not knowing what was about to play out.The film started without much fanfare and I became bored and started to fall asleep. Just as I was nodding off, the fog swept in as it is wont to do in Northern Maine even in the summer. The decision was made by the drive-in management to delay the film until the fog blew over (they hoped). My mother had settled my older brother and myself in the backseat of the car hoping we would leave her to be absorbed by Atticus's commanding presence on the screen. Alas the fog had delayed the movie and the question between mom and dad was should we go home. Dad readied the car to go when a tunnel occurred through the fog allowing us to see the screen of the now restarted film.So in a state of half awake in the backseat of a 1960 Blue Plymouth Fury I viewed this enchanting visual, the subtle gray tones of the movie made even more wispy and enchanting by the effect of viewing through the fog. Do you have any idea the effect this had on me, to this day it has influenced me in my view of the goodness and not so good in people. Watching Boo Radley through a fog tunnel was terrifying to a 7 year old but this was balanced by the safety and security of Atticus, fighting the good fight.To this day Atticus and indeed Greg Peck is my yardstick of a person who despite the whirlwind of being a white man in the American south of the 1960's wants to do the right thing and resists getting caught up in the racial maelstrom prevalent of the day. He represented what a good man and father could be and should be. We should all take note and tell our kids to put away the computer games and shoot em up flicks and watch "To Kill a Mockingbird". Serve this wonderful movie with wispy fog remnants and optional social comment and watch how it plays out for your family. I rate this wonderful movie 12 out of 10, and I sorely miss Greg Peck!!! He was/is an American treasure!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd seen this film as a child, but even though I went to law school where you'd think I'd be required to watch it many times over, I had not gotten around to it until today. In terms of filmic technique, it's simplicity itself, not showy in any way. But it also evokes every deep felt feeling and emotion with a cool beauty that brings tears to my eyes. The portrait of life in Depression-era South is painstakingly wrought, from the subtle generosity of inviting a poor child to dinner to the childhood mythology of the "crazy" neighbor to, finally, the finest trial summation ever presented in a courtroom drama, period. It's suspenseful, heartbreaking and comforting all at once. This is a true treasure of American culture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a beautiful portrayal of the South in the early 20th century. I grew up about 100 miles from Monroeville Alabama (where the movie is set), and this movie is absolutely faithful to the feel and the people of the South of that time - good and bad. It also contains many lessons in courage and kindness.My favorite part of this movie is the way it brings back my childhood to me.I remember running around my town with my friends much like Scout and Jem and Dill run around Monroeville. We had a "monster" in the neighborhood, just like Boo Radley (although we never actually met him). And Atticus' and Calpurnia's lessons to Scout in good manners bring back lessons from my mother and grandmother.The performances from Atticus and Mary Badham are just wonderful.</fullReview>

And the statement made in this movie is one that should not be taken lightly. It shows the ignorance of people and the pain it inflicts on the innocent. I personally feel that this movie should be the #1 movie on the top 250, but thats just me. And for it to come out when it did amongst segregation in the south was a statement for change in the country. So, if u read my post and agree with me, give this movie a 10, if u haven't seen it, do, and judge for yourself. I've seen most of the movies on the top 250, but give me suggestions.</fullReview>

I figured that she was just telling me that to get me to read some books, but then a few weeks ago in my literature class, my teacher had us read a chapter of the book. I absolutely loved it. The next day, she brought in the movie and we watched it. IT WAS SPECTACULAR! I got so into it! She let us watch about 30 minutes of it each day, and I always found myself daydreaming about what would happen next in this exciting tale! I think this movie has a strong story line, and a great cast. I would like to add that even though Phillip Alford (Jem) is in his 50's now, that he was really hott as a child. I give this movie 10 out of 10 stars and 2 thumbs way up. This really is one of the greatest movies of all time.</fullReview>

Maycomb is actually Monroeville, Alabama. I know because I grew up in Alabama and actually had the pleasure of meeting Harper Lee. There actually was a "Boo Radley" in Monroeville, so that part of the book is based on fact. There was no trial of that sort in Monroeville, but those sorts of trials were all too common in the South, and elsewhere. The character of Dill is actually Truman Capote who spent his summers with a maiden aunt in Monroeville. I urge everyone to first READ THE BOOK and then see this movie. I watch it every time it is on TV. It is simply wonderful</fullReview>

This film ranks up there with Citizen Kane and others that are considered to be the best of all time. I can't recommend this film enough.

Considering Peck won the best actor oscar and the film won several Oscars and Golden Globes it will be remembered as one of the few believable and acurately rated films of the 'golden age of film'. The child actors, Mary Badham, Philip Alford, and John Megna, were particularly good. The projected the required naivity and innocence that is hard to get and still know your lines.'To Kill A Mockingbird' is truly effective. It reflects the time it was release and the time it was set.

		<shortDescription>An incredible story about empathy and courage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I watched To Kill A Mockingbird I thought that all the people have the same rights, but then I changed my mind. To Kill A Mockingbird is set during the 1930s. It develops a lot of different themes such as education, prejudice, and social class. The theme that impacted me the most was racism; that is why I changed my thoughts about equality. I love how the movie describes the trial of Tom Robinson with Gregory Peck as his lawyer, Atticus Finch. I liked a lot of things about To Kill A Mockingbird. The characters are like the book describes them. My favorite movies are suspense (mystery) movies, so I love the mystery of Boo Radley because I didn't know what really happened to him or how he really is. The case of Tom Robinson was the theme I liked the most because just for prejudice among white people toward black people, a good man was tried. Also, I liked all the history of the Finch family, and the life of each member, because each one had different thoughts and feelings. Finally, my favorite character was Scout Finch because she was a smart, strong girl, who tells the story with innocence and love. Although the movie was beautiful, there are some things I would change in the film, To Kill A Mockingbird. The character that I dislike was Aunt Alexandra because she always was criticizing Scout. She just looks at what Scout wears instead of looking at her feelings and thoughts. The worst character of the movie was Boo Ewell because he doesn't care about his children, he puts an innocent man on trial, and he tries to kill Scout and Jem. Also, I dislike Ms. Caroline Fisher because she was very rude with Scout, instead of feeling proud of her, she told her to stop reading at home. Gregory Peck is a wonderful actor, as Atticus Finch. He looks the same as the book, a man who shows empathy and courage. He shows empathy because he doesn't judge the people by their social class, and courage because he takes the case of Tom Robinson. He is the best lawyer; he doesn't care what the others say. He is a colossal man, big and extraordinary as the father of the family. Gregory Peck was an excellent actor; he showed his life through his movies. On a scale of 1 to 10, I rate the film, To Kill A Mockingbird, with an 8. The film is the same as the book, and develops all the themes. For example, the theme of prejudice is developed through the case of Tom Robinson. Also, the setting is like the book describes it, Maycomb, 1930. Although the movie was very good, I think it lacks special features such as color, music, and background. Also, the movie skips some parts of the book. For example, when Atticus went to Tom Robinson's house to tell his wife he died, in the book he went with Calpurnia but in the film he went with Jem. To Kill A Mockingbird is an excellent movie. According to the American Film Institute, it is one of the 34th best movies of all time. It is a story that maintains suspense from the beginning until the end. When any person starts watching, they can't stop seeing it because it is an amazing film. Also, the movie helps people to understand</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"This movie become my favorite"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To Kill a Mockingbird has become my favorite trial movie ever. I usually hate old style movies, but this movie is great. It is based on American history, and it gives historical information about how discrimination was unfair to black people. I was so sad when I finished the movie, and I saw it three times, over and over. This was my first black and white movie that became my favorite. I like most parts of this movie. I like the setting of this film, because it describes small towns of the 1930's, but it was so different that I was amazed in my mind. I thought it is really old living condition and old fashion. Also, Atticus was riding a car. I thought it was great. When I was in Korea, I saw movies and Thought the America has two story houses and have nice garden. And second thing I liked the actresses. My favorite one was Scout Finch, because when I see her in the film I always think of my old friend, that I was a kid that really close to me. Also, this movie shows a lot of detail about the judgment and trial. Most of I liked the sound one the film. The sound makes me feel scare and sad. I remember that sound, when Atticus loses his trial. I love the actor Gregory peck as Atticus Finch, because they're look similar persons, Autticus was smart and courtly man, and so is Gregory Peck. I think it was good casting for Atticus Finch. Gregory Peck is dead now, but I saw the TV show of The 1991 Kennedy Center Honor. I can see his gentle and courtly manner also. On the TV show the violinist Issac Stern introduced him as a courtly man he also has a good relationship with his friends. Now that I have seen the show, I feel honor toward Gregory Peck. Most parts of this movie are great, but if I could change some, I would change the black and white to color I think that will be more beautiful view of Maycomb. It would be more interesting. Also, I think the story goes so fast, when I read the book, it had more detail in it. I think the movie skips some information about Scout, how she was smart. Also, I disliked sound, but it was very old, so if they change to the new sound, it would be more interesting. My user rating is `9' because I like most part s of this movie, but the story was little different than a book, also I like book better. They skip some part in the book. but it was pretty good . Later if they make new version of this movie, I would positively watch it. I think this movie is the great movie that I have ever watched, In the school.</fullReview>

At the end of the movie, I could feel myself begin to choke up with tears, and I am not one who usually get overly emotional over movies. The movie stays fairly close to the story, but it combines and consolidates some scenes, and eliminates others, so I highly recommend reading the book in addition. The makers of this movie were wise, however, in choosing how to condense the story into a movie format, in that they captured the same feeling and sent the veiwer the same message.

But then a little while later we did a study on the book in school and watched the movie--and I loved the movie this time. Wow! What a piece of work. I liked it ten times more than the first time I saw it. (Keep in mind, the first time I saw it, I was but a child of 13.) In conclusion, I don't think this movie will ever measure up to the book, but it should be seen anyways...for its goodness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once every few years you watch a movie which make you feel likeyou actually learned something about life and the human spirit. In a lifetime an average person like you and me get to see thousands of movies, and quite a few of them we will even enjoy. But let´s face it: The only reason we keep going, is on the off chance something like "To kill a mockingbird" will come along and tell us how life really is. In essence a deeply human story about tolerance, although suberbly acted with quiet dignity by Gregory Peck, the heart and soul of this movie belongs to the kids. In using the children´s point of view director Robert Mulligan shows us the intolerance of the depression era without turning it into a morality tale. Of course this IS a morality tale, but it´s done with heart, grace and skill. The best kind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very moving film, particularly in it's evocation of childhood. Director Mulligan seems to be very skilled in his direction of the child actors, and the admittedly conventional camera work is well suited to the stately pace of the script. Peck is good as Finch; his performance is not amazing but it's enjoyable enough. Robert Duvall also makes a small appearance in one of the most touching scenes. Topping things off, Elmer Bernstein's score is magnificent. Perhaps this is an under-rated film, maybe because it doesn't take many risks, but it's one of the finest to emerge from the changing American cinema of the 60s.</fullReview>

The acting is superb, each acting is perfect for showing there part of the movie, especially Gregory Peck. The characters are great, and if you've seen AFI's 100 Heroes &amp; Villians Atticus Finch (played by Gregory Peck) is #1 on the list for heroes. The character of Atticus Finch is so great, standing against all the prejudice, and hatred in the world standing along the side of the black man. Not just the book is great, but the screenplay is tremendous, Horton Foote does a great job from getting the characters out of the book and into the movie, and does a great job showing how falsely accused the black man is. The directing is excellent, and producing. Everything is excellent creating one great movie. I would see this right now if you haven't, nobody could refuse this movie at any cost. You may find some parts sad but the children clean that up right away, plus the ending would wipe the record clean. So see this movie and at the end you'll know you haven't wasted $5 on a crappy movie.</fullReview>

Yes, it was beautifully, understatedly filmed (and the lovely black and white cinematography seems to highlight the shades of grey in the story). And yes, there was a powerful, confidently-presented message of toleranceWhat stays with me to this day, though, is the relationship Finch had with his children. As a father, Atticus Finch showed more respect for his children than I recall ever seeing ANYWHERE. I remember seeing this respectful relationship, and being deeply touched by it. I still remember it as my own daughter grows up, and while I can't claim to reach that standard, I at least do my best to remember it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is "America" distilled into an epic film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is arguably the finest motion picture ever made about the Vision called "America." It is an idealist recreation of small-town and rural United States. It explains the Great Depression, especially in the South, in a way that makes that period painfully real. This film is also about the goodness of one man in particular. Human nature, with both grandeur and evil contesting, is played out by a magnificent cast. The movie is not Harper Lee's novel, but it is the cinematically perfect rendering of her book, its time, place and people. Fatherhood has never been so splendidly delineated, childhood so perceptively depicted, bigotry so thoroughly skewered and decency so crystalline as in this film. It is a template for "Things as They Ought to Be," once racism is shown to be the stupidity that actually it is. The story unfolds on a summer day in the South, and folds closed almost a year later, on an Autumn night. Within these borders glisten keepsake items, much as we see in the superb opening credits, each item being carefully taken from its place in an old cigar box. And finally, in the closing moments, we connect the title to the basis of this story's morality, much as Atticus Finch tells it to his son, Jem, when presenting him with a small-calibre rifle: "... you must never kill a mockingbird ...." With Harper Lee's poignant autobiographical novel as a base, Horton Foote's award-winning script has distilled a time and place into a vision. It is a vision worth living up to, and seeing over and over. Every father should be Atticus Finch, every child should live in the secure simplicity of "Macomb." Elmer Bernstein's lyric score carries the story, rather than covering it, the characters and settings shimmer with truth, and a particular time and place in America is captured and preserved on film. "...Mockingbird" garnered over 20 nominations for national and international awards, including eight Oscar nominations. Gregory Peck won Best Actor, and Horton Foote best screenplay writer. The film won the "British Oscar" - BAFTA's award -for best foreign film, and Alan Pakula won BAFTA's award as best director of a foreign film. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>The old cliche is true: the book is better than the film. To someone who read the book first (and second, and third, and fourth ...), the film seems disjointed, and the worse for not focusing more on the children, especially before the trial starts. No film can accurately condense such a finely crafted book word-for-word onto the screen, however, and the film more than does justice to its source, with the actors playing their parts as I imagined the characters in the book to be. Harper Lee gave Gregory Peck her father's watch because his performance so reminded her of her own parent, and the two 'amateur' child actors, Mary Badham and Philip Alford, are natural in their roles. Collin Wilcox gives a strong and emotive deliverance of Mayella Ewell's courtroom testimony. I loved the climax, and the closing scene with Atticus and his children is beautifully touching. I recommend this film as I recommend the book, but putting the film first is probably the only way to enjoy an unbiased viewing before the inevitable comparison!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It has taken me twenty-seven years to be able to see this film and I must say I thoroughly enjoyed it...however, the novel that the film is based upon is a totally different story altogether. I have tried countless times to read this novel, seeing how it is one of THE classic works of American Literature, albeit I can never seem to fully immerse myself into it. I always manage to read about a hundred or so pages and then my interests wane quickly. The 1962 film is totally different from the way that the novel is laid out, and I still haven't gotten through all of it (I doubt that I ever will, come to think of it).Usually, they always tend to say that the book is better than the film, however not in this case. Gregory Peck gave the performance of his career as Atticus Finch the southern lawyer and single parent to two adorable children. It is the way that Peck played the role that sticks out in my mind. His performance of the lawyer with the no-nonsense, straight off the cuff approach to parenting won him the Academy Award for Best Actor that year. He beat out both Peter O'Toole in Lawrence of Arabia and Jack Lemmon in Days of Wine and Roses, something that in my opinion is no small feat considering who he was up against!The roles of Scout, Jem, and Dill are three of the film's central characters and the children playing them pull them off effortlessly. Mary Badham who played Scout was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress but lost out to another child star: Patty Duke in the Miracle Worker. The roles of Jem and Dill, played by Phillip Alford and John Megna, respectively, round out the perfect casting that the creative team achieved when casting these roles. If anything, watching this film make make some people long to be children all over again.To Kill A Mockingbird also won for Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Set Decoration-black and white. It lost Best Picture to Lawrence of Arabia.All in all, To Kill A Mockingbird is a true classic of the American Cinema which has certainly stood the test of time. The performances, direction and overall message of the film attest to that.My rating: 3 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on Harper Lee's sole 196O Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, this film is a special favourite for many who relish it as a reminder of their own rural childhoods: I'm one such viewer. A beautifully haunting movie, it casts a strange, almost poetically wistful spell over the viewer coupled with some genuinely chilling &amp; emotionally affecting moments. Gregory Peck is wholly believable and suitable personality -wise in his portrayal of Atticus Finch the forty-something widower of two children, Jean Louise, better known as Scout, and Jeremy, whose nick-name is Jem. The magnificent black-and-white photography makes the painstaking 3O's ambience seem genuinely realised and Elmer Bernstein's wisfully haunting score is recognised as a classic composition. Mary Badham's playing of Scout is so natural-like that she can be likened to actually being the character she plays. As Jem, Philip Alford isn't far behind &amp; together they are wholly believable as siblings. Dill Harris was described as a towhead in Lee's novel, but he is generally accepted by fans who associate John Megna's somewhat bizarre interpretation of the lad who was based on Harper Lee's childhood friend, Truman Capote. Colin Wilcox as Violet Ewell is an inspired piece of casting: she brings real conviction to her role as the pathethically desperate white trash daughter of an illiterate drunk. Alice Ghostley is briefly seen as the funny Miss Stephanie and Estelle Evans plays Calpurnia with warmth: she is the children's surrogate mother. A long, nostalgic journey into 1932 Alabama, this film is both funny and sad, scary and tearjerking.</fullReview>

In fact to this day whenever Gregory Peck encounters Horton Foote, he always says "Thanks for the Oscar Horton!" After viewing this film, it is easy to see why.Few great novels have ever made great films.

Having read the book first though, I do have to admit that the story went too fast, skipping about 10 chapters at a time.

		<fullReview>Ahhh!!! Another movie on here that actually isn't overrated. This is a superb adaptation of Harper Lee's timeless novel. It is magnificently acted, particularly by Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch, but also by the kids who play Scout and Jem. This is a really great movie and any fan of the book would appreciate it as well. Everyone should see this movie. bye.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this again, broadcast by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation as part of a Gregory Peck "marathon". Beautifully and atmospherically filmed in black and white. Full of powerful and stirring moments that are never bombastic or overstated. I remembering crying at the end of the novel when I read it at age 14 for school. The film has the same effect on me, every time. The early- to mid-sixties produced some superb films, of which this is a stellar example. Many older films seem hokey and dated after a couple of decades. "Mockingbird" holds up superbly. It is a perfect movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is one of the most powerful, moving stories to have ever touched my heart. It is one of those living examples of art that can truly cross over into people's minds and souls and actually make a difference in their lives.It would be sinful to compare this to any other movie or story, because it is in itself a very complete experience and deserves an undiluted appreciation for what it is.Even though I am from a different culture, the story was simple and went straight to my heart, and after so many years, I really wonder why America went from movies of this purity to some absolute rubbish that it produces today. I am all for entertainment, but I am also for purity. I can take a pure, mindless comedy, but not a shallow emotional "ride" that some films these days attempt to pack in. Are American film schools showing "To Kill a Mocking Bird" to its students?I would be shocked if anybody could see this film and still went on to make stupid films.Congratulations to Harper Lee and to each and every cast and crew member that made this film. The world is a better place for all of you having graced it.</fullReview>

I couldent stand to read back then, I didnt even read the book like I was suppose to. It was was unfortuante it was one year later I saw it. But as soon as I heard the opening score to The movie it drove my immagation wild, I was automatically hooked. I even read the book. Everything in this movie is ahead of its time ( guess thats why there are so few good movies). The acting is portrayed in every possibe realistic manner, plus all roles are well suited. GO SEE THIS MOVIE (if you have not already). I think one of the main things that carry this movie is the soundtrack. Well scored and makes everything come to life, this movie reminds me to this day the unforgetable memmoies of high school. Thats how much of a impact it has had on me.

It followed the storyline so faithfully (naturally no movie can ever get all details out like a book)and the movie set a mood that took one away to the deep south in the 30's. You could almost feel the poverty and sadness of the depression years. Atticus Finch (played by Gregory Peck) was sober and serious and also a bit down (after all, he lost his wife just a few years earlier). The entire cast was very well chosen and did an exemplary job at bringing the story to life. This is a must see for children of all ages and anyone else who wants to watch a truly good movie. Get ready to get disgusted at some of the characters, and feel pure sympathy and compassion for others. I give this movie a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

To tell you the truth, I didn't care what happens to the black guy. Not that I'm racist, I hate white people as much as black people, but I really don't care. The only detail I actually remember from this film is that he was shot 15 times by the police when he tried to escape.

		<shortDescription>One of the best films out of the 1960's......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I ever saw the movie "To Kill A Mockingbird" as a child growing up,it scared the living daylights out of me. The reason why it scared me so was because of the sinister portrayal of the character of Bob Ewell as the prejudice bigot who comes up in the movie where he pops out of nowhere while Atticus Finch goes into the house of an innocent black man accused of rape. However,the character of Atticus(played by the great Gregory Peck who won an Oscar for his performance)defends him anyway,only to find out that his client,Tom Robinson(played by Brock Peters)didn't do it. The movie goes into detail of how the events occurred and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. This was a much loved and critically acclaimed film that tells all of just how growing up in the South was like during the 1930's in the fictional town of Macon,Alabama. It goes into childhood innocence,racial prejudice of all counts,(and contains several of it in there)as well as moral tolerance and courage. No wonder it was on the AFI's most 100 lists of the greatest movies of all time,and one of the most memorable films of the 20th century. It is a must see for all ages,cause I have seen this picture over a dozen times and it doesn't scared me now since I enjoy it tremendously. One of the top ten films of that year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"To Kill A Mockingbird" brings back a flood of memories to me. I saw this film when I was twelve years old.....my late grandmother took me to a BIG downtown theatre to view this film. This possibly was the first time I had ever seen a film in a BIG theater.....I was awestruck and that was even before the film started. The lights dimmed and the movie began.....I was quickly swept back into a black and white world of how life was back in a sleepy little town in the south. I (personally) was unaware of the racial problems that our country was suffering. At that age I was only interested in playing with my friends.....so the racially charged scenes were a bit too deep to this little kid. BUT, what got me is relating to the children on the screen.....they were JUST like me. The mystery of Boo Radley I found throughly engaging and rather spooky. I "played" Jem the rest of the summer with the girl next door playing Scout and her brother playing Dill. We did the rolling in the tire.....and making believe that the old man down the street was Boo Radley. We had a BALL!!! Scout in her Halloween costume scuffling with Mr. Ewell scared the living daylights out me and finally seeing the VERY scary Boo Radley nearly put me under my seat.....until I realized how gentle he really was with Jem and Scout. Poor Jem with a broken arm after saving his sister..... WOW!!! This was powerful stuff!!! Many years later when I was a junior in high school our book assignment was to read "To Kill A Mockingbird". I read it spellbound and realized what a great film my grandmother had taken me to see. The town of Macomb sizzling on a hot Southern day with the taste of gritty sand blowing through the air. Rabid dogs, gossipy neighbors, mysteries at every turn. By now, I was aware of the racial difficulties that our country had and NOW I could look at the movie in a different light. The movie was MUCH more scarier than I ever realized.....I can find NO fault whatsoever with this GREAT American film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best films of the 1960s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film explored could only be possibly left undisturbed in all its proud, grim glory, in black and white cinematography, rather than using inferior colour processes. The 60s remains the peak of time in which the moral certainty and controversially challenging racial themes were most strongly implied, although the classic story of innocence and a black man charged with the rape of a white girl is still alarmingly relevant today, even to a lesser extent.Could ?To Kill a Mockingbird? be able to survive a modern day movie re-make, miniseries or television film?Remaking ?Mockingbird? as a feature film in a sense would almost be as bad as a sequel to ?Casablanca? or a remake of ?Gone With the Wind?. It is to morals as what ?Citizen Kane? is to its own powerful themes and what ?Singin? in the Rain? or ?The Wizard of Oz? is to musicals. In other words, any sign of a duplicate could do no justice to its predecessor, without undoing the original?s power, which had first debuted on the screen in celebrated style almost forty years ago.Unfortunately, incidence had to be compromised with cinematic length, and some of the novel?s key events were not filmed. I saw ?Mockingbird? some months before I studied the novel, which happens to be the text currently being studied at school, and despite its excellence, it has not been entirely helpful. The question remains as to whether even some of the film? s darkest themes were deemed unfilmable. Apart from that, the screenplay of Horton Foote remains largely faithful, and retains most of the literary brilliance of Harper Lee?s original Pulitzer Prize winning work. In turn, the director has done the same.No actor of the day could have played Atticus Finch better than the great man, Gregory Peck himself. Any sign of the comic, cynical newspaper reporter he played previously in ?Roman Holiday? is far removed. The dignified symbolism of human idealism was a well-deserved Oscar win, played to the upper core of conviction.The usage of literal unknown actors, including Mary Badham as Scout, has therefore not compromised some of the all-important supporting creations by bastardising the film with big names. Finally, Kim Stanley?s narration of the older Scout is fitting and appropriately convincing.Technical elements for this 60s film are generally above average. Visibly rugged sets and costumes have been well created. The musical score is not an intrusion, but rather a befitting haunting melody that becomes increasingly better with each viewing of the film. It?s a relief to know a lousy, irrelevant theme song does not accompany the film.Against ?Lawrence of Arabia?, David Lean?s masterpiece epic, the fact that the underdog ?Mockingbird? won any Oscars at all is truly a wonder. Named by the AFI as one of the top 100 films of all time in 1998 only further proves why this film has been one of the most successful adaptations and perhaps the best film of any year in the 1960s. Unfortunately, 1962 was simply not one of them.Rating: 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Epic uniquely American; a Luminous tribute to fatherhood.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is arguably the finest motion picture ever made about small-town and rural United States, about the Great Depression, about the South and especially, about the goodness of one man in particular. Human nature, with both grandeur and evil contesting, is played out by a perfect cast.The film is not Harper Lee's novel, but it is the cinematically perfect production of her time, place and people. Fatherhood has never been so perfectly delineated, childhood so perceptively depicted, bigotry so thoroughly skewered and decency so crystalline as in this film. It is a template for "Things as They Ought to Be," once racism is shown to be the stupidity that actually it is. The story unfolds on a summer day in the South, and folds closed almost a year later, on an Autumn night. Within its borders glisten keepsake items, much as we see in the superb opening credits, each being carefully taken from their place in an old cigar box. And finally, in the closing moments, we connect the title to the basis of this story's morality, as Atticus Finch told it to his son, Jem: "Son ... you must never kill a mockingbird ...."With Harper Lee's poignant autobiographical novel as a base, Horton Foote has distilled a time and place into a vision. It is a vision worth living up to, and seeing over and over. Every father should be Atticus Finch, every child should live in the simplicity of "Macomb." Elmer Bernstein's singing, haunting score carries the story, rather than covering it, the characters and settings shimmer with truth, and a particular time and place in America is captured and preserved on film. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Stand up. Your Father's Passin'."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a rural county somewhere in the Deep South, some time between the Depression and Pearl Harbor, a black field worker is accused of raping a white woman. Atticus Finch is the country attorney who takes on the defence of Tom Robinson. Atticus is a well-respected man, but "lawin' fer niggers" is not going to make life in Maycomb County easy for him or his family.  "To Kill A Mockingbird" is one of the best, and best-selling, American novels of the twentieth century, and hardly needs any introduction here. The story is recounted by Scout, Atticus' tomboy daughter, who is six years old at the time of the events which she describes. Her adored older brother Jem is her constant companion, and the narrative evokes (in both book and film) the distinctive world of childhood. When I first saw the film, the novel was already a much-loved part of my mental furniture. I felt that Gregory Peck's Atticus was right from a cinematic perspective, but wrong in terms of fidelity to the novel. To me, Atticus was older and more frail, and yet somehow less grave. On a second viewing, however, I have revised my opinion. Peck is an outstanding Atticus, and this is borne out by the IMDb trivia section, which usefully explains that Harper Lee was so pleased with the way Peck captured her father's essence that she made a gift to him of Atticus' watch. It is not putting it too strongly to describe 'Mockingbird' as the first film of the American nouvelle vague. With their clean, unpretentious images, the opening credits could have been filmed by Truffaut. This is a style which suffuses the whole film. Everything is shot with an unfussy clarity and a complete absence of fancy tricks and fancy lenses. Russell Harlan deserves credit for his intelligent cinematography. All the novel's major incidents are here. Scout rides the tyre onto the Radley porch, Jem loses his pants on the fence, Walter souses his vegetables in syrup and the lynch mob is disarmed by Scout's innocent but apposite remarks. If the Tom Robinson saga seems hurried into the film, as compared with the book, this is entirely understandable - a movie has ninety minutes in which to do the work of three hundred pages. As Scout the narrator introduces herself, Scout the protagonist swings into camera shot. This elegant efficiency is characteristic of the whole film. The energy of the children, and their excitement and confusion on Scout's first day at school, are beautifully in the breakfast scene, with the staccato banging of the screen door. The Walter Cunningham lunch is terrific, with Peck admirably putting across the deadpan wisdom of Atticus. Mayella's mendacity, and the wretchedness of her position, are exposed by the very simple but very effective zoom-in during her cross-examination. As the good ol' boy prosecutor questions Tom, the US flag stands between them, symbolising both the gulf which separates the two cultures and the enlightened work of bridging the chasm being undertaken by the federal government. This was the era of civil rights agitation, and of the progressive outlook of the Kennedy administration. It is shocking to the people in the courtroom that Tom should pity Mayella, but for us it confirms his integrity as a man. Elmer Bernstein's music is, as always, classy, subtle and designed to enhance the meaning of the film. The opening credits are accompanied by the lone voice of a child, humming. This was revolutionary for the time, but perfectly-judged, being in keeping with the film's nouvelle vague style, and highly evocative of the child's-eye-view. The 'creepy' theme for the night raid on the Radley house is brilliant, the piano and clarinet combination producing a memorably haunting effect. Dill, the little boy whose return signals the advent of lazy summer days as surely as the flowering of the cotton, is an interesting character in his own right. In real life this youngster was Truman Capote, Harper Lee's childhood friend. Here he is played by the excellent John Megna. All three child actors (Mary Badham as Scout and Phillip Alford as Jem) are simply marvellous. Scout's mixture of self-assurance and childish vulnerability, and Jem's leadership qualities, are captured perfectly. I accept that I may be wrong in this, but it seems to me that the film hints at a sexual relationship between Atticus and Cal (Estelle Evans), the black woman who runs the Finch menage. After all, it would make thematic sense. For all practical purposes Cal is a mother to the children and a wife to Atticus. Man and woman share a bond of mutual respect which is never voiced because it does not need to be. At one point, something crops up and Atticus asks Cal to stay the night. She agrees without hesitation. Symbolically, this union (enlightened white with decent black) will bear fruit in a future America. Peck seems to go for a 'Clark Kent' look for Atticus, and my guess is, it's deliberate. Atticus is Superman, the totally benign, totally capable American hero. That he can couple with the flower of black womanhood is implicit in, and important to, the film's meaning. The cramped little 'Huck Finn' courthouse with its imposing facade is wonderful, as is Scout's familiar neighbourhood, with its mature trees and creaking verandahs, flawlessly evoking the Maycomb of the book. 'Boo' Radley is played by the always-admirable Robert Duvall, here making his first feature appearance. Onscreen for a matter of seconds, with no dialogue, he sears onto the viewer's memory the definitive image of Boo, "the unlikeliest of guardian angels".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an anti-racist masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've just watched this movie for a second time and was reminded of what a cinematic masterpiece it is. The pivotal moment in which the jury returns with its verdict is still a stunner. Released in 1962, but set during the Great Depression, this dramatized depiction of the noble attorney Atticus Finch, his family, and the community in which he practices his profession offers a (still) powerful and necessary indictment of racism as consisting of an entire social system. Just about everything about this film is superb, including the acting of Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch (for which Peck won an Oscar) and Mary Badham and Philip Alford as his children, Scout and Jem, along with the remainder of the cast. The direction by Robert Mulligan also heightens the drama. What really worked for me here is that TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD generally offers us three dimensional characters (though Boo Radley was not very well fleshed out, and the ending, in which he figured rather prominently was perhaps the film's weakest moment). Like the good courtroom drama that it is, it gets underneath the characters so as to uncover something hidden about them; in fact, as Atticus says more than once to his children, it is necessary to get underneath another's skin so as to be able to understand them. But as a tragic depiction of what the sociologist Gunnar Myrdal called "the American Dilemma" (i.e., a very deep rooted racist social system), it shows us persons who are complex, who are in some senses victims of their own thwarted ambitions and years of poverty's hardship, and who are capable of both lynch mob irrationalities as well as acts of justice and reciprocity. Even the highly moral Atticus seems to recognize his own limited capacity to do much toward changing this world to which he is tied. Some of the more poignant moments also come about as his children, particularly Jem, come to see the world as it really is, i.e., populated with weak beings who commit acts of grave injustice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the finest films of the century.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A neglected classic, that needs and deserves to be seen a lot more than it is. No other film or series, with the possible exception of The Waltons, has got as close to the heart and soul of rural America as this one.Gregory Peck, in his finest role, plays Atticus Finch exactly as the book describes him - a good and decent man trying to to the right thing in a society that just will not allow him to do that. The fact that we see how all aspects of the community interact and view the trial of Tom Robinson hammers home the point of how pervasive and common racism was in those days. The closing scenes in the courtroom still give a chill today.The two child actors do an excellent job of bringing Jem and Scout to life, but the other real star to me is Robert Duvall. Boo Radley is the great unheard presence in the book, and he manages without words to bring out the tragedy and heroism in this character. I defy anyone not to be moved to tears by the closing scenes on the Porch, or Atticus' words 'Thank you Arthur for my children.'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not a movie to watch if you want car crashes, explosions or the like. Just a superbly crafted movie which gets at the heart of age-old problems of race and prejudice, and their impact on a couple of kids in the depression-era South.Easy to see why Gregory Peck likes this the best of all his movies.A comparison with the book would be an apples-to-oranges exercise. Still, it's perhaps not entirely coincidental that both are regarded as classics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything you've heard is true</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is just as powerful and well-performed as you've heard. From the scenes where Scout and Atticus have discussions, to the scene where Scout innocently confronts a member of a lynch mob, to the trial scenes, to the last scene, (featuring Robert Duvall in his film debut, in which he says so much without ever speaking), every moment is masterfully directed and beautifully perfromed. Gregory Peck really deserved his Oscar for th role of Atticus Finch; his dignified portrayal of a single father called upon to "do our unpleseant jobs for us" is remarkable. Not only is he wonderful and eloquent in the courtroom scenes, but his scenes at home are wonderful, too. He seems to be every child's image of the ideal father: stern yet kind, all-knowing, able to explain anything, and yet his kids know he can't do everything, though he can do more than they think. These scenes also give him a chance to interact with the amazing child actors Mary Badham and Philip Alford, both of whom had never done any acting before this and yet are naturals. Badham is espicially good in the scenes where she and Atticus discuss things; she senses so much, and yet is still so innocent. She does a lot of growing up, but so does Alford, as he listens in on his father's talks with the judge and watches his visits to the Robinson home. His maturing is much easier to see. Both actors are just as good as Peck; their adventures are amusing and their performances excellent. Brock Peters is also very good as Tom Robinson, the black man accused of raping a white woman. You are not manipulated into feeling sorry for him; you just naturally are, thanks to his portrayal and the direction of his scenes. This is a wonderful movie. I don't know if the book is better, as I haven't read it, but I know the movie is excellent. Please see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A classic. This film was a delight from start to finish. There were several things worth a mention from this film.1. Gregory Peck: He slips into the role of Atticus Finch with ease. It was made for him, and he slips into it like a fine suit.2. Mary Badham: A great performance from a child actress. She is Scout, and no one else could play her.3. The score: Ranked by Movietunes as one of the fifty most definitive scores, it works with this film.4. The direction: Very subtle and understated, Robert Mulligan did himself proud. I could go on and on about the strengths of this movie, but won't. If it has one weakness, it is that it seems to go on a bit too long. But that doesn't make it any less moving.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the great all-time movies. It is incredibly moving for you see the total negligence of a black man's innocence in South America and yet, you have Gregory Peck trying to educate his children, especially his daughter (brilliantly played by Mary Badham), against racial discrimination. This is one of the most under-rated movies ever with one of the greatest under-rated actors, Gregory Peck, and it's wrong to under-rate him; he's a very very very good actor.The movie is filled with power, sadness, and an excellent look at racism in South America. I would say the ending with Robert Duvall standing behind the door and then Mary Baham takes his hand and goes outside with him on the swing is one of the prettiest, saddest, most powerful scenes of all-time. An absolute must-see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To Kill A Mockingbird is not a bad film, but it's pretty overrated. Apologies to the fans. I'm amazed Gregory Peck won the Academy Award. He took what seems like a great part, on paper, and managed to give a stiff, heavy (though convincing) performance, in my opinion. This guy once had a great deal of looseness and charm, as in: The Yearling (1946). Is Atticus such a paragon and saint that he has to be played with clenched jaw and stiff neck? I would have liked it if he loosened up occasionally. I just felt Peck was playing one note throughout. I hate to say he was bad, but I felt he was verging on it. I read somewhere that Harper Lee originally wanted Spencer Tracy. Though I suppose Tracy was a bit too old, by then, he had the ability to humanize saintly characters. (Meanwhile, Universal wanted Rock Hudson, their biggest box office star.)The children are natural, but not especially great actors. Alice Ghostly is good, though her ebullience seems toned down to fit in with the "Playhouse 90" acting style that pervades everything. Robert Duvall is good. The various supporting players are all commendable but without much presence. They seem to underplay to the point of fading into the background. Maudie, Calpurnia, etc. Then in the courtroom we get some overacting. I can't put my finger on what I don't like about the film, overall, but I just think it's not altogether life-like. I also wish it had been shot on location; I think a lot of atmosphere could have been achieved. The set, which was completely constructed on the Universal back lot by a brilliant art director, Henry Bumstead, is quite an achievement. But no set has the same "life" to it that a real location has. This isn't a bad film, and of course it has its touching scenes (with several moments greatly enhanced, emotionally, by Elmer Bernstein's score). I just don't have the same reaction to it that many others seem to have.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Becoming more toothless....As Time Goes By</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To Kill a Mockingbird, made in 1962 and depicting the Alabama of 1932, looks and feels a little shabby today. There is a lack of passion and raw emotion here (Gregory Peck (Atticus Finch) sleep-walks through the whole thing) and, considering the lack of stability of the times, one would expect a lot more rage. However ..it is what it is..and this is a very highly rated movie by a lot of people. It does seem a little pointless to let a man "get away with murder" at the end of the movie..while the rest of the film..is all about how justice is required by society..no matter what. It has a certain clever aspect to it...going back to something Atticus Finch said early in the film (to his children) "we don't kill Mockingbirds because they sing so well". Yes, well the David Duvall character must have whistled wonderfully. I guess there are no Golden Rules.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have killed me....yawn!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film as I decided that it was about time I watched some of the classics that 'Greatest Films of All Time' lists keep raving on about. I have to say after watching a couple of them I feel the list needs tearing up and starting over.To Kill A Mockingbird is a famous book written by Harper Lee. She won the Pulitzer Prize for her writing and I believe that this is the reason the film is deemed a classic as I have to say I found it utterly dull and boring.Gregory Peck plays Atticus Finch, a lawyer who looks after his kids alone after the death of his wife. The beginning of the film is from the point of view of his daughter Scout, who plays in the street and has a good relationship with her brother Jem. They have a belief that a man who lives down the street is actually insane and they taunt this man by sneaking onto his property and banging on his door. The fun of being a youth hey. Their fun soon changes though when their Dad is offered the job of defending a black man who is accused of rape. Due to them living in a racist era the town's folk don't take too kindly to Atticus defending a clearly 'guilty' black man and they intend to make his life hell. Their kids fight Atticus' kids, they lynch mob the police station and threaten Atticus and they all lose great respect for this man and his family. As the film gets to the trial we see the children losing a part of their innocence as they realise there is evil in this world.The trial scenes are not as tense as they should have been and they take all the attention away from the children. For forty minutes or so they are barely in a shot. Atticus tries to defend the black man, Tony Robinson and although he is clearly innocent he faces a losing battle against an all white jury. Tony is killed after the trial and the father of the man Tony apparently raped, goes after Atticus' children.I won't tell you what happens after as I wouldn't want to give away an ending of a classic, although if you listen to me I wouldn't bother watching it. People will though due to its status in society and I am aware that it conveys a meaningful message, especially for the era it was released in but the whole ending throws out the principal Atticus is fighting at the beginning. The film to me is just a mess. I know the book is a classic and no I haven't read it but that doesn't make the film a good one. It is just plain boring.I had this problem a while back whilst watching another film voted as one of the greatest of all time: Citizen Kane. Oh my, that film must have been the most boring film I've ever seen, it was painful to watch and I felt tears streaming down my face. This wasn't quite as bad but it is one of those classic films that people of today won't get, especially if they are under thirty.I have no problem with the acting in it. Gregory Peck is very good as Atticus and there are a few good scenes that I found myself interested in but very quickly I would be falling asleep again. Maybe I'm not appreciating what is supposed to be beautiful about this movie but to me there is absolutely nothing.Disappointed to say the least but there is one thing To Kill A Mockingbird has taught me, to not trust the 'All Time Greatest Movie' lists that are around unless of course they actually have something about them, like The Shawshank Redemption for instance. Now that is a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With three wins among eight Oscar nominations, this is one of the best pictures of all times. Gregory Peck won one of those Oscars for what is certainly his best performance.It was Mary Badhams first film, and she received a well-earned nomination for her performance as Scout. It was also Phillip Alford's first film. Both of these children performed as well as many actors with years more experience. Of course, Horton Foote's Oscar-winning screenplay, based upon Harper Lee's novel contributed immensely, but the two young actors really made you believe you were watching real characters.In an interesting note, it was also Robert Duvall's first film. He was the "Boo" Radley referred to throughout and not seen until the end.The summation given by Peck has to be one of the greatest of all times, and he truly was, in the words of Miss Maudie, "born to do our unpleasant jobs for us..." Which, of course, includes reminding us of when we fall from what we should be a humans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before the movie came out, I had already read To Kill a Mockingbird at least 3 times. I was in junior high then and one of my friends gave me a copy and told me that I HAD to read it. I think I was only through about two chapters when I bought my own copy and returned hers. I finally wore that copy out I read it so many times.I really didn't want to see the movie. I was afraid that it would somehow profane a book that touched my soul more deeply than anything I had read up to that time. But the same friend who gave me the book told me I HAD to see the movie. I went to see To Kill a Mockingbird by myself. I wanted to be able to leave the theater if it wasn't as good as I had been told.It was better than I had been told. It was as good as the book. Gregory Peck, Mary Badham and the others in the movie gave faces and voices and an outside to people I already knew from the inside. It was a profound and profoundly moving book that became a profound and profoundly moving motion picture. And in one small way, it was even better than the book - the music. It has one of the most beautiful musical scores ever written for a movie. The music does not dominate or overwhelm, but it enfolds the story with grace and beauty.If I were required to pick the greatest movie ever made, I would not be able to choose between To Kill a Mockingbird and The Shawshank Redemption. Other movies are, perhaps, technically more perfect. Some movies, such as Citizen Kane, have influenced the art of making motion pictures in many ways. But To Kill a Mockingbird touches the soul and leaves you feeling cleaner for having seen it.</fullReview>

The story don't seem to give many 'arguments' as to why the black man was innocent. After the trial, I still don't know if the man is guilty or innocent. The movie is supposed to be about a discrimination trial. However, it is alittle short for the purpose it serves for the movie. However, the first half is not about that. It is pretty much a perspective from the children...it sort of made it a children's film. However, during the second half, the attention was shifted. I guess one can't make a movie entirely on a trial. But because of this spread of storyline, they couldn't touch deep enough of both of the things they wanted to say. There are also few scenes which I thought was not logical. It is a good movie. But I don't think it is a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay, But Not All It's Cracked Up To Be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To Kill A Mockingbird, both as a book and a movie, has been hailed as a classic, a masterpiece, etc. I personally don't see what the big hoopla is.It seems that the movie is trying to be deep, trying to be artistic...and while a bit deep with the whole storyline of Tom's trial, in reality, that's all it did-try.They story is set in Maycomb County, Alabama, in the midst of the Great Depression. It follows the life of Scout Finch, a little girl growing up in that county. Basically, it's about what's going on with the town and what's going on with Scout and her family throughout her growth, leading to different "storylines" of events that happens to Scout and the rest of the Finch's.Probably the only storyline I really appreciated was the story of Tom Robinson's trial. Atticus (Scout's father) was defending Tom in a rape case, and since Tom was black, this was taboo in Maycomb. This story really showed unfairness and how cruel prejudice and hate can be. Maybe if the movie was only centered around that story instead of throwing in aspects like Boo Radley, Dill, and others, I would consider calling this movie a classic.I also might've enjoyed it more if they had had a different main character. I personally couldn't stand Scout. I understand that she was supposed to be an innocent, unknowing little girl, but she came off as an annoying, loud, obnoxious brat that I wanted to slap throughout the entire movie. Maybe if it had been from Atticus' point of view, or Jem's, or just ANYONE aside from Scout, I might've enjoyed the movie more.The cinematic work was pretty good, but not extremely artistic. It's a far cry from the fantastic cinematic elements of films such as "Traffic" and "Psycho". While it had some good angle work and good lighting techniques, it wasn't really a great film in the cinematic field. To be fair, though, I suppose that that's not what the movie was going for.I give it a 3/10. The story involving the trial was beautiful, there was some good acting (Gregory Peck, to give an example-although I don't think his performance was Oscar worthy)...but it was such a long way off from all it was said to be, it just turned out to be an overrated bore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great movie if you have the stomach flu and are over 45. It also helps to be a white liberal who wishes he could be the kind of upright, loving, articulate father Gregory Peck plays in "To Kill a Mockingbird." I remember watching the movie when it was originally released in 1962 after having read the book. I am not the kind of person who cries easily, but I remembered crying over both the book and the movie. It was with my tears in mind and a difficult-to-define recollection that this is truly one of the great films that caused me to rent the DVD.Watching it made me realize that there is a world out there that doesn't have the stomach flu. "To Kill a Mockingbird." is better than any stomach remedy if you are of the right demographic, as I am. I cannot imagine a 22 year-old (one of my children is 22) sitting still for the slow-moving pace of the drama or for the tedious subplot concerning the emotionally-disturbed young man who lives in the neighborhood.This is a movie about racial injustice and how wonderful Gregory Peck is to defend a poor, frightened black man who is accused of rape in the South during the Depression. The sort of injustice described here is now lost to boring history books. Racism in America still exists, but not this particular flavor of racism that those of us who found it so familiar can appreciate. The racism I have in mind is like a fine old wine; namely African-Americans not treated as human beings in the deep South while a noble white guy enters the fray and gets credit for being noble.Watching this movie is like reliving the bad old days when every stereotype is blatantly reenacted and the pleasure is in watching which stereotype will come next. This is not a movie about how hard it was to be black in the South in 1932. This is a movie about how pleasurable it is to remember the days when a brave white man like Gregory Peck represented what we like to think of as bravery and racial justice.My guess is that most 22 year-olds wouldn't like Gregory Peck even if they knew who he was. Try it and see. Even if "To Kill a Mockingbird" does not stand the test of time, it still will be a comfort in a time of stress to folks like me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania."To Kill a Mockingbird" (1962) is very well crafted motion picture. Based on a famous novel (which i didn't read) it tells a story from the point of view of two young children. I won't spoil anything, but the story is not the most original or particularly interesting. Nevertheless, what makes this movie a very good one is it's acting - writing, directing. Overall, "To Kill a Mockingbird" is superbly paced movie, at running time 2 h 9 min. this movie barely drags and due it's great acting and writing is entertaining from start till finish. On the other hand, to find this movie at No.84 in IMDb best movies of all time is a bit not right i think. The film is very good, but it's not that great - it's message here is very simple, yet not that deep. The whole movie is more like a fantasy then reality - but maybe that is how it looks through the eyes of children. Nevertheless. "To Kill a Mockingbird" is a very solid movie, but maybe a bit over-hyped.</fullReview>

It is a great American Motion Picture. The screenplay is so faithful to the classic novel, it is just brilliant. The performance by Gregory Peck is so powerful and surreal. He represents a true American icon. The acting by the young cast was also impressive. The court scenes are just so wonderfully shot and acted. The stand-out besides Peck to me was Collin Wilcox Paxton, who in a short scene plays Mayella Ewell. I thought she was absolutely fantastic and stole that scene completely. She was robbed of an Oscar nomination. The score and cinematography are so beautiful, even in black and white.Overall, this a fantastic film that needs to be seen.

		<fullReview>There have been so many eloquent praises laid at the feet of this fine movie by previous posters to this forum, I find myself wholeheartedly agreeing with them all.I'll try to focus on a couple of aspects of this masterpiece, TKAM, that I haven't seen many people comment on ... they are "vignette's" that add their own peculiar flavour, in small but charming ways: 1) The opening credits: What an amazing piece of cinematography ! With Elmer Bernstein's simple but elegant music, and the sight of that marble rolling along, while an innocent childish voice of Scout singing and chatting to herself, while drawing and rubbing impressions with a crayon. Simply brilliant.2) Mrs. Dubose: A crotchety old neighbour living two houses from the Finche's, who yells at Scout that she's an "ugly girl". Atticus considers her one of the bravest people he's ever met, since she was able to break free from a morphine addiction. The children imagine she has a Confederate pistol hidden beneath her shawl, and as Jem explains, "she'll shoot you just as quick as look at you". Atticus, in his charming Southern way praises Mrs. Duboses' rose bushes, while trying to swat his children with his hat as they hide behind him.Again, a very brief little vignette that makes you feel as though you are living in the old South of the 1930's. Another brilliant diamond buried within this wonderful film, TKAM.</fullReview>

Peck does his best but Peters is convicted anyway by the all-white jury; this is 1932. In Macon. That's in Georgia. While being transported elsewhere "for his safety," Peters tries to escape and is shot dead. The redneck father responsible for all this mishigas (James Anderson, who must be great pals with Bill McKinney because their parts are interchangeable) holds a grudge against Peck for defending Peters in the first place, and for proving Peters was innocent in the second place, and for thereby impugning the honor of the Anderson family in the third place. Anderson calls Peck "a n***** lover" and spits in his face, but of course Peck would find any response infra dig. Anyway, Anderson sneaks up on Peck's two kids on Halloween night and tries to knife them, but is prevented from doing so -- and is killed -- by Boo Radley (Robert Duvall in a powerful but wordless performance). Peck is told by the Sheriff (the ever-emotive Frank Overton) that, although Duvall may have killed Anderson, well -- Anderson was responsible after all for the death of the innocent Brock Peters. "I say let the dead bury the dead, Mr. Finch." The story is told from the point of view of Peck's two kids, the eleven-year-old Jem (Philip Alford) and the six-year-old girl, Scout (Mary Badham). It's kind of sweet too, to see these goings on -- both comic and dramatic -- through the eyes of a naive girl like Scout. Kind of like Candide in Georgia. And if Alford gives a pedestrian performance as Jem, Mary Badham does a splendid job with the character of Scout. Credit, too, the direction by Robert Mulligan and the editing by Aaron Stell, who catches Badham's face at precisely the critical moments. (When her brother is in jeopardy and a sudden gun shot is heard off screen, her face jerks and her eyes open wide in an almost perfect take.) It's especially fine work because neither Alford nor Badham are particularly adorable kids. Jem is rather ordinary in a Tom-Sawyerish way. But Badham has a strange face, with keen, slitted eyes, freckles, and a nose that juts out at odd angles. Neither of them is pretty in the usual child-like way, although compared to their friend Dill (John Megna), purportedly based on Truman Capote, they could both be in beauty contests.Mulligan's direction could hardly be better, given the nature of the story. After lights out in this sleepy Southern household, we hear Badham asking Alford about their mother, who died some years ago. The Mulligan's camera drifts from the delicate lace of the window curtains to Peck sitting alone on the porch swing, his face lowered, his arm draped across the back of the wooden swing, as if he can still feel his wife's presence within the circle of that arm. End of scene. Had more been made of it, it would have been banal.The moral calculus of the film puzzles me a little. I'm not sure that "the dead" who have "buried the dead" are in quite the same position. An innocent man is shot and killed "while trying to escape." A guilty man is killed while trying to murder two children. I don't know. Does that come out right for you? And Harper Lee, and the screenwriter Horton Foote, are pretty easy on the quiet town of Macon. That lynch mob that shows up at the jail to string Brock Peters up, for instance. They are momentarily stopped by the unflappable and imperious Peck, but what really turns them aside is the appearance of Peck's kids. They don't know what's going on. And Badham cheerfully greets the members of the mob whom she knows. She asks them to say "hey" to their kids, who go to the same school as she does. This innocence is so disarming that the leader of the mob says, "Let's break it up and go home." Really? On the flip side of the coin, if the writers treat the town's peccadilloes a little gently, at least there are no Big Speeches -- no preaching. Peck never gives a speech (not even in his summation) about all men being created equal, and God made all of us, and we'd better get our stuff together if we ever expect to have a team like the Atlanta Braves.It's a good, sensitive movie. It may or may not sound like it in precis. (Almost all movie kids are repugnant, I'll grant you that.) But it's quite well done, and Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch has become part of our cultural data base.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vulgarity of discernment on the spot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"To kill a mockingbird" (1962) directed by Robert Mulligan is as movie a kind of feeling adapted from a novel well known, in which the silly blockade of almost an entire community of prejudice in citizenship above all, it's quite enough for breaking with such irrationality at stake, substituting the democratic logic of institutions concerning justice, freedom and equality of opportunities. Although as absurd of colonization and independence and speculative origin of humankind like a truth learned in school, the strength of mistaken conception impulses vulgarity of discernment on the spot. What is important here is also that the alleged majority of this community understood at the time what makes it out of mind , when a lawyer brought to them action at the court. Even not waiting for a sentence protecting him against the mob nor because given the part of his legal speech impeaching accusation against his own customer, a poor man with a fake rape on the back of his imprisonment by authorities. The fact that this movie is an adaptation from a novel, whose events are described by a child as such an adolescent before the date, which means that the universe described is quite the same of 1927, it seemed also from the written description of a year that took the social attention in all America, when at the same time other events about injustice were still more flagrant than this usual case of unconformity by a young lawyer, to the banality of the smashed human being in his growth for more attention from the authorities themselves. A melodrama like that, when the law itself was out of mood for the decreasing of segregationist activities in 1962 putting it on the screen, it was for the director Robert Mulligan still a problem of other nature. Because the public opinion was slowly changing since the fifties, even in great speed namely with the young and the integration was never strong than then, by which the viewers opened their mind to such a limit case with two generations before of retard, from the impact of the irrationality on their bad conscience. Before the African roots of part of its population there, as reminiscent link with mental reduction or exclusion from inequality configuration of bodies and education of souls. This is why the child helps to understand the sweet touch of mercy and the foolish act of the lawyer for a lost cause from there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As an assignment for my English class, I had to write an essay on the book To Kill A Mockingbird. I discovered that we had the DVD at home, so decided to watch that instead. I initially thought it would be dull and maybe boring, but I was pleasantly surprised.To Kill A Mockingbird is set during the 1930s, and it's about a young girl named Scout and her older brother and father, who she always calls by his first name-Atticus. Atticus is a lawyer and has decided to represent Tom Robinson, a black man accused of rape.The movie taught me a lot of things about justice, prejudice and discrimination. Gregory Peck's portrayal of the widowed lawyer was amazing, and the American Film Institute has ranked Atticus Finch number one in their list of top 100 movie heroes, and To Kill A Mockingbird number two in their list of 100 movie cheers (behind It's A Wonderful Life).A heartfelt movie that lots of people can enjoy, just like I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fine Screen Adaptation of a Beloved Book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"To Kill a Mockinbird" is one of those movies that is bound to fail on a first viewing, because it has to of course compete with the book on which it is based, which has captivated readers ever since it was written.But when you revisit the film after the initial "it's not as good as the book" reaction, you find that it's a wonderful piece of art in its own right, and if it sacrifices much of the texture and detail that makes the book so compelling, it keeps the tone and the book's humanist message intact.Gregory Peck was perhaps born to play Atticus Finch. I most admire him and the screenwriter and director for keeping the role of Atticus true to the book and not allowing a certain cloying brand of sentimentality typical of Hollywood films to creep into the performance. Atticus is a noble and good man, and a reliable father, but he's rather cold and formidable. Scout and Jem love him, but they're also slightly scared of him, and he keeps them at a distance. The very traits that count as deficiencies as a father are what make him a good lawyer. This aspect of Atticus's character always fascinated me, and Peck gets it just right.My biggest lament is that the filmmakers could not include the story of Jem and Mrs. Dubose, the mean old lady who lives in the Finches' neighborhood, that provides perhaps the single most beautiful moment in the novel. As punishment for destroying her flowers, Jem must read to Mrs. Dubose every day after school, for increasingly longer periods of time. When she dies, Jem receives a box containing the petals of a flower, the kind that Jem destroyed. He thinks she's haunting him from the grave, but Atticus explains to him that Jem was unknowingly helping Mrs. Dubose kick a morphine addiction. Jem's reading distracted her through her periods of withdrawal, and enabled the proud woman to leave the earth without taking the shameful secret with her. Sending the flower to Jem was her way of thanking him. What a wonderful moment in 20th Century literature.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I previously saw this classic film when I was in middle school, but had mostly forgotten how the film went, and to some extent, even how the story went, so I decided to go back and watch it.It was worth it. This film doesn't have the latest and greatest techniques of its time, but what it does have is a determined and capable cast, direction that really manages to capture the innocence of youth, and one hell of a story to work with. One little treat is the credits sequence at the beginning of the film--it contains some of the most gorgeous black and white cinematography that I've seen in a credits sequence. The rest of the film's "eye" plays like an enhanced television "eye", in that everything's shot fairly plainly, although some of the mis-en-scene is used well for suspense.Really though, the film has few noticeable faults and manages to portray Harper Lee's classic in such a way that it retains many of its charms and all of its heart. It's very good; I recommend it. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Cinematic Masterwork About Human Fallibility in a World of Wearying Intolerance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having just read Charles Shields' biography of Harper Lee, "Mockingbird", and re-read her classic (and only) novel for at least the third time, I was able recently to watch Robert Mulligan's 1962 classic film adaptation with fresh eyes, and the 2005 Legacy Series Edition DVD fortunately contains a pristine print transfer and a bundle of extras that make repeated viewings more than worthwhile. Rarely has a film so accurately captured the emotional consequences of human fallibility steadfastly within the grip of racial intolerance. Set in the Deep South of Lee's childhood in the fictional town of Maycomb in 1932, the story, adapted by writer Horton Foote, focuses on six-year old Scout, the tomboy, motherless daughter of lawyer Atticus Finch.Along with her four-years older brother Jem, Scout regales the new neighbor boy Dill with horror stories about the bleak-looking Radley house and its chief occupant, "Boo", whom they believe has been locked up in the basement. Finch, in the meantime, has been given the unenviable task of defending Tom Robinson, a black man accused of raping Mayella, the cry-wolf daughter of a white trash racist farmer, Bob Ewell. The two stories meld seamlessly with the model behavior of Finch, who tries to teach his children not to come to judgment based on hearsay and perception. Facing great odds, Finch attempts to discredit Mayella on the stand, but Tom's sympathetic testimony proves to be his own undoing. Because of the town's pervasive racism, Finch loses the case, and tragic consequences ensue. However, life lessons for the children emerge as well as "Boo" in an unexpected heroic act.Gregory Peck gives his career-best performance as Finch, bringing the necessary human-sized dimensions to a most honorable man. It's inspiring work from a great screen legend. Mary Badham is wonderful as the inquisitive Scout never veering off toward precociousness in her acting, and almost as good is Philip Alford as Jem. Brock Peters plays Tom with palpable dignity, while James Anderson dexterously handles the unenviable task of playing the disturbingly vile Ewell. An almost-albino-looking Robert Duvall makes his film debut as "Boo" Radley, making his late appearance in the film impactful. I did not know that the remarkable Kim Stanley is the one who provides the voice-over for the grown-up Scout neé Jean Louise. Elmer Bernstein composed the sparse but resonate musical score, and Russell Harlan's black-and-white cinematography is effectively evocative. This masterwork is as good as family films get.The two-disc DVD set has a superb package of extras for any fan of the film and the book. Beyond providing an excellent print and audio transfer, the first disc contains a deeply insightful commentary track with full participation from Mulligan and the late producer, Alan J. Pakula, a superb director in his own right. There is also video footage of Peck's acceptance speech when he won the 1962 Best Actor Oscar for his role, his quite touching speech when he received the AFI's Lifetime Achievement Award in 1989, a tribute from his daughter Cecilia, a brief 1999 interview with the seldom-seen Badham, and the original theatrical trailer.The second disc offers a fascinating, ninety-minute 1998 documentary, "Fearful Symmetry", filmed effectively in black-and-white, which goes well beyond the standard making-of featurette. It includes interviews with Peck, Badham, Alford, Pakula, Mulligan, Foote and Bernstein, and paints a remarkably penetrating story of the production. There is a second feature, 1999's "A Conversation with Gregory Peck", directed by famed documentary filmmaker Barbara Kopple, which is actually a full-blown feature about the actor as he prepares for an onstage tribute. Providing revealing glimpses of the private man, it originally aired on PBS's "American Masters" series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They took something out of the tree to make this film, but they out something back into it too.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film classic adapted from a literary classic. Harper Lee's To Kill A mockingbird is one of my all-time favorite novels and Horton Foote successfully turned that novel into an Academy Award winning Best Screenplay for 1962. This film was nominated of 8 Oscars and won two. Besides Best Screenplay it earned Gregory Peck the Best Actor Oscar in the role of Atticus Finch. Child actress Mary Baham as Scout was nominated for best Supporting Actress but ironically lost out to another child actress Patty Duke for her role in The Miracle Worker. This is Peck's movie but it's also Badham's. Both are superb. This film was made in the contemporary time of the Pulitzer awarded novel and took on a giant task of bringing to the screen a beloved novel. It wasn't rushed to the screen however. This was done right. Robert Mulligan beautifully captured the look and feel of the book in this screen adaptation skillfully crafted by Foote. Perfect casting in Peck and Badham. A good supporting cast here with Robert Duvall, Alice Ghostley, William Windom, Frank Overton, Brock Peters and Estelle Evans. What can you say about this? Beloved, poignant, superb, timeless, endearing, artful, uplifting, heartwarming, tender, tragic? Say them all and give it a 10 out of a possible 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an amazing film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to express what an emotional experience seeing this movie was for me. How something done so simply can be so profound is beyond my limited abilities, but that's what "To Kill A Mockingbird" is, a simple, beautiful film with profound messages. It takes one back in time, to 1932 - and you don't for a minute doubt that you're there, in a small southern town. It shows us, through the eyes of imaginative and energetic children, what life was like. It also shows us a great man, Atticus Finch, and demonstrates through action the values with which this widower has raised his children: by the respect he shows his black housekeeper, in his taking of a controversial case involving the alleged rape of a white woman by a black man, and in the way he tells them what his father said, that it's wrong to kill a mockingbird, because they are only on earth to give joy and harm nothing and no one.The acting, of course, from top to bottom, is superb. The children - Mary Badham, Philip Alford, and John Megna, are perfect. Brock Peters gives a marvelous, sympathetic performance as the defendant. Gregory Peck delivers the performance of his lifetime in the role of anyone's lifetime.I'm glad to see that TCM has this film in its educational package for schools, because it should be seen by everyone.There are tough lessons in this world, Atticus points out. One of the toughest is one of the messages in this film, that it's not the Boo Radleys of the world we need to fear. Evil is, as Edmund Burke said, when good men do nothing. Atticus Finch wasn't one of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still As Close To Perfect As The Movies Have Ever Gotten to Mimicking Reality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From its unconventional main title sequence, celebrating the lost recesses of a child's imagination, to the quiet rectitude with which Gregory Peck transformed a seemingly soft spoken gentleman into the very pillar of masculine integrity, there was much to admire in Robert Mulligan's graceful production of To Kill A Mockingbird (1962). Based on the novel my Harper Lee, the film tells the story of a small town lawyer, Atticus Finch (Peck) and his unassuming determination to exonerate a black man, Tom Robinson (Brook Peters) from the false accusation of raping a white farm girl, Mayella Violet Ewell (Collin Wilcox). A seasoned critique of racial prejudice and family abuse, the story diverges from this public scandal into an intimate snapshot of family life from the period. Atticus's children Jem (Philip Alfort) and Scout (Mary Badham) share an unjustified fear and mistrust of mentally challenged neighborhood boy, Boo Hadley (Robert Duvall) in a secondary narrative that only serves to reinforce the story's central theme of tolerance. On every level, the film is a vintage class act. Small wonder then that in a recent AFI poll of the most popular screen heroes, Atticus Finch topped out at number one. Throughout the filming, Gregory Peck referred to a pocket watch to keep his character on time. The watch was a studio prop. But after Harper Lee saw the film she gave Peck a time piece belonging to her late father, on which Atticus was based, because his performance so reminded her of him. As an actor, Peck could have been paid no finer compliment.Universal was one of the very first companies to launch full force into the DVD market back in 1997, releasing a health sampling of contemporary and classic titles from their catalogue in only a few short months. But I am sure many will concur with the statement that most of these early releases were not of a quality or caliber suited to the full capabilities of the digital format. In fact, almost all were substandard. In this initial fray, Universal delivered To Kill A Mockingbird as a 'Collector's Edition' disc that featured a non-anamorphic transfer riddled with dirt and scratches, as well as the documentary "Fearful Symmetry." But now we get the film as one would expect it to be, cleaned up, remastered and presented 16X9 enhanced, and with all the bells and whistles one could hope for. To Kill A Mockingbird: The Legacy Series, presents the film's beautifully rendered B&amp;W image with a consistently clean transfer. Blacks are deep and rich. Whites are very bright, but never blooming. Fine details are realized throughout. The audio has been remixed to 5.1 surround, but is limited in its spread ? partly because this is mostly a dialogue driven movie (hence, no car chases or special effects to give your rear and side channels a work out), but more to the point, due to the limitations of sound recording circa 1962. Nevertheless, one will NOT be disappointed by this transfer ? a definite step up from Universal's initial effort.Extras on disc one include the film's original theatrical trailer and four tributary snippets. The first is Gregory Peck's rather lackluster Oscar acceptance speech. The last three are vintage tear jerkers; At the AFI's Life Time Achievement Award, Peck delivers a masterful four minute oration that unequivocally proves he's a true rarity in Hollywood; a gentleman of the first order. Next up is Cecilia Peck's loving (if slightly rambling) tribute to her late father, given during an academy dinner. Third up is Mary Badham's glowing and respectful reminiscence of working with Peck on the film. (Aside: one shouldn't expect much in the way of either audio or video quality on these extras. Of the above mentioned, the AFI Tribute exhibits the most pristine image and sound quality. Both the Badham and Peck tributes have a very poorly contrasted image (the latter also grainy) and with an extremely strident audio track. Peck's Oscar speech is the poorest of the batch.On disc 2 we get the previously issued "Fearful Symmetry" making of feature length documentary (which is really more of a retrospective on Harper Lee's home town than a true 'how the film was made'), and the all new "A Conversation with Gregory Peck" ? a thorough and comprehensive tribute to Peck chocked full of interviews. The image quality on both documentaries ranges from good to fair. Ditto for the audio.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Mulligan's adaptation of Harper Lee's beloved novel about the beauty of childhood and the ugliness of racism in a small southern town. Gregory Peck is lawyer Atticus Finch who defends a black man accused of raping a white woman. Atticus is a widower who is raising daughter Scout and son Jem. This movie perfectly depicts life in the small town South through the eyes of young Scout. The racial message of the film might lack the punch it had in the 1960's but the other story lines hold up. This is a quiet movie, much like Peck's Atticus character, that draws you in. The character of Dill the city boy who visits in the summer, is based on Truman Capote who Harper Lee knew when they were children. Robert Duval in his first, and tiny, role as the mysterious neighbor Boo Radley. #34 on the American Film Institute's 100 greatest films list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Screen legend Gregory Peck lights up the screen and steals the show in To Kill A Mockingbird. This is the classic movie based on the Pulitzer Prize winning novel. The story is very powerful as it shows how a white lawyer named Aticus Finch (Gregory Peck) defends a black man accused of rape in a racially divided town. The story also shows how he raises his children. He has a tomboy daughter named Scout, and an intelligent son named Jeremy. The meaning of To Kill A Mockingbird is great, but you have to watch it to figure out what the meaning of this classic film is. The character development is great as we see how Aticus Finch deals with his job difficulties, as well as life difficulties. Scout learns how to deal with people in her way, and Jeremy learns that as brave as he is, there is still danger and evil in the world.To Kill A Mockingbird is a classic and is wonderfully acted. Everyone should see this movie, whether they're young or old. Even though this is in black and white, kids might still enjoy watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another point of view</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To Kill A MockingbirdAs soon as I saw To Kill A Mockingbird, I started to understand the book better. Since seeing the movie, I realized one thing - to see a movie is to look at something from another point of view. If we take a look at the movie, we see that the director, Robert Mullingan, makes the movie and it contains his ideas. Most of the director's ideas come from the book it self, but the way the movie was produced makes it seem totally different. One thing that made me like the movie, was the way that Mary Balham and Philip Alford played Scout and Jem Finch. Second I also liked the setting, the cars and the houses are old. These things make the movie very real. The main idea, which is related to discrimination against black people, doesn't lose. It remains the same like in the book, and it is shown very well. This thing makes the ending of the movie to be good. Gregory Peck, who plays Atticus Finch's role, is the man who never fights back. He fights for goodness. Peck was not an anti-semitic man. He liked to be kind with every body. He also made a lot of good to people. This fact is proved by that he had a lot of friends. Gregory Peck is the man who insisted this movie be made, knowing that it was controversial. This movie shows white men with a bad face. Because he insisted to make the movie, he proves that he didn't care about the racial barrier. Peck was dedicated to be kind. Goodness characterized him because he choose to play the Atticus role. Atticus is a man who helps poor people like the Cunninghams or black people like Tom Robinson. To Kill A Mockingbird, the movie is made from somebody's point of view. If I should change something in the movie, first I would put more events from the book. One example was when Jem, then Scout found in tree some things, or when Nathan Radley shouted in the air. The movie would be longer, but it would be complex. Another thing that I would change is clothing for people who are supposed to be poor. It would be more like in the book. To make the movie closer to the book I would replace Robert Duvall, who was Boo Readily. I would change him with another, uglier actor. One thing that made the movie to be real was the setting. The setting was very good realized, with old houses and cars. The town was fictitious, but the movie is so good that you cannot figure out that the setting is not real. The next thing that made the movie real is the actors. The children act and look almost like the book describes them. Scout and Jem are children, with who is hard to make a movie, but they acted like they were in reality. In conclusion I want to emphasize one idea. To understand To Kill A Mockingbird, you have to look at the movie from another point of view. The movie is real because it contains the main idea from the book. The actors act very realistic. A good example is Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you want to see a movie for the goodness of the movie, don't see this one. It is a total adaption of the book. There are many of the same exact lines, and everything is the very same as in the book, including the characters and and setting. But, for an adaption of the story, it was very good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully shot, moving and faithful to the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To start with, the book is absolutely wonderful with great characters and a moving story. To Kill a Mockingbird is one of the best adaptations of a book, it is not only faithful to the source material but it almost improves on it. Do I have any criticisms? Not really, other than to say that the film is a tad overlong for my liking. But it is a brilliant film, with a beautifully crafted story that still maintains the emotional punch of the book about a lawyer in the Deep South and the effect of the rape trial on his children. The film is beautifully shot, the whole film is incredible to watch, and the score is sensitive. The script is effective and sticks closely to the book, and the direction from Robert Mulligan is very impressive. The acting is really good, I have read that Henry Fonda would have been better for Atticus Finch, although Fonda was a great actor, Gregory Peck does give a superb and career-best performance in this film. And he is very well supported by an excellent Robert Duvall as disturbed Boo Radley, while Mary Badham and Phillip Alford are very well-cast as the children. Overall, a wonderful and faithful adaptation and just an excellent film really. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hmmm,...what hasn't already been said about this film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While occasionally my reviews go on and on and on, this one simply doesn't need to be exhaustive, as so much has already been said about this film and it has received so many accolades. Most everyone knows that this film is a classic and it deserves a fine reputation--particularly for the fine acting and writing as well as its social impact.Peck plays a small town lawyer who has been assigned to defend a Black man who has been accused of raping a White woman--a pretty tough subject for an American film of the era. The defense of this man and the town's prejudice is all seen through the eyes his children--making this film an excellent one to show children, though its appeal is universal (unless you are an avowed racist, I guess).Peck was one of the greatest actors of his age and perhaps apart from 12 O'CLOCK HIGH and possibly the underrated BIG COUNTRY, this was his greatest film role. See this and see him at his best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fine Classic Whose Meaning Goes Well Beyond the Story Itself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A fine adaptation of a fine novel, "To Kill A Mockingbird" not only brings the story and its characters to life, but also creates a world whose meaning and significance go well beyond the story itself. Gregory Peck gives what might be his finest - and what almost certainly is his best-remembered - performance, yet he is only one of several strong points of the movie.It's understood that the movie version is going to be somewhat different from the book, yet this adaptation is very well-conceived in its selections from the novel and in achieving what it sets out to do. It concentrates on the Tom Robinson case and on the children's exploration of their neighborhood, and it meshes these story-lines together nicely.The main themes of justice, acceptance, and related ideas are obviously of great importance, and yet what helps this movie to stand out from so many others that promote the same values is that it does not stop at simply re-affirming right and wrong, but puts these and other issues into a framework, a way of looking at the world.Almost the whole movie is viewed from the world of the children, and it is not the over-simplified or stereotyped world of most children's stories, but rather a world where so many things seem so much larger and so much more mysterious than they seem to adults. The true mystery and curiosity of a child's world is hard to capture either in print or on film, but from the very beginning "To Kill a Mockingbird" effectively helps its viewers to look at things from that kind of a perspective.Peck's performance works very well, especially with this in mind. Most of the time, he allows the issues to speak for themselves, not indulging in theatrics or emotion, even to make the most important of points. For this reason, on those few occasions when he does become more vehement, those moments are that much more effective. The child actors, especially Mary Badham, are a perfect complement to Peck, and Robert Duvall's brief appearance fits in wonderfully.Both the original book and this movie version are quite worthwhile, and there's no reason to have to choose between the two. Both of them succeed admirably in their own sphere, and both add their own dimensions to the story, the characters, and the world that they live in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boo Radley--American hero</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have lived with this movie, and the novel on which it is based, most of my life. My parents took us kids to see this movie first run, figuring the I was too young to understand the disturbing, crucial courtroom scenes about rape and racism. The parents were right. I fell asleep. Scary movie for a little kid! Very Southern Gothic, beautifully shot. I was riveted during the early scenes with the kids. The scary Boo house and the soap figurines made a big impression on me. I slept though the middle of the movie, so at the very end, I thought the skulking but kindly Boo was still scary. I now realize that he's the most wonderful person in the story. He is the Mockingbird.I read the book as soon as I could read, and again, skipped over just about everything but the kid portions of the novel. What great episodes, and what beautiful writing. Since then, I read the book at least once a decade and see the movie whenever I can. Had I been a teen when the movie first came out I would have wanted to protest the "Stand up Jean Louise, your father's passin' by " scene--a little too adorable and grateful, is that Negro pastor. This movie's set in the lynch era, but it was released during the the brave civil rights era. Black citizens were laying their lives on the line at that time. Some White people were out there, but not nearly as many. So the movie's emphasis on the middle aged white dicty hottie lawyer, who will save us all, is a bit skewed.All the posters who claim to love the book, yet say that the movie is enough, frustrate me. Please read the book once every decade of your life. You will have grown, and, strangely the book will have grown. And bless you posters for mentioning powerful characters in the book, like the horrible Mrs. DuBose, who never made it to the screen.Since my last re-read, I am struck as never before, by Dill literally becoming sick about racism during the trial.But such a rich book has to be condensed for movie length, and Mulligan and Foote have presented the best. Happy ending: Fishbellywhite alienated southerner loner kills racist with big knife because the racist attempts to kill a small girl dressed as a ham.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRDTo Kill A Mockingbird is a good trial movie, about interesting themes like racism, respect, compassion, and different social classes. It is a very good movie, especially if you like trial movies. It also has good actors. Even though it is an old movie, it is a good one. Also, this movie won many awards. Here on imdb it has a good percentage of high user rating. In my opinion, I like the book more than the movie.I like this movie because it is very realistic. One of my favorite parts is the trial, which was sad but interesting. Even though Tom Robinson had a good lawyer and he was a good man, he struggled. Another thing that I like is Scout's character. She is good and very funny sometimes. Although I don't like old movies, this one was good.One of the aspects of To Kill A Mockingbird that I most appreciate is Atticus Finch, played by Gregory Peck. He does a perfect performance in the movie. He is not only a good actor. He was also a good person and friend. That's why he had a Kennedy Center Honors in 1991. He made lots of good movies, so he was very famous. He brought greatness to this film with his personality and with his good acting ability.Even though it is a good movie there are some things that I would change. I dislike the movie because it is in black and white, and it is old. I don't like that kind of movie at all. I think they are boring, and you can appreciate the movie better if it is in color. I would change when Atticus killed the dog, I don't think that they have to kill the dog just because it is sick. I don't really like the end because I think that it could be more interesting to the audience.I recommend this movie to everyone. I think that every single person would be satisfied after seeing the movie. It is very interesting and it is full of emotions, it could make you cry, feel happy, mad, etc. I also recommend reading the book; in my opinion it is better than the movie, it has some passages that the movie doesn't. To Kill A Mockingbird is a good story; you are going to love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great classic by most measures.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Kill/Mockingbird' is in black and white, has a simple story, and it does not turn out as one would hope. So, why is it so highly regarded? I asked that question on the IMDb classics board. While I received a variety of responses, the two most telling were ... (1) It is a movie that follows the book very closely. (2) It tells a story of a level-headed man who stays calm and does the right thing during a time when racial and other prejudices were in full form.The title comes from a conversation where Atticus tells his kids that it is OK to shoot Bluejays, but not a Mockingbird because they don't harm anything and just sing nice songs. This can also be applied to the black man who is being tried for rape, and to Boo Radley who is shy but helpful.SPOILERS follow - Atticus Finch is a lawyer in the small, poor southern town, and is asked to defend the black man accused of rape of a white girl. He carefully builds his case, proves to everyone that the man was innocent, and the girl was in fact likely a victim of abuse from her rotten dad. But in the racially-charged atmosphere the jury convicts him anyway, and he is 'accidently' killed as he is taken to prison. Justice is soon served when the rotten dad dies in an altercation. The bulk of the movie examines relationships between Atticus and his children, and the other townspeople.</fullReview>

It's a great movie based on an equally great book by Harper Lee. A lot of parts from the book are missing from the movie but nothing too important so it doesn't take away from the core of the story.Technically Scout is the main character and the story revolves around her, but Gregory Peck really steals the show as Atticus Finch. He is just amazing to watch. I was surprised to read on this site that Robert Duvall plays Boo Radley. I really couldn't recognize him. Still Can't.What else can I say?

		<shortDescription>It's a Classic, But...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...to be honest I expected a bit more: Having heard so much praise for "To Kill A Mockingbird" since my childhood, and with the added fact that it enjoys a permanent position in IMDb's top 250, I had very high expectations for this classic film. However, when I recently watched it, I was somewhat deflated: Expecting a 9/10 or 10/10 film, I could barely give it a 7/10. Here is why:"TKAM" is about the story of Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck), an idealistic lawyer in America's South, who defends a wrongly accused black man (B. Peters) during the depression era; his passionate defense drives him to face the hostility of his racist fellow citizens. Although the story sounds like a courtroom drama, in fact it is hardly such: The plot revolves around the everyday life of the two little kids of Finch (M. Badham and P. Alford), with the trial being rather out of focus, and portrayed in a piecemeal way.This last point is the grave weakness of the film, at least in my humble opinion. Everything else is fine: The acting is superb (with the two children definitely stealing the show, despite Peck's indisputable calibre), the atmosphere of the small city is skillfully presented, and of course, the anti-racist message of the movie is powerful. Yet, the problem is that "TKAM" continuously preoccupies us with the children's games and mischiefs, thus distracting us from following soberly (a) the capture and trial of the accused man, (b) the clash between Finch and his co-villagers, and (c) the clarification of what finally happened and who is responsible. In other words, the film fails to keep the focus on where I believe it should remain from the beginning to end: Finch, the defendant, and the community.I am aware that at the time when this film was produced (early sixties), the issue of racism was still considered a taboo, and thus the launch of "TKAM" probably would touch sensitive cords; perhaps this explains the rather childish and melodramatic approach used by its producers, as they were possibly trying to take off some heat from its core message. This might be OK for the sixties, seventies, or even eighties. Yet, by watching it in 2004, I definitely left only partially satisfied. "TKAM" is a classic, yes: But if it had been produced today from scratch, I believe it would be much more focused and coherent.</fullReview>

For example the important scene in the book were the white children are challenged in the church was not included. Calpurnia, and most of the black actors in the movie had next to nothing to say. This stopped the viewer from getting to know the black people. The only time a black person gets to say his opinion is in the court. The killer line, "The meanest person god ever blew breath into" was said by the wrong person and lost it's impact. Basically I think that all people should read the book to get a better idea of what Harper-Lee was trying to show in her book. The movie doesn't reflect this. Read the book first.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am very sorry to say that I must give this classic film a rare negative review. I love most classic movies from the 40's through to the 60's inclusive, but unfortunately I did not enjoy this one very much. I know that it is widely regarded as a classic piece of cinema, and a wonderful book and story, up there with the likes of '12 Angry Men' or 'Casablanca', but to me it didn't compare with these films. I picked up the DVD a couple of months ago, and was all prepared to see a wonderful picture that I had heard great things about. Perhaps wrongly, I expected a great and triumphant court battle for the human rights of a wrongly-accused man, a black man at that. I am sorry to say that this expectation was too high, and that what I saw was a fairly half-hearted collection of courtroom discussions, surrounded by the goings-on of a couple of children in Depression America, along with the actions of some bigots. I know that many of you will say that it's not a story about the court drama, but about life in the Depression, and I acknowledge that to be true having seen the movie, but I think that the court-case should have been the central theme, and it could have been so much more. I acknowledge that Gregory Peck's performance is great as far as it goes, but I feel that it was constrained by a slightly insipid storyline. He, of course, makes the movie, and to me it would not even be watchable but for his presence. I have given the film a 5 rating, mostly because of Mr Peck's work, but I think that his talents were let down by the rest of the production. If you compare his appearance here with his work in Cape Fear, which was done in the same year, the two are very different; (in that movie Mr Peck did a brilliant job, showcasing the full range of his talents). I say sorry to the rest of you who love this film, but sometimes a movie just doesn't come up to expectations, and I just couldn't get into this one. It is very slow and very boring!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I felt really disappointed with this film, the kids in the film kept getting most of the spotlight and we don't even get to the court case till half way through the film and to my disappointment Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck) lost the case and then somehow afterwards the black guy who was tried guilty ends up dead not long afterwards, and then something ridiculous happens in the end that makes no bloody sense. It was a Halloween night and one of the kids is dressed up as a giant ham (really?) and then all a sudden this guy attacks them and then another guy comes in out of nowhere to save them and kills the guy who tried to hurt them and sooner or later we see the guy who saved them. OK, who the hell is this guy? The court part was the only good highlight of the film, the rest is just the daily lives of a few kids, ergh, this film is actually not good at all, a really overrated film.By the way, Atticus is not really a heroic guy, sure he defends a black man accused of a crime and won't fight back if spat on, yet he kills a dog with a gun that everyone assumes has rabies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gregory Peck's performance as Atticus Finch is one of the most enduring in all of film history. In addition to his role as Ahab in Moby Dick, it is not unfair to say he may have presented his fans with 2 of the greatest and most believable screen performances ever. Examine the contrast involved between the two. Atticus Finch: The quiet, self retiring Southern defense attorney, and Ahab: The quintessential, domineering Type A control freak. His sense of timing and understanding of the roles are exceptional. The heroism of Atticus shines thru with barely a raised voice. The villainy of Ahab would be considered completely over the top if attempted by any other actor. As the foundation and central hub of these films he makes the other actors around him simply shine in their own performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Important for the messages that it gives</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't read the novel that it is inspired from, but I think the film isn't as good as the book. Because long interrogation scenes in law court make you get asleep. Most remarkable thing that we can observe is that the film turns around Gregory Peck and two little stars.A widower lawyer Atticus Finch has got two little children who are Jem and Scout seeming like a boy. Atticus has to do his job in the town and also he takes cares of his little two children. The children are so naughty and disturb their mysterious neighbour Radley. At that point, name of the film appears with the words which spilled from Atticus' mouth. However much a mockingbird doesn't harm to nothing or nobody, there is no objection to shout it because of doing nothing from warbling. But at the end of the film, while Radley saves his children from Bob Ewell's attack because of Ewell's grudge for his defence of Tom Robinson, Radley becomes a mockingbird and Atticus feel a great regret.Examining the scenes partly, a man's payment to Atticus with crops because of his misery and children's efforts for defense their father who guard for his client Tom Robinson are so amazing.One criticize for the Robert Mulligan is the length of lawcourt scene and of course it deserves to be in 250's by the message that it gives.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie while I was reading the novel, and the movie did a great job; it was literally as great as the novel. Gregory Peck won a well deserved Oscar for playing Atticus Finch, the lawyer in 1930s Alabama who is defending a black man wrongly accused of rape. The important point is that in the Deep South in the '30s, it was unheard of (not to mention dangerous) for a white man to defend a black man. But the story is told from the point of view of his daughter Scout (Mary Badham), who gets taunted at school; everyone tells her that her daddy defends (N-words). One of the most touching scenes in "To Kill a Mockingbird" is when Atticus has to explain to Scout the whole situation and what the greater ramifications could be.I can't say with words how wonderful this movie is. I think that it was the first movie to deal with the race issue in America (at least the first major one). Some people have said that Gregory Peck's face belongs on a dollar bill, and I have to agree, judging from "To Kill a Mockingbird".</fullReview>

Gregory Peck's portrayal is flawless. The supporting cast also deliver astounding performances, especially Brock Peters as Tom Robinson, Collin Wilcox Paxton as Mayella Ewell and James Anderson as Bob Ewell (who apparently was very frightening and disturbing to the other actors on set!)

		<fullReview>A small-town lawyer (Gregory Peck, Oscar-winning) defends a young black man accused of rape in depression-era Alabama in this outstanding and thought-provoking motion picture. Peck tries to show his two young children (one Oscar-nominated Mary Badham) that prejudice has no place in a world that we all share together. He also proves that the way a person looks does not show who the person really is inside. Robert Mulligan (Oscar-nominated) finally found his niche as a director as he had struggled throughout his career with interesting, but somewhat obscure productions that never found a cinematic audience. "To Kill a Mockingbird" was vastly important for 1962 America as racial unrest and the Civil Rights Movement dominated the headlines. The film is a smart production that stood very tall against other competition from the year of its release ("Lawrence of Arabia" and "The Longest Day") and still stands tall as one of the finest films the American cinema has ever developed. 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mockingbird's 40th Year!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is definitely near the very top of my all-time favorite films! Quite a few of my friends have not seen "To Kill a Mockingbird". I have been surprised at how many of them have responded:"Oh, ' To Kill a Mockingbird '.............I saw the remake with Matthew McConaughey and Sandra Bullock!: ' A Time To Kill' ".Though I actually loved that 1996 flick with McConaughey and Bullock, I still feel that it's a bit of an insult to suggest that "A Time To Kill" is the same movie as "To Kill a Mockingbird" (or that it even approximates the older story). There are totally different characters, with totally different personalities in "Mockingbird". The story is similar only in a few superficial ways. One clearly comes away with a truly unique flavor in "Mockingbird"; "A Time To Kill" cannot really hold a candle to this Gregory Peck masterpiece (Peck himself has said that this was his favorite film-----and that being offered this role was the luckiest day of his life).I am glad that, though this movie came out in 1962, they chose to shoot it in black and white. A completely different mood comes out, by presenting this movie in those softer, darker colors. "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane" also came out in 1962; it was a black and white movie as well. I recall reading that Bette Davis talked to that film's producer, and threw her support behind the idea of filming that story without color (again to create a darker mood).Actually, there are at least three things that a black and white "Mockingbird" does. One: it complements the serious and tragic tone of the story. Two: it complements some of the childhood memories which are rather spooky and akin to a horror movie. Three: This is, after all, 1932 Macon, Georgia. The black and white colors do kind of take us back to a world which no longer exists (and a world which was right in the middle of the Great Crash/Depression). Many people who were adults, then (or were children having to pitch in during this national crisis), developed a completely different mindset; a mindset that so many of us will never know (of course the Depression aspect is greatly overshadowed, in this film, by the theme of a Black man accused of impropriety with a White woman in the early 30s Deep South).It is hard to know where to begin, with a movie of this great caliber. I will just throw some of my thoughts out, and let the chips fall where they may. I thought that the theme song for "Mockingbird", which begins and ends the film, was truly an incredibly beautiful song. At the end of the film this music is like a song of TRIUMPH! It is also a very TOUCHING song. Elmer Bernstein, the composer of this music, said in a documentary that he was going for a kind of child-like tune-----one in which a child would just be playing around with a few keys on a piano. Mr. Bernstein certainly transformed that tune into a very sentimental piece, that kind of tugs at your heart strings.The first time that I saw this movie, I was not paying complete attention, and I thought that one of Atticus Finch's (the lead character played by Gregory Peck) loved one's had died, on account of the unpopular stance that he took. I teared up, as the movie closed out with that powerful music (not realizing that "good" had almost completely overtaken "evil", here).Of course I cannot comment on "Mockingbird" without alluding to Gregory Peck's Atticus Finch. What a wonderfully noble and good man! You could say, more specifically, that he was a wonderful father (especially raising two children as a widower, and a very busy attorney). Of all the moving and powerful interactions he had with his children, what impressed me most was how he reasoned with them as if they were little adults (rather than "children"). He never seemed to talk down to them. He tried to talk (and negotiate) with them, as close as he could, to one of his peers (a very interesting irony, since both his children called him "Atticus" and not Dad or Daddy!).You couldn't help but respect Atticus for taking on such an unpopular case, during that Era (and in that part of the country). He even told his daughter:"If I didn't take this case, I couldn't hold my head up in town! I couldn't even tell you and Jem, not to do something that was wrong!"Atticus knew that someone had to take this case and he accepted it. He also truly believed that his client was innocent (Tom Robinson, a strong, young Black man, accused of raping a White, Southern Belle). His performance in the court room (including his closing statement) was stellar! It was riveting to hear that powerful, dramatic Peck voice, as he went to bat for his client!Near the end of the film, one of Atticus' neighbors said to his young son, Jem:"Jem, there are some men who are born to do our unpleasant tasks........Your father is one of them."In a small way Atticus Finch seemed to symbolize Christ, when I considered this. Though he did not actually lose his life, doing what was right came at an extremely heavy cost to himself and his family.There is a whole lot more to this movie, than just the proverbial racial strife between African-Americans and Whites. I encourage anyone who feels this way to give this film a chance. Hopefully it will speak to you (and more importantly, MOVE YOU), as it did me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I downloaded a DVD version few days ago to watch this movie, to see what's all the fuss about. And i simply can't understand what was so great about it, where was "the moving" part everybody is talking about? I agree, good acting, some palpitating scenes, but everything moved so fast, one time you're watching the kids how they spent their childhood, the next minute there's his father defending a black man who was accused of raping a white woman, people of which wasn't anything mentioned in the first half of the movie. They just randomly jumped in and started making part of the film. I really cannot understand the reviews of this title, "a movie which will remain in history", "incredibile", what the hell was so incredible ? Please tell me, i feel stupid. OK, maybe this was a good movie at it's time, with good performances for that age, but its absolutely nothing spectacular compared to nowadays movies. I believe all of the good reviews were posted by old people, who watched this in their childhood and seemed spectacular now to re watch it, but definitely boring by today's standard's. This movie will eventually go down in the years coming, it certainly will. Except for the good acting, absolutely nothing did impress me, 6/10 for the sake of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Actually, I have read the novel before watching the movie, and I think the book is better than the film. In my opinion, the film wasn't fully capable of bringing the origin author, Harper-Lee was trying to express, since some parts from the novel were left out, making the events rather irrelevant to the book. Another thing is that the focusing was not so appropriate: the focus should be put on the rape trial; but in the film, the rape trial was rather sketchy. However, the junior actors (the children) acted well, as well as Gregory Peck (as Atticus). In conclusion, the film is generally acceptable, but not so eminent at all.I would give it a 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

Yes there's racism in the South, but we don't need to learn about it through some stupid movie. I'd rather eat dirt than watch that "movie" again! So if you haven't seen this long, black and white, sad excuse for a movie, save yourself a couple hours and do something that's actually worth your 80 years on this planet.

		<shortDescription>A Classic...? Really?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally saw this movie last night after I checked it out at my local library. This is a wonderful service of our state tax dollars, loading up on a bunch of DVD's that we all can check out for free. Anyways, I checked out this movie as it is called by most movie fan's as a classic and supposedly one of Gregory Peck's greatest roles, especially since he won an Academy Award for his performance. Without going into a lengthy review, I will say that I went in expecting a riveting, profound movie with excellent court scenes throughout most of the movie. While there is some genuinely interesting, thoughtfully written and superbly executed court drama going on, it couldn't have been more than 25 minutes of this two-hour movie. The remains of the time goes to the two children and what they get themselves into while Atticus is off at the courtroom. While that would have been perfectly fine for say, 30 minutes or so, it runs rampant at nearly 90 minutes of the movie. This was honestly astounding as I thought this was going to be a courtroom drama with minimal activity outside of it. This was hardly the case. Still, it is far from a bad movie, and the scenes with the children are entertaining in their simplicity of a time long since gone. And Peck, while a bit emotionally stunted (as usual), still does a very good job in his role (though I am interested in the quality of the other Oscar-nominated actors from that year because I don't see Peck's role as an Oscar winner, rather just Nomination-worthy.6/10.</fullReview>

I've watched it a few times and this flick never ceases to amaze me.

		<fullReview>I remember really enjoying Harper Lee's novel when I read it more than 25 years ago. The film is pretty good, I guess. The child actors all did wonderfully. Gregory Peck did well enough as Atticus Finch, although I'm not sure it was an Oscar-worthy performance. The whole rape trial sequence seems overly preachy to me now. I suppose that in the early '60's there may have been people unaware of the realities of Jim Crow, but nowadays it has been forced down everyone's throat for decades. The heroic liberal fighting injustice is a theme whose time has long passed, and viewing TKAM now hasn't the sort of impact that I imagine it did then. Grade: C</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently re-read To Kill a Mockingbird and was as enchanted and charmed as ever by this wonderfully didactic fairy tale. It sounds funny to call it a fairy tale, but it's not a full out great novel, either. Maybe it is something that exists somewhere in between, delighting readers and challenging critics. ("Coming of age novel" minimizes it.) Scout Finch is arguably the most charming female character in American fiction in the second half of the century, and the heart of the book is really her narration, and how she relates to everyone in her world, particularly her father. Through Scout's eyes we see the changing humanity of her older brother Jem. The author goes to great lengths to make Scout as adorable as possible and yes she is a little bit in love with her childhood self.The book, set in the 30s, is flavored by the coming pressures of the times in which it was written, the 1950s and 60s. The living room conversations among the women about the differences between North and South in their treatment of blacks were very recognizable. But, the book's power, for me, does not lie in the Tom Robinson trial and his subsequent fate, true as it was. That part moved along predictably enough, and Atticus weathers the town's outrages nobly, holding the klieg light steady for all who so choose to see the way out of darkness. No one does.Strangely, there was no portrayal of a married couple, to my reading. Most of the adult male characters' wives had died, and the women either lived alone or with a maid. Maybe it was meant to convey the dying South or maybe it reflects the author's own life or her assessment or faith (or lack of it) in the future of the South.Still, To Kill a Mockingbird is a portrayal of a once noble family, and a very decent family, grounded in some pretty good values and going out to experience life eagerly and with honor, not shrinking from anything.It's not a work of Great Fiction but there is something about it in line with great American works. What that something is, is hard to pin down. Maybe it is the richness in every sentence, the warmth and understanding. The recognizable history, the sweep of years and ages that one phrase embodies and evokes, and the nostalgia it stirs up. Maybe it is the everyday poetry of the language, instantly recognizable as classic American writing. Maybe it is the completely true characters, each one unique in a land where conformity was valued and enforced.The film necessarily cuts out a significant portion of the book but for the most part the choices made for what was left in are good ones. Still, the omissions include the development of important characters (Miss Maudie, Mrs DuBose, and Calpurnia among others), while other characters are left out entirely (Aunt Alexandra). A lot of family back-story is also cut. The result is that the outlines are there (albeit with some pretty steep mountains in the background!) and that seems to have satisfied a good many people.Phillip Alford as Jem was unquestionably the best casting choice of this movie, while Mary Badham's pampered background shows through. I picked up on a sullen, mocking reluctance in scenes requiring a demonstration of affection and lovingness. Alford, more down-home, does just fine, and is all boy, with a lovely voice. Dill is hardly anyone's notion of a beautiful child contest winner and is clearly not Southern. Peck certainly looks the part of Atticus Finch, and while Atticus clearly is a reserved man, I don't think he is a dead one. Too bad the one actor who most looked the part, the freckle-faced, tow-headed Walter Cunningham, did not also sound it.Perhaps it is the experience of watching the movie so soon after having read the book. There simply is no comparison. Read the book! It is so much better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie, it is one of my favorite movies. I think it is one of the funniest movies ever. The first time I saw it I was laughing so hard that I couldn't breathe. Gregory Peck and John Megna are so funny together. Frank Overton is also great with his "wigger" scenes and as a man who has been duped in online dating. Who else could have played such a great role? Nobody!Cinematically speaking, the story is like an extremely well-crafted painting where the smallest, seemingly insignificant details are made noticeable in a device used by Mulligan to allow us to laugh at Peck's crazy antics and Overton's goofy faces!This movie may lack a few things but what it lacks is definitely made up for in comedic relief. If you have a dry sense of humor or aren't funny in the least, you won't like this movie. But for those who do know comedy when they see it will definitely laugh. I've a sore throat from laughing so hard after just watching this movie 20 minutes ago. I give this movie 2 thumbs up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Imperfect, Populist 'Must-See Classic'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a film student, I have known about 'To Kill a Mockingbird' for ages. My father had a copy on our bookshelf while I was growing up (he was a voracious reader). I was always puzzled by the title, and had no idea what the story was about. And, I had known about the film for many years, but had put it off - even though I'm a fairly big Gregory Peck fan. So I finally bought the DVD, and I must agree with that gentleman from Troy, NY. A lot of his comments are right on the mark. However, I disagree with his attack on the Finch legacy. Yes, their ancestors probably owned slaves, and that was no doubt the base for their family economy and fortune. But to fault them as being hypocrites; this is unfair. Can you say that all liberals in the South are hypocrites? No! Someone has to turn the tide in such a racially volatile area. However, the film takes its sweet time developing, and there is a severe lack of conflict in the first half, and even the second half. I think much of this is due to the smarmy portrayal of the children, and the obvious idyllic life in their small town. Also, the characters on both sides are too black and white (no pun intended!). Although James Anderson does a SUPERB job playing Bob Ewell (He made me hate that character so much!), this is a stereotype. Also, the blacks in the film are southern stereotypes too. They're all humble, forgiving, obedient, etc. It would've been nice to see an angry young man or woman amongst them. Also, I thought that in the novel Mayell finally confesses she committed perjury, but there's no evidence of this in the film. So, I give this a '7' for the acting, production values, and direction. I enjoyed it somewhat the first time, but now I feel I watched it more out of duty than anything else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD (1962) **** Gregory Peck, Mary Badham, Philip Alford, Brock Peters. Top notch adaptation of Harper Lee's novel about an Alabama lawyer Atticus Finch (Peck, Best Actor, in the role of his career and the epitome of integrity) a mild-mannered widower/father facing the case of his life: defending a black man accused of rape. Dramatic in scope but a life-affirming tale of adolescence and life lessons. Robert Duvall, in his film debut, is the misunderstood reclusive neighbor Boo Radley in one of the film's finer moments. Directed smartly by Robert Mulligan in the less is more approach to filmmaking (who was nominated as well as Badham as Scout in a beautifully modulated performance of loss of innocence personified and nominations for Best Picture also). Oscars went to Horton Foote for his screenplay adaptation and art direction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Catechism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Boy, is this movie confused or what? Almost a movie of two halves, and like all such movies doomed to have one half weighed against the other, a case where neither half wins but both lose, TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD begins as a sort of southern Gothic reverie not unlike Charles Laughton's iconic NIGHT OF THE HUNTER. A pervading atmosphere you can almost smell of hot wet summer nights and a sense of childlike wonder and mystery, that uncanny ability of children to find the macabre in the ordinary, the fantastical in the mundane, which we all return to again and again in our creative moments as adults; this, I think is Mockingbird's biggest asset, its charm and beauty. Not the courtroom scene that hijacks the movie halfway through, not the subplot of racism and smalltown bigotry in a rural Southern community and not even Gregory Peck (whom I find almost unbearable). The real stars here are the children.I have no doubt in my mind that at some not so distant point, the movie was not only educational but important. The message still is. But, having progressed thankfully to the point where racism should really be a non-issue (although often it's not), Atticus' catechism in the courtroom seems to be stating the obvious. That it's not exactly layered throughout the movie, that the movie itself makes such an about-turn when it enters the courtroom, makes it stand out like a sore thumb. As a reminder of what were and could be again, no doubt it's still relevant. But in the context of a dramatic movie it is a bit of a false note.We're lucky then that the movie reverts back to the great first half for its climactic conclusion. I haven't read the book to know how well the story works there as a whole, but this seems to me like a missing opportunity. The world of the adults seems awfully uninvolving compared to that of the children, the one full of magic and possibility. Maybe contrasting the two was kind of the point.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's no doubt that in the time this movie was released, it made quite an impact, an in many aspects it's still a good movie. The anti-racist message this movie carries might not be as bold as when the movie was released, but since racism is still happening around the world, it never hurts to warn against it. No problems here.Overall, the movie also makes a well-made impression. The acting is good (I'm surprised that a movie this old sports such good performances by children), telling everything from the perspective of the little girl work surprisingly well, too, and the movie is very honest and direct, without the sentimentality or audience manipulation you'd probably see in (most) modern movies about such serious themes. However, I think this movie hasn't aged particularly well. By now, we've just come to expect a bit more of movies in terms of plot and cinematography. In "To Kill a Mockingbird" the plot is rather simple, the pacing very slow (with way too much time spent on the children and their games), and the cinematography very static. Ultimately, "To Kill a Mockingbird" is still a well-made, genuinely honest and touching movie with a message that manages to still be quite good in spite of its (when compared to modern movies) cozy pacing, static cinematography, and somewhat simple plot*** out of **** stars</fullReview>

After watching the first ten minutes I literally had to double check the DVD case to make sure I was watching the correct movie. . .this is a classic? Trying to enjoying it, I kept telling myself, "It was made in the early sixties. Movie standards were different back then. Scripts weren't as tight. Viewers didn't demand details that made the movies realistic. Etc.etc." Well, that didn't help. In a word, the movie was just plain hokey.I swear, the reason this movie got such acclaim at the time is because the main character stood up for a black man in court who was accused of raping a white women. It's because it championed a black man, and showed how evil some southern white folks could be. If it would have been a white man who'd been wrongly accused of raping white woman I'm sure the media and viewers would have not given it a second thought. This is not a great movie by any means, in any era.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>disturbing, but not for the reasons (probably) intended</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this film several times over the years, from childhood to middle age. I used to like it better, as a child, than I do now, as a middle-aged woman. Parts of the film, most notably the lyrical and sometimes humorous treatment of childhood and maturation, remain moving and beautiful. The segments about the unbalanced neighbor are just as scary for me today as in the 1960's. I wish to raise a point on which I will concede that I am acutely sensitive. What bothers me about this film (and probably would about the book, tho' I haven't read it) is its treatment of the white woman and her allegation--namely, that she must (of course!) be lying. I'm well aware that there was and is plenty of racism in our society, and that grave injustices have been and sometimes still are committed. However, all too often members of society seek to "make up" (as tho' that were possible) for past injustices by inflicting new ones, or to use this line of reasoning as an excuse to not deal with real problems. I spent 17 1/2 years in school and I've been in the working world for a quarter-century in several different organizations; in all of these places, I've experienced a lot of harassment, both physical and verbal. I can assure you that even today, supervisors, coworkers, the whole personnel and management apparatus will do practically anything to avoid having to deal with harassment, particularly sexual harassment, just as they failed to deal effectively with it in any of the schools I attended. To use a legal term, the burden of proof rests squarely on the accuser, to report, document, and (my personal favorite!), explain why the person would do what he's doing, rather than put the harasser on notice that his behavior is totally unacceptable and must stop. No, instead these caring/sharing/wonderful folks in society want to examine your words and deeds to see whether you did anything to provoke the harasser. Then come the excuses; he's having problems at home/school/work, so you should exercise a little forbearance when he hits you, screams obscenities at you, and otherwise treats you like dirt. Or, he comes from a "different culture" (which, near as I can tell, is code for he's from somewhere--perhaps from somewhere as nearby as his own head--where it's OK to treat girls and women as 3 steps lower than a goat--who knows, maybe it's just your perceptions that are off!). So, these sweetly reasonable, compassionate people imply that it's OK for him to scream, or hit, or kick you. Of course the problem isn't that he doesn't choose to exercise the ordinary self-control required of civilized beings, or that the powers that be, thru their excuses and inaction, tacitly but nevertheless clearly communicate to him that it's OK to continue behaving this way. It's rather as if they want to balance the whole burden of society's past problems on your back! Of course they can preach to you in this offensive way--after all, it's Just you it's happening to, not them! Observe what happened to Anita Hill at the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings. If that disgraceful episode proved anything, it's that women are the only group in America that it's still OK to treat badly. I realize that in this film, the viewer is supposed to know that the accused man is innocent, not guilty. I just wish the powers that be, the PC crowd, could've used some other example to show this. And I wish that some of the admiring viewers could discern the major flaw in this film.</fullReview>

The acting was DREADFUL. I ended up turning the movie off before it ended because i could not handle such a beautiful book be chopped and messed around with as badly as it was. The movie was such a disappointment i cannot wait for it to be remade by someone who actually loved the book and can truly capture its beauty and can be played by people that can *hopefully act and portray the characters in a much better way.

I say this because I think people get swept away by the story rather than by its treatment in this particular case.When I watched this movie I felt lost and detached, not knowing what was going on and why.The music was obtrusive, although it was typical of the era, so I'll give it that. The sets and the costumes were well done, I'll give it that, too. But the only good performance was from Gregory Peck. Everyone else was stilted and forced.The only way this movie can be justified as good is by comparing it to other films made at that time. It seems real actors hadn't yet realized it was respectable to perform their craft on the silver screen, and directors hadn't yet become artists. Even this doesn't totally fly. I have seen great films made then and before (Cape Fear, High Noon), so I know it could have been done well.I fault the screenwriter and the director, and whoever it was who told them they were doing a good job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>PhD Adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A dreadful adaptation of the book by Harper Lee. In the book, it engages you by mentioning how the Caucasian American community trace their origins to either side of the Battle of Hastings (eg. Yankees - Normans, Confederates - Saxons). The Battle of Hastings is then likened to the American Civil War where the Normans (Yankees) won and the Saxons (Confederates) lost. However, the Saxons (Confederates) went on to win the cultural war by converting the Normans (Yankees) into Englishmen (Americans), and drew the boundaries within the Caucasian community. The novel progresses from this Victorian inheritance to set the scene for why there is segregation between the black and white American communities after the abolition of slavery. It was a question of the black man having the right to be called American (or English in relation to Saxons and Normans). Brock Peters's relationship with the white girl (who is seen as white trash) is interpreted as the black man wanting to have sexual and social liaisons with their white neighbours to solidify their national identity, and an attempt is made on his life. In the film, Peters is shot, and the attention is drawn towards a rather sad character who has nothing whatsoever to do with the book. In the book, the black man is put on trial and proven innocent, but demonstrates that the only white women that would want a black man is 'white trash'. In reality, that is not altogether true, but in some instances, it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic books don't always beget classic films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A classic book about a noble theme doesn't guarantee a classic film. I started the DVD with high hopes but found the barely intelligible infantile antics of the first hour almost unwatchable. Did it have to take that long to introduce the unseen Boo Radley and announce an accusation of rape?The courtroom scenes were excellent, as were almost all the moments when those irritating kids weren't running around, slamming doors, being stupid and shouting in high-pitched voices.A child's words on a page, especially if precocious, don't easily translate to moving pictures. The film suffers from its attempts at faithfulness. The story is strong enough without the distractions of playground fights.Fans of the film should visit the ridiculous 'Rotten Tomatoes' review by Emanuel (Mr Moustache) Levy. He seems to think Jem is a girl. He says that Boo is chained to a bed (not shown) and that he has yellow teeth (hard to spot in a black and white film), and that he drools. The issues are important and an enduring embarrassment to the 'Land of the Free' (which was founded on slavery), but that's not enough to qualify the film for greatness. Judge the book on its merits and judge the film on its merits. On the screen, To Kill a Mockingbird would have worked much better as an adult story with the children as bit part players. It had its moments, but those kiddie scenes held it back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic? How?!?!?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read the novel &amp; seen the movie, &amp; I don't understand why everyone says it's great. I hated both, though the film was a tad better than the novel. Gregory Peck is probably the only good thing about the film. However, he is like Darth Vader in Return of the Jedi. His scenes are solemn, while just about everything else is goofy.There are several things I didn't like about both the film &amp; the novel. First, the names. We have two Greek names (note, this is the southern US), a dog's name, a pickle, an onomatopoeia, and a name that's being pronounced 3 different ways. Second, Dil should not have been written into the story in the first place. He was annoying in the book, &amp; even more annoying in the movie. He had one of the most annoying voices I've ever heard, it looked like his head was too big for his body, and if he's so rich why does he only have one change of clothes? Third, events that were irrelevant to the story. There were a lot more in the novel, which the screenwriters were smart enough to leave out. In the film, there are only two big ones: Mrs. DuBose &amp; the mad dog problem. The last one I'm going to talk about is how fast Jem matures. He's only 12! To quote Cameron Crowe's film Almost Famous, "You've robbed him of an adolescence!!" I'd explain more things I didn't like, but I have a word limit.So in conclusion, I thought this was a bad film, though I thought the novel was worse. If you haven't read it yet, don't waste your time. I've seen the movie twice and I don't get why it's such a classic. I'm glad Lawrence of Arabia won the Oscar that year (though I thought that one could have been a bit shorter.) Have a nice day! =)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just Call Me Iconoclastic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The courtroom procedure is the worst ever shown on the big screen. Lawyer Finch never brought up the impossibility of a one handed rapist to choke his victim as described. He did a silly exercise to show the girl's father was left-handed yet never brought this point home. He never brought up character references to show the reliability of the defendant. This oversight even existed in the novel, even though Tom's employer interrupted the court to pronounce this fact, and was dismissed from court. Prior to the trial the movie was more believable than the novel, which portrayed a first grade girl with vocabulary and reasoning ability of a much older person. This reminded me of a similar performance by the similarly aged young boy in the novel "Painted House". Just not realistic. I realize that to be critical of such a popular movie is akin to griping about movies such as "Casablanca", "Miracle on Forty Second Street", "Its A Wonderful Life", and their brethren. To my mind the performance of Gregory Peck is the bright spot in an otherwise boring movie. The bright spot was the statement by the black preacher to "Rise; Your father is passing".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really like Gregory Peck but he just could not save this movie. I really enjoyed the novel and thought it was great. But the movie is not as good. I couldn't even watch the movie all the way through. I probably saw half of it. I watched part of it in class once, and part of it at home. It was disappointing both times. Compared to the book the film was really rather boring. I thought all of the characters in the book were very colorful, very likable. They didn't make the transition for me to the movie. All of the kids overacted, all of their lines were too loud and their southern accents were overdone. All of their dialogue was spoken in a whiny tone. This is a movie that I had wanted to watch after reading the book and I feel like it could have been really great. I feel that the production of this movie was too rushed. This may not be true but that's how it felt while watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To Kill a Mockingbird</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was told that this was mainly a courtroom drama, but from one point, it seems to be more about the kids and family. Also, I wonder why Atticus Finch was voted number 1 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes &amp; Villains instead of James Bond or Indiana Jones, he didn't do much heroic stuff. Anyway, basically Atticus (Oscar and Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Gregory Peck) lives with his maid and two kids Jean Louise 'Scout' (Oscar nominated Mary Badham) and Jeremy 'Jem' Finch (Phillip Alford). All I can say about the court case, which comes a lot later, is that Atticus tries quite hard, but he doesn't win the case to prove a Negroes innocence of raping a woman. The stories that I really am interested in involve the two kids and their new friend, Charles Baker 'Dill' Harris (John Megna) nearly investigating a psychopathic neighbourhood man, but later, you find out he is nothing like what they expected, and turns out to save one of them. Also starring Robert Duvall in his first film role as Arthur 'Boo' Radley. It is a good film, and I guess Atticus Finch is a great hero in some ways, I can't really say this is one of my favourite films, but definitely worth watching. It won the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Director for Robert Mulligan (also nominated the Golden Globe), Best Music for Elmer Bernstein and Best Picture, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Film Promoting International Understanding, Best Motion Picture Score, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Gregory Peck was 12 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, the film was number 17 on 100 Years of Film Scores, it was number 23 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers, it was number 2 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers, and it was number 34 on 100 Years, 100 Movies.

		<fullReview>It wasn't until last night that I actually got round to watching TO KILL A MOCKING BIRD . It's something of a legend and is reflected that it's in the IMDb top 250 movies at position 46 but i'm somewhat baffled as to why . Grogory Peck isn't bad but his performance as attorney Atticus Finch is disappointingly one note . He won the best actor Oscar for his role here but it's not a performance that shows that Peck has much range and other actors have failed to win Oscars for better performances through the years . The story itself is inoffensive but very predictable in that you know fine well that the man in the dock is a victim of racism rather than a murderer I truly believe that the only things this film has in its favour is that the child actors are bearable , but so were the children in Charles Laughton's NIGHT OF THE HUNTER , which despite being a masterpiece , did not come close to achieving the commercial and critical acclaim that this film did . We also have the novelty of seeing an unknown actor called Robert Duvall with hair but IMHO it's far from being a classic film . Please don't lynch me because I didn't like it</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So the title "To Kill a Mockingbird" alludes to the fact that it's a sin to kill a mockingbird because it's an innocent creature - all it does it sing. During the movie it appears that Tom Robinson is the "mockingbird" - he is innocent but is found guilty. Later we find that Boo Radley is actually the "mockingbird" - after Bob Ewell attacks the children the Sheriff and Atticus agree he should not be punished for killing Bob, and Scout makes it clear she agrees because it would be like "killing a mockingbird". So Boo Radley gets away with killing Bob because he was attacking the children and was a bad person all round.What a shocking moral to the story! It's OK to kill someone without consequences if they are bad! THIS is what is wrong with America. THIS is why they are hated so much throughout the world. Because of the belief that it's OK to kill someone if you think they are bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Novel + False Hero = Spoiled Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only two "classics" that still make the annual best seller lists are To Kill a Mockingbird &amp; Catcher in the Rye. "Catcher" was spared from being made into a movie, and was also spared the liberal spin machine. Mockingbird was about the everyday life of kids growing up in the rural South. The focus was 80% on the kids. In the background, the father Atticus Finch was a lawyer who took on the case of a young black man accused of a sexual crime against a White. In the movie, the lawyer and the trial are in front-and-center focus, and with Gregory Peck's ham-from-hell overacting, Atticus Finch became the most phony hero in movie history. In the film, the accused black was anything but an Ice T (before he reformed and turned TV cop) menace. No, he was obviously a sweet and reserved person --- and everybody in town knew it. So this great lawyer hero had to take on alleged racial prejudice, not real prejudice but movie-style prejudice, twisting flimsy and virtually non existent "evidence" to get these nasty bigots "to see" through old Atticus Finch's liberal eyes.... The only thing less brave than Gregory Peck's paper hero were the filmmakers. Remember, liberalism was very much in mode when this movie was released. Real courage was to disagree with the liberal dogma while Time, Newsweek, et cetera praised it in lockstep. Spitting on the rural South was an active part of that dogma, the theme of dozens of movies, and a virtual guarantee of 4-star reviews. My advice: Get the book, read it; it's great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you've read the book of the same name, that's really as far as you need to go. Skip the movie, it's not worth your time.While the book had a somewhat richer storyline and a better narrative, the movie falls flat on these areas, concentrating far too intensely on the center plotline, effectively snubbing most of the cast in one way or another. Gregory Peck's Atticus Finch becomes the main character in place of Scout, which was probably the worst decision of the entire movie. It drags on like nothing else I've seen, and in general is the worst adaptation I've ever watched, and a terrible movie by itself. Any redeeming points the book had (despite it's general mediocrity, the book did have good character development and narration) were cut down by the movie. In four words, this movie is bad.</fullReview>

We have gotten together and listed our grievances: 1. Boo Radley- His general character was underdeveloped throughout the whole movie. 2. Atticus- His portrayal did not do Atticus Finch justice. 3. Where were Aunt Alexandra, Dolphus Raymond, Scout's teachers, and Uncle Jack? 4. Calpurnia- I have never seen such horrible casting in all my life! 5. Who thought it was a good idea to cast a chimp to play Dill? 6. We feel the most interesting and important parts of the book were completely left out such as Miss Maudie's house catching on fire, Cal taking the kids to First Purchase, the kids reading to Mrs. DuBose, and countless other morals and noteworthy situations and characters.

Atticus was bland and uninteresting, Scout looked nothing like the book describes her, Dill was ugly and loud and annoying, the kids in general were really bad actors, the aunt was nowhere near as evil as she is in the book, etc. The lines were all taken directly out of the book, which is something you never do in a movie unless you want it to go really slowly. The story was centered more on the trial, which takes about three chapters in the book, than on the lives of these kids. The trial itself was actually funnier than moving full of overacting and stupidity. None of the actors sounded southern anyway. The book was actually pretty good; I had to read it in class, and then we watched the movie, and it sucked. The direction was really bad too, and the characters had no depth. I mean, I'm 14 and I could do better. You probably think that just because I'm young I can't appreciate a classic, but this thing just sucked. If people of all ages can't enjoy a movie, the makers have failed in their job. I have no idea how anybody could actually enjoy this or spend money to buy the video.</fullReview>
