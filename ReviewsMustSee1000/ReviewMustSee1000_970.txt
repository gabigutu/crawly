		<shortDescription>A heartbreaking gem of a movie. Loved it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a little gem. I read the New York Times review that said it was "Brilliant" or whatever, and I don't know if I'd go that far, but it's definitely the best movie about divorce and child custody I've ever seen, and it's nothing like Kramer vs. Kramer. It's actually really sweet and real feeling, mostly because you really identify with the little girl Maisie. All the adult actors are great, and sometimes funny (Steve Coogan), but I especially loved Alexander Skarsgard. He seems like a loser when you first see him, but he ends up being super loving, and his scenes with Maisie are really fun to watch. Haters are going to hate, but I think anyone would relate to this film about parents, kids, and finding people to love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unique Gem With Some of the Best Performances of the Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What Maisie Knew (2012) *** 1/2 (out of 4)Excellent updating of the Henry James story about a divorcing couple (Julianne Moore, Steve Coogan) and the impact that their behavior has on their young daughter Maisie (Onata Aprile) as well as the new step parents (Alexander Skarsgard, Joanna Vanderham). WHAT MAISIE KNEW isn't going to appeal to a mass audience but it's certainly a terrific little gem from directors Scott McGehee and David Siegel. What I enjoyed the most was the unique way it told the story. We never get the "full" story of everything going on but instead we get the bits and pieces that a child would remember about something. Instead of finding out why a parent leaves her at school, we just see how the child remembers being left alone. Instead of knowing what the parents are fighting about, we see how it impacts the child and her memories of it. This is a very unique way to tell the story and it gives a touch of freshness to a storyline (divorce) that we've seen before. It also doesn't hurt that the film doesn't shy away from some rather ugly behavior from the parents and especially the Moore character. To say she's an unworthy mother would be an understatement but I appreciate the film playing things straight and not ever trying to make something cute. It also doesn't hurt that we get some of the best performances that you're going to see all year with Moore doing an excellent job in her role as the busy mother who doesn't have enough time for her daughter. This is a rather ugly role so it was brave for the actress to take it on. The same with Coogan who also plays a jerk and delivers with some strong work. Both Skarsgard and Vanderham really steal the film in the roles of the step parents who find themselves being forced to deal with something they never expected. Both of them should be remembered at Oscar time but we'll see how that goes. The same is true for Aprile who doesn't get too much dialogue but we constantly see her reactions to the things going on around here. This is such an excellent and quiet performance and something you'd see in a silent movie. WHAT MAISIE KNEW is about a pretty ugly subject matter but it's a fascinating look at it for those who enjoy great performances and a unique story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>She knows plenty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. An ultra-modern update of the 1897 Henry James novel introduces us to parents we know, but wish we didn't. Steve Coogan plays Beale, a self-absorbed art dealer. Julianne Moore plays Susanna, a self-absorbed rock star. OK, you and I may not know art dealers and rock stars, but we know self-absorbed types and we know they make terrible parents. So not only do we know it, but it's also what Maisie knows.Five outstanding performances and strong work by co-directors Scott McGhee and David Siegel prevent this one from spinning off into the neverlands of melodramatic muck. Onata Aprile is a wonder as Maisie. She displays none of the typical "movie kid" precociousness. The movie (and James novel) are told from her point of view. We see the fragmented bits and pieces she experiences as her parents fight. Rather than a full story, we share her moments of late pick-ups, early drop-offs and forgotten trips.Soon enough Beale and Susanna are divorced and the real wars begin. These despicable adults make little effort in hiding their hatred of each other from 6 year old Maisie. It becomes background noise to her life. Further proof of the epic narcissism from both, Beale soon marries Margot the nanny (played by Joanna Vanderham) and Susanna reacts by marrying Lincoln, a band gopher and bartender played by studly Alexander Skarsgard. The most startling moment of the movie occurs when Lincoln first begins playing with Maisie ... it's as if we had almost forgotten what it means to give your attention to a child.This is not an easy film to watch ... at least if you understand that parenting means putting yourself second. The directors do a wonderful job of showing us how Maisie takes in moments and what memories she makes from these. The neglect and false moments of caring from her parents make her acceptance of the attention to her step-parents even more poignant. We can't help but hope things work out for this little girl and it's a reminder that childhood innocence cannot be recaptured once lost ... and it's worth hanging on to for as long as possible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the very best child acting performances...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It always amazes me when I see a really impressive child acting performance. This is one of an impressive collective of films where a young performer has been quite outstanding. But there is something of an important difference between this one and most others. While the likes of Tatum O'Neal (Paper Moon), Ivana Baquero (Pan's Labyrinth) or Haley Joel Osment (The Sixth Sense) were all brilliant, none of them were as young as Onata Aprile. When you consider that at her age she simply will be incapable of understanding all the nuances of the screenplay, it makes it all the more outstanding just how good she is. She doesn't really say a whole lot but her looks convey massive amounts of meaning. Her performance is so natural that it reminds me of kid's drawings ? so unaffected, unpretentious and instinctive that adults can never faithfully replicate them. The acting by the entire cast here is top calibre but at times like this you cannot compete and Onata Aprile easily steals the show.It's quite a disturbing story really. Maisie is a neglected child and it's not very pleasant seeing her be passed around from pillar to post being essentially disregarded. The view the film adopts is a child's one. We see Maisie peeking round corners, in the periphery watching, seeing but never fully comprehending but understanding more than she is given credit for. She seems to know more about right and wrong than her parents do, for example. They are in worlds of their own, ignoring their little girl in order to play out their own self-obsessed games. Steve Coogan and Julianne Moore are very good in these unsympathetic roles in which they make you understand why they are like the way they are without making us actually sympathise with them.The film works so well because it's given such an unsentimental treatment. The story unfolds subtly and believably and it avoids saccharine. While Maisie's parents are the bad guys of the piece they're not really villains as such, just extremely poor parents and very selfish people generally. As it turns out, it's the parent's new partners who are left increasingly in charge of the little girl and they are slowly drawn towards each other too. Collectively they make for an actual workable and loving family unit. Both Alexander Skarsg?rd and Joanna Vanderham are also great as these much more sympathetic adults. Events ultimately progress to an ending that was upbeat without sacrificing believability; it's simultaneously inconclusive yet hopeful. I suppose one of the messages of What Maisie Knew is that what is important is what is best for the child, not what is convenient for blood parents.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>She knew who really loved her and who cared for her...She also knew that mummy and daddy were too busy arguing to notice that the pizza guy had arrived.&nbsp;"What Maisie Knew" practically opens mid-tirade and Maisie, a wide-eyed six- year old girl has heard it all before, she skips innocently through their art-deco New York apartment, past her none-the-wiser parents, pulls out a fistful of dollar bills from her own piggy-bank and returns to the door to pay for the pizza."What Maisie Knew" is a re-visioning of the 19th-Century Henry James novel by the same name. The story follows Maisie, played by the captivating Onata Aprile , caught in the midst of a custody battle between her aging rock star mother Susanna and art-dealer father, Beale.Susanna intensely played by the always-brilliant Julianne Moore and Beale (Steve Coogan) only unite in their neglect and emotional abandonment of little Maisie, and both of whom are not above using their daughter as a pawn in their war game.As they battle on with the messy custody arrangements, Beale marries former nanny Margo (Joanna Vanderham), and in retaliation Susanna also remarries, to young bartender Lincoln, (Alexander Skargard).As Maisie moves between her parents now separate lives, we unearth a natural connection between Maisie and Lincoln. You feel safe when he is around, even though he doesn't know what he is doing half the time and like Maisie, is out of his depth and unsure where he stands in Susanna's life.Constantly, Susanna relies on Lincoln to pick Maisie up from school, drop her off, and spend time with her and improvise when necessary. &nbsp;But as the affectionate bond between her new husband and her daughter grows, Susanna becomes jealous of the relationship to the point of enforcing to Lincoln "you don't get a bonus for making her like you"."You don't deserve her," Lincoln lashes out as&nbsp;Susanna breaks up with him, expressing exactly what the viewer has been thinking. But as another relationship in Maisie's life ends, it's her resilience that keeps us captivated and in awe of such a brave girl.The story is told from Maisie's perspective including many shots even captured from Maisie's eye level so we get a fresh look at an unoriginal story. Instead of finding out why a parent leaves her at school, we just see how the child remembers being left alone. Instead of knowing what the parents are fighting about, we see how it impacts the child and her memories of it."What Masie knew" is a bleak film but hopeful, it demonstrates that innocence is not something to be wasted and used but cherished and protected. What Masie knew is &nbsp;to trust the people who actually take care of her - never voicing an allegiance against anyone but accepting love when it's offered</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Small and Intense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read five previously posted reviews of this film and see no reason to repeat what they've already said. I agree, for the most part, with the positive ones. And I suspect the negative ones were written by people whose established taste in movies should have steered them away from seeing this one in the first place.What I'll add is, I guess, a mostly personal perspective. I've found that I am lately much more drawn to smaller, more deeply felt movies than to bigger, slicker, higher-production-value ones. To "What Maisie Knew," for example, than to "The Great Gatsby." Even though both source novels share a similar interior aesthetic, the treatment in the former stays inside the characters, where James focused the original (thus causing one of the previous reviewers' comments to the effect that "nothing happens" in the movie), while the latter (possibly because of Luhrmann's well-established directorial predilections)stays resolutely focused on the exterior spectacle and barely skims the surface of Fitzgerald's deeply rendered characterizations.If you like smaller, more closely observed and deeply felt films, you'll like this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They don't deserve Maisie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What Maisie Knew (2012), directed by Scott McGehee and David Siegel, is an extraordinary movie about an extraordinary young girl. Maisie (Onata April) deserves better parents. Both her mother (Julianne Moore) and her father (Steve Coogan) are self-absorbed people who care about Maisie, but care about their careers more than about their daughter.Maisie is cheerful, cooperative, and adaptive. Although her life has all the trappings of luxury--a nanny, an exclusive private school--she lives in a precarious world. Her parents make only haphazard arrangements for her care. Sometimes these arrangements work, sometimes they don't. Once, the haphazard plans fall through, and Maisie is literally abandoned among strangers. We don't know what will happen next to Maisie, but it probably won't be good. Her parents don't deserve such a great little girl. But, she is their daughter, and she'll have to play the cards she's been dealt.The acting is strong in this movie, but I think the most impressive work is done by Julianne Moore. Moore is brave enough to take a role where she often looks tired and worn, and where her character is truly inadequate as a parent. You cringe at the way Moore makes stabs at being a good mother, but never quite works hard enough to actually achieve that goal. I think she deserves--and will get--an Oscar nomination for her work in this film.There are a few lovely views of a beach and the ocean in the movie. These will work better in a theater, but everything else will work well on the small screen. This is definitely a film that is worth seeking out and seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A gorgeous film that manages to convey the emotion of childhood at its more heart-wrenching. The central performance by Joanna Vanderham is absolutely extraordinary, and reminds me of some of the greatest child performances I've ever seen on film. As her parents, Julianne Moore and Steve Coogan make you feel like you are right in the middle of the tumult of family life. Directors Scott McGehee and David Siegel have created a movie that feels like life, the vulnerability, the abruptness, the comedy, the joy. With intimacy at times almost startling, this is one of the best adaptations of a novel by Henry James I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"What Maisie Knew" Is Splendid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An achingly poignant and quietly brilliant modern retelling of a Henry James story.The filmmakers make the bold decision to tell the entire story through the point of view of Maisie, a little girl caught in the middle of her parents' bitter breakup. Steve Coogan and Julianne Moore play the mom and dad, and while neither are at heart bad people (though both make strong arguments for that label at various points throughout the film), it's clear that neither should ever have been a parent. They end up hating each other, and using Maisie as a way to get at one another. It's an old story (at least as old as Henry James), but the treatment of it here feels fresh and like something I haven't seen before. The two real caregivers are Maisie's ex-nanny and her mom's new boy toy, both of whom take on the obligation of caring for Maisie even when it's downright weird for them to only because they know that no one else will if they don't. These two fall in love, and create a sort of stand-in nuclear family with Maisie at its center. This should probably feel implausible, but it doesn't the way it plays out the in film.The acting is excellent all the way around, especially from Julianne Moore, who tears into an unflattering role with everything she's got. Watching a mother realize that the daughter she loves (and make no mistake, flawed as Moore's character is, she does love her daughter) would be better off without her is tough stuff to watch.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is what I hope Henry James would have written, were he alive today. The book is tough sledding, late James when he was dictating his novels (due to tendinitis), and there was no holding him back. At least one Harvard professor called him "the greatest American novelist," but this work is deservedly minor.The movie was perfect, in the top 1% of all I've seen. The style was the antithesis of James, radical "showing" instead of "telling." I think the title should have been "What Maisie SAW," but that's too titillating. What she knew or felt only her future therapist will learn. We do have a hint though when her father throws her mother's flowers away, and M explains, "He was allergic."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thoughtful, beautiful, amazingly constructed Henry James update</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What Maisie Knew (2012)A truly remarkable movie, filled with great acting, masterful editing and filming, and terrific writing. The basis of it all is the core here, a glimmering Henry James novel by the same title from over 100 years earlier. It's amazing how well the story holds up set in contemporary times, and changed in many necessary (and interesting) ways. What it keeps it going is the basic heartbreaking drama of a child tossed between two indifferent parents.The mother might be seen as the main actor here, Julianne Moore, and this is the best I've ever seen her, I think. She gives a slightly fiery performance, and "slightly" is perfect, avoiding an overacting job suggested by her role as a slightly successful rock and roll star. She's terrifically awful and you come to hate her, appropriately.The father (Steve Coogan) also puts in a sharp performance playing the lively, fun parent who is a selfish womanizer, hiding, sometimes, his flaws from his daughter. His relationship with the mother is not detailed very far because it is mostly one of distance and disdain. And mutual abuse.The real star here is the girl, an utterly charming and beautifully effective actress, Onata, Aprile. She succeeds not by her delivery of great lines, but by her expressions. It's all because Henry James understood something delicate about children in these situations: they know what's going on and don't say it. And they also don't let it affect them because they simply can't afford to, or because they become hardened in some little ways, making them withdraw or act out. That Maisie maintains a delicious sweetness without playing the victim is quite remarkable, and Aprile is brilliant.The secondary woman and man in the story are also terrific, and their roles grow as the movie grows. In fact, they become the sympathetic heart of things.Pulling this together is the directing pair, McGehee and Siegel. This is their fifth movie together, and neither man has directed anything without the other. I've not seen any of the other four, but the reviews are middling to poor for all of them, so I'm not sure how far the novelty takes us. But it works here perfectly, making the complexity unfold quickly and coherently.It's an ordinary drama on the surface, but let this one sink in over time. It's that good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Adults need to pass tests to get a license to drive a car, we have to apply to the State Department for a passport to travel abroad: heck, one of these days, we might even have to register to buy handguns, after the UN takes over Texas or something. One feels that there really ought to be some sort of test required for parenthood.Young Maisie is living what should be an idyllic lifestyle, in a huge Manhattan apartment, with a Rock Star mother, an art dealer father, going to a really cool elementary school with all sorts of bright schoolmates. The problem is that she is just one more shiny accessory in her self- involved parents' lives, analogous to a Louis Vuitton suitcase for them to squabble over when the break-up happens. The only people capable of acting unselfishly towards her are the two pieces of eye candy that the parents take up with after the split, both of whom are pawns in the struggle between Susanna and Beale.The cast is first rate. Coogan plays his best "Steve Coogan" role, familiar from "Tristram Shandy" and "The Trip": you kind of want to like him, but you wouldn't trust him as far as you can spit him. Alexander Skarsgard and Joanna Vanderham give substance to their peripheral characters, and young Onata Aprile, like Christopher Walken, conveys volumes with just her eyes. Julianne Moore plays an absolute monster, who is allowed one, probably transitory, moment of self- awareness at the very end of the story: other than that, Susanna is just bad news.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Little Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, I'll admit that I was interested in the film (and book) because of Alexander Skarsgard. I tried reading the book, but thought it was dense and boring. I wasn't sure how they would make a movie out of the source material. I was proved wrong by the heavy, yet interestingly character driven movie.First, the little girl (Onata Aprile) who plays silent witness to her parents tug-of-war during and after their contentious divorce. She doesn't talk much during the film, but the child is so interesting to look at, she carries the movie with her subtle body language. Not your typical cute kid actress. Julianne Moore as a past her prime rocker chick was excellent and scary in her love/neglect of her daughter.Alexander Skarsgard was great. I've seen him play "sweet" before, but the costume designer, etc. dressed him like a schlub; washed out gross plain t-shirts and jeans. His hair was in his face most of the time. He looked like he was bent over to make himself look smaller (6'4"). They did their best to make this incredibly handsome man look unkempt. I've seen this actor drenched in blood (True Blood) and smacked down in boxing matches (M magazine). Yeah, he still looks good.Tough, but enjoyable movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a very beautiful and powerful movie. If by beautiful and powerful I am understood to mean that the director, writer, actors and producers made the best representation of sadly, what is too often a common story.The child actress steals the movie. She is adorable, never overacts or is other than a real little girl with very understandable emotions.I thought all the other actors did a very good job too, with maybe the exception of Julianne Moore. I'm not sure how old Susanna was supposed to be, but Julianne seemed too old for this role. Her role though is the most thankless as Susanna is a thoroughly unpleasant person, manipulative, egocentric, demanding, heedless, and ever so selfish. Her one shining moment comes towards the end of the film.This was very upsetting for us to watch, but I think it is necessary because there are many little Maisies and Max's probably that most of us know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful sad story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"What Maisie knew" is a story about a divorce told through the eyes of a little girl and is one of the best and saddest films to come out this year. Maisie (Onata Aprile) sees the marriage of her parents Susanna (Julianne Moore) and Beale (Steve Coogan) fall apart and sees herself becoming one of the major conflicts in a bitter divorce. The film shows divorce from the perspective of an innocence which cannot comprehend the selfish motives of two adults who are willing to hurt each other even if it comes at the cost of their own child. It is a study of how the people who are meant to act as examples in a life can act so selfishly despite the costs, and who they leave to suffer the repercussions of their actions.This is the fifth film jointly directed by David Siegel and Scott McGehee. The perspective with which they told the story enabled them to deliver it with a compassion and realism for a subject which has seen it rarely. They are supported brilliantly by a cast which includes great performances from Steve Coogan, who acts out of his comfort zone with conviction, and Julianne Moore, who gives one of the performances of her career. They show how unintentional cruelty portrayed in a performance can be realistic and not be as melodramatic as is usually the case for characters in films about divorce (e.g. Stepmom). Good supporting turns are also given by Alexander Skarsgard (Lincoln) and Joana Vanderham (Margo) who turn out to be the only salvation for a little girl left alone by her circumstances. The star of the show is, however, the little and extremely talented Onata Aprile who plays Maisie with a sophistication that actors much older than her would be proud of. Her reactions to the things happening around her not only make us question about the maturity of the people around her but shows us how an innocent perspective can make these motives seem as inane as they are. A few of such moments are so compelling in their delivery that they create some of the most emotionally draining scenes you will ever witness. One of the performances of the year, Aprile elevates this movie to an even greater height and shows how young actors can project such maturity in demanding roles. One of the overlooked gems of this year, please watch it if you haven't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Third time lucky with Henry James</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the third, and ultimately successful, attempt to make a worthwhile film based upon the famous novel of the same title by Henry James, which was originally published in 1897. This film is set in our own time, so that many liberties had to be taken to extricate it from the Victorian Era and transplant it into the contemporary scene. The initial attempt to film the novel occurred in 1968, when the BBC produced something. Although I used to know one of the actresses who appeared in it, I am no longer in touch with her and hence cannot ask her about it. It has never been reviewed on IMDb. The part of Maisie, who is meant to be a little girl, was played in that BBC production by Sally Thomsett, who was then aged 18! Hence I am inclined to think that that dramatization was of little value, since the whole point of the story is that Maisie is a child. Another dramatization of 58 minutes was produced in the USA in 1976, but little is known about it, and it also has never been reviewed on IMDb. These early attempts are presumably therefore of little relevance or value. As for this film, it really is superb, and has much to offer in many respects. First and most important of all, Maisie has been carefully and brilliantly cast and is played by a little girl named Onata Aprile, who was six years old at the time of filming, and is now eight. She is American, from New York City, has appeared in other titles, and is the daughter of the glamorous actress Valentine Aprile (see her Facebook page). Obviously I don't know how much Onata is really like the child she plays in the film, and can only judge how she comes across on screen. Taking her simply as she appears, therefore, I must emphasize the dreamy, fairy-like and innocently accepting quality of the child. Like other dreamy little girls whom one has known from time to time, she is to a large extent lost in her own private world of fantasy and has only a tangential relationship with 'adult reality', which is opaque to her. This is precisely what was needed for Maisie. The story and the film positively require this. This dreamy, innocent little creature then becomes the emotional victim of two hopelessly dysfunctional parents. Her mother is played by Julianne Moore, who does her usual brilliant job of acting and convincingly portrays a horrid, vain, self-absorbed pop singer. (Moore does her own singing with a group called The Kills, whoever they are, and I would rather not know, as their music stinks.) Moore is always going away on tour and leaving Maisie behind. Meanwhile, Maisie's father, portrayed by Steve Coogan, is equally feckless and inattentive and suddenly just leaves to work in England, abandoning Maisie on the sidewalk as his taxi whisks him off to the airport. Both parents frequently protest in that saccharine manner perfected by Americans about how much they 'love' Maisie. But in the USA today, the word 'love' has been cheapened to such an extent that it means practically nothing anymore. It is the ultimate debased coinage. The way Americans always close phone conversations with their family members by ritualistically and hastily mumbling 'Love you!' shows just how cheap it has all become, since repeating that like a mantra in such a fashion, as if in the grip of a superstitious fear that failing to utter the formula might invite disaster, drags the expression of the sentiment down to the level of pure trivia. I call it 'junk love', and class it with that junk food that is making them all obese. And junk love is similarly making them emotionally obese. You can have fatty deposits in your emotions too, which wobble and shake just as ludicrously as the flabby flesh of the semi-human 'flesh-mountains' that stagger from their cars into the malls in search of fodder to cram into their maws, like the mindless mobile digestive tracts which they have become, what one might call 'foraging lumps of wobbling protoplasm'. So the hopeless parents epitomize this junk love syndrome, and their false assertions of undying love barely emerge as faint burps from the fatty degeneration of their all-consuming egos and self-love. Julianne Moore portrays this type of person in such a scary fashion that she brings the message firmly home. The film is jointly directed by a 'pair of directors', Scott McGehee and David Siegel, who seem to be aiming to become the new Taviani Brothers. Their sensitivity and insight are powerfully in evidence, and their skills are much to the fore, resulting in a wonderful cinematic achievement. Henry James would be bewildered by the chaos of the world of 2013, but he would 'get' the film with no difficulty at all. Children mangled by their inadequate parents are an eternal subject, and that does not change much in essence. Alexander Skarsgard (of the famous Swedish Skarsgard acting family) and Joanna Vanderham, as the pair of younger and cast-off spouses of the two parents of Maisie who try to look after her when the parents recklessly disappear all the time, are superb in their roles. How Skarsgard, who is as Swedish as Selma Lagerlof, can be so convincing as a languid 'all American guy', complete with slouching body language and the right accent and speech patterns, is nothing short of a miracle. Why shucks, he looks like he just came back from an American high school basketball practice, having self-effacingly apologized to the coach for missing a jump shot. Well, this film does not miss, and instead scores effortlessly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't neglect this like the parents did</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"This is my new stepfather. My father married my nanny, so Court made my mommy get married too."What Maisie Knew is a wonderful adaptation of Henry James's novel of the same name. Writers, Nancy Doyne and Carroll Cartwright, managed to capture the spirit of the novel really well. It is a great (although difficult) film with some very memorable performances thanks to some well developed characters. Directors, Scott McGehee and David Siegel, succeeded in focusing on the small details and interior of each character rather than on the big melodramatic moments. Despite all the drama, this film always manages to stay small and let us experience things through the eyes of the 7 year old lead character. It is her memories we are seeing and the way the film was edited draws us into her character and helps us identify with the things she is going through. This film might just be one of the best movies about divorced parenting. Through the eyes of Maisie the audience can experience the difficult situations she has to go through because of her parents neglect. It is such a surprise to see how James's novel which was written about a century ago still remains so contemporary now. The film felt so real and authentic and it was easy to relate to the story as well. The directors approached this story of a dysfunctional family in a very sensitive manner and it really worked. What Maisie Knew is a very touching film and one I'd definitely recommend, especially if you like tasteful character studies of human nature. I found this film to be very emotional without being manipulative or melodramatic and definitely one all parents should watch.Maisie (Onata Aprile) is the tender and loving 7 year old daughter of Beale (Steve Coogan), an art dealer who travels a lot for work, and Susanna (Julianne Moore) a rock star whose glory days are a bit behind her. They have a beautiful apartment in New York and seem to be living very well, but Maisie's world is shaken when her parents get divorced and fight for custody over her in court. The judge decides that they both share custody so the film follows Maisie as she lives ten days with her mother and ten with her father. When she arrives at her father's place she is sort of surprised to find her nanny, Margo (Joanna Vanderham) living their, but she is glad to have her company. Margo and Maisie get along really well and since her father travels a lot she spends most of her time with her. Then when Maisie returns with her mother she finds out that she is dating a younger man named Lincoln (Alexander Skarsgard). Lincoln has no clue about parenting and at first their relationship is kind of strange, but with her mother gone for most of the day the two begin to bond and form a special relationship. Despite her parents neglect, Maisie enjoys most of her days with her step parents who really seem to care for her more than her parents. Susanna and Beale do love Maisie and have a good relationship with her, but they are so focused on their jobs and their right to have custody over her that they actually neglect Maisie along the way.The film can be disturbing at times because divorce and parental neglect can be rough, but the story is told in a very sensitive manner. The true star of the film is the 7 year old Onata Aprile who really delivers a powerful emotional performance. This is a girl who is forced to adapt to the different changes in her life at such a young age and despite the complexity of the role, Aprile really captures the heart of the character. Julianne Moore also stands out in her role as the neglectful parent. She really is unlikable, but she gives a memorable performance and kind of stands out as this year's best female villain. The film takes a very different perspective on divorce as it centers the action around the little girl, instead of the parents. It's the innocence through which she sees everything that captivates the audience. She has to pay for her parents sins, but she manages to adapt along the way. Aprile may not have a lot of lines in the film, but her emotions can be read through her facial expressions. She deserves a lot of recognition for her performance. Skarsgard and Vanderham play the most likable characters in this film so it is easy to like them in their lovable roles and I enjoyed their performance. This is a film you won't want to miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Parents Say</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is mildly recommended.What Maisie knew was her divorcing parents were constantly at odds with each other. Based on the Henry James novel and given a substantially modern revision, the film depicts scenes from a young girl's point of view as these dysfunctional adults use their daughter's unconditional love as a emotional pawn to hurt each other and selfishly gain the upper hand. The story may be old and predictable, but sadly, the battle between the separating spouses is a well known commodity and still being enacted in many broken homes today. What Maisie Knew is a film that takes an unflinching glimpse at the carnage left in the aftermath.By focusing on the littlest survivor's struggle in dealing with this bitter custody wars, the film already lays bias to Maisie's parents as evil and self-serving types. Both parents are egomaniacs and creepy. Susanna (Julianne Moore) is a narcissistic rock star and Beale ( Steve Coogan) is a successful art dealer. Both are better suited for their jobs than as Maisie's parents. As their hatred builds for each other, Maisie's world begins to implode as new people enter her parents' lives and now become part of hers: Beale remarries Margot (Joanna Vanderham), Maisie's nanny, and Susanna remarries a younger man, Lincoln ( Alexander Skarsgard). Their interactions and relationships are the mainstay of the film.While the parent roles are wholly unsympathetic and truly unlikable characters, the actors playing them are quite good at giving them some redeeming qualities. Moore's Susanna is such a self absorbed diva, jealous of any attention going to anyone other than herself, including her own daughter and Moore plays the role with disturbing intensity. Coogan's Beale is the father in absentia, more interested in worldly fortune and travel plans. As their supporting spouses, Skarsgard and Vanderham bring their charm and appeal to their more congenial roles. But at the core of the film is Onata Aprile as the young child. The young actress manifests a believability and naturalism to her role as Maisie. Her solemn looks and inquisitive manner elicit the perfect degree of empathy and concern.What Maisie Knew is solidly directed by Scott McGehee and David Siegel and co-written by Nancy Doyne and Carroll Cartwright. One could see that this film was a labor of love by the filmmakers. The film is fragmented and filmed in a stream of conscience structure as Maisie observes various changes in her own life. Subtle touches help to capture the chaos forming around Maisie's daily life: the loud arguments going on in the next room while she tries to sleep, her long waits for either parent to take their turns for custody duties, her independent skills in making herself a grown-up sandwich for dinner, etc.What Maisie Knew begins to lose itself in the last third of the film. It was there that a lack of credibility set in for me and the actions became contrary to the characters' nature. Their reactions registered as untrue and served only as a means to concoct a more positive ending. The melodrama overtook the genuine drama that was so successfully established for most of the film. Still there is much to admire in What Maisie Knew, a film that values the innocence of the young while constantly realizing that a child's world is always trumped by the power of parenthood, be they good parents, or in this case, very bad ones.

		<shortDescription>IMDb description is not exactly accurate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is not so much about a bitter custody battle, but more about parenting (and step-parenting). Does good parenting mean buying gifts, toys, various gadgets and fighting for custody no matter what? Many people struggle to find a balance between career and family. For some people careers are of utmost importance - that's their #1 passion. For most people their family is what it's all about. And there are also people who are still lost no matter the age- insecure and dysfunctional. The film is about how challenging it is to be around such people, especially if you have to depend on them. THE NEGATIVE of this film is unfortunate use of animal. Animals are not toys. They are living, breathing creatures who feel affection, pain and fear just like we do. It simply does not make any sense to use and promote use of baby animals in a film about responsibility towards kids.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw What Maisie Knew months ago in the theater, and yet I keep thinking about it. They got to the heart of the material. The casting and emotional tenor is perfect. I keep thinking about the characters as if I knew them. This is a haunting movie of the break up of a family and the resilience of a child. I highly recommend it. Having had a mother a bit like the Julianne Moore character, I was profoundly moved by the caustic effects of a selfish parent. She was wonderful. To think it was adapted from a Henry James story is interesting, that there could be parents so self centered one hundred years back. Sad, yet Maise finds what she needs and holds the moral center of the movie. The settings were poignant and poetic. Somehow the entire production gets to the heart of the heartbreak of a child.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read, years ago, a comment by a psychologist that the ability to nurture is the highest level of human emotional behaviour for nurturing requires a person to place another's well-being either equal to or above one's own. And this is where some parents fall so short as they may love their child dearly, but are unable to reconcile their wants and needs with those of their children.What Masie knows is that her parents love her, but for various reasons both have a very limited ability, if any, to nurture. In the last scene when Maisie touches her mother's shoulder, Maisie demonstrates what they lack: the capacity to offer comfort and love despite disappointments and limitations in life or in character.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What I realize again after watching this movie is that being a kid's dad or mom is a serious thing, rewarding if you take the responsibility and be a good one. Parents' quarrel, waiting for a long time with them showing up, and living in a drifting life with them are three nightmares for the young, who are delicate and vulnerable. The director did a great job in contrasting the attitude of Maisie's parents and those of the two tender and kind young adults. It's not biological relationship that legitimize the parents' claim over their child. And such parents Coogan and Moore portrayed should change for their kids' childhood and future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful performance in "What Maisie Knew"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"What Maisie Knew" is a very touching dramatic film from 2012. It is currently available on NetFlix Instant Download Streaming. The directors are Scott McGehee and David Siegel. The screenplay is by Nancy Doyne and Carroll Cartwright.The mother might be seen as the main actor here, Julianne Moore, and this is the best I've ever seen her, I think. She gives a slightly fiery performance, and "slightly" is perfect, avoiding an overacting job suggested by her role as a slightly successful rock and roll star. She's terrifically awful and you come to hate her, appropriately. The father (Steve Coogan) also puts in a sharp performance playing the lively, fun parent who is a selfish womanizer, hiding, sometimes, his flaws from his daughter. His relationship with the mother is not detailed very far because it is mostly one of distance and disdain. And mutual abuse. The real star here is the girl, an utterly charming and beautifully effective actress, Onata, Aprile. She succeeds not by her delivery of great lines, but by her expressions. It's all because Henry James understood something delicate about children in these situations: they know what's going on and don't say it. And they also don't let it affect them because they simply can't afford to, or because they become hardened in some little ways, making them withdraw or act out. That Maisie maintains a delicious sweetness without playing the victim is quite remarkable, and Aprile is brilliant. Dale Haufrect</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This little girl was so intriguing to watch, I was even reminded of my self at that age. It was really a shame her parents couldn't get over themselves and really see her and what she was going through. I started to get upset when Maisie was continually abandoned places over and over without anyone making sure there was an adult there to watch her. I tried to calm down and not let it affect my feelings for the movie. I kept thinking this can't happen, someone would call the cops, especially when she was left at the restaurant. Then I realized this is a reality for some kids and many children have it much worse. Maisie's mother just had no control over her emotions or behavior. She loved to throw words around like "MY daughter" Yet she was so quick to leave her with other people without so much as checking up on her. She was so selfish, Lincoln said it best when he told her "you don't deserve her." I was really hoping Lincoln and Margot would just take Maisie away. Her idiot mother completely over reacted to everything! Shame on her for making Maisie feel bad about being close with Lincoln. Maisie finally has someone who pays attention to her its natural to be fond of that person. In the end you see her mom does love her I think she just is not sure how to be responsible and put her kid first. I think thats the point of this film, maybe some parents don't see what they are doing to their kid. Even small little things and comments you make over time affect your child. This film showing "what Maisie knows" really does that perfectly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This little girl's life is a roller-coaster of joy and letdown by selfish and immature parents who are only peripherally aware of their daughter's existence. Six year old Maisie's life at the hands of her parents made me so angry. These truly are people who do not deserve children. This film is fantastically well acted, and portrays the subject matter so impressively that it should be used in parenting classes to show adults the effect their behaviour can have on their children. Steve Coogan is convincingly unsympathetic as a lazy slime of a father, and Julianne Moore is completely believable as the self-obsessed, treat-the-child-as-an-accessory mother. Contrastingly, Onata Aprile's Maisie is an absolute joy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie really stole my heart. It felt a bit like Fish Tank with Michael Fassbender at the beginning with the whole mother's new boyfriend/husband, but I warmed up to it. I loved it. I love this movie so much, it's right up there with Midnight in Pairs and Fight Club. All the acting was spot on. Alexander Skarsgard did a wonderful job at playing a dad, since I'm used to seeing him as a vampire in True Blood. It showed that he's able to play adorable and lovable characters too, not just threatening ones. I come from a broken home too. Not this chaotic though, but I sympathized with the small girl and thought her acting was the best I've seen. Not sure what Maisie 'knew', but it makes me want to really pick up the book and read it to maybe find out more.</fullReview>

Story on the other hand making this movie something unique. For the first few times i was avoiding it for quite some time, but then at the moment i thought that i should at least try it once. I rarely watch any movies categorized in "Drama". but after watching it, i can proudly say it was worth it. This movies teaches us a lesson about society. It tells us what happens to the kids after their parents separates. Also how much they love and care for their kids.9/10 (For outstanding casting by Onata Aprile and intense storyline)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maisie is a young girl living in a fancy apartment with her rock star mom and art dealer father. When they get a divorce, things get messy. Maisie becomes a weapon and trophy for the parents to use against one another. Soon the father's new girl and the mom's new boyfriend meet each other and don't hit it off at first, but then reveal their feelings of sadness towards their meaningless marriages. They both fall in love and try to rescue Maisie from a lifetime of being just another object to fight over. Onata Aprile was very convincing and an amazing actress to choose; she played the role of Maisie very well. The soundtrack was sad, the plot was even more so. Maisie is only a film character; imagine the kids every day who aren't as lucky to escape? Maisie appears wise beyond her years and damaged by the divorce; she is shy, extremely reclusive and quiet until she starts hanging around with Margo and Linchon. This is such a depressing yet beautiful film. It was based very loosely off an 1800's novel by the same name. It's really worth watching, try it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Maisie Knew : What she saw and heard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maisie is quite a little girl, considering that many children at her age cannot deal well with such a tough situation like hers. She probably does not entirely understand how her life is changing, but she remains rather calm and quiet in her innocent way while we observe the situation through her little narrow view. Regardless of how much she is aware of what is happening around her, we know there is nothing much she can do in her position, and we naturally come to worry about whether there will be any stable environment for her in the end.Based on Henry James's 1897 novel, "What Maisie Knew" tells us how Maisie's comfortable life is disrupted through her parents' sudden divorce, and one interesting thing about the movie is that the adapted screenplay written by Nancy Doyne and Carroll Cartwright moves the story background from the late 19th Century to our time. That does not feel like a big stretch to us, because divorce has become a far more ordinary thing since James' novel was published while the human matters associated with it still feel timeless to us.For some reason which is not explained well, Maisie's parents have a big fight at their home in the beginning, and we soon see how their home life at some luxurious Manhattan apartment is crumbled step by step during a short time. Susanna(Julianne Moore), who is an aging rock singer, changes the lock of the front door to keep her art dealer husband(Steve Coogan) out of the apartment at one point, and then we see a bitter custody battle between them as they are going through divorce process.Stuck between her parents for a while in this mess, Maisie(Onata Aprile) looks helpless to us at times, but it seems she accepts the inevitable change in her life. Young kids like her would feel understandably confused or angry about that, but it looks like Maisie is floated above the situation like an innocent observer. She gets along well with her schoolmates as usual, and she quickly adapts to her new home to live with her father, though she is not so happy to know that her mother is not going to live with her.As the time goes by, we see more changes coming into Maisie's daily life. Not long after it is shown that there is something going on between her dad and her kind Scottish nanny Margo(Joanna Vanderham), her dad re-introduces Margo to Maisie as his girlfriend, and she soon becomes Maisie's stepmother. In case of Susanna, she marries a young bartender named Lincoln(Alexander Skarsg?rd), and, because she mostly occupies herself with reviving her old career, Lincoln is usually the one who takes care of Maisie just like Margo does instead of Maisie's father, who is busy with his work all the time.Lincoln and Margo meet each other for the first time at Maisie's school through coincidence, and it does not take a minute for us to see that it is a sort of Meet Cute scene between them. As we see more about how lousy Maisie's biological parents are to Maisie, we also begin to notice a certain possibility while Lincoln and Margo respectively spend time with Maisie; when they all walk around the city together, they do look like a real family as enjoying each other's company.I have not read Henry James' novel, but I can say that the directors Scott McGehee and David Siegel did a good job of sticking us to Maisie's view throughout their film. The camera is frequently set to her viewpoint, so our view is usually limited to what she heard or saw. The conflicts between the adult characters around her are glimpsed briefly as Maisie passes by or faintly conveyed through the muffled arguments from outside as she is in her room, but we can easily guess what is going on ? and what is going to happen to her sooner or later.The movie depends a lot on its child actress Onata Aprile, and McGehee and Siegel drew a splendid natural performance from Aprile. Maisie may be a little too good to be realistic because of her precocious attitude, but Aprile brings considerable believability to her character, and we constantly care about her and her welfare ? especially when she is temporarily put into the care of a total stranger later in the story,Aprile is supported well by the adult performers surrounding her. While Alexander Skarsg?rd and Joanna Vanderham have a nice subdued chemistry as two different people who really look like more suitable parents compared to their respective spouses, Steve Coogan and Julianne Moore inject a little does of humanity into their pretty unlikable characters. Coogan, who begins to show his more serious side recently, has a small nice scene with Aprile, and he ably balances his character between concern and selfishness during that scene. While I came to dislike Moore's character more than before in the end, Moore brings some degrees of understanding into her pathetically self-absorbed character, and she is very good in a crucial scene where she realizes how she has screwed up things again and then makes a sensible choice for her daughter."What Maisie Knew" is a sensitive domestic drama equipped with good direction and nice performances, and I cared and worried about its little heroine while watching it. You may complain that its ending is too neat and predictable, but the movie makes us want it to happen through its good storytelling, and we are glad to see that she will be all right ? at least for now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Onata Aprile - Remember Her Name</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Onata Aprile is an eight year old young lady who is destined for stardom if she continues with her acting career.She totally owned 'What Maisie Knew' from start to finish and her acting was absolutely flawless. Her presence lit up the screen and her acting ability was electrifying.SPOILER BEGINS Maisie, played by Onata Aprile is a little girl whose mother and father, Susanna (Julienne Moore) and Beale (Steve Coogan) have split up and have had a bitter custody battle for Maisie which the father wins.Maisie goes to live with her father and Margo (Joanna Vanderham). Margo had been taking care of Maisie while her mother was on the road with her band and her father was away on business.When Maisie went to live with her father she discovered her father and Margo had been having a relationship and has moved in with Beale. Shortly after Margo and Maisie's father get married and at about the same time Maisie's mother meets and quickly marries Lincoln (Alexander Skarsg?rd). Both Margo and Lincoln are nearly half the age of their new spouses.Both parents were only interested in their own selves and Maisie was a poor second.She was pushed around from pillar to post and it was usual for either Margo or Lincoln to pick up the pieces because Maisie's parents were rarely around.Not very long after the two marriages both Lincoln and Margo split from Susanna and Beale, but continued to look after Maisie.Eventually the obvious happened and Margo and Lincoln fell in love.Maisie's mother goes off on her tours and her father goes back to the UK to work and Lincoln and Margo end up caring for Maisie.For the first time in Maisie's life she knew how it felt to be truly loved and Margo and Lincoln loved Maisie more than life itself.When the mother returns to take Maisie with her on her tours Maisie does not want to go and eventually her mother accepts this and allows Maisie to stay with Margo and Lincoln.SPOILER ENDS This was both a disturbing and sad movie. Thank God 99.9% of parents are not like Maisie's mother and father.The script was extremely well written as was the direction and all the actors played their parts superbly, but I still must say that Onata Aprile outshone even Julianne Moore.A mention must I feel be made about Joanna Vanderham who played Margo.Joanna is new to the big screen and her career to date has mainly been in TV acting in several TV series, notably 'The Paradise on BBC.She also has a sparkling career ahead of her and I am looking forward to seeing her in her next movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sterilize the rich</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Initially I viewed this film because it was based on a Henry James novel, and James is highly regarded as an novelist -- even though most of his characters seem to be one-percenters -- and I wanted to see how contemporary script writers interpret a supposedly scandalous American story.Julianne Moore and Steve Coogan put in pretty convincing performances as two privileged, self- absorbed losers with little affection for anyone, who find themselves past mid-life raising a child. (Does this sound familiar? Unstable couples eligible for AARP adding "parent" to their resumes?)But despite their little girl's bad luck in the genetic lottery, Maisie turns out to be a gem, a sweet and guileless child who simply needs someone to be there and give her some measure of stability and affection. You can't help but root for her as her clueless, idiotic parents fumble through their divorce and passive/aggressive parenting moves. Luckily for Maisie, she finds allies and loving, stable adults in her nanny and stepfather, so she wins in the end.The largely uncoached Onata Aprile, daughter of the actress Valentine Aprile, puts in an affecting performance as Maisie--the best child performance I'd seen since Anna Vertelarova played the goat girl Helenka in the Czech film Zelary (my personal favorite of all time) back in 2003. Remarkably, six-year-old Onata starts out subtle and nuanced, then makes her character more expressive and joyful as she gains trust in the two adults closest to her. Directors Scott McGehee and David Siegel, and Onata's co-stars, probably deserve much of the credit for that.The evolution of Onata's performance parallels that of Alexander Skarsgard as her stepfather, who at first appears to be a sketchy, unreliable twit but gradually grows into a trustworthy companion. Scottish actor Johanna Vanderham completes the trio as her docile, inexpressive nanny, who begins to assert herself through her affection for the child, and comes to realize she is worthy of more herself.No sex, drugs, machine guns, chain-saw beheadings, explosions, or irresponsible driving. Just a little girl trying to find some love. Writers Nancy Doyne and Carroll Cartwright had a pretty good idea with this adaptation, I think. It's a keeper. Some say it's much better than the book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film-Making of the Highest Order</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no point prevaricating or procrastinating.This is film-making of the highest order.Adapted from a Henry James novel, written at the end of the nineteenth century, What Maisie Knew is the terribly sad, yet ultimately hopeful story of a young girl, Maisie, who is collateral damage ? what used to be called cannon fodder ? in her parents' acrimonious break up. James's story has been updated to a contemporary setting, the action set in New York rather than London, but the themes remain the same. It's perhaps best not to dwell on the fact that deep-seated flaws in the human condition have not changed fundamentally in over a century. Better education, travel and information technology may have induced a smug, self-satisfied belief that we are so morally superior to our ancestors, but it seems that the more things change, the more they stay the same?The film is seen mostly from the confused and inchoate world of seven year old Maisie (Onata Aprile). You rarely hear about what her parents (Julianne Moore and Steve Coogan) argue. All you hear are their rants, often drunken or drug-fuelled, and their vitriolic and foul-mouthed abuse spat at each other in earshot of their daughter whose welfare they both speciously claim to be their only priority. It takes very little time to establish that these two self-consumed people each have only one priority in their respective lives.The film is at its very best when Julianne Moore is centre stage. This is hardly surprising ? she is one of the finest film actors of her generation with a commanding screen presence and always able to bring an edge to her characterisations. With four Oscar nominations on her Rsum already, she can consider herself robbed if this role as a fading rock star fails to garner a fifth.There is very strong support from both Alexander Skarsg?rd and Joanna Vanderham as the step-parents who struggle to bring a semblance of stability and compassion to Maisie's dysfunctional and mentally-battered life. Making her big screen debut, Scottish actor Joanna Vanderham is a charming delight and on this evidence will surely attract more great roles. The very young Onata Aprile is perfectly cast as Maisie, her performance never cloying nor bathetic.The actors, fine as they are, have also been gifted with a great, tight script from writers Nancy Doyne and Carroll Cartwright who skilfully develop all the film's protagonists ensuring that they are not two dimensional stereotypes and showing that even the most selfish and shallow can carry a spark of decency. The way supporting actors Skarsg?rd and Vanderham are allowed to grow their characters from apparently superficial paramours to show they amount to so much more was one of the film's many highlights.Billed as joint directors, Scott McGehee and David Siegel are also on top of their game. The film flows naturally, its story and pacing is most even. The use of many close-ups instils an intimacy, and often having the camera at the eye level of a six-year old girl was also most effective; this combination had the effect of drawing the audience in and blurring the fourth wall - several times I turned away, closing my eyes and grimacing, feeling the pain of those I was watching. McGehee and Siegel also demonstrated how very limited use of hand-held camera can enhance a film when used most selectively.This is simply a film where everything comes together, where everything works and everyone involved can be proud of their efforts. Don't be put off that the subject matter might, ostensibly, be a little bleak. It goes much deeper than that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing but with redeeming features</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was looking forward to this film having read many favourable reviews and being excited by the stellar cast list. I left the cinema feeling a little empty and mildly depressed..I thought that both Steve Coogan and Julianne Moore were accomplished as ever, with Alexander Skarsgard playing perfectly the role of the na?ve but ultimately heroic new stepfather. The young actress who played Maisie was quite mesmerising (a mature and natural performer) and I look forward to seeing more of her.The problem for me was that many of the situations lacked realism. I just could not believe that, even taking into account their levels of self-absorption, the parents would variously abandon the child to virtual strangers on the streets of Manhattan. The lifestyles were not chaotic enough to justify this sort of behaviour. The manner in which these situations served to thrust the new partners into each other's lives lacked subtlety. I haven't read Henry James' novel on which the film is based, so I can't say if the problem arises from a difficulty in transposing the plot to the present day.There were glimpses of humour in the film, especially from Coogan, and I could have done with more of the same to lift my spirits..What did Maisie know? Possibly that she had found two genuinely loving temporary guardians who cared for her in the absence of her mostly inadequate parents. I left the cinema thinking that she would probably soon find herself back with one or other of those same inadequate parents.The film itself was beautifully shot and I liked how the slow pace of many of the scenes gave me a perspective of New York that differed to the common clich of hustle and noise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Vivid Insight on Today's Domestic Circumstances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've had a copy of this film since last year but never tried to purposely watch it on our movie time. I thought of it at first to be a mediocre family drama, but it turned out to be an excellently narrated heart-breaking story of a kind-hearted young girl who's tossed around amid the relationship crisis of her unmarried parents.The film was translated into modern time setting from a book written in 1896 by Henry James depicting irresponsible parents. The actors equally delivered great performances, including Joanna Vanderham who I think deserves an applause for her supporting role.What Maisie Knew, gives a fresh reflection about the importance of families, the togetherness and presence of both parents in rearing their child, and the innocent and disturbed thoughts of a girl who is caught up in an unfortunate situation. It can stir up emotion and awaken a person's inner heart of its capability to truly love and care. Several times, there were scenes that can bring the viewer to the edge of his emotion and blame the parents' stupidity and immaturity.Interestingly, the bleak possibility of the young girl's longing for the companionship of her parents seems to have been saved through the care of her parent's new spouses who got mixed up in the situation and were forced to look out for her.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really think it's a 10 out of 10!What Maisie Knew is a hearth breaking story from a child's perspective of a divorce and the afterwards.WHAT A JOB FROM THE DIRECTORS!!!First of all, how can a little girl be a better actress then half of the Hollywood stars? Honestly, I fell for every single act and emotion she made. The 4 adult actors and actresses did what they had to do, but the movie was directed way better then they could actually act memorable.The parents, Susanna and Beale (Julianne Moore and Steve Coogan) had great characteristics, you hated hem whenever they shown up. After one hour, you just wanted them to go away and never come back! The "new" parents, Margo and Lincoln (Joanna Vanderham and Alexander Skarsg?rd) were extremely boring at the beginning, and their character was also built up really great.The story is extremely realistic! The parent are getting divorced, but they don't want to take care of Maisie. The only thing what the want more than not taking care of Maisie is to not allow the other taking care of Maisie. They divorce, get married to Margo and Lincoln (yes, Susanna with Lincoln and Beale with Margo) who are ACTUALLY love Maisie. While Beale is always away, Susanna has always something better to do, then being with Maisie, just like going on a tour with her band. Lincoln meets Margo, and they three gets to love each other.But it's much much more than that. How many children are in a similar situation? Their parents doesn't even realize what trauma do they cause to their children. How many bad parents are out their, who think they are such great ones, and when their children grow up and have difficulties in society they find excuses. But it's all because of them! The story itself make sense I think. There were no surprises. But the way how we get there is very touching, and that's where you see the difference between a movie and a brilliantly directed movie.Thank you Scott McGehee, thank you David Siegel, thank you Onata Aprile (Maisie)!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little polarized, but appreciable attempt to reflect on parenthood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If anyone has still doubts concerning the fact that parents are not those who bear children, but those who raise and care for them, this movie will probably dispel these doubts. The story may be a little extreme in the way the parents of this little girl leave her anywhere without ever caring if she is safe, to the point that they could easily be accused of child neglect. However, I appreciated the interesting attempt to reflect on the meaning of parenthood in the modern world, full of egoist and immature adults, who often love sincerely their children, but often in a narcissistic way. The characters are also sometimes stereotyped and lack the possibility to express themselves fully, especially Julianne Moore and Steve Coogan, good actors, but entrapped in their perpetual skirmish, thus smoothing the way to the positive couple of step-parents (whose younger age may be a sign of trust in future generations?). At the same time I appreciated the distance and the fact there is no urgency to say and express everything. The little girl, whose perspective is constantly put on the foreground, is also almost reduced to silence, we are not given the chance to know what she really thinks or feel, but in a way we all know what she needs and we perceive it very clearly without the need of too many words. And here lie in my opinion the quality of the picture and its interesting approach.</fullReview>

Saw the ratings and as usual skipped to the User Reviews section to find some mixed reviews but the positive reviews made me want to give this movie a try. So I did and I couldn't be more glad. I couldn't believe a child of that age can act that well and I'm no expert at judging acting but I can tell when it is brilliantly done. The entire cast made it easy to forget that I was watching a movie and those weren't real people. I didn't look away from the screen even once and that practically never happens while I'm watching movies. Some movies are so high on emotions that they emotionally drain you and leave you exhausted but this movie has just the right balance. There were a few scenes where I was smiling without realizing it. It hasn't received the hype that it should have and that's a shame. I recommend everyone to watch this movie and experience the subtle brilliance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maisie is a 7 year old girl who's life spins in chaos as her parents fight over her custody. Her mother, Julianne Moore, is a self-centered, aging rock singer. Her father, Steve Coogan, is overly-busy, too caught up in his work to give his daughter the attention she needs. Maisie finds peace with her nanny, Joanna Vanderham, who's own life begins to get too complicated for her after she moves in with Maisie's father. Maisie soon finds a new friend in Lincoln, played by Alexander Skarsg?rd, a bartender and friend of Maisie's mother.Julianne Moore is excellent as Maisie's mother, Susanna, a character so infuriating, we want to jump through the screen and slap her. Steve Coogan's character is calm, collective and polite though doesn't seem to understand the reality of the responsibility he has as a father. Just as Maisie is no different than a piece of jewelry to make her mother seem caring, to her father, Maisie symbolizes some sort of accomplishment. When the ugly custody battle is over, it's obvious that neither the mother or father truly love Maisie anymore than themselves and neither of them really want to be burdened with having to raise a child. They have their own lives and careers to worry about.It's a heart-breaking tale that is quite frustrating to watch at first and yet it has a strange, beautifully innocent appeal to it all. This is thanks to well-written characters and wonderful performances by Joanna Vanderham, Alexander Skarsg?rd and especially, Onata Aprile as Maisie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>unlikely fairytale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title of 'What Maisie Knew' is a misnomer, deliberately so. A more accurate title would be 'What Maisie Will Know.' A young child witnessing up close the acrimonious breakdown of her parents' marriage will inevitably revisit the moments later in life, reinterpreting events in light of her own growing experience. The filmmakers deliberately leave open the question of what, exactly, Maise knows. Onata Aprile's naturalistic, disarming portrayal of Maisie is the perfect platform for the audience to project their own interpretation of exactly how the child views events.The huge flaw here is a hugely improbable ending that lays a saccharine filter over traumatic experience. Anyone watching the movie who has, as a child, witnessed the ugly divorce of their own parents - and there will be many such viewers - will view the ending as a cop-out. The best thing that could happen to Maisie is the thing least likely to happen - her carers fall in love and claim her for their own. And, miracle of miracles, it happens. It is a pat climax that avoids dealing with the consequences of child abandonment. Children long for their parents. Implying Maisie has bypassed that emotion does a disservice to the theme.Rarely was a 'happy ending' been so unwarranted, and infuriating. I am not sure what ending the film should have had, but it most certainly wasn't this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>5.9 of 10. The movie/rock star version of a child stuck in a divorce and its many other complications. There's a variety of mystery and relationship subplots going on, such as who is the villain and who is the hero and who gets Maise. The child in this case has the advantage of having wealthy parents, so some of the normal problems are removed while other problems come up and other common problems remain.The casting fits nearly perfect. The girl is cute but not too cute, which fits her parents. Moore is still attractive but clearly an aged star beyond her prime years, someone like so many in the present day seeking to be a parent a little too late.Despite an intriguing story that has most of the touches of reality lacking in too many family films, it doesn't go anywhere significant and never really fits the title, leaving it as a cute heart warmer of a film about what Maise observes and feels.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Normally I despise newer movies because of the bad camera lighting, the music and the plots, but this film was very good. It is from the perspective of Maisie, a little girl thrown back and forth between her divorced unstable parents. Her dad, who married the housekeeper, is always away, and her mom, a depressed rock star who is always on tour. Maisie would rather stay with Lhincon, a guy who immediately likes Maisie and begins to realize that she is being mistreated. He also falls in love with Margo, the housekeeper and Maisie's best friend. Margo and Lhincon begin to act as surrogate parents, taking her to the city and letting her enjoy her childhood.It really points out the common problem of negligent parents, as Maisie gets left at school, a bar and the apartment, and she begins to act older than most kids her age. The film was based on a novel published by Penguin Books.I'm rating it 9 out of 10, for great acting, a lovely drama story and how closely it follows the book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's a lot of good in this movie, but unfortunately, I just could not get past the lame choice to make Julianne Moore's character a "rock star." I just found it totally unbelievable and it served no purpose toward the plot or story arc whatsoever. She has made a career of playing high-strung, dysfunctional characters, so no problem there. But rock star? I don't buy it. You can't just throw on a bad tattoo and expect it to work. She has no edge at all. Was Betty White unavailable? And plus, she's not so dysfunctional that she's a druggie trainwreck, so why even bother? What she does is insignificant to the overall story, so why make such a wild leap of logic? I just found it totally distracting and annoying. The rest of the cast does fine, although the messages are a bit obvious and they beat you over the head with them while feigning subtlety.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Maisie Knew</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Indie director duo McGehee &amp; Siegel has harvested great word-of-mouth and critic appraise for their second feature THE DEEP END (2001, 8/10), although the consecutive spelling bee drama BEE SEASON (2005, 5/10) is a fiasco and after a low-key romance-drama UNCERTAINTY (2009), their fifth collaboration is WHAT MAISIE KNEW, a modern-day custody battle in NYC transposed from Henry James' 1887 novel of the same title. Maisie is a beautiful schoolgirl, mom is a rock singer and dad is an art work broker, their bourgeois life has plummeted into chaos when her parents facing an ugly divorce, the contest for her custody introduces Maisie a stepmom and a stepdad, whom Maisie grows close with thanks to the regular negligence of her biological parents. The film valiantly fixates its camera from Maisie's angle, she is the reticent victim of the aftermath caused by her parents' failure to co-exist under the same roof, through her ethereal princess adorableness, the film is ample with aesthetically stunning shots, NYC has never been so unworldly intimate and hauntingly dreamlike, all the more precious, McGehee and Siegel unflaggingly refuses to betray any speck of sentimentality and melancholia, as awful as the situations are, there is no tear-jerking awkwardness, instead, a less-disturbed recording of the hustle and bustle is capable of invoking much more inner ripple effects and self-reflection. Onata Aprile as Maisie, has been elicited great on screen glamour through her innocuous postures, she is no crybaby, no temper tantrum either, a dainty soul evolves far maturer than she should have. Moore and Coogan as the biological parents, are the negative examples of parenting, Moore renders a spot-on mimicry in her rockstar garments and delivers an overpowering rancor out of her character's unlovable carapace while Coogan, sheds his comic burden, is less flamboyant but more cunning than he appears. Skarsg?rd and Vanderham, as the young surrogate caretakers of Maisie, the former downplays his masculinity and feels shortchanged as a toy-boy-bartender, the latter is such a boon to the film, Vanderham vibrantly offer her second fiddle role with great emotional ups-and-downs, as her film debut, she should on the list of young talent to watch.A no-guts-no-glory slant on familial dysfunction on parenting, a moral tale to forewarn those adults who think they can, but are not wise enough to proffer a healthy environment for their children, who supplant devoted love with self-centered egoism and play the under-appreciated one to earn others' sympathy. What Maisie knew? She knows when adults are lying to her, she knows how to be the grateful to the kindhearted, she knows how to love her parents in spite of their respective imperfection, Maisie knows too much about the despicable world, but she is also a lucky girl, she has found something which is untainted and someone who will cherish her wholeheartedly. The film is an indie gem and attests McGehee and Siegel's faculty in film- making should not be overlooked.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emotionally unconvincing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have not read the original story so came to this tale of a child's experience of parental love, lost and found, with few preconceptions. It's a fairly undemanding movie to watch partly because there is a lack of conviction in the acting of the parents, played by Joanne Moore and Steve Coogan. The former plays an ageing, self-absorbed rock artist (Susanna) while the latter portrays her equally self-centred art-dealer husband (Beale), but neither manage to produce an emotionally compelling performance. Moore never seems to be able to escape the impression of being a Hollywood actress acting,while Coogan comes over as rather shifty and slightly odd and deploys an accent that varies from pure Coogan to slightly transatlantic Coogan. Joanna Vanderham, playing his second wife (Margo), also seems afflicted by a wobbly accent that floats from hints of Irish to increasingly strong Scots. Onata Aprile, as Maisie, is engaging throughout but a cute kid is not enough to raise the production beyond the average. The best acting comes from Alexander Skarsgard (Lincoln), who gives us the one moment of emotive power when he has a spat in the street with Susanna. It was a bold move to end the film with a long slow motion shot of Maisie running into the sunset - bold but still a dreadful clich! Compared to other recent films depicting a child's struggles in an adult world (eg Kid On a Bike, I Wish, Sister) What Maisie Knew falls well short. But still watchable.

It follows that the girl sees and hears, and we see her world through her play and her conversations to other adults. Though the plot is rather grim, the filmmakers manage to portray the events without being overly dramatic. This makes it surprisingly easy and pleasant to watch. It pains me to see Maisie being thrown like a ball from one adult to another, yet Maisie is still holding up without showing negativity. It shows that Maisie's world is untainted and innocent. It almost feels like there is a glimmer of hope and love through the child's eyes, despite being entangled in the messed up adult world.</fullReview>

Alexander Skarsgard is excellent as Lincoln. He plays to Onata Aprile's remarkably authentic acting naturally. I was amazed. Joanna Vanderham as Margo is good, but less convincing as kid-loving governess and stepmother. The fact that James' work translates so well into the upper class of this time is stunning. Child as trophy, as projection screen, as puppet. The basic assertion of the story is simple. A child will recognize love and gravitate to it, despite the conventions of society or manipulation of dysfunctional birth parents. This story reflect James' insights into human nature, which were partially enlightened by his brilliant brother, William, who was one of the first scientific physician-psychologists in the U.S..

		<fullReview>"What Maisie Knew", a modern film adaptation of an Henry James' novel, directed by Scott McGehee and David Siegel, delves into the life of a child, Maisie (Onata Aprile), daughter of a neurotic Rock singer, Susanna (Julianne Moore) and a businessman, Beale (Steve Coogan), whose primary concern is his business and as her parents fight for her custody, Maisie finds in her nanny, Margo (Joanna Vanderham), and her mother's new husband, Lincoln (Alexander Skarsgard), the care she is oh so lacking in her parents' self- absorption and verbal arguments. Although the film has its fair share of theatrics with Julianne Moore providing an over the top (and entertaining) performance as Maisie's selfish mother, the film is for the most part a delicate drama bolstered by a exceptional performance from its lead child actress, Onata Aprile, who provides a perceptive and restrained performance which is just delightful and heartbreaking. A solid supporting cast with excellent turns from Alexander Skarsgard, Joanna Vanderham and especially Steve Coogan. Julianne Moore shines with a part which could have easily landed her into camp and at times she does, but she's able to bring an understanding into her role which prevents the character from being a caricature. The film does suffer from a contrived plot as seen in its second half, but as it ended, those dubious plot turns became quibbles compared to the power of the film in being moving.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hate movies involving kids and animals. I avoid them like the plague because they strike the most sensitive cord in my heart which is the care for the ones who cannot care for themselves.Then again, I cannot turn a blind eye to the ugly reality around me, so I went ahead a watched a movie that I knew would make me hate certain parents. This movie made me feel so, because despite that we may live in a different city or have a different social status, kids are kids whatever the circumstances.I want to start by congratulating every single actor for their incredibly credible performances, and if Julianne Moore or Steve Coogan ever read this review I want to also add a ton of love for the difficult roles they had to play. Onata Aprile (Maisie) was of course incredible.Now I want to start from what I did not like about this movie, which unfortunately I wish it could happen in real life. There are some minor exaggerations and parts where, while probably true in some cases, I can hardly believe it would happen in every separation with kids involved, but what prevented this movie for getting my full marks were the happiest parts. It's like watching a miracle; by definition this is not meant to happen. These parts took me away from the feeling of watching real lives and made me remember that, after all, this is a movie, and what is going to happen is whatever the screenwriters and directors say that is going to happen.And what did happen? Marginal reality, because god forgive that we, the audience, are presented with the 100% true facts of what really goes on in the lives of the children. The movie got it almost right, 90% of the time, and for that I am thankful. And for that I recommend every future parent to watch this movie not thinking themselves as the 10%, as the exception, but as the most likely rule.If you do not have kids but wants them remember to ask yourself if you have enough time, enough patience, and the right partner to conceive a human life that needs these three ingredients. A human life is far too important to leave it to chance, and sometimes just because you happen to have functioning reproductive organs does not mean you should be a parent. Sometimes it is better to deny yourself of that gratification so you can do the right thing, the mature thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Maisie Really Knew!! Plus a Homage to Other Great Child Acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS Of course!I will not rehash the plot of this excellent film. I will only comment on the subjective undercurrent of the story, and at the end pay a little homage to similar great child performances.A critic said that this film has a "happy ending." Unfortunately, I beg to differ.Since the film makers knew that they could not, within the constraints of a 2 hr. movie, show the maturation and aging of Maisie the way James could in a full novel, they (the film makers) chose to end the film on an outwardly superficial and subsequently, a very unsettling ending. Just as within the film, Maisie is viewed almost like a stagnant garden statue that is moved here and there by the whims of its owner, the ending is also one of "false" happiness, and security. a moment in time, or a slice of life fugue that becomes most unsettling, even horrifying when you realize that this idyllic moment is just that, a brief interlude.Soon, Maisie will have to go back to her mother, her father will be almost totally out of the picture, and who knows where Margo and Lincoln will end up because it is painfully obvious that the glue that holds them together is not a true budding love for each other, but an overwhelming love of Maisie and a need to be her saviors. But, in the end, they cannot be, and though we as viewers hope for the typical Hollywood happy ending, it also cannot be. The stoic innocence of Maisie's present will soon be shattered by the realities of adolescence and beyond. The fact that we can foresee the damaged adulthood that lays ahead despite the momentary reprieve is what is so horrific. Like the 1960's film of Shirley Jackson's "The Haunting", the "unseen" is often more horrifying than the usual theatrics of most films of this nature.In closing, I would also like to comment on the affective emotional state of Maisie. I think this subtlety is where the film really stands out. We have been subjected to enough graphic horrors of child abuse, child abandonment, and unfit parents in film. Movies of this nature tend to be terrifying like "Bastard Out of Carolina" or lightly played as in Kramer Vs. Kramer. Maisie is characterized almost as an enigma. We see her for the most part as a receptacle of the unchecked emotions of the grownups that surround her, yet she does not let us into her world, but we "know" what damage to her psyche must be taking place.The most poignant moment in the film (to me) came where Maisie, for one brief moment lets down her emotive guard and while lying in her bed, sheds a single tear. We then "know" what Maisie "knew"It also did not escape me that considering Maisie's almost "frozen" inner emotional state of being, that this momentary realization on her part, was an either intentional, or unintentional homage to that famous scene in the French short film, "La Jetee"Maybe, it was in this moment that Maisie (as the James novel evokes) has a premonition of "the death of her own childhood". Because despite Maisie's false bravado, the film's ending is a but a momentary false hope.The truer narrative is that Maisie, along with Margo and Lincoln will be forced by circumstance to soon confront the transient nature of their beach house fairy-tale, and we as viewers must transition from the world of film to the bleaker future realities of Henry James's novel.This performance by child actor, Onata Aprile, reminded me of another child actress, Ana Torrent, who's wonderful understated acting can be seen in the films: El Espritu de la Colmena (The Spirit of the Beehive) and Cra Cuervos (Raise Ravens) my personal favorite.Though a totally different style of acting, probably the best performance of a child acting in a film period, was Ann Carter in the 1944 film, "Curse of the Cat People" the Val Lewton masterpiece that could be (and has been use d as such) A textbook of child psychology. The title has nothing to do with this gem of a movie, used only to appease his RKO contract to make a sequel. Lewton wanted to call the film, "Anna and Her Friend"And lets not forget the over the top "stagy" by design, performance of Patty McCormack in the 1956 film, "The Bad Seed" (too bad the Hayes code did not permit the film to end like the book...the movie's only flaw)Finally, one of the most beautiful performance by a child actor was Patricia Gozzi, in the 1962 Best Picture, "Sundays and Cybele" ( Les Dimanches de Ville d'Avray) I cry every time I see this film, now out in BD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Directed by Scott McGehee, "What Maisie Knew" stars Onata Aprile as Maisie, the young daughter of a couple who are concluding a bitter custody battle.Sounds clichd? What's original about the film is this: as Maisie's biological parents are both a couple of negligent jerks, Maisie's mother's new husband (Alexander Skarsgard) and Maisie's father's new wife (Joanna Vanderham) strike up a romantic relationship and then essentially "adopt" Maisie as their own. Also original is the fact that the film is told entirely from Maisie's point of view, unfolding via stolen glances and overheard conversation, little Maisie always eavesdropping upon an adult world she isn't fully privy to.Unfotunately, the two most original things about "What Maisie Knew" completely undermine one another. The film's adulterous relationships promise to be interesting, but as we're limited to Maisie's POV, we're never privy to what happens within it."What Maisie Knew" was based on a novel by the great Henry James. It ends with Maisie at a beach-house, the poor girl shuttled to yet another home and family. Like the baby turtle Maisie symbolically purchases, "home" for Maisie has become an always moving farce. 7.9/10 ? See "Like Dandelion Dust", "The Squid and the Whale", "Faces" and "Shoot the Moon".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maisie Knew...her parents were piranha</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What Maisie Knew....that her parents sucked, that her parents were selfish, irrational, irresponsible, egotistical narcissist. This was an emotional movie showing exactly what can happen when parents are too caught up in themselves rather than the person that is supposed to be their center - their child. It was so sad seeing how they used the girl to get back at the other parent. It also showed how one can say "I love you" all they want, but it means nothing if they don't show it. Alexander Skarsgard is a really good actor because he came off as a simpleton in this film - a sweet simpleton, but so far removed from his "True Blood" Eric role. The acting throughout the film was excellent and while this film was somewhat predictable, it had the ending that you crave for this young child. It was perfect. Overall, this was really well done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maisie (Onata Aprile) is a six year old who is trying to exist as her family disintegrates. Her mother Susanna (Julianne Moore) is a rock star angry at her art dealing husband Beale (Steve Coogan). The divorce is a bitter affair. Eventually Beale marries the nanny Margo (Joanna Vanderham), and Susanna marries bartender Lincoln (Alexander Skarsg?rd). Neither parent is really fit to raise Maisie.This is a modern day reinterpretation of the Henry James novel. The audience is invited to experience the divorce through the eyes of the child. It is heartbreaking when the mother tries to couch the child in her divorce interview. However there isn't enough of those moments. There is a much more naturalistic flow. It is very subtle. It's maybe too subtle. The inherit drama isn't pushed out to the front. The child is an isolated passive figure floating from one caretaker to the next. It's a tale often told since it was first published in 1897.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A heartbreaking movie with a world class turn from it's young star</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Upon watching What Maisie Knew something becomes glaringly apparent in regards to the most under-seen and underrated movies of 2013, for Maisie is right up there in concerns to both of those titles as it's one of the best acted and well told touching tales in recent memory and heralds a stunning turn from first timer Onata Aprile as the titular young girl caught up in a horrifyingly complicated break up.Directors McGehee and Siegel should be commended for the telling of this story which is adapted from Henry James's acclaimed novel. McGehee and Siegel do a fantastic job of situating the story from Maisie's point of view, a tactic that could of easily failed if the directors and young actress were not 100% on their game which stunningly they are on from the films beginning right through to the touching end. Performances are universally strong by the cast but despite featuring many a seasoned performer all are outplayed by Aprile.It would be remiss to review this film without spending sufficient time talking about the revelation that is Aprile. This young girl completely owns this film and makes Maisie one of the most fully formed and hauntingly beautiful characters to grace the screens in quite some time. Aprile's turn is filled with humour, elegance, love and sadness and not once does she make a misstep with the material set before her. It's quite a sad prospect that due to the films low key release and general public knowledge it's likely Aprile's turn will not be recognised at award ceromonies but make no doubt about it, her turn should be acknowledged as one of last years best.Watching What Maisie Knew with a dry eye is a daunting prospect for the film is touching beyond words and as haunting as anything released in the last 5 years. Finding the film may not be easy but the search is worth the reward for Maisie deserves to sit along classic break up tales such as Kramer Vs Kramer and welcomes in a new young acting talent on the scale not seen since Dakota Fanning in I Am Sam.4 and a half useless parents out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Evocative and moving</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The adorable six year old Maisie (a very persuasive performance by Onata Aprile) lives in New York City where she is the subject of a bitter custody battle between her rock star mother Susanna (American Julianne Moore, convincing in an unsympathetic role) and her art dealer father Beale (British Steve Coogan in - for him - an unusual non-comic portrayal). Each parent co-opts an aide in the war, Susanna taking up with bar man Lincoln (the Swedish actor Alexander Skarsg?rd) and Beale seducing Maisie's former nanny Margo (Scottish Joanna Vanderham). The twisting narrative is seen through Maisie's eyes as she is treated like a shuttlecock between the four adults who often behave more like children themselves.It is clear where this story is going pretty early in the tale, but I found this small, independent movie genuinely moving and it had me talking to the television screen on which I viewed it. This is partly because I found it so evocative: I was myself the subject of a contested custody battle when I was eight (my mother won) and my first wife and I handled our custody case so, so differently (I had custody of our five year old son). But any viewer would find "What Maisie Knew" impressive because of the convincing performances and believable situations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How do we stop loving our children?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What Maisie knewI wish I could ask every parent who wants to divorce to see this film. I wish all divorce lawyers, social workers, psychologists and psychiatrists would see this film. Having children and trying to keep a family together is not easy. I remember the terror I experienced when, as a child of about eight I thought that my parents might divorce. To be suddenly homeless as a child has to be the most horrible experience.We have so much more, materially and financially, than our parents had, but somehow, somewhere along the way, we appear to have become so very hard of heart. We have become cold, unfeeling and even cruel. How do apparently normal adults, neglect, violate and abuse innocent children who did not choose to be born? What happens to our sense of responsibility? How do even apparently religious, morally upright and ethical people put their own careers and spiritual needs ahead of their children's? Our children are part of our DNA. Yet, somehow, many seem capable of separating themselves from their children, ignoring them and become uncaring. In many parts of the world including S A, babies have been raped, violated, physically assaulted and even murdered. In Kwa Dabeka a 7 yr old child was decapitated about a decade ago.While Homo Sapiens' knowledge has increased, while we have tens of thousands of gadgets that enable our lives to be so much easier, we seem to have retained the primitive and savage behaviour of our primeval antecedents; only, we cloak it better than they did. But it seems that it is still there.This film is unique because it looks at a home coming apart through the child's eyes. We see the bickering, raging parents, the selfish careerists for whom the child is a burden, an unwanted ball and chain. The parents do not physically violate the child, she does not often weep, but the agony of a home disintegrating is there, in her eyes... The people that the child eventually wants to go to,the love that she eventually receives is what this film is all about.This film was heart-wrenching but for me it added a dimension that we adults might have lost along the way as we aged.

		<shortDescription>Excellent but also heartbreaking!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An excellent, if somewhat intense and depressing drama. This movie looks at a messy parental break up from the point of view of the young child caught in the middle. It gives you some fascinating insights into what children see and understand of such matters (ie a lot!) and reminds you how resilient they are even to awful mistreatment.Onata Aprile, the young actress that plays Maisie, steals the show. Everyone else is reduced to bit parts by her outstanding performance. She comes across as a withdrawn child who finds joy in drawing and her imagination. But she's also someone that clearly loves her mummy and daddy, and she is always ecstatic to see them even when they've been awful to her. It's heartbreaking to watch.There is added interest from the budding romance between the two young partners of the separated parents. They are much more caring and you just wish they could run away with Maisie! Makes it all the more heartbreaking that you know the situation isn't going to get better or simpler for Maisie throughout the rest of her childhood.This is a movie that makes you think, but be prepared to feel dreadful after watching it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Maise Knew , What did she know? Hum</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was excellent from any point of view you want to see it from. It shows the reality of a divorce, the sadness of what happens when kids have to switch from one parent to another when it is shared custody, the irresponsibility of some parents and mostly it leaves a huge lesson.The lesson is that you do not have to be the biological parent to be a parent. It shows the two sides of a story. That both parents might love their little girl, but do not know how to care for her. By the other side the ones that are not the parents do what parents are suppose to do. This movie is sad but has a happy ending. It is not that type of movie in which all the movie is about court. It just shows one scene of the court less than 1 minute. And it touched my heart because I have a 6 year old. My husband asked me at the end..... Why is is called What Maise Knew? I was like silly, because she was not dumb. She knew all along that even if her parents loved she could not take care of her, she would always say for everything OK, I am OK, That is fine. But in the inside she knew the reality of things.That day the movie touched my husband so much that he said, let's play a parcheesi with our 6 year old. My 6 year old is always asking to play that game and we are always, later, tomorrow, on the weekend. My husband and I agreed with this movie that a healthy family is the one that is in peace and not fighting all the time, the one that has time to do a breakfast for your child, the one that has time to go pick him up from school and not send someone else to do your responsibility, the one who cares and is willing to do sacrifices. You know what I mean when the movie ends.I recommend it because it is very touching and it is the best divorce movie I have seen in years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We are left to ponder what exactly Maisie knew.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a "title" person, a title has to make sense to me once the movie is over. I believe I know what Maisie knew, but she is such a small child and rather quiet so I have to guess. I guess she knew who really cared about her and who didn't.Julianne Moore is Susanna, a singer who tours with her group. She isn't very good but I suppose every singer in a spot like that hopes the next break might be their big one. She is married to Steve Coogan as Beale, he is an art dealer who always seems to have something important in the works that his wife and child get only the small amount of attention that might be left over.Their young daughter, maybe 6, is cute Onata Aprile as Maisie. (Her mom is an actress, she had a minor role.) She seems very well-adjusted, but seems to be a pawn in her mom and dad's legal wranglings to get a divorce. The story gets a bit complicated, with her nanny (Joanna Vanderham) and her mom's new husband (Alexander Skarsg?rd) getting involved. In fact her dad apparently marries the much younger nanny, but only as a way to have someone care for Maisie when he was away, which was often.Overall it is a story of some very dysfunctional parents and their little daughter just wanting to have a normal young life. It seems that what "she knew", in a scene near the end with her mom, is that even though she loved her mom, she was better off without her. And without her dad.This is a hard movie to rate, I found it very interesting but when it was all done it just seemed yet another childhood tragedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not only Maisie who knows where this is going. It's the viewer too. It will be hard not to see where this is going. That doesn't mean it's a bad thing though. While we can see where this is going (from Maisies point of view), the actors make it worth our while, which is a feat if you think there are only 4 people carrying this on their shoulders (if you count Maisie out).The acting and the decent pace the story moves makes this a very enjoyable if very predictable story. Something everyone can watch, if they like a drama or two. So while this wasn't the best movie I watched that year it's still one of the better ones</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Updating of a Classic Henry James Text</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Those who expect this updating to be close to the Jamesian source-text are in for a disappointment. Directors Scott McGehee and David Siegel transpose the tale to contemporary New York and transform it into a gut- wrenchingly powerful tale of a child (Onata Aprile) torn between two self-interested parents (Julianne Moore, Steve Coogan), and their respective spouses (Joanna Vanderham, Alexander Skarsgard). Aprile's performance is quite simply remarkable - although obviously in love with both parents, she seems to accept everything that happens to her. Neither parent seems particularly interested in her, despite their frequent protestations of love; the spouses try their best to make a life for Maisie, but have to cope with the fact that neither of them are her blood-relatives. They therefore have no claim on her. Directors McGehee and Siegel make wonderful use of New York locations: the shiny world of the upmarket apartment where Maisie has no real place; the stylish bar where Maisie has to spend one or two nights; the seedy whorehouse; and the continual shots of iconic yellow taxis, symbolizing the transience of Maisie's life. In the end she achieves some kind of self-determination; it might not last very long, but at least it represents some kind of an advance on her past. In dramatic terms this has to be one of the best James adaptations I've seen; far superior to many of the fusty costume dramas produced in the past.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Spoiler-Free Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What Maisie Knew is in the same vein as a Kramer vs. Kramer. It's the heartbreaking story of the end of a relationship told through the eyes of a little girl. What makes this film different and highly emotional, is that the film is not about the separation necessarily, it's just the catalyst for what the story is really about. Maisie's parents (played by Steve Coogan and Julainne Moore) are breaking up. They're both self-centered people who are the sole reason as to why they have issues, and poor Maisie gets caught up in the middle of their self-centered battles. However, there is a shimmer of light for Maisie when both parents get remarried and Maisie's new stepparents are thrust into having to care for this girl who has been neglected for so long by her biological parents. I think what this film illuminates so well, is that just because someone is a child's biological parent, does not mean that they are actually a mother or a father, it takes someone who is genuinely special to fill that role. While the film never gives us much closure, and often dips into melodrama, as a whole, this is a film made by the sweetness of the relationships between Maisie and her stepparents, and a large part of this is due to Onata Aprile's wonderfully innocent performance as Maisie.I give What Maisie Knew a 9 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sad, tender &amp; sprinkled with a special kind of beauty.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You probably missed What Maisie Knew first time around. Seek it out. If you really need it categorized, it's Kramer vs Kramer for the modern, even more screwed-up times but far more tender and sprinkled with a special kind of beauty.Take a married couple, divorce them, dump an innocent, wide-eyed child in the middle, pour in a couple of decent new spouses into the mix and that's the essence of What Maisie Knew.Susannah (Julianne Moore) is an aging, floundering rock star using drink and drugs as crutches and surrounding herself with loud music, loud people and anything peripheral that will keep reality at bay and make her feel, superficially, good about herself. Beale (Steve Coogan) is her art dealer husband who calls it a day on their ailing marriage, taking their daughter's nanny, Margo (Joanna Vanderham) with him, for more reasons than childcare. Susannah marries younger model and barman Lincoln (Alexander Skarsg?rd) in willful revenge and, at the centre of it all, is their daughter, Maisie (Onata Aprile), watching silently, trying to make sense of the mess around her and reaching out for simple, honest love from whoever will give it.Directed by brothers Scott McGehee and David Siegel, What Maisie Knew is a beautiful film of divorce, child custody, sadness and frustration. One desperately wants to shake the parents (or lock them in the boot of a car and drop them off deep in the desert where they can do no harm) and make everything turn out right for the good people in the film. This is a fine example of the 'law' and 'the right thing' being completely at odds with each other. We know pretty quickly what should happen and what we want to happen, but we also know the law would never allow it. But maybe, just maybe? What Maisie Knew is hung on the star power of Moore and Coogan and they play their parts in this love quadrangle perfectly. Susannah is difficult to like, but Moore plays her not as a despicable mother who doesn't care but as a creature to be pitied, as a woman who genuinely loves her daughter and who knows she should do right by her, but is so needy, so anxious for validation and another sticking plaster of excitement that she cannot let go of her own needs for the sake of Maisie's. Moore gives us a woman who tries to grab at everything and consequently cannot keep hold of anything tightly or permanently. Although she knows she is failing Maisie, the attraction of preventing Beale form having what she cannot cope with is enough to spur her on.Coogan is never going to be a versatile actor nor attain the success of Moore. Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa is proof enough of that. But, surprisingly, he's on very good form here as a father who, again, loves his own daughter but is equally too wrapped up in his own world and neediness to provide the time and attention that she needs.Margo is instantly established as the angel of What Maisie Knew, but McGehee and Siegel are not so careless as to allow her to be perfect. In an emotional scene outside her apartment we see the cracks in her certainty (and her new marriage), but that, in turn, allows the truth of her innate goodness to shine through. It is a gentle, strong performance from a fine actress who has worked largely on the small screen up to now, and one that will cause many hearts to flutter.Skarsg?rd's Lincoln is painted as the weak, but good-hearted man who discovers his own capacity for love. It is a subtle performance from the actor known to many as Eric in TV's True Blood, and I'm willing to bet he'll give more prominence to What Maisie Knew on his CV than last year's risible Battleship.As for Onata Aprile, she is so natural, so affecting that you'll want to take her home with you.Whilst entirely engaging and resistant of an absolute Hollywood ending, What Maisie Knew will disappoint aficionados of Henry James, upon whose source novel of the same name this is loosely based. This takes a small slice of the novel, ending long before Maisie reaches maturity, and eschews the conclusions the novel draws, but with under 100 minutes to play with, it is inevitable that much would be excised and some characters (Mrs. Wix, particularly) diluted and brushed over.What Maisie Knew flows a little too smoothly but that, like the comparisons with the novel, is a minor gripe. It is a far more relevant and saddening film than Kramer vs Kramer, perhaps because divorce is closer to us all now, but it won't garner the same attention. Nevertheless, it's a sweet, sad film for a quiet evening and a thoughtful drive home.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WHAT MAISIE KNEW very effectively shows a child's eye view of the adult world and various things that the six-year-old protagonist understands perhaps better than anyone else. The audience attains a keen level of empathy with Maisie, caught in a crazy quadrangle of instabilities, jealousies, and intrusions of strangers. This film is fine satire on superficial priorities and relationships as well as the phoniness of the adult world in general. It's moving without being the least bit maudlin or sentimental. Sometimes the plot seems tangential and that we need to know just a little bit more about the five central characters; however, that patchy quality still contributes something to one of the film's biggest themes, as quoted from the soundtrack in the title of this review.WHAT MAISIE KNEW is a subtle film that does not immediately grab you with action, suspense, or any of that sort of stuff; still, if you give it a chance to immerse you, it will. Excellent acting and character development, especially by Alexander Skarsgard as Lincoln and, of course, Onata Aprile as Maisie.A lot of screaming, cussing, and generally adult situations; otherwise, it hardly merits an "R" rating--No blatant violence/gore, sex/nudity, or other such elements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie was based on the century old novel but this adaptation set in modern-day New York City. It was perfectly transformed from 100 years old culture and lifestyle to present era.It tells the story of a little girl called Maisie who notices his parents' irresponsible behavior towards her which leads to make her own decision for the future of her own. The kid was so adorable and her splendid performance made the movie one of a best adoption and justice to the book though I haven't read it.At first glance I thought the character Lincoln was a pervert because I was not aware of the tale what it's all about but later turned out one of the unique and best story. And same goes to the character Margo as well. It was not your usual drama, it was about a kid whose life slowly falling apart because of her parents inadvertence. Her bravery like an adult makes key to the bright future. It was a nice movie about parenting errors, this kinda stuffs happening everywhere in the world, hope this movie will be an eye opener of the parents like the kid from this movie. As per the entertainment it was a little draggy other than that it was a absolutely important message tale.8/10</fullReview>

The two for me that come to mind are The Passion Of The Christ and We Need To Talk About Kevin. This is in another category of movie where it leaves you speechless because there are so many things you want to say about it but find it hard to express. The little girl who plays Maisie really steals the movie from Moore and the other big names by portraying a girl with such innocence that you really want nothing but the best for her in the hell she is going through. Besides being a very great movie it will also make you feel different about being a parent and why putting your child's welfare ahead of your own is so important. An example of why everyone should not be allowed to have children. Overall, a must see and important movie that won't get the publicity and recognition it deserves because nothing blows up in it. I give it an A.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting view from children's side, realistic and remarkable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What did she know... Well.This was very spectacular movie about childhood and weird parent issues, very tight and made me remember those times long time ago.Somewhat humor few times and very good acting, directing, script and adaptation. I don't know what genre this should be in actually, drama of course but thats about it.I think many parents should see this when their kids are very small. There are some kind of lectures in this film that might make think things about the future, what that nice little kid really things, feels, how to make her life better than seeing father and mother fighting all the time.Final words: This is not movie for kids, maybe for quickly grown teenagers and adults. It's not easy to catch the whole idea, had to see this twice and in second time with English subtitles so I didn't miss a lot.Very very remarkable movie, worth to watch. Not for some CGI-lovers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's so hard to write about a good movie, with the bad ones is easy. What can I say, I was impressed of everything in this movie: the acting, the scenery, the costumes, the lighting, everything was just right here. It's a drama, but very well done! At some point I was crying seeing what they were doing to the little child. I was speechless! It's the ordinary crude unfair life through the perspective of a simple child who has done nothing wrong! The loving parents are not loving anymore, and that little girl needs a family! I was angry on her mother when she left her in the middle of the night alone at the pub's door, not even wondering herself if Lincoln was on duty or not! The story is wonderful: although simple and without many twists, is showing us how crude the life can be. Straight to our hearts! The acting is admirable, everyone in this movie delivered, no fake moments here: Julianne is a brilliant actress, one of the best IMHO right now, every role she gets...you just can't tell she's acting. The scenery is simple and no sunny moments there but is exactly what a moody drama like this needs! What can I say more, go see it or rent it or do something, maybe sometimes we need to remember and cry!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uninspired</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What Maisie Knew addresses the theme of divorce and its consequences on children through the eyes of little Maisie, but if the approach is sincere, the movie isn't convincing. The situations, not always very realistic, are dreadfully frozen, same thing applies to the characters who don't evolve, stuck in their unsubtle stereotypes. Moreover, the rhythm is terribly slow, the few interesting things are a lot too diluted, and even though the movie is just an 1h35 long, you quickly get bored. Add on top of that badly directed actors who don't convey enough emotions and a far-fetched happy ending, and there is not much left to save from this uninspired adaptation that deserved better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing film, truly amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would seldom give any film this high a rating. This is the best performance by a child actor I have ever seen. Even though the directors say that many of the lines were scripted at times it is clear that the characters just take off with improv that is so real and "of the moment" that it leaves one speechless at the ways in which scenes are carried, especially with "Maise" who steals the show throughout and touches the hearts of all, on camera and in the theater. All five of the main actors were superb, so very real and believable. What a deep insight into life, love, adult conflict, betrayal, Touching, moving, sad, joyous! Don't miss this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wake up call for parents</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a very moving story portraying the realities of what is in the eyes of a child because of the bad choices parents make. Putting career and your own selfish interest is not an option once you become a parent and if you have issues with your husband/wife/partner keep it behind close doors. Great acting by all, especially Onata Aprile. We should all really think more about what a child goes through when parents break up and try to make it as smooth as possible. Most important of all is to allow the child to be exactly that a child. It was obvious Onata felt really comfortable with Alexander Skarsg?rd and Joanna Vanderham. Congratulations to you all great work!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Julianne Moore does NOT chew more than . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>. . . she bites off here, even though critics said that is what novelist Henry James did at the time this story first was published more than a century ago. Moore plays a woman who is both a neglectful mom and wife, as well as a totally washed out rocker, along the lines of Courtney Love. Though we have no Nirvana-style suicides here, we do have Moore singing three songs, which is more than she warbled in THE KIDS ARE ALRIGHT, if my memory is correct. Onata Aprile as the ping pong ball-like child Maise, Susanna's (the Moore character's) daughter, is convincing as a waif lost in the complexities of modern America, where the dollar rules in its one buck, one vote system. Naturally, a pop music career--no matter how flagging--is more lucrative than raising an only child, and under Red State survival of the fittest rules, what doesn't kill Maisie can only make her tougher. Fortunately, this young lass has no brothers on stand-by to shoot her in the head during her many moments lacking in parental supervision. That is what Maisie knows.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful debut in an otherwise predictable movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some children are blessed with loving parents, while others are stuck with horribly egocentric folk that just can't get along, to the detriment of their offspring. Poor Maisie (young newcomer Onata Aprile, only 7 years old at the time of shooting) unfortunately has to contend with the latter, as her terrible excuses for parents, played by Julianne Moore and Steve Coogan, simply cannot see eye to eye about anything and only communicate by shouting at each other and arguing ad nauseam. Maisie can't remember ever seeing them in another, happier state of their relationship and has gotten used to their constant petty bickering, but doesn't let it get her down as she tries to make the best of it. Of course, the question always on our mind is: does she understand that the emotionally unhealthy environment she's growing up in is not the regular way for children to mature? Could she ever choose between her mother or her father if it came down to it as they are both lobbying for her unwavering love? Coogan and Moore certainly excel in playing people you just can't help but hate for how they're so obviously ruining Maisie's childhood, a fact they ignore because they are more concerned for besting the other in winning Maisie's love. While we are busy detesting these horrible guardians for causing her to accept a living condition that is quite simply unacceptable to behold for anybody with a slightest sense of responsibility, hope looms on the horizon as her parents both mix up with just the right people to turn her life into a more positive direction. Her father marries her foreign (Scottish) nanny, while her mother hooks up with a seemingly not so bright, tall guy (Alexander Skarsg?rd attempting to shed some of that sinister, scheming vampire image of his, courtesy of True Blood, by playing a sweet, easily likable bartender). Unfortunately the story soon progresses in the most predictable of directions as these two people, who actually care more about Maisie as a person than as a means of annoying the other by acquiring custody of the girl, come to understand just how easy it is to love this charming child and agree how much she deserves to be taken care of by decent folks. And naturally they can't help themselves by also falling in love with each other when they realize just what a manipulative, sleazy people Moore and Coogan are, abusing both them and Maisie for their own purposes as they keep up their disgusting little power play. In terms of plot development, we soon come to know that What Maisie Knew has little surprises to offer while delivering its fairly repetitive, one-sided melodrama. The film makes up for this in the acting department, where young Aprile stuns the audience with a most exceptional, truly inspiring and convincing performance; a remarkably rare occurrence for such a young child, but a solid promise for her future career in acting should she decide to keep it up (we can only hope). While the adult actors go through the motions in a more regular fashion, which isn't devoid of merit but simply not nearly as mesmerizing, Aprile carries the film as very few other actresses her age could ever have done, proving just how much truth there is in that old adage that good casting is doing half the work. What Maisie Knew is just average in all other regards, but a fabulous performance like this is well worth checking out, as it is so seldom witnessed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deep emotional drama! 4/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Review: I wasn't that impressed with this movie. It's extremely slow and quite boring in parts. I did feel sorry for the girl who has 2 really inconsiderate parents who have broken up. The little girl who plays the main character, does light up the screen with her great performance, but they should have brought in other elements to keep the story interesting. Don't get me wrong, I did care about what was going to happen to the main character, but it seems to get a bit repetitive. In all, it's a deep drama with an average storyline. Average!Round-Up: Steve Coogan is really covering every aspect in his acting career. After being the idiot in his Alan Partridge movie, he has gone full circle with this role, but he's hardly in the movie. Julianne Moore is playing the same type of role that she does in a lot of her movies, but it's the little girl that put the adults to shame. I can understand what the director was trying to portray with the film, but he really needed to make it more interesting with some twists or at least a unpredictable ending.Budget: $6million Worldwide Gross: $1millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there emotional dramas about a little girl who is in the middle of a couple breakup. 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Refreshing perspective but doesn't translate well to present day.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first it's quite touching to see the neglect of the young girl caught up in the custody battle. Not many divorce or custody movies show the perspective of the child and that's refreshing.The acting is good. The young actress who plays Masie is good. Julianne's character shouldn't have been made to be a rock star. Alexander Skarsgaard is suitably disheveled as the bar tender step father.The updating of this 19th century novel doesn't translate well to present day because the one dimensional nature of the characters is just too hard to believe. The natural parents are just too neglectful and ungrateful to be believable and the step parents just too good to be true.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not that great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really don't understand how this movie has 7.5 stars. Yes, the little girl did a great job acting. She was a natural. But the story didn't make it's point. Yes divorce is hard, yes the children suffer most and yes parents should put their children first, I think everyone knows this, although it's not done all the time, but this movie didn't even seem to have an ending. Nothing was settled, no one saw the error of their ways, the ex-nanny and the bartender are somehow living in this beautiful beach house and are suddenly a couple, when they barely know one another and how did Lincoln even know where to find them at the beach house? I had no problem with any of the acting, I thought everyone was good but I couldn't buy Julianne Moore as a rock star, even an aging one. And Alexander Skarsgard needs to stand up straight, he's a beautiful man, he needs better posture. It was a boring movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor Maisie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to like this film, I really did. I understand the point of the movie and how the portrayal of the parents are often true to life, but the first 45 minutes were completely painful to sit through. I had to force myself to stay, thinking that it had to get better and much to my surprise it did get better. Although the acting was good, there wasn't much of a plot and the outcome was unrealistic.The only redeeming parts were the child acting skills and the intervention she received from her new "step-parents". I enjoyed these characters, but they still could not make this movie enjoyable for me. Enjoyable is probably not what the writers and directors were aiming for, but I can not get into a movie if I can not get sucked in by the storyline or the characters. Although I know custody battles can get nasty and children are often neglected, it was so disturbing to watch two worthless parents battle it out with each other for a child that they could care less about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyone reading this comment, be aware of all those reviews made before mine. They are definitely overrated. I mean I never make comments in public but I couldn't help myself this time because I felt like I have to warn people about this movie so they would not waste their time. Such terrible acting from Moore. Maybe it's the first time I was disappointed with her performance. Very poor and basic scenario. Disaster editing. Unrealistic details such as "a mother just dropping her own little girl off on the street in front of a bar and leaving without not making sure that the person picked her up" ... I can't believe I just wasted such time of my life for such bad movie.just to save your time..or go ahead and try yourself. I hate when people overrate movies.....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Words cannot describe how utterly disappointing and dreadful this film really is. The acting was poor and the performances were hammy and could literally have been done by anyone off the street. There was no connection or feeling from the characters and the never ending ennui throughout the film made me more interested in counting the bulbs in the ceiling.I went in not knowing anything about the film as I knew the cast list and thought I would enjoy the performances and narrative. It is a predictable, boring, dreary pile of nonsense. It really is a pity that Maisie didn't know how uneventful and boring her life really was on celluloid.</fullReview>

You only see the before and after, the middle is cut out.It feels like, hey we are going to act for you now, look at us, we are actors saying words. can we win an Oscar?the older actors appear randomly to do some acting then leave, and you follow the little girl again, then repeat...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Judging from the desired serious tone set by the directors this story of 7-year-old Maisie being tossed from one selfish parent (Julianne Moore reprising her role from Boogie Nights) to the other (Steve Coogan in his recurring jerk role) should have been a heart wrenching undertaking. It wasn't.The longer you stick with this film the more far-fetched the plot becomes. Suspending disbelief here would be akin to thinking OJ Simpson was innocent. And even if you do go along with the fairytale storyline there's still the uneven point-of-view approach that seems like it was put together more by a 7-year-old with Legos than a professional filmmaker with big boy toys.So, why the low rating? 2 reasons:1. I kept waiting for Steve Coogan to do a Michael Caine impression. Spoiler alert: He never does! 2. Newcomer Joanna Vanderham. Ain't she a peach?</fullReview>
