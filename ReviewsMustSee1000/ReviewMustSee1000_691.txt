		<shortDescription>The Jewel of the Coen Crown</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the great undiscovered gems of recent movie history. In my opinion, Miller's crossing is easily the best of the Coen brothers' films, and one of the true classics of American cinema.On the surface, the story of warring gangsters in 1920's America is one that has been told many times before. But never before has it been handled with such artistry and precision. The (rather violent) action scenes keep the movie going along at a brisk pace, and the camera work is every bit the equal of "Fargo".I became a lifelong Gabriel Byrne fan as a result of this movie, despite his best efforts to disappoint me since. Byrne's Tom Reagan is a compellingly amoral character, who takes more unchallenged beatings than perhaps anyone in film history. Men beat him up. Women beat him up. Collection men, bookies, gangsters, and even his boss gives him a terrible thrashing, and he hardly lifts a finger in opposition (with one notably humorous exception).Albert Finney is tremendous as Leo, the local crime boss. His "Danny Boy" scene should go down in film history as one of the greatest pieces ever filmed. Jon Polito is at once absurdly funny and threateningly psychotic as Johnny Caspar, Leo's rival in the turf war. J.E. Freeman, John Turturro, and Marcia Gay Harden all lend strong support in a cast that was assembled and performs to near perfection.I will never understand why this film has not received more recognition and acclaim. As an example of the modern style of Film Noir, it has no equals ("The Usual Suspects" would rate a close second). Among gangster films, only "The Godfather" can compete, and "Miller's Crossing" features superior pacing and dialog, although it lacks "The Godfather's" epic proportions. Perhaps someday this film will receive, like "The Manchurian Candidate" and "Touch of Evil", the belated accolades it so richly deserves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Intellectual's Gangster Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I'm talkin' about friendship. I'm talkin' about character. I'm talkin' about--hell Leo, I ain't embarrassed to use the word--ethics." So Jon Polito, as crime-boss Johnny "Caspar," describes to his overlord, Albert Finney as "Leo," his point of view while seeking permission to kill a double-crossing underling (played by John Turturro) in the opening lines of __Miller's Crossing__. Had the script sought only to explore the power relationship between the two chief mobsters (one the rising Italian, the other the diminishing Irishman), this would have been a very good gangster film. It portrays an earlier era in the nation's history of organized crime (perhaps Chicago in the late '20s), and one can imagine Leo as the Irish predecessor of __The Godfather__'s Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando).Just as __The Godfather__ was really about family relationships and the ethical complexities arising when familial loyalty collides with the business of violence, however, __Miller's Crossing__ is actually about, as Caspar tells us, friendship and character put under the enormous strain of that same business of violence. The film, therefore, centers on Leo's trusted adviser Tom (played flawlessly by the Irish actor Gabriel Byrne). Tom is not a gunsel, but the brain behind Leo's muscle. His decisions carry life and death consequences, however, and we watch him try to live with himself, to preserve his character, as he works out a code that will help him and his friends survive brutally violent upheavals. Critics of the film have cited its graphic cruelty and the seeming coldness of its characters, yet these are essential features in developing the film's theme.Sentimentality might get any of the major characters killed, and one notes the pathos and dark humor that underline an ironic distance that each character, especially Tom, cultivates as a tool for survival.Clues abound as we wonder what Tom will do next. Follow, for example, the men's hats over the course of the film. Who "keeps his lid on," so to speak, and who loses his? Note the number of times characters exclaim "Jesus!" or "Damn!" when saying the name "Tom." What has he sacrificed? Has he damned himself?Spectacular action sequences, beautiful production values, top-notch camera work by Barry Sonnenfeld, a haunting musical score, and the best dialogue ever written by the Coen brothers make this a great gangster film. The fascinating and complex theme of friendship, character, and ethics make it one of the great films from any genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my modest opinion, this film is the Coen's greatest achievement to date, even greater than Fargo. I was happy to see so many recent entries on this page, because that means something I predicted long ago is coming true: film buffs are finally "discovering" Miller's Crossing, an underground masterpiece that has dwelt in obscurity for ten years.The central motif of the hat, and Johnny Caspar's preoccupation with the altitude thereof, brings to mind another underrated masterpiece, Drugstore Cowboy. The complex Jungian symbolism of forests, doors and especially hats is my favorite aspect of the film.The only criticism I've heard of this film (and I think it's B.S.) has to do with the "over-acting"--a criticism that has been directed at more than one Coen film. Admittedly, Coen screenplays read more like novels than movie scripts and are not always actor-friendly. Gabriel Byrne, who appears in all but two scenes, does a great job playing an extremely complicated character. Tom Reagan is a smart guy surrounded by morons, and exists in a scenario where only muscle counts and brains don't. And he hates it. And he hates himself because he knows he's all brains and no heart. He tries to redeem himself through a selfless devotion to Leo, whom he hates. All this makes for an immensely challenging part, and the film could easily have fallen apart with a lesser actor than Gabriel Byrne playing the lead.But the acting is great from top to bottom: Marcia Gay Harden (in her big screen debut) as the hard-boiled moll; Jon Polito as the maniacal Johnny Caspar; Steve Buscemi as the hop-addicted Mink; J.E. Freeman, who is such a marvellous screen villain you have to wonder why he's still toiling in obscurity; and Albert Finney, an actor who embodies the term "screen presence." But the Grand Prix goes to John Turturro, who carries the most powerful scene in the movie: when Tom takes Bernie out to Miller's Crossing to "whack" him.Another criticism frequently levelled against the Coens is that they are preoccupied with "scenes" and don't focus enough on plot coherence. This too is an invalid criticism, as far as I'm concerned. Some people are irritated by a film that you have to watch a couple times to fully understand, but that's precisely the kind of film that I love, and that's why I love Miller's Crossing so much. Every time I see it I pick up on something that I didn't catch before.Speaking of "scenes", the "Danny Boy" scene is the best. The second best is the following scene, where Tom and Terry walk through a hallway lined with goons. The third is the police raid on the Sons of Erin Club, in which Leo takes on the entire police force.I'll resist the temptation to call Miller's Crossing "The Greatest Film of All Time"--because who has the right to say that? But I must say that it is my favorite film of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my opinion, "Miller's crossing" is by far the top work of the Coen brothers, and one of the best movies in the history of cinema. The huge Coens' talent being now fully recognized, I hope that this masterpiece will get the credit it deserves.The plot deals with the war between Irish and Italian gangsters, caused by the Jewish crook Bernie (the Coens like to joke with the rivalry of different ethnic groups). The crook's affectionate sister Verna is the mistress of Leo O' Bannion, the boss of the Irish gang, who consequently opposes to have him killed by the Italians. But Tom Reagan, the old mate and factotum of O' Bannion, has different plans... The story is extremely interesting, exciting, entertaining. There are no flaws in the development of the plot, despite its complications (a homage to the intricate classic film-noirs of the Golden Age). The script is sharp, cynical, sarcastic, full of memorable lines and of black sense of humor, with many delightful subtleties: the celebrated Coens' wit at its best. The photography is magnificent and very original. The music is great. The action scenes are superbly filmed: violence explodes suddenly and unexpectedly. The finale is perfect and splendidly crowns the movie.Tom Reagan, played by Gabriel Byrne, is one of the most memorable characters I have seen on the screen. A gangster who tries to use intelligence instead of violence (with alternate success), following a peculiar moral code. Cynical but devoted to friendship. A systematic liar, but capable of generosity. Despite his skills, he is not ambitious, he prefer to be subject to a big-shot. And then, with all his smartness, he strangely chooses to destroy himself with alcohol and gambling. A magnificent psychological design. With this sober, brilliant, subtle performance, worth of a Bogart in great shape, Byrne just shows that he is the best actor in the world (my opinion, of course).The aged Irish boss O' Bannion - Albert Finney is the opposite of Reagan: naive, sometimes dumb, with a strong love and childish attachment for his girl-friend, he is confident only in his own charisma and in brutal force. Speaking of brutal force, he will show in a gun-fight that he's still the number one, in spite of years passing (incidentally: this is one of the best action scenes I've ever seen). Also the other characters are shaped with outstanding intelligence and care, from the main ones (Bernie, his sister, the Italian boss, his right-hand Dane) to the last of the thugs. The whole cast is fantastic: Finney, Turturro, Marcia Gay Hayden, Polito, Freeman and all the other excellent supporting actors. A special mention for the scaring gangster Eddie Dane - J.E. Freeman: he really makes you shriver. Turturro is a bit histrionic for my taste, but this is his style of acting, suited for the role of the crook, mean and coward, but cunning and dangerous as a snake.To summarize, in "Miller's Crossing" fun, drama, action, suspense, mystery are masterly blended with deeper themes such as love, friendship and human loneliness. This movie is splendid, magnificent, unique, don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was blown away by this film the first time I saw it. After giving myself a couple hours to shake off my dumbfounding amazement, I became addicted. This film has everything. It's witty in its dialogue, suspenseful in its action and violence, beautiful in its cinematography, and (being so like the Coen brothers) it can make you laugh and cringe in the same scene.The script is superb. The characters are absorbing and the dialogue (as some reviewers have already observed) flows like words in a book. You have to watch some scenes more than once to totally get what's going on, and even then you still might miss something.The acting is top-notch, even down to the lowest thug. Gabriel Byrne plays the antihero Tom to lonely perfection and Marcia Gay Harden's hooker without a golden heart is excellent. The rest of the cast is great as well, including good mobster Albert Finney and a funny cameo by Steven Buscemi. However, the show is stolen threefold by Jon Polito as the erratic Italian underboss Johnny Caspar, John Tuturro as the slimy "schmatta" Bernie Bernbaum and J.E. Freeman as Caspar's dark, vicious adviser/thug Eddie Dane. Jon Polito's monologue in the very beginning on ethics and Tuturro's desperate pleas at Miller's Crossing are both powerful scenes, and Freeman commands the screen whenever he is on.My rating is a 10/10. The best part about this movie is that it gets better and better every time you watch it. Oh yeah...the Danny Boy scene is reason enough to watch this movie anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>what's the rumpus? this movie is one of the greatest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is for those who have seen the movie and given it the high hat."For a sheeny he's got a lot of good qualities." I'm watching the film AGAIN now and this gem just popped up. Any piece of dialog would make my quote book. This ain't no review. It's a response. First, seeing this as a gangster movie is like seeing Blade Runner as a sci-fi flick. Second, seeing this as film noir, with Tom as the typical anti-hero shows that we have to classify every film by the terms we are comfortable with. Finally, Tom is one of the most complex characters I've seen in film. Why? Because he's real. It reminds me a bit of the American Splendor comics and film where Pekar don't have to give a happy ending, a sad ending, clear symbolism, a strong message. Just a story even if it does not "fit" into what we expect from books, films, magazines, etc. Tom is one of my favorite characters and I still don't understand him and neither do you. This along with everything people have commented on (dialog, editing, characters, etc.) make the film in my opinion one of THE greatest films period. What makes Godfather better? Brando's tired speeches? This is a flick you can watch over and over and I stand by those who respect the genius of this film. So take ya flunkie and dangle and again- this paragraph is for those who give the high hat to Tom, the most conflicted and realistic personage in any film I've seen. Will you watch Tom with amazement or try to analyze his motivation based on film stereotypes? Let's get stinko.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Must-See For Any Lover of The Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are very few films that engulf the viewer and demand them to give their full attention. This is one of those rarities. While viewing this film one finds themselves sharing the same space and breathing the same air that the characters do. It's beautiful. It's the stuff of great story-telling.I must admit, I am a great fan of Gabriel Byrne in anything, no matter what it is, so maybe I'm jaded. And as I have seen practically everything with him in it, I must say it is refreshing to see him work with an amazing cast and script to back up his talent.And the music is terrific. How ironic to have "Danny Boy"-a sentimental grandparents' favorite- playing while machine guns are ripping apart mens' flesh. The cinematography is superb also. Not only do the characters speak in a language rich with visuals, they live in a moving painting.This was one of those films where I watched all the way through the credits slack-jawed and was sad to see the film end. It's that good. I'm not especially a fan of gangster films but I am willing to make exceptions and Miller's Crossing is one of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Coens' movie, bar none.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many new movies that have been released on DVD this year. Forget them, and pick up a copy of this movie. It has only recently become available on DVD. The unavailability of this movie on DVD for so many years has been a sin. I own this movie on laser disc and it is one of the reasons that I still have a laser disc player.I cannot do a better job than the other reviewers have in pointing out what make this film so outstanding. Just let me repeat the usual: The casting is flawless; the dialogue is on the mark, with dozens of juicy bon mots; the humor is sublime; the cinematography is absolutely gorgeous; and the plot, while complex, is still comprehensible enough not to detract from the action.This movie is as close to flawless as a movie can be.And one more thing, this movie has nothing in common with either "Yojimbo" (which was itself a rip-off of Dashiel Hammett's "Red Harvest") or "Fistful of Dollars". Well, OK, I'll grant that they both take place in towns dominated by two strong gangs of criminals (as if that's never been the case in any other movie,) but the other plot elements and the dialogue are completely original.**** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best modern gangster file ever....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has got to be, hands down, one of the best gangster films ever made, certainly in the last 20 years or so. Better even than Reservoir Dogs, I'd say...which is a great film too, but just not nearly the same caliber as this.In a nutshell, the whole movie is about loyalty, and the affect it has on Tom Reagan, as well as everyone else around him. Tom is the central character in this story, and we basically get to experience this movie in his shoes (or wearing his hat, which would be a more appropriate analogy, and you'll understand why I say this after watching the film). In fact, I can probably count on one hand the number of scenes that Tom Reagan (played masterfully by Gabriel Byrne) does NOT appear in.I won't go into great detail, because the story is full of subtleties...things that you won't notice even after seeing the movie several times. I think that's why I put it so high in my mind as a work of cinematic art. There has ALWAYS been something new that I discovered upon each viewing that I didn't see before, so the complexities of the story make it vastly more entertaining that, say, Titanic or some other Hollywood schlock that's being peddled in theaters. Which is probably why this film did poorly when it was first released, I didn't even see it until it came out on cable a year later.The script is truly marvelous, and the snappy dialog hearkens back to the good old days of gangster films from the 30s with great actors such as James Cagney, Edward G. Robinson, and Bogart. In fact, go get the Warner Bros. Gangster Classics Box set before you see this film...it'll give you a better appreciation of this film, in many different ways (the wise-cracks, the over-the-top gun battles, etc.). The only way the Coen Brothers could pay greater homage to the old gangster classics would have been to have filmed Miller's Crossing in black and white...which they didn't need to do anyway, this film just can't be beat in it's set design and imagery.Oddly enough, there is almost no gratuitous sex in this mildly R-rated film...it's all implied, which is a nice touch given the way most R-rated films just give in to rampant sex and violence, just for the sake of being able to do it. Even the violence (which some posts have alluded to as excessive) just doesn't even compare with what most folks see on screen today...but that just it, the Coen Brothers use sex and violence in a subtle way that enhances (not detracts) from the film. We know more about what people feel about each other rather than just get to see to sweaty bodies going at it in bed. Don't get me wrong, I think sex and violence in adult films is not a bad thing...I just hate it when filmmakers just throw it in as a way of pleasing the crowd, especially when they don't show the consequences of what sex and violence can bring about in our society.Anyway, I could go on and on...go BUY (not rent) this film, it'll be the best clearance-rack DVD you'll ever own!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Mobster Film Evere Made, bar none.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contrary to what Pete the Geek says in his comment this film is not a comedy. I suspect he is a fan of the old black and whites and so he believes this is a spoof of them which it is most certainly not. This is a pure drama with perfect dialog and excellent acting all around. The film basically tells the events that unfold around a Gangland war between the Irish and Italian mobs of the late 20s. Gabriel Byrne plays Tom, Leo's (Albert Finney) right hand man and adviser who disagrees with his boss's decision to protect the conman brother (John Turturro) of his girlfriend Verna (Marcia Gay Harden) and must work his own wily methods to protect Leo from this decision.This is a masterpiece of modern film and definitely shows that the Cohen brothers can do anything with film. The dialog and accents are all perfectly executed in vintage 20s style and flare, the sets are absolutely beautiful and the costume work is so good you almost feel like you stepped back in time. Anyone who doesn't love this film should go back and try watching it again. The musical score alone is enough to make it worth while.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most over-rated under-rated movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was very much a disappointment. I understand that it's meant to understated, but it's so subtle to the point of being droll. The first 45 minutes are quite confusing, there's lots of subtle plot points that seem to detract from the main plot. The acting is decent, but the script is borderline comically unrealistic without being ironic. Watching this movie, I wasn't sure if this was supposed to be a comedy, a gangster movie, or a drama. At times, it's all three and can't figure itself out. Gabriel Byrne's performance was underwhelming. He looked as bored as I was watching this movie. The characters are all unlikeable. By the end, you want them all to die. Only pretentious, faux-intellectual, artsy types would like this film. I'm generally a Coen Brothers fan, but this movie made me very angry watching it, mainly because I wasted two hours of my life. I would better have spent it watching Raising Arizona, Fargo, or The Big Lebowski even though I've seen them 100 times. The pace is extremely slow. This movie is all style and no substance. Nice art direction, nice cinematography, even good acting, but absurd script, excruciatingly slow pace, poor character development (what are there motivations?) and a plot spread thin over two hours complicated by unnecessary verbose dialog and distracting side bar sub-plots.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good components, but they do not blend naturally.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Reagan, the main character in this film, frequently states that you cannot know a person well, and both much of the appeal, and the weakness of this film lie in just this approach to characterization. The film has an intricate plot, and many people will find that characteristic very appealing, but the many intricate plot twists and character decisions somehow do not seem to spring naturally from either the characters or events on screen.This disconnect is an odd thing to see, because any, or at least most, individual scenes from the film are more or less viable and reasonable in and of themselves, but taken as a whole, you can see the puppet strings of the movie yanking the characters this way and that to achieve complexity and surprise. Because of this, while much of the acting is good, it feels false in context, with scenes failing to synchronize with one another, and with the only realistic characters, considering an individual performance as a whole, being the simple and somewhat stereotypical ones. If you are sensitive to this disconnect, you may well dislike the movie, but if you are instead, longing for a complex plot, you may love it.I should note that as usual in a Coen brothers film, the dialog is a treat, but cannot fail to mention that unlike their better known work, you are likely to miss a good deal of it, as the sound quality is not high enough to decipher many a clever comment.All considered, the easiest way of looking at this film is to see it as an early effort, pointing to future greatness perhaps, but not a complete and developed masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Coen brothers craft a loving homage to gangster pictures of yore with splendid results. Essentially the plot has Gabriel Byrne as a good - bad guy caught between two rival gangster factions. It's a standard story line that is still providing cinematic water for many a film maker these days, but shot through the Coen prism, with literary astuteness holding court, it's a genre piece of considerable class. A picture in fact that gets better and better with further viewings.When the Coen's are on form they have the skills to make a grade "A" thriller and blend it with a sort of dry irony. It's like they bite the hand that feeds whilst praising said genre influences to the rafters, but it works as damn fine entertainment. On a narrative level Miller's Crossing molds the Byzantine with the labyrinthine, keeping the complexities just on the right side of the street from that of art for arts sake.Visually the film is superb, the hard working sweat of the city dovetails impudently with the mother nature beauty of Miller's Crossing the place, a place home to misery, a witness to the dark side of man. All the while Byrne, Albert Finney, John Turturro and Jon Polito bring an array of characterisations to the party, each one his own man but each craftily proving the folly of man. Marcia Gay Harden, in one of her first mainstream roles, slinks about making the two main boys sweaty, and wonderful she is as well. While Carter Burwell provides a musical score that has a smug (in a good way) self awareness about it.Style over substance? Yes, on formative viewings it is. But go back, look again, see and sample what is not being said. Pulpers and noirers will I'm sure get the gist. 8/10</fullReview>

What caused this, I'm not totally sure, and I really can't fault the film too much. It sounds like I didn't like it, but I did. It's a decent enough film, Turturro is pretty amazing and pretty much the MVP of the film.

		<shortDescription>Miller's Crossing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Miller's Crossing is a film containing characters of the gangster genre occupying a noir-style world. Visually, the film holds up with other Coen Brother films in terms of its style, which includes elaborate set designs, costumes, landscapes, etc. Visually, the film is magnificent and eye-catching.Where the film falters lies in its dialogue. A staple of Coen Brothers' scripts, particularly their earlier films, involves characters who possess an uncharacteristically sharp tongue and wide vocabulary. Miller's Crossing is no different. Don't get me wrong, the dialogue is well-written, but at times too well-written. Characters speak so fluently in wise-cracking threats that their eloquence undermines their threats. The audience, rather than invest care in the characters, instead marvels at their wit and articulacy. But again, this isn't to say that the dialogue is bad. In fact, most will probably find the characters and dialogue appealing. The plot does not become apparent until after the credits roll. For the beginning of the film, characters speak swiftly back and forth, referencing off-screen characters nobody in the audience has yet seen. This may lead to some confusion regarding what in tarnation is happening, which subsequently may lead to a lack of emotion or care invested into the story by the viewer(s). Ultimately, Miller's Crossing is one of those films you're going to have consider in retrospect in order to piece it together. Albert Finney and Jon Polito offer tremendous performances as respective racketeer bosses. Gabriel Byre successfully plays Tom Reagan, a man caught in the middle of the warring mobsters. The wonderfully gifted John Turturro plays the two-timing Bernie Bernbaum. For this role, the Coens couldn't have scripted anyone better than Turturro, who in one instance can seem sputtering and weak 'til the next scene in which he confidently points a gun in someone's face. Overall, Miller's Crossing is a good film that possesses many reasons to watch it; though ultimately you may find yourself having to watch it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring, Derivative, Silly, Poor Acting, Did I mention Silly?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I gave this a 3 because it was not totally unwatchable.The main problem with this movie is that the story was silly and pointless. The problem with trying to make a good movie based on a silly and pointless story is that you are starting below zero, and everything else has to be excellent to even bring the movie up to good.That didn't happen here.As a first matter, the acting was terrible. The worst acting in the movie came when the guy from Fargo is at the bottom of the stairs talking to the lead character. I almost fell off my chair laughing it was so bad. He literally looked like what you'd expect at the High School talent show - forced, as if he was reading off of a teleprompter.As a further example of bad acting, the Italian actor who played the Jewish character was terrible throughout. The scene where he is on his knees and "pleading for his life" was laugh out loud funny - it was that unbelievable. Then later, when the same character tries to act tough, it's about as believable as Screech trying to act tough on saved by the bell.The acting of the Italian mobster is another low point - he overdoes it to the point of making Dinero look reserved.Beyond the acting, the story stunk.For example, in one scene the Italian mobster kills his, presumably, long time bodyguard and number 1 because the lead character has come over to the mobster's side and spun a tale about how the bodyguard is double crossing the mobster. Please. I find Clifford the Big Red Dog more believable than that. But the mobster is apparently so incredibly silly that he is willing to murder his right hand man because a guy who, 48 hours earlier, represented the enemy Irish mobster is now telling him his bodyguard is a traitor!!Sure.That'd be like Vladimir Putin's right hand man coming to the U.S. and convincing the president, in a matter of hours, that his VP was a spy.Those are just some examples - the whole movie is one long string of the ridiculous and improbable all strung together into a big mess.Another example is when the lead character is being forced to kill the Jewish character in the woods. It was obvious from the start that he wasn't going to do it. So he marches him out there, and the two guys who work for his "new" Italian boss don't even bother to keep an eye on him. They let him waltz off into the woods, they hear two gunshots, spaced a minute or more apart, and they think nothing of it.That is so stupid so as to be beneath dime store pulp fiction, never mind a movie on the big screen.Then there's the painfully derivative machine gun scene where each machine gun has about 7,000 rounds of ammo in it, and when a guy gets hit, he doesn't just fall limp, like what happens in real life, he stands there with his arms in a zombie reach and wiggles like a Shaker on Sunday for about 3 minutes and 3,000 of the 7,000 rounds are send through his vibrating torso. Ridiculous, silly, and boring.Another example. Hit men walk in front door of mansion, walk up to room for about 4 minutes, then walk in and Irish mobster is under bed.What would any non-retarded person do? Well, clearly then would fire 2 or 3 thousand rounds into the bed. Not!You'd hit the floor and spray under the bed or you'd get up on the bed and fire down, or you'd get back in the hallway and you'd take an angle . . .But not in the brother's movies. In the brother's movies, everybody acts like a complete moron all of the time.If a movie is made based on an improbable premise, then the movie can be enjoyable. Fargo is one example of this. The events of that movie are improbable, but not impossible. On the other hand, if a movie is made based on an impossible premise, then the movie has to either aspire to be Buckaroo Banzai - where it is understood that everything is unrealistic - or it is a flop, as in the present case.I find it funny that some people say that they watch this movie over and over and it "gets better".I can tell you that, were I to be strapped to a chair with my eyelids held open as in Clockwork Orange (great movie), I would not only NOT think this movie was better, I would think it even worse, because all of the bad acting, impossible behavior, and silly story lines would be even more obvious.Ayy.Absolutely terrible movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coen's Best Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:What love of a women will do to two best friends? This is the core of this masterpiece, Tom is love with Verna though he loathes her and himself for feeling it for her. When he sees that she is courting Leo, his boss, to get her sleazy brother Bernie protected from Casper, he starts pushing Leo to give Bernie up to drive Verna back into his arms. This is the answer to the riddle of why he drinks and gambles almost to his death and at the end he does not forgive Leo. Leo is amazed; he thought Tom was being a double agent for him, wrong, it is all about getting Verna away from Leo. He does have some guilt about sleeping with her behind Leo's back which is part of why he betrays Casper and gives him up to Bernie. But, at the end, we can see that it was really all about possession of Verna. Tom just cannot go with Leo if he is going to have Verna. This is the hidden core of this gangster movie; the infighting between Leo and Tom for possession of the scheming Verna.Tom's self loathing of his love for Verna is why he engages in self destructive behaviors like power drinking and gambling on the horses. Verna confronts him in the ladies lounge with just what I am saying she says,"why don't you just say you do not want me going out with Leo?" Tom is very closed off, mainly, from himself. He loathes Verna almost as much as he hates Bernie. It is one of the best stand alone gangster movies apart from all these minutia; it is non stop action and adventure. It has some of the snappiest, cutting, crisp dialogue. J.E. Freeman as the terrifying Eddie, maybe you still have too many teeth?, Dane steals this movie. Watch it to see the scariest bad ass muscle man for Johnny Casper. J.E. is the only reason to even watch ALIEN RESURRECTION he had a much smaller part but he still is such a powerful actor. His interactions with Tom are funny and entertaining. It has some great action scenes in it; the one where they try to kill Leo at home and he lights them up with the Thomson is worth watching for this scene alone. It is on the level of the Cagney classic WHITE HEAT; it is simply the best modern gangster movie bar none. Look, FARGO is so overrated, as is THE BIG LEBOWSKI this one is growing over time as those two are fading. Time is always the cruelest judge of movies; whatever the hype, time cleanses the crap from the libraries over time. Come back in thirty years see if you can find PACIFIC RIM. If you want to see great acting and a great gangster film watch this classic the absolute zenith of the Coen Brothers from 1990.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>hang onto your hat !!! This under-rated classic packs a wallop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is it really a stretch to claim that Millers Crossing is the Coen Brother's (Fargo, Blood Simple) greatest film? Not if you are judging it on technical merit. The acting, screen writing, cinematography and direction are at near perfection. I've probably seen this film 10 times since it came out and I continue to catch things for the first time. Each scene flows into the next with such fluidity its almost hypnotic. This is one of my all time favorites which deserves this 10 rating...a rating I seldom give.The setting is prohibition-era, big city America and that's all we know, and all we need to know...this movie isn't about history. This is a film that explores themes like power, loyalty and trust. The plot is rather intricate for a gangster movie and the first time you view it you aren't exactly sure just what happened. This is not a complaint about the film, but really more of a compliment. Many film classics through the years can leave you confused if you really dissect them afterwords.The story revolves around the central character Tommy (Gabriel Byrne), who is the right hand man to mob boss Leo (Albert Finney). It seems a rival named Johnny Casper (Jon Polito) is about to start a war over a two-bit bookie named Bernie (John Turturro) and Leo has decided to protect Bernie as Leo is currently seeing Bernie's sister Verna (Marcia Gay Harden). Casper is not at all happy about this and neither is Tommy and he tries to warn Leo but Leo is smitten and vows to protect his lover's brother.This is where things start to get murky, who is really loyal to who, and why? Leo controls everything in the city but when he narrowly survives assassination, he suddenly starts to lose grip of his power. At one point a cautious Tommy tries talking sense into over-confident Leo with the memorable line "you run this town because people think you run it, if they stop thinking it, you stop running it". This is the type of dialog you'd expect from a movie made in the 1940s. Much of Millers Crossing seems like its paying homage to a bygone era of film, the jargon (take your flunky and dangle) the snappy byplay between characters and the emotional flatness of everyone involved...no one in this film seems to be having much fun. But they are fun to watch!I would have to agree that the best scenes of the film are Leo and the "Danny boy" scene and the title scene...Bernie's little ride out to Millers crossing. John Turturro is astounding in this scene, but I hate to single out any one actor in Millers Crossing because the whole cast is absolutely perfect.This brings me to my favorite part which is the climactic scene at Casper's house. To me, this is the most intense scene in the movie and actually makes the hairs on my neck stand up! Casper of course leaves us with the immortal words....something he tells all his boys...."always put one in the brain".Gotta love it, and yes it was overshadowed by Goodfellas and other films when it was released, but like fine wine the classics always age well....and if you've never seen Millers Crossing I ENVY YOU, because you get the sheer joy of seeing a perfect film for the first time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am on a Cohen bros. binge at the moment having watched the BIG LEBOWSKI; BLOOD SIMPLE and FARGO just prior to Miller's Crossing.I have not written a review of these previous movies but would rate them in the 8,9,and 10's when I get around to it.That is how movies should be made.So when I saw the incredibly high ratings this movie received from the Users I just had to write in about this movie before the other better ones.I suppose I was lucky watching 3 classics before this shtinker.(sic). .And how this movie falls flat compared to the other Cohen masterpieces just mentioned .Miller's Crossing was like watching a badly written comic book with characters you would not care about because the writers did not flesh out any realistic characterisations.The Italian mafioso with no Italian henchmen? The Irish gangsters with no Gaelic accents?The Jewish fixer with a non kosher speech pattern? I mean WTF! Do your research and find out how they spoke ,then write it ,then get actors to pronounce it right.Are American audiences so idiotic they cannot tell the difference from 1930's speech patterns and 1990's forced idioms ?How many beatings does Gabriel Byrne have to cop before a bruise appears?The Italian mafioso who now runs the town,(Chicago) is stupid enough to listen to the smearing of his chief henchman from a gangster who only a week ago worked for the Irish mob and then to execute the great Dane like a dog without an interrogation? Viewers have you seen The Godfather?You probably gave it 10 if you are a gangster movie buff.Then you give 10 to this candy floss also?Where is the in between?Where are the shades of grey with scores in the middle?Of course the movie was stylistically good.It looked pretty.That alone will not make a movie interesting.The accents were not realistic,the plot was too unbelievable,and the characters all unlikeable.The ending was nihilistic.Why kill the brother of his lover(and the proverbial leak) and then not rejoin the Irish mob?I mean where is Gabriels payoff?The money he pocketed from the lone Italian Boss' pockets to pay off his horse gambling debt?The trip to the cemetery to tell his Irish boss he won't be working for him after all?The approbation from his girlfriend after she just buried her brother? Why did he go there for the ending?Was he hoping for a bullet between the ears in the final seconds of the movie to put him out of his misery?That certainly would have been an ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With "Miller's Crossing", the Coens turn their playful pens to the world of 1930s gangster flicks and 1940s detective noirs, churning out a film that owes a little too much to Kurosawa's "Yojimbo".It's a slick picture, every shot precise, every colour carefully calibrated, but what eventually emerges is little more than a formalist game. Gangster iconography meets laser printer, the plot plays out like a self-conscious attempt to capture the labyrinthal tone of early noirs. Characters beg and break down in tears...but we don't care for any of these people. They're robot copies, everything reduced to an aesthetic choice.More than Tarantino, Leone or De Palma, the Coen's are the poster-boys of cut and paste cinema. Their films are exercises in stylistic wit, more a series of vignettes that work in isolation as comedic short films, than any sort of comment on the world. Sample filmmakers, theirs is a cinema that can't look beyond its own stylistic myopia. That they sample legendary directors and iconic films does not by association make them part of that league of talent. And yet...And yet the Coens are honest about their dishonesty. Their films are cartoons, exercises in buffoonery (only a trickster would title a film, "A Serious Man"), which tend to wallow in comical nihilism. It's all a game because cinema has become a game. It's all pastiche, because Western cinema has become pastiche. It's nihilistic, because most of American cinema has lost all meaning. So why not wallow in the filth and do it with style? The Coens thus leave us only two choices: revel in their cinematic wit or reproach them for not trying.7.9/10 ? "Miller's Crossing" has two great sequences, but it's also one of the Coens' most smug pictures, its overly glossy look (shades of "Road to Perdition") and heavily stylized dialogue diluting any long-lasting imapct. Worth two viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Coen brothers triumph.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one my favourite gangster pictures of all time and to say the least I am a big fan of the genre. The use of the camera by the Coen bros.,the cinematography and the detail of the mise-en-scene are first rate. Yeah yeah. Thats my sad attempt to show that I learned something in film school. Seriously though the sets are excellent. As in The Hudsucker Proxy the Coens really make you feel like your in a completely different time and place.Gabe Byrne is well cast as the softly spoken loner who by the end of the picture has danced rings around everybody yet doesn't seem much better off. Tom Reagan(Byrne) is a very original character because one can really relate to him. He hasn't got the stomach to murder, doesn't carry a gun despite all of the violence which surrounds and indeed threatens him every day and is prepared to take a beating as opposed to venting hell hath no fury style vengeance which would result in a much higher penalty. Essentially he's an everyman who is playing the cards life has dealt him and is more than aware its a shitty hand but knows the best way to win is not to go for broke.Albert Finney is excellent as Leo the boss of the Irish mob who run a very fictional Chicago-esq setting and who is a lifetime friend of Reagan who is essentially Leo's unofficial consular. John Turturro goes from a 'tough-guy' in 'Do The Right Thing' to an at times pathetic yet equally psychotic 'rat' in this picture rather superbly. J.E. Freeman represents a rather commanding and intimidating physical presence as the fearsome Eadie Dane who has to be one of the most memorably sadistic henchmen ever committed to the screen. However for me Jon Polito, a favourite of the Coens, just about runs away with the picture as the wise-cracking mob underboss Johnny Caspar, a tough talking and ambitious Italian who has become fed up of taking the scraps from Leo's table and launches his own bid for the crown as the town's head honcho.The film offers one of the most violent and memorable scenes in movie history when to the sweet theme of 'Danny Boy', two of Caspar's henchmen attempt to assassinate his now rival boss Leo at his home. The sheer ferocity of Tommy Guns has never been so well portrayed or indeed has this very cinematic weapon ever been so aesthetically pleasing.The theme of the film is, like many before, borrowed from 'Yojimbo' with a middle man, Tom Reagan, playing off two rival gangs. The difference is that Tom actually does have loyalty to one.Another difference is that there is a lot of well executed humour here. Thats not to say there wasn't some in the Kirisawa classic but it's a little more obvious here. There is a more direct comparison to this film which some may have noticed but believe me 'Last Man Standing', released several years later, does not hold a candle to this picture. That film took itself a hell of a lot more seriously and faded from the memory rather quicker quite possibly because you had seen it all done before but better.A typically Coenesque surreal edge is also given by the at times unorthodox camera use and blandness of the sets. As in 'Hudsucker' and 'Barton Fink' the minimalist and somewhat austere fashion of the pre-60s years is overemphasized to great effect. The film is after all meant to be a fantasy. Yes a very adult and violent one with obvious nods to the realities of Capone's Chicago and the 30s and 40s Cagney gangster films but still a fantasy non the less.Overall this is a very original take on the gangster theme and a visual gem. It also contains some important lessons for any aspiring gangsters. In the words of Johnny Casper "Look at this kid. Something I tell all my boys.Always put one in the brain!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Miller's Crossing' is a cleverly constructed and sharply written piece of work in which the dialogue plays as important a role as the action in creating the drama. It is seemingly the tale of an amoral existentialist hero, Tom Reagan, negotiating his way through a complex situation, rather in the manner of a Jean-Pierre Melville film such as 'Le Doulos' or 'Le Samourai'. However the film is deeply concerned with questions of loyalty and obligation, and Tom's final choice is actually moral one. The film is carefully shot in an autumnal palate but is staged without extravagance and makes excellent use of the interior sets and few locations. The tight structure and deliberate air of unreality, which is heightened by deft comic touches, separates this from more portentous crime dramas such as 'The Godfather' or 'Once upon a time in America', and gives 'Miller's Crossing' its own unique place in the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well-executed exercise in film-making - and less to it than meets the eye</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first came across the Coen brothers when I caught Blood Simple on late-night TV. There was one scene in that which made me laugh out loud (when one character drives into the middle of nowhere to bury a body and has done so by dawn, only for a moment or two to discover that he can't start his car and might be stranded: try convincing the cops who find you in the middle of nowhere next to a freshly dug grave that your are guilty of nothing). The film's elaborate plot, the double-crossing and double-double-crossing also impressed me at the time. I then saw Miller's Crossing and remember also being impressed. Next came Raising Arizona which did rather less for me (and I don't very much like Nicolas Cage). After that, in no particular order were The Hudsucker Proxy, Barton Fink and Fargo. I admired Fargo - the Coen's are nothing if not stylish - but I didn't like the way the William Macy character, a schmuck in trouble who gets in way out of his depth, was the butt of the jokes. It was like getting easy laughs from teasing the fat kid in class and as, for a while, I thought of myself as 'the fat kid' - I wasn't half as fat as I thought, but I wasn't very slim, either - I didn't like it. I saw a couple more Coen brothers movies after that, for example The Big Lebowski and, more recently No Country For Old Men, but I found I had unwittingly joined the small club of those who aren't quite as impressed with Ethan and Joel Coen as so obviously Ethan and Joel are. Why not? I think it might be because, as one critic I read said of Fargo, they are heartless. There is cleverness galore in their films but each film lacks something essential to a great film. For my money the Coens are good at making good-looking films but those films are never as good as they might be. They seem more an exercise in Ethan and Joel demonstrating what smart kids they are than anything else. A year or two ago, I saw Blood Money again and it wasn't quite as good as I had remembered it. Miller's Crossing is rather the same: yes, you keep watching because - well, these lads make technically good films. But once the credits roll, you find you don't give a hoot. Miller's Crossing has another Coen-manufactured intricate plot, but it is all rather pointless. It is rather like watching a busy junction from an aesthetic vantage point: interesting enough for a while if you've got nothing better to do, but it eventually dawns on you you might well have quite a number of better things to do. Sorry, but I just don't think Miller's Crossing is all that good.</fullReview>

The Italian and Jewish characters where pure stereotypical rubbish as were most of the Irish. The story made no sense, particularly all the trust everyone had in Tom Reagan. There was no chemistry between the girl and Reagan... the whole relationship made no sense. Oh, and the girl was singularly unattractive. What a waste of great actors too. I'd have expected Turturro and Steve Buscani (who only had a brief appearance, to be way more picky in the character's they played then the pathetic Bernie and Mink. Albert Finney was pretty descent as Leo (Irish Mob boss) and was the one saving grace. In essence to me the story and characters weren't really believable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Prohibition era film noir follows Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne), cynical but loyal adviser of mobster Leo (Albert Finney), as tension with the rival gang led by Caspar (Jon Polito) escalates; complicating matters are Vera (Marcia Gay Harden), Leo's girlfriend, and her brother Bernie (John Turturro), a grifter whom Caspar wants dead but Leo is determined to protect.Being a Coen brothers movie, Miller's Crossing features impeccable cinematography, a great score by Carter Burwell, snappy dialogues peppered with black humor ("All in all, not a bad guy - if looks, brain and personality don't count"). Byrne, Finney, Turturro, Harden and J.E. Freeman (as a fearsome thug) are all excellent; the stand-out is a deliciously hammy Polito as the puffy, sweaty, jovial boss with a huge chip on his shoulder and a comical obsession to run his business with an appearance of "ethics".Structure is interesting - the Coens introduce a relationship or a scene, then repeat it later but with a crucial spin. The interplay between Leo and Tom mirrors the one between Caspar and his right-hand man Dane; twice a man wanders through the woods at Miller's Crossing, once to kill, once to be killed; twice a man begs for his life on his knees; the various political figures, like a Greek choir of sycophants, bounce between Leo and Caspar as the power balance shifts. And the key dynamic of the main triangle is not Tom and Leo fighting for Verna's affection, but rather Tom and Verna fighting for Leo's.Then there is the Coens' genius for subverting expectations. Small moments become memorable: when Tom is awaiting a beating, he is left alone with a huge thug, who walks ominously towards him. Tom smacks him with a chair; the thug, shocked and offended, stomps out of the room holding his bloody nose, then a smaller, older guy storms in and knocks Tom out. The overall effect is darkly humorous, surprising, engrossing.9/10</fullReview>

Tough crime drama with a little dark comedy, it's a marvelous homage to the gangster films of old while still feeling fresh and different. The stylish direction and Barry Sonnenfeld's beautiful cinematography give the film a wonderful look. The hauntingly lovely score from Carter Burwell is among his best work. The first-rate script is full of punchy dialogue that seems straight out of a Dashiell Hammett novel. The cast is as good as it gets with amazing work from Gabriel Byrne, Marcia Gay Harden, John Turturro, Albert Finney, and Jon Polito. It's such an entertaining and fun movie, particularly for fans of old-school gangster books and films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Double Crossing at Miller's Crossing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Miller's Crossing is an intricate tale of a gang war, about Irish criminals who are running an anonymous American metropolis in 1929 and a rising group of Italian mobsters who are tired of playing second fiddle. The central protagonist here is Tom Reagan (Byrne), who is the closest adviser of the big political boss in town, the vivacious Leo (Finney), who not only controls the police, but also the various mafiasos in town. One of them, run by the eccentric Italian Johnny Casper (Polito), is angry at Leo over the proposed assassination of a little gangster rat, Bernie Bernbaum (Turturro), who just happens to be the brother of Leo's girl, the tough-talking Verna (Harden). In the opening scene, Casper asks Leo to have the chiseling Jewish bookie killed, but Leo won't budge. This is partly because Leo doesn't want to let the uppity Caspar get his way. In the meantime, unbeknownst to Leo, Tom is screwing Verna on the side.However, Tom fails to keep things from escalating, as we soon find him and Leo at odds over her, and Leo kicks Tom out of his job. Subsequently, he crosses over to Casper's side, apparently in the hope of entrenching himself high up in the trust of the city's new mob boss, but it's immediately clear that whatever game Tom's playing, Caspar's success and well-being are of only incidental concern. As the film goes on, Tom tries to manipulate everything, but towards the middle of the film, rats on where Bernie is, and finds himself with the task of shooting him at Miller's Crossing. Here's where the big twist lies, and it sets the stage for the rest of this film, which reaches a fateful conclusion.Miller's Crossing attempts to both sum up, and revivify, the gangster genre. Guns, booze and fast women - all timeworn gangster film clichs are given a fresh twist in this masterpiece from Joel and Ethan Coen. The Coens' play this icy gangster tale mostly straight, but they can't help throwing in a few of their dark, comic explosions; it's one of their best, most cohesive films and it holds up to repeated viewings. There's not a false move, a bad angle, an awkward line or a wanting performance at any point in their fascinating tale of gang warfare, family loyalty, personal loyalty and homo-erotic bonding set in some peculiarly insular, corrupt, never-identified small town in 1920s America - a sardonic neo-noir gangster story with a wicked sense of humor and unfettered violence. Capping the beautifully layered storyline is a barrage of wonderful performances from everyone, like Gabriel Byrne's wonderfully stone-faced performance, hiding himself under his facade; Marcia Gay Harden showing a different side of the traditional mob moll; John Turturro's wonderfully energetic performance; and, of course, Albert Finney brilliantly portraying Leo as not being a monster, but really being a tough but gentle man.A gleeful riff on a very old genre; the Coens make Miller's Crossing sing anew with wit, intensity, and irresistible black humor, thanks to a screenplay of pure gold. I still think it's the best Coens' film yet!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler alert: This synopsis may contain information that could be considered spoilers to some readers.Miller's Crossing is one of my favorite Coen brothers movies. It helped a lot, of course, that all of the actors were well cast. Jon Polito as Caspar was his usual superb self, somehow managing to simultaneously keep his character both likable and despicable. Gabriel Byrne as Tom was a great punching bag who somehow emerged from every beating just as handsome as he was before it started. J.E. Freeman was excellent as Caspar's psychopathic gay hit-man. John Turturro as Bernie Bernbaum, the apparently gay brother of Verna, added an ongoing menace to the film. Marcia Gay Harden was wonderful as Verna and looked perfect in the role.Since I don't think I can improve on previous positive reviews, I would prefer to address the gay innuendo that is present throughout the movie but is frequently overlooked. It is certainly not the central focus of the story which is probably why so few viewers pick up on it (and even as a gay viewer, I have to include myself among them). Once all the clues are pointed out, you wonder how you could possibly not have seen them.First of all, we can be sure that at least three of the characters are gay: Psycho hit-man Eddie Dane and his lover, Mink. Also there is Bernie Bernbaum who is having a secret and potentially dangerous affair with Mink, largely for the purpose of gaining information. Below are some of the clues, not necessarily in order:Clue one: The movie opens with Caspar and Eddie Dane in Leo's office. Caspar is trying to get Leo to allow him to put a hit on some guy named Bernie whom he suspects of hurting his fixed bets by selling information. Bernie, however, is the brother of Leo's girlfriend, Verna, so Leo is very reluctant. Leo suggests that maybe Eddie's friend Mink is responsible for the betrayal. Eddie quickly comes to Mink's defense and Caspar backs him up by saying that Mink is Eddie's "boy". In another moment during that scene, Eddie and Tom exchange knowing glances that suggest more than mutual disdain or admiration. My take on that moment is that Eddie is sadistically attracted to Tom and that is exactly how Tom sees it. I don't think the attraction is mutual.Clue Two: In the scene where Tom is at the club talking to Mink. The conversation more than suggests that Eddie and Mink are lovers and that Mink is having an affair with Bernie behind Eddie's back. Tom tells Mink that it wouldn't be good if Eddie were to find out that Mink has another "amigo" because he doesn't take Eddie for the understanding type. Mink quickly becomes very concerned that Tom might squeal on him.Clue Three: Tom is talking to Caspar, trying to convince him that Eddie is a betrayer. During that scene, Caspar again says that Mink is Eddie's boy. He even adds that he, himself, doesn't go that way. Tom, referring to Eddie and Mink, says something to the effect, "There's always that wild card (a slight pause, he raises his eyebrows) where love is involved."Clue Four: After Tom pushes his way into the ladies' powder room to talk to Verna, she tells him how her brother is misunderstood just because he's "different". Clue Five: There is also the scene in Tom's apartment where Bernie says that his own sister tried to seduce him and the suggestion is that she was trying to make him heterosexual. I know that some people see homoeroticism between Leo and Tom but I don't see anything erotic about their relationship. I think they love each other and are deeply devoted to each other but that's as far as it goes.As a bit of trivia, in real life Joe Polito who plays Caspar, and J.E. Freeman who plays Eddie Dane, really are openly gay.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's a lot of talk in this gangster flick, and lots of characters with some twist. It's about the things gangster flicks talks about most, loyalty, I guess. And betrayal and love ..etc. well, other genre talks about these things too I guess.But the scene in the forest is great - it takes the story to another level, as if another movie by itself.The gun fights and burning down the house was over the top or maybe that's a homage ???I don't particularly like the acting, but more for the story.p.s. There's always a moment in the Cohen movies that freezes me - a disorienting shot - that confuses me where I am in the movie's context. Here it is the warehouse scene when Gabriel was capture, fighting a thug, and lifts a chair, when he stop, pauses and heard something.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm talking' about friendship. I'm talking' about character. I'm talking' about?hell, Leo, I ain't embarrassed to use the word: I'm talking' about ethics."----Johnny Caspar in Miller's Crossing Miller's Crossing is one of those movies you may have to watch a few times to get the story straight. If you bother to do that, you will find it is a well plotted, well shot story that comes as close to a masterpiece as we are likely to get in this post modern age of instant gratification. It is a throwback to the film noir movies of the 1940s where everybody is guilty and there is no happy ending.The plot deals with the war between Irish and Italian gangsters, caused by the Jewish crook Bernie. The crook's affectionate sister Verna is the mistress of Leo, who is the boss of the Irish gang, who consequently opposes to have him killed by the Italians. But Tom Reagan, the old mate of Leo, has different plans......The story is extremely interesting, exciting, entertaining. There are no flaws in the development of the plot, despite its complications (a homage to the intricate classic film-noirs of the Golden Age). The script is sharp, cynical, sarcastic, full of memorable lines and of black sense of humor, with many delightful subtleties: the celebrated Coens wit at its best. The photography is magnificent and very original. The music is great. The action scenes are superbly filmed.Violence explodes suddenly and unexpectedly. The finale is perfect and splendidly crowns the movie.In my modest opinion, this film is the Coen Brothers's greatest achievement to date, even greater than Fargo. Movie buffs are finally "discovering" Miller's Crossing, an underground masterpiece that has dwelt in obscurity for so many years.The movie is probably not for those who want something with mile-a-minute pacing, crashes and explosions. I would say Miller's Crossing is the thinking person's gangster movie. It needs repeated viewing and you continue to find more in it the more you watch it. If that describes you, I think you'll like it.Happy Weekend!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Politics and Morals of the Mob.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there is one thing the movies have taught us over the years, it is that just like our world, the world of gangsters and the mob have a set if rules and regulations; morals to follow on how to act on the job. Never before in another mob film have these themes been so deeply explored than in Miller's Crossing, a Coen Brothers film mostly forgotten today but must stand as one of the very best of its genre of the last fifty years.Of all the elements of this film, I can only say that those that make it so strong are also the ones to be criticized the most. For my money, the plot is confusing but not hard to follow as it weaves and twists into a nicely convoluted story about a man double-crossing and being double-crossed involving nearly every gangster in town until it all comes together in the end. The dialog is unbelievable in the way it is both fun to listen to and very strong in establishing the characters speaking it. This was certainly a breakthrough film for the Coens in that they began to bring a certain polished professional touch to their films to go along with their usual indie swagger and style.Here, the elements come together, with the cinematography wonderfully capturing the Prohibition era and the camera work reserved but effective. The acting is superb; Gabriel Byrne is a true leading man whether he gets those roles or not. Albert Finney, Marcia Gay Harden, Jon Polito and John Turturro all do their part and the result is staggering in the way it demands complete attention from the audience not just to follow the plot, but also to contemplate and understand the motivation of these people.There is certainly more here than meets the eye, but that is the beauty of all the Coen's films. Joel and Ethan have always been a team able to go above and beyond what we expect and stimulate us with something totally new and original. Here, we get an old-fashioned story-type brought to life with a twist. It truly is something to see and see again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Man Who Mistook His Life for a Hat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS.Gabriel Byrne's hat plays an important part in this movie. When he is about to be killed, an assassin takes the hat and scales it into the woods. When he's about to kill someone else and is wearing only his underwear, he grabs his gun and his hat and races outside. The last shot of the movie has Byrne pulling hit hat brim down low over his eyes then slowly raising his face to stare at a departing friend. In fact, everybody's hat is kind of important. We see the hat of a dead person half way down the stairs before the camera shows us the body at the top. Jokes are made about people's heads having outgrown their hats. A pudgy gangster keeps complaining about his rivals giving him "the high hat."Obviously the hat seems to "stand for" something but I'm not sure what. Lives? Maybe. But in fact I couldn't follow the plot either, and I kept getting the names of the characters mixed up except for a few of the most important. The plot is all twists and turns, as stylized as the dialogue -- "twist," "bumped off," "yegg," "roscoe." The whole thing could have been lifted out of, or turned into, an old comic book, perhaps "Crime Does Not Pay," which I remember from childhood.And, as in a comic book, it's hard to care much about who gets "leaned on" or "bumped off" since they're all cartoons anyway. Not that the story or the film is designed to be realistic. There isn't nearly as much blood as in most gangster movies. And Byrne takes several poundings, any one of them enough to hospitalize a rhinoceros, without any sequelae more than a bit of a wince as he struggles to rise from the floor.I guess, though, that I didn't want Byrne to get "bumped off." I don't know why. Maybe it's his homely face and tragic demeanor, which made it easy for me to identify with him. With that mournful visage he should run for elective office -- maybe president of the United States. He'd at least have the political cartoonist vote in his pocket. And I suppose too that I was glad to see Albert Finney survive in one piece. He's a decent dramatic actor but he has an outstanding way with comedy. (That droll American accent.) And he must have a good sense of humor too, without any pride to speak of. When Byrne bursts into a lady's room he shouts that the other gals should get out. One of the "gals" in the background is Finney dressed in a maid's costume. He makes a hurried sign of the cross and rushes out along with the other girls. He also has a line, "Dis is da kissoff," which is a repeat of a line he had in "Two for the Road," some 30 years earlier. How can you not want a guy like that to survive? That line isn't the film's only link to the past. One character's name is Judy Barton. And an inconspicuous poster informs us that Lars Thorwald, a prize fighter, will be featured in an upcoming bout.So anyway I couldn't follow the plot exactly. But looked at as an exercise is stylization this is a pretty good movie. A good deal of imagination has gone into it, the dialogue, the location shooting, and especially the direction. I don't just mean bravura jump cuts or negative shots or simple-minded tactics that are meant to draw attention to themselves. I mean more subtle stuff, of which I will give just one example. While two henchmen wait on the road, Byrne marches Turturro into the woods to kill him. Turturro gets on his knees and begs for his life. Byrne, realizing that NOT killing Turturro is likely to get HIM killed, nevertheless relents. Turturro stumbles off into the woods and there is a long shot of Byrne standing alone among the longleaf pine. There is a slow dissolve and Byrne's figure is replaced exactly on screen by the figures of the two henchmen back on the road, standing next to their car, and choking with laughter.This is by no means a perfect movie, but it is a perfect original. And we give Academy Awards to blockbusting by-the-numbers disasters like "Titanic."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of our first glimpses of "Miller's Crossing" is the stunning image of a worn black fedora coming to a rest in the middle of a forest, before a gust of wind sweeps it up and sends it sailing down an avenue of trees. Later in the film, Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne) recalls a dream he once had, in which he is walking through the woods and he loses his hat in the wind. So this is his dream, his nightmare perhaps. In his dream, he doesn't chase the hat, Tom firmly asserts: "Nothing more foolish than a man chasin' his hat." What is the importance of this hat? Could it represent his self-respect? We notice that Tom loses his hat whenever he is in a vulnerable state: At a drunken card game, already with a hefty debt to dangerous people, Tom wages him hat and loses it. As a bloodthirsty hit man prepares to kill him, Tom's hat is cast aside. As a former friend pounds away at his face with heavy fists, Tom fumbles to keep the hat within his grasp. However, perhaps there is a much simpler explanation for the hat's prominent inclusion in the film:JOEL COEN: "Everybody asks us questions about that hat, and there isn't any answer really. It's not a symbol, it doesn't have any particular meaning..." ETHAN COEN: "The hat doesn't "represent" anything, it's just a hat blown by the wind." JOEL COEN: It's an image that came to us, that we liked, and it just implanted itself. It's a kind of practical guiding thread, but there's no need to look for deep meanings." (excerpt: "Joel &amp; Ethan Coen: Blood Siblings")Nevertheless, the unforgettable image of the hat dancing away in the wind is a poignant and fascinating one, whether or not the Coens intended anything significant by its inclusion. The film is positively brimming with stunningly beautiful moments and, indeed, cinematographer Barry Sonnenfeld himself declared that the film must have a "handsome" look to it, as opposed to the wacky, energetic camera movements of such previous Coen films as "Raising Arizona."The script, as always with the Coen brothers' films, is brilliantly written. Many critics have often complained that, though well-written, their dialogue comes across as unrealistic, and ultimately as though it has, indeed, been written. I don't really believe that this is relevant ? this is merely Joel and Ethan Coen's style; they do not strive for realism in their films, only for delicately-scripted, immensely watchable entertainment. The plot of Miller's Crossing is not really very dissimilar to many other Prohibition-era crime dramas, but the Coens have most certainly made this film their own, despite several respectful homages to other classic films in the genre. Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne, "The Usual Suspects"), the adviser to an aging crime boss, Leo O'Bannon (Albert Finney, "Big Fish"), does not quite fit into the world of organised crime and political corruption ? he possesses a good brain, but completely lacks any heart. In a profession when "friendships," loyalty and ethics are so important in staying alive, Tom is uncertain of his ultimate place in society.The acting in this film is wonderful, with each of the actors taking full advantage of another snappy Coen brothers script. Byrne, with his perfectly-fitting Irish accent, does a good job of portraying a complex character, in the process taking more unchallenged beatings than perhaps any other film character in history. Finney is brilliant as a Leo, with one of the most memorable scenes in the film arising when two fully-equipped hit men arrive at his home to assassinate him. Demonstrating admirable quick-thinking and agility, the aging Leo shows that he, indeed, "can still trade body-blows with any man in this town," being quite an artist with the Tommy gun. Jon Polito is suitably crazy, powerful, stupid and threatening as Johnny Caspar, Leo's rival crime boss in the town, as is J.E. Freeman as Caspar's merciless henchman, known as "The Dane." Marcia Gay Harden is also very good as Verna Bernbaum, Leo's (and occasionally Tom's) girl. However, full accolades are awarded to a mesmerising John Turturro ("O Brother, Where Art Thou?") as the slimy, double-crossing bookie, Bernie. The harrowing scene in which Tom leads Bernie into the woods at Miller's Crossing to be "whacked," is a triumph of astonishing film-making and acting.It is unfortunate that "Miller's Crossing" is an often-overlooked Coen brothers film, especially as I consider it their finest film to date. Brilliantly evoking time and place, and bustling with style and substance and everything else we've come to expect in our films, here is a gem that deserves to be seen and appreciated by more people. It's only fair. "I'm talking' about friendship. I'm talking' about character. I'm talking' about hell. I ain't embarrassed to use the word - I'm talking' about ethics!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coen brothers' masterwork in pacing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Miller's Crossing is composed like a classical symphony. Beethoven and Mozart knew what was the key element in creating a masterpiece. Speed and stillness, peace and violence, noise and quiet work in a flawless harmony. The action scenes do not come often, but when they do they are shocking, hilarious and astonishing. I felt my jaw drop watching Leo defend himself against breaking and entering thugs. The scene didn't go at all the way i thought, and even though i was aware i was watching a Coen brothers' film, i was feeling all those emotions above. It's been a while since i've been surprised like that.I like the fact that the main character plays a tough guy in the world of tough guys, but we the viewers get to take a peek into the real Tommy, who is a human being with emotions. He simply is a gambler. To the very extreme. He knows of nothing else to do, so he just keeps going and tries his best to survive playing with death every day. And make it look cool, of course. Never reveal your true state to your opponent.A bit of a disappointment was the Steve Buscemi was in a bit part only, but Albert Finney was great on the other hand. John Turturro makes his Coen debut and is immediately interesting. Some of the dialogue went a little over my head, since (old gangsta style) English isn't my first language and i had no subtitles available, but i think i got through it all right. The plot twists and turns did not surprise me to the level the action sequences did, i've seen a lot of plot twists already and haven't been surprised in that department for a while.A solid effort that is a little behind Fargo and O Brother, Where Art Thou? in humour, dialogue and overall atmosphere (music &amp; cinematography), but is still the third best Coen Brothers' feature in my opinion.7/10 - very good</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gangster film master piece (warning spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well the coens have done it againMost of the films the Coens have made contain their unique dialouge, energetic and bueatiful camera work and strong performances. Miller's Crossing is no exception.Director of photography bathes the film in deep, warm shadows. The plot is typically complex and the art direction is splendid. The performances are all around excellent. Special mention must be given to Gabrial Byrne who plays his character so hard boiled we are reminded of the heros of other classic Noir films like Sam Spade and Phillip Marlowe. The Coens love to pay homage to earlier films of these generes. With Miller's Crossing they pay homage to both the Gangster and Noir generes.Gabrial Byrnes character is so shrouded in secrets and yet his eys reveal that of a man that is constantly thinking about what is going on around him and yet is able to stay above it all. We never really understand his motivations for betraying his boss and releasing turturos character yet by the end we know that he is the smartest character in the film. Marcia Gay Harden plays her femme fatal role perfectly. Like most noir films, it is usually something involving a female that is the catalyst to the plot. Byrnes Character may be the most complex of the film yet his is not the flashiest. That honor goes to Abert Finney and Jon Polito.Pherhaps the reason behind the fact that these two are so easily manipulated by Byrne's character is that they act so impulsivly with mostly lethal results. Watching the film one must be amazed at how clever Byrnes character is seeing as how close to death he comes so many times in the film.Special mention must also be given to John Turtorro. While he plays a very dislikable character, the monolouge he delivers at "Millers Crossing" where he is suppose to be killed has a way of cutting into a viewers heart and evoking so much sympathy. This is all turned around by his double cross.Anyone looking for the Coens trademark visual style will love the shootout at Albert Finneys house set to the tune of Danny Boy. Hands down, one must agree that Finney got the best scene of the film blasting down a dark street with a tommy gun staying perfectly calm. Finney plays his role with so much gusto we are reminded of other toughguy gangsters like Al Pacinos "Tony Montana", Joe Pescis "Tommy Devito" and "Nicky Santoro" and finally James Caans "Sonny Corleone"We are left with a brooding Noir/Gangster film perfectly molded by the Coen brothers that can satisfy any of their fans.In the end though, see this wonderful film for yourself</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-made Gangster Parody</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For viewers who have seen this movie and think it's a straightforward gangster movie, you might want to see this one again. The movie is anything but that. This is a skillful and very tongue-in-cheek parody of gangster films of the 1930's and 1940's and has about as much to do with reality as a Busby Berkeley musical. Gabriel Byrne, Albert Finney, Marcia Gay Harden and the rest of the cast all keep a straight face during the proceedings and the outcome is highly entertaining. The Coen brothers style here is very similar to their later hit movie "Fargo" and it's artistically miles past "Blood Simple" or any of their previous films.  As far as diverging from reality, in one scene Albert Finney fires his machine gun for five minutes without reloading (that's about 10,000 rounds, folks). Gabriel Byrne gets violently beat up every five minutes (this includes kicks to the face, being thrown down multiple flights of stairs etc.) and never shows anything more than a minor fat lip on his never-changing expression. The gangsters are all "dressed to kill" and their dialogue is straight from "Farewell, My Lovely". When one gangster asks another if he's going to have a rival killed, he answers "Yeah. For starters." The movie has more intentional funny one-liners and equally hilarious scenes than the average comedy. Of special note are the exchanges between Gabriel Byrne's character and the crooked Police Chief. If the movie "Johnny Dangerously" had dialogue like this, it would have been a box office sensation. Most of the people who saw this movie when it came out in 1990 couldn't figure out exactly what they had just seen. The Coens deliberately interspaced scenes of deadly earnestness between the put-ons and many viewers left theatres shaking their heads. Now that most folks are more familiar with the Coens and their unique blend of macabre humor and real life tragedy, this film will make perfect sense on second viewing. This is certainly one-of-a-kind film making at its best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing quite like it- moody, offbeat noir at its best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gangster films, especially ones set in prohibition era, usually follow an archetypal formula to please the masses. But Miller's Crossing is a Coen brothers gangster film, which means expect the unexpected, and get ready to be surprised, weirded out and thinking about it for days after. It exists in a world where there's no bad guys, heroes or even antiheros, just really morally depraved people making bad and worse decisions. The protagonists are callous hard cases and the antagonists are cheerfully psychotic. You might think that would set you up for an out and out action bullet fest with a healthy dose of adrenaline. Again you'd be mistaken, as the Coen's also subvert that clich, for something a little moodier, and in the end, far more memorable. Gabriel Byrne broods through his charismatic turn as Irish mob enforcer Tom, a ruthless and enigmatic guy in the employ of crime boss Leo (a blustery, surprisingly sympathetic Albert Finney). Tom is outwardly loyal and perhaps even believes he is to the core, but circumstances have led to him having an an affair with Leo's girl Verna (a young, sultry Marcia Gay Harden). Leo's outfit is currently on the brink of war with the Italian faction of the mafia, led by rabid Johnny Caspar (Jon Polito, frothing at the mouth in the liveliest work of the film). Another bad dude, Eddie Dane (J.E. Freeman) is also muscling in on action. Freeman was a criminally underrated guy gone way before his time and he's a stone voiced, menacing monster as Dane. John Turturro shows up as usual, playing Verna's brother, a sniveling rat bastard without an honest bone in his body. The scene with him and Byrne in the lonely forest is spine chilling. There's also nice work from Olek Krupa and Steve Buscemi. The words flow with carefully crafted 1930's authenticity, the production design and cinematography hum along splendidly and the actors all knock it straight out of the park. There's several scenes, including a bombastic fistfight and a climactic final shootout that should go down in both gangster movie history, and rate with the Coen's best work. The secret to their success I believe lies in their constant yearning to tell a story naturally, with all the unpredictable little kinks and eccentricities that one might find in real life itself. As we all know, life is always never what it seems, and so much stranger than any film. The Coen's know this, and own it in all their work, even making it readily apparently in a line of dialogue from the trailer: Up is down, black is white, and nothing is what it seems... at Miller's Crossing.</fullReview>

Talented Coen brothers also interest great actors to work with them and they, well directed, also use to have excellent performances. Indeed, all the actors do a fantastic job in "Miller's Crossing".

		<fullReview>Miller's Crossing is one, of the best gangster films to come around since The Godfather: Part II. The Coen Brother's gem is a slow, tepid burner, relying heavily on friendship and treachery rather than guns and death. Violence may be sparse, but it's authoritative and compelling when it lands. Tom (Gabriel Byrne) is the heart, the catalyst, the soul of the Coen's third major film. Paying as much attention as possible is key. The script is tenacious but flawless. Everyone involved is superb. Not one person stands out. Every shot is crisp and beautiful. Every scene meticulously thought out. The symbiosis behind Tom's hat and his connection towards it represents a power within the community. No hat, no power. Miller's Crossing has many layers. Repeat viewing is advised.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's the Prohibition era. Leo O'Bannon (Albert Finney) is an Irish mob boss who controls the city. Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne) is his right hand man. Verna (Marcia Gay Harden) has the boss wrapped around her little finger. Only Leo doesn't know that Verna is also sleeping with Tom. Italian rival Johnny Caspar (Jon Polito) wants to kill bookie Bernie Bernbaum (John Turturro) who's been taking advantage of him. Tom tries to get Leo to give up Bernie but he's Verna's brother and Leo refuses. Leo and Johnny go to war. Leo kicks Tom out when he reveals his affair with Verna. Tom goes to work for Caspar and he's commanded to execute Bernie in the woods at Miller's Crossing.It's the third big great movie from the Coen brothers and they show a real mastery of the cinematic arts. It is beautifully shot, ultra violent, and the actors are some of the best around. It is hard-boiled gangster noir and one of the best for fans of the genre. The mannerisms and dense dialog can put off some people and may lose some who don't pay enough attention. There are no good guys in this story. It is strictly anti-hero stuff. That may also put off some people. The audience is asked to pull for Gabriel Byrne even though he's still a gangster, just a more reasonable one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Luck of the Irish ... and the others' hard one ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It would be so convenient to label "Miller's Crossing" as a simple gangster film. It has the gritty look of the Prohibition era where the bloodiest violence disguised under a veil of well-fashioned elegance. It has the film noir's shadowy atmosphere embracing the unethical choices dictated by heart, pride and a tacit code of honor. It has the snappy dialog with wisecracks and sexual innuendo bursting out like machine-gunned fire. It has the lone ranger sticking his neck out to nobody ? except some crucial exceptions. And it has the obligatory gallery of players from the faithful boss with too much confidence to fill his hat to gun moll with ambiguous motives. But there is more than this bunch of 'it has', otherwise, it wouldn't be a Coen brothers' film.Indeed,"Miller's crossing" keeps afloat these archetypes like that black hat carried by the wind in the middle of "Miller's Crossing" serene autumnal foliage, an environment in green and orange as to symbolically match the Irish texture of the film. And it's for stylistic devices like that, and a beautiful photography from Barry Sonnenfeld, that there is more than a story to follow in "Miller's Crossing", there is a state of mind, a deadly force hovering over everyone, hero included. It's a chess-like game instead of a war where each move carries bloody premises, and lack of anticipation is a lethal flaw. And this is why "Miller's Crossing" is so demanding on the field of endurance and intelligence: after having tried to figure what went behind each move, only the 'checkmate' rewards our patience and highlights in the process, the film's brilliance.And trust the Coen brothers for that, as they probably knew such a film would take more than one viewing. They suffered from mental block while writing the screenplay, and had to start and finish "Barton Fink" before getting back to "Miller's Crossing", this is how so exhilarating in its complexity the film is. But not every film can ask for a second viewing, only one that is as lavishly designed and as cleverly written can. Watching "Miller's Crossing" again not only made me reassemble the pieces of the puzzle again, but it plunged me in a dazzling-looking universe, not likely to be conform to reality, but the hell with it. I enjoyed every bit of it. It might be too overly-designed or written, but at this level, it's not just filmmaking, it's a work of art. And the film's beauty is so visually hypnotic you let yourself intellectually challenged until the emotionally satisfying conclusion.Still, there are more than dialogs and visuals, there are faces, expressions that say it all and non-expressions that say even more. And the cast do honor to the Coens' required level. Gabriel Byrne is Tom, the right hand of Leo, the Irish mob boss played by Albert Finney. He's what we'd call a 'Consiglieri', in Mafia jargon, a voice of reason, even more valuable when the boss is blinded by his heart. Leo's girl is Verna, Marcia Gay Garden, the sister of a bookie, Leo's rival, the Italian Johnny Caspar, played by Jon Polito, wants killed for business reasons. It's easy to figure each one's motives, but the story gets more complex when it's revealed that Verna's heart belongs to Tom. That Bernie, John Turturro as the grifter who starts the whole situation is indeed a true sleaze-ball, and where some homosexual on-goings are revealed between Caspar's right hand, the towering and scary Eddie the Dane (J.E. Freeman) and a friend of Bernie played by Steve Buscemi.That's the thrilling set-up of a game of tactics and calculated double-crossings. The plot is probably inspired by Akira Kurosawa's landmark "Yojimbo", on which the first opus of Sergio Leone's dollar trilogy was made. You know what I'm talking about, when one character takes advantage from a war between two rival gangs and families, switching between both sides, sowing discord and outsmarting every one until emerging as the winner. Naturally, the game isn't safe, and he has to face some situations where his life hangs on a thread, and takes a few beatings as a necessary risk. The film doesn't have that epic romanticism like in "The Godfather" where such moves would be totally impossible, where betrayals only existed within the same blood. But we do believe that a chatty and full-of-himself parody-of-a-gangster like Johnny Caspar would be likely to trust a man like Tom. Tom is a mastermind when it comes to convincing people, especially when his life is at stakes.And no matter how much trust we put on Tom, nothing is predictable. There are two key scenes, both taking place in the titular setting. The most dramatic one occurs when Tom has to kill Bernie, as a bona fide test. By the way, John Turturro is amazing in that scene, and I wondered how the Academy could overlook that performance, since it nominated Michael Lerner for a lesser role in "Barton Fink". Bernie pleads for his life so convincingly that there is a palpable eternity between Tom's finger and the trigger. The next rendezvous in "Miller's Crossing" continues that episode and consist on Caspar's men searching the macabre aftermath. The resolutions of these situations might ask a bit too much in terms of suspension of disbelief, but in the poetic subtext of the film, like a mystical four-leaf clover inhabiting Tom's destiny.And "Miller's Crossing" is the fourth leaf of a tremendous set of gangster films of the same year : "Goodfellas", "The Godfather Part III", "The King of New York". And it's quite fitting that another Irish-mob classic, Sam Mendes' "Road to Perdition", on the same vein of greatness, transcended by Conrad Hall's cinematography, used a similar parallel between a location and the state of mind it conveyed. The difference is that the road to perdition here crosses its way out, making "Miller's Crossing" a sacred intersection between life and death ? and nothing else mattered.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Greatest Gangster Films Ever Made. An Excellent,Unforgettable,Underrated Masterpiece Of Cinema From The Coen Brothers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Miller's Crossing is a masterpiece of cinema and is not one of greatest gangster films ever made but also one of the greatest films ever made. Filled outstanding direction,a wonderful cast,an incredible flawless screenplay,amazing photography and a powerful score,Miller's Crossing is one of my favorite films and The Coen Brothers,Gangster Films Brothers,Gangster films and movie-making at it's best.Set during the Prohitbition era,Miller's Crossing tells the story of Tom Reagan(Gabriel Byrne),a adviser who works under Irish crime boss Leo(Albert Finney)and works as a guide for Leo. When a war with Italian Mob boss Johnny Casper(Jon Polito)starts to come to ahead,Tom is stuck in middle trying to stop the war between the two rival gangsters and has to deal with loyalty and death and Tom soon discovers that no one and nothing is what it seems.Miller's Crossing is an excellent and flawless masterpiece of cinema that was critically acclaimed by film critics but was basically ignored when it came out in the theaters in 1990. Miller's Crossing came out at a bad time having been released right around the same time as another great Gangster film and masterpiece of Cinema Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas. But thanks to Home Video,DVD and Cable Miller's Crossing has been rediscovered by audiences and is seen as an amazing film that it is. One of the reasons that The Coen Brother's Miller's Crossing is such a masterpiece and unforgettable film is that Miller's Crossing is combination of the Gangster films of the 1930s and the Film-Noirs of the 1940s and mixing it with the gritty Hard-Boiled Noir tales of Dashell Hammett taking the influence of Hammett's novels such as The Glass Key and Red Harvest and applying to this film as well as the influences of films such as Yojimbo and A Fistful Of Dollars but The Coen Brothers have taken all of those influences and added their own signature style to it. With MC The Coens have given viewers a film where in the gangster world violence happens all the time,the main characters and their dialog are tough and cynical and the plot is very complex and big and characters can be loyal to you one minute and turn on you the next. In the hands of some other filmmakers the film easily would've fallen apart but in the hands of the Coens the movie comes together flawlessly. Another beautiful thing about MC is the film never says where the story takes place. Is it New York City,Chicago or Los Angeles? MC takes place in a unnamed city that could be anywhere in the 1920s or 30s. The film's stylish and amazing photography by Barry Sonnifeld is beautiful and visually stunning and gives MC an accuracy to film and makes the time period look realistic and true and every camera angle is intense and devoted to the details. The screenplay by Joel and Ethan Coen is amazing and truly masterful and flawless,giving the main characters brilliant fast talking cynical dialog and creating a language and style on it's own with Black Humor. The Film-Noir influence is on display with this film and The Coens just go with it. The fascinating thing about the screenplay and dialog is that despite MC being a gangster film the F-bomb is never dropped or said in the film. Tom Reagan is great character that is rooted in the tradition of Gangster films and Film Noir because Tom is cynical but also complex with a true moral ambiguity that borderlines on good and bad and he smart and very knowledgeable. Tom Reagan is easily one of the greatest characters The Coen Brothers have ever written. The violence in the film is brutal and bloody and done with brilliance and the black sense of Humor The Coen Brothers films have so you don't whether to laugh or be horrified. The ending of the film is amazing and truly powerful but also very stylish, memorable and ambiguous and will have viewers discussing what the ending means and what happened. The ending is one of the things that makes Miller's Crossing a Masterpiece.The whole cast is amazing in their roles. Gabriel Bryne is excellent as Tom Reagan,with Bryne bringing toughness,grit and cynicism to the role. Marcia Gay Harden is brilliant and sexy as Verna,a tough girl who can handle herself. Harden brings grittiness and beauty to the performance. John Turturro is outstanding as Bernie Bernbaum,a con artist who's also Verna's brother. Jon Polito is fantastic as Johnny Casper,an Italian Mob boss. J.E Freeman is great and intense as Eddie Dane,Johnny's right hand man. Albert Finney is amazing as Leo,an Irish gangster and Tom's boss. Mike Starr(Frankie),Al Mancini(Tic-Tac),Tomas Toner(O'Doole)(Richard Woods(Mayor Dale Lavender)and Olek Krupa(Tad)give good performances as well. Also lookout for cameos from Steve Buscemi(Mink),Francis McDormand(Mayor's Secretary)and Sam Raimi(Snickering Gunman) The direction by Joel and Ethan Coen is brilliant and amazing,with The Coens always moving the camera slow close-ups and quick zooms and beautiful shots from the ground up and also great Film-Noir lighting. Fantastic direction from The Coens.The score by Carter Burwell is excellent,powerful,haunting and beautiful and matches the tone of the film. Another great score from Burwell. There is also a great use of the song Danny Boy(Sung by Frank Patterson)in a amazing,unforgettable classic scene.In final word,if you love The Coen Brothers,Gangster films,Film-Noir,Crime Dramas or cinema in general,I highly suggest you see Miller's Crossing,an unforgettable masterpiece of cinema that you will never forget and is a film that every film lover should have in their movie collection. Highly Recommended. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coen noir III: 'Look into your heart'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Character. Ethics. Reason and storytelling versus the universal void.The Coens have told this story a dozen times, starting with their debut. The story here is the classic Dashiel Hammett setup from Red Harvest, both Kurosawa and Leone dipped into it in the 60's but in the hands of the Coens it is something else. We follow a man, punishing angel who as he flies through different lives weaves with the flutter of his wings a tapestry of cosmic buffoonery. All we see here are human leaves kicked off the forest ground, dust and leaves.Was it all so he could pay a debt his way? For no good reason at all?We think there is going to be pattern there, but no. It is all about the hat being blown this way and that by winds. The hat doesn't mean anything, it's not transformed into something wonderful (as the woman is quick to wishfully interpret the dream, as were we)?it's merely the tip of the thread, the invisible string being pulled, pulling us into a story of stories.This isn't noir in its heart. It's noir in the clothes, the snappy talk, the characters and some of the tropes, the doublecross and whatnot, but insofar as noir is the stuff of dreams, there is agency in its winds. There's some doodling with dreams here, 'mental states', the whole thing with the body in the woods. But it's just that, a perfectly folded origami. I'm pretty sure there was a more elaborate structure here that the Coens decided to scrap at the last minute, perhaps thinking it wouldn't mesh well with the gangster shell. I'm pretty sure they made that film about 'the life of the mind' their next project, Barton Fink.So far as gangster movies go, I'd trade Goodfellas for this anyday. But how about the bellowing gorilla? That was so strange, it may be the moment that will most stick with me, causal transference by air.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Utter Brilliance, truly an amazing film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To this day, it still amazes me how much this film went by the wayside in 1990. Granted, Goodfellas was a masterpiece, but I find Miller's Crossing to be beyond brilliant. The Coens accomplished something in this film that Scorsese could never begin to imagine. While being an underrated classic, Miller's Crossing is a triumphant tale of expecting the unexpected. As the tag line states, "Up is down, black is white, and nothing is what it seems". Gabriel Byrne's performance of Tom Reagan is flawless, genuine, and unforgettable. Jon Polito, John Tuturro, Albert Finney, J.E. Freeman and Marcia Gay Harden also deserve the same recognition for their stunning performances. No other film, in the history of cinema, has ever felt so magical and alive. From beginning to end, MC is filled with twists and turns that make you feel like you hope the movie will never end.The scenes themselves are like something out of a Picasso painting. Rather than rambling on, I'll name a few of my favorites: -the opening scene with Caspar, Tom, and Leo -the unforgettable "Danny Boy" scene with Leo -"Bernie's walk" into the depths of Miller's Crossing -Tom opening up to Leo about he and VernaI could go on forever. Every scene is instantly classic, with a touch of gold from the Coens.In addition to the beautiful cinematography, the dialogue is sheer genius. While I enjoy every single line in the film, I particularly loved what Tom, Leo, and Caspar had to say. If there was ever I movie that I could nearly quote from beginning to end, it would most certainly be Miller's Crossing.What else could possibly add to a flawless movie? Carter Burwell's score. While Burwell is known for his excellent scores in Fargo and Barton Fink, he truly achieved greatness with the Miller's Crossing score.The thing to walk away from with a film like Miller's Crossing can easily be summed up by the film's tag line: "Up is down, black is white, and nothing is what it seems". Not only does this concept apply to the plot of the film, but it applies to the viewer's expectations. Most people who walked into the theater in 1990 were expecting a typical gangster film, like The Godfather or Once Upon A Time In America. What they got was the exact opposite. Rather than seeing one-sided mobsters carry out the wishes of their boss, we see a rebellious Tom Reagan who has had enough with Leo's stubborn and egotistical judgments. With that in mind, the viewer sees an organized crime boss turned on his heels and thrown to the whim of an ex-underling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Coen bros BEST movie!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A truly original, under-rated and undiscovered "Neo-Noir/Gangster Movie", with a very intellectual and unpredictable scrip, with dark humor + irony outlining the incredible dialog. Stylized and much atmospheric photography and direction. Music that gets under your skin and performances that stay with you forever.The film makers could have been influenced by "A Fistful of Dollars" (1964) but they have made a one-of-a-kind film with Miller's Crossing. Its a story about a gambler with dark motives, who is taking advantage of the conflict going on between two rival gangster groups. He moves among the two groups, with a moral code all of his own, while carrying out a highly intellectual and dark Machiavellian plan.The script is excellent and along with the brilliant acting, all moving through a very atmospheric underworld, exploring themes like friendship, betrayal, once put together they all make a small masterpiece. Perhaps (in my opinion) the Coen's best film. Gabriel Byrne is FLAWLESS as "Tom Reagan". He creates the type of character that stays with you forever, and he does it with simplicity. Probably among one of the most complex characters ever written. Full of dualities (as most Noir characters should be) and of course "damned" and self destructive (by choice).To sum up, this is definitely one of those films someone has to see a second time (as with most brilliant films). It's a guarantee you will see new things each time you watch it.Excellent!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is "Dick Tracy" for adults</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not just making fun of gangster movies, the Coen brothers are making fun of Hollywood, making fun of us all. By making fun of a genre, they are making a whole new genre.Every character is a caricature. No line is a throwaway. Every shot produces a carefully desired effect. That effect is usually to have the viewer cerebrally scurrying to try to remember who said what to whom when. Loyalties outwardly mean everything but get changed more frequently (it would seem) than undershirts. This is camp, all grown up.The Coens suck us right down into the plot. We think for a while that they're serious, but they're laughing all the way. Even finally realizing their manipulation of us doesn't dampen for one minute the enjoyment of the movie. The dialog and action clip along at an impressive pace and the viewer is compelled not to miss a single line.If you like movies, you'll likely like this one. If you like the Coens, you'll love this one. If you've just read some Tolstoy, you shouldn't have any trouble keeping up with the number of characters and their (ahem) development. The rest of us need a scorecard.The real accomplishment of "Miller's Crossing" is that it never descends into kitsch. The same script could have been acted by the Marx brothers without any dialog edits and would have been on a par wit "Duck Soup", but the cast here keeps and straight face and keeps us interested the whole time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Coens pay homage to the American gangster movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Millers Crossing is the Coen brother's take on the classic prohibition era gangster movie and it has many of the hallmarks of their unique style.The story is simple and quite clichd really. The Irish American crime boss Leo (Albert Finney) has the authorities in his pocket as he runs his empire smoothly. However there is trouble on the horizon as one of the smaller gang leaders Johnny Caspar (Jon Polito) wants his permission to kill a crooked bookie Bernie Bernbaum (John Turturro). However Finney is in love with Turturro's sister (Marcia Gay Harden) and refuses.The film is told from the point of view of Finney's trusted lieutenant, Tom Reagan, played by Gabriel Byrne. He advises Finney not to let personal feelings impact on business decisions, but to no avail and things spiral out of control.The film is full of the double crossing and violence you would expect from an old-fashioned gangster movie. However the distinctive Coen style is what sets it apart. They pay homage to the great gangster movies of the past rather than telling a gangster story per se. There are some great set piece scenes, almost cartoonish violence and razor sharp dialogue. The costumes and sets are perfect in helping to bring us back to the golden age of gangster movies.The Coens seem more interested in style at the expense of character development so the cast don't have to display their undoubted talents. However Turturro is worthy of special mention for his turn as the sleazy bookie. I thought Byrne's Tom Regan comes across as a wisecracking know-it-all and I found it hard to have much sympathy with him. I found the other characters more appealing, for all their faults.I hadn't seen this film in a while and was perhaps expecting too much but it is still one of the landmark movies in the careers of these geniuses of modern cinema.</fullReview>

He is calm, clever and witty. The dialogs are great. John Turturro also performed stunningly especially when his character begs for his life.The film plot is also clever, with betrayal happening every moment. There was a lot of characters and parties that Gabriel Byrne's character double crossed, and yet the events unfolds neatly without confusing the viewers with the vast amount of information.The film manages to keep me interested throughout, which is very rare for a gangster film.

		<shortDescription>Not that much of a Rumpus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Miller's Crossing is not your typical gangster film. Its gangsters, Coen Brothers style. Gangsters film noir (not that uncommon you might think, but there haven't been many gangster films in recent years you could classify as noir; while Goodfellas was an amazing film, would you class it as noir?). The gangsters have principles and ethics. And its taken for a given that all the cops are bent. The police chief simply works for the top dog ? the man who really runs the town.Leo (Albert Finney) plays the aforementioned top dog, and is an honourable man who keeps his promises. He is constantly supported by loyal lieutenant Tom (Gabriel Byrne), and the two have an almost father-son relationship. When rising mob boss Johnny Caspar (Jon Polito) comes to see him telling him he is going to kill someone under Leo's protection, instead of giving up his charge in order to keep the peace, Leo refuses to allow the hit. What follows is a slow descent into gangland war, with Tom caught right in the middle, trying to prevent all-out war (and Leo finding out about his relationship with Leo's girlfriend, played by Marcia Gay Harden).Tom (Byrne) is an original anti-hero. Caught in the middle of a brewing turf war between rival gangsters, wanting to keep the peace and stay out of it. Unlike most gangsters, he operates with his brain rather than his muscles. Byrne plays it superbly (as we have come to expect from him), with just the right amount of melancholy and self-destructive nature mixed in with honour to ensure he doesn't appear to heroic. In fact, Byrne is the undoubted star of the piece, playing it understated while everyone else finds license to cut loose and overact. Albert Finney, while underused, is terrific, and utilises a wonderful gangster accent ? with, rather originally, hint of John Wayne in it, whilst Polito and the rest all have the stereotypical indistinct gravelly voices.What makes the film so atypical of gangster films is its contradicting nature. For instance, early in the film there is a ferocious shootout at Leo's house, but it is played out to the strains of 'Danny Boy', and almost in slow motion. It never appears to be over-dramatic, while the shootouts again hark back to 30s gangster films ? lots of tommy guns, with lots of loud bangs, flashes and smoke but very little claret. Further, the Coen Brothers, in keeping with their unconventional tone, utilise a sense of old style filming, with fade outs between scenes ? reminiscent of Dad's Army and Golden Age Hollywood films such as Gone With The Wind. The violence is also reasonably restrained for the most part (at least until the end anyway), again in fitting in with the old-style filming.The relationship between Finney &amp; Byrne's characters is also refreshing; they are close confidantes, trusted friends ? something not often seen in gangster films. Leo is also a gangster with ethics and principles, and keeps promises to protect people; again not a common gangster trait.But for all it's praiseworthy points, the story itself is a bit of a slow-burner; when compared to classic gangster films like The Godfather and Goodfellas, or even modern ones such as Road to Perdition, the story produces little adrenaline or excitement, and it is hard to become too wrapped up in the story and the plight of the characters.The Coen Brothers seem simply unable to produce a standard generic picture; everything they make always appears to be slightly off-kilter, and Miller's Crossing is no different. So if you want a gangster film that isn't in the 'badda bing badda bang' tradition of Goodfellas, then Miller's Crossing is perfect. But just don't expect a white-knuckle ride.</fullReview>

This movie is so much fun. It is clear that the artist's had fun doing it and were in-joy-in themselves. So fun. Highly recommended. Gabriel Byrne is such a study in calm under pressure. Marcia Gay Harden gives life to what are really only a very few lines and creates a complete human being. Albert Finney, although uncertain whether or not to use an Irish brogue, balances with mastery the portrayal of power in the crucible of romantic love. I don't know the name of the man who plays Caspar, but he is so delicious in his role. He took big chances and we were all rewarded by his courage. I saw this movie in '93 for the first time and did not appreciate it at all. I'm watching it now and loving it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gangsters run an American City in the early 20's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This early Coen Brothers film is filled with double double crosses. Gabriel Byrne, in one of the leads, makes his character strangely attractive. The ratio of people hit to shots fired is probably pretty close to the truth. A tiny anachronism is the presence of dial telephones in an American city before 1925 ( either that or some other problem with whatever it is that places the plot that early). Another tiny plot hole is that if the outsider's bets on the fixed fight keep the fixer from profiting, the outsiders fail to profit too.The ethical gangster is pretty funny - heavier handed humor than later Coen, though. I wish we had a rating of 7.5 - I put the film better than 7, but it hasn't enough emotional impact on me for 8.</fullReview>

Opulent, prohibition-era sets provide the backdrop for the quirky, sassy dialogue. John Torturro delivers a stand-out performance in a small role, but it is Byrne who carries the movie with his icy demeanor and subtle depth.The movie slows on occasion, and stalled during a scene with Regan and love interest Verna (Marcia Gay Harden). The Coen brothers seem more comfortable advancing plot than developing characters with dialogue.Frances McDormand (of Fargo), appears briefly in an uncredited role as the mayor's secretary. Steve Buscemi, also of Fargo, plays Mink, love interest to tough guy Eddie Dane (JE Freeman) and Torturro's grifter.Stylish and witty, the film is essential viewing for fans of the genre and of the Coens.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Miller's Crossing is a wonderful and authentic Gangster film, that ranks among my favorites.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Miller's Crossing is a special film for me, with a really authentic type feel to it in every way, but that's because it has The Coen touch!. I'll admit I'm not that big a fan of Gangster films they have to really grab my attention to get me excited, but Miller's Crossing was one of those. Gabriel Byrne's magnificent portrayal of Tom Reagan is one for the record books as one of the greatest Gangster performances of all time, and I found his friendship with Albert Finney|Leo| to be wonderful and heartbreaking at the same time. The double-crossing, the twists, and just the way that Tom had a heart of gold unlike most of the gangsters truly amazed me. I had many favorite scenes in this movie, but the best had to be when Bernie|Turturro| was in the woods with a gun to his head by Tom, it was really an effective scene that I won't spoil any more. I've found The Godfather overrated, along with many other Gangster films they bore me, but Miller's Crossing is truly one of a kind, and I loved every minute of it.Performances. Gabriel Byrne gives a performance for the ages as Tom Reagan. This guy has always flew under the Radar, but with this performance it makes him legendary, and rightfully so. His hard as nails act, with a heart of a gold underneath was really something special. Marcia Gay Harden is terrific as Verna. She is classy and I loved her sass. John Turturro is a revelation as Bernie. His Weaselish antics were great and made for memorable moments. Jon Polito is chilling as Johnny Caspar. His constant shouting, and his intense performance was great. Albert Finney is classy and great as Leo.Bottom line. Miller's Crossing is a film not to be missed if you love Gangster movies. It's authentic feel will pull you in quickly and not let go until the end. See it! 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Interesting Film That Goes....Nowhere?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You can't really find fault with the acting, the dialog, the story or cinematography of this film. Some of the violent gun deaths are over the top, but is never on a par with other gangster films for blood and gore. The film does lack however, in setting the mood for the era and for the feel of the ethnic gangs. "Gangs of New York", "The Molly MacGuires" and "Godfather" do a tremendous job of this. This film is more like a stage play. "Miller's Crossing" is all pretty much good or excellent. But this is a film that is ultimately unsatisfying. That's because it carries you along and slowly builds up a double cross and hope for redemption in a very suspenseful and rewarding way, but there is no payoff in the end. All the potential that the film builds is just tossed away when Gabriel Byrne walks away from his life and everything he lied, cheated and killed for. So you are left wondering what it all meant. We get the foreshadowing of this very boring and unsatisfying ending when the Verna character off handedly said that the hat dream was a metaphor, how pursuing it would lead to a payoff, and Byrne cut her off and said there was nothing there, just a hat. Well, that's the movie in a nutshell. Just a gangster movie. It's not "The Sting", it's not "Goodfellas", it's just a lot of good acting in an ugly and violent world that leads to absolutely nothing. So I give the film a 6 out of ten. It is watchable, but why? It doesn't make you think. You just walk away feeling like you were cheated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An uncredited remake of "The Glass Key", the Coen Brothers' 1991 "Miller's Crossing" is in a number of ways an astounding film, (certainly one of the Coen Brothers' most tightly knit, narratively), full of black-humorous quirks, such as the marvelous set-piece of Albert Finney as the crime boss turning tables with a tommy-gun on would-be assassins in a car which he calmly follows on foot until at last the car crashes and explodes, while a classic rendition of "Danny Boy" plays over the soundtrack.The Coen Brothers' also take a minor scene from the Hammett text - where Ned Beaumont drunkenly gambles away his hat and then has to go hunting for it after he sobers up - and turn it into an over-arching metaphor for the emotional emptiness the anti-hero (marvelously played by Gabriel Byrne) struggles with throughout the narrative and which Hammett left as merely implicit.They also return the ethical bleakness to the finale, without actually duplicating Hammett's - now it is the crime boss who gets the girl and the anti-hero who is left to ponder the ruin of his friendship with his former boss. It should also be noted that the Coen Bros. return the alcoholism to the anti-hero, thus further problematizing an already difficult-to-grasp character.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Miller's Crossing" is, in my opinion, the most accomplished of the Coen brother movies, which is saying something; they have made some very fine flicks.Among the criticisms I've heard about the Coens are: (1) they are too zany ("Raising Arizona"), (2) they are too offbeat ("The Big Lebowski"), (3) they are too dark ("Barton Fink"), and more recently (4) they have sold out to commercial Hollywood ("Intolerable Cruelty").True or not, none of those complaints can be made about "Miller's Crossing", which is one of the most well-crafted movies in Hollywood history. Perhaps because no one aspect of the film (scripting or directing or acting or cinematography or sound) stands out above the others, it's easier to overlook how superb every film element is accomplished.As a result, this is a movie I bought, and one that I watch over and again, especially when I'm trying to learn something about the craft of movie-making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another in a long (at the time) line of gangster movies is a bit of counterfeit film noir, dressed up in the style of the late 1980s but taking its cues from the crime dramas of Hollywood's Golden Age. Up to a point the forgery works: Gabriel Byrne is a more effective lone wolf than Alan Ladd ever was, playing the proverbial man-in-the-middle when big boss Albert Finney initiates an obscurely motivated war against a rival gang. The brothers Coen downplay their usual bag of camera tricks in favor of clever dialogue and countless double-crosses, loading their plot with so many characters that more than a few get shoved into the background (femme fatale Marcia Gay Hardin, for one). The colorful and lively story is set in a nameless city during an unspecified time of tommy guns and speakeasies, but the film adds nothing new to an already overcrowded tradition except state-of-the-art bloodletting and some oddly anachronistic stereotypes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not my favorite Coen brothers crime thriller, though certainly not the worst</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At times I wondered if Miller's Crossing might work better as a novel, and it basically clicked right then why I didn't find it to be the masterpiece I kept hearing about from people on this site. I'm a big fan of the Coen brothers, and perhaps I expect too much of them. But they also happen to have some of the finest chops in working "neo-noir" out with great visuals pizazz and very natural screenplays. Miller's Crossing is a little different though, even as it's through and through one of their movies. This time, for their first time on their only 3rd film, they have here something very polished, with a cast that includes the most powerful of character actors and a star or two. And they even draw influence from Dashiell Hammett from a couple of his novels (Red Harvest one of them). So why does this feel so, well, self-conscious? Even more self-conscious than they usually do I mean? It's probably because at times there's such an icy-cold precision working with these characters, at least through Reagan (Gabriel Byrne), that the nuttiness that makes the film much more entertaining kind of has to muscle in for room. It's an homage that really walks that fine line of becoming too aware of itself, like a superhero constantly adjusting his cape and weapons belt.That's really the only liabilities I felt, or thought, from the film. And maybe it might be better on a repeat viewing (The Man Who Wasn't There, which I thought was very good on a first go-around, now I find to be one of their masterpieces). Still, there's much in the film that kept me watching it till the end. Jon Polito is in one of the very best performances of his entire career- which also includes other stints in Coen brothers pictures- as a half agitated, half talky-chummy kind of 1930s Italian crime boss, who sometimes in-between the problems with the gamblers and Bernie Bernbaum (John Tuturro) has to smack some sense into his pudgy son. But Tuturro too is once again striking some rich material with his performance, who is maybe even more of an ice-cold movie clich gangster than Byrne's character, as the two end up playing each and the other side back and forth. There's also some style from Finney and Marcia Gay Harden too. And some of these set-pieces are real knockouts, such as the shoot-out at Leo's place, or that first major scene in the woods at the crossing.But in the end maybe the only disappointment I could say is that it's so much of a good thing that the Coens almost forget about putting these people in the real world. Everything becomes so much akin to the old movies and novels in the world of Miller's Crossing that the pleasures of watching it- and they are available via Sonnenfeld's camera and the performances- get in danger of putting almost too many words in their mouths, with it being too, well, written out. I recommend it, but not necessarily as the first movie from the brothers, unless you're hankering for some gangster-movie homages all the way down to the cigarettes and Steve Buscemi's bit-part speech.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Wordy Take on Organized Crime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Films about crime always seem to get special attention, thanks to the success of The Godfather. Many anxiously attend every new crime movie, hoping to see heartless characters slaughter each other in new and interesting ways. Yet somehow it's always intriguing to watch, and one seems to get caught up in the action, as the outer conflict becomes a clear picture of the protagonist's inner conflict.Miller's Crossing is an interesting take on the "crime" genre that sets up Gabriel Byrne as the protagonist, playing Tom Reagan, a man who seems to have a kind heart and is caught between opposing sides. The Coen Brothers display the interesting story in a peculiar way, a way far more interested in the dialogue of the characters than in the action on screen. If you're looking for action, you'll find a few, well-shot scenes, but those scenes are far from being the focus of the film, which puts Miller's Crossing in a class along with some of the more developed films about organized crime.Another aspect that puts Miller's Crossing in this class is the superb acting. As previously mentioned, Byrne puts in an excellent performance as Reagan, but supporting him are an excellent Albert Finney as Leo, and John Turturro puts in one of his best performances as Bernie. Sadly, none of the performances won a single nomination from the Oscars. Furthermore, the film is very well-shot and displays its mood well via Barry Sonnenfeld's cinematography and Carter Burwell's short theme.However, the screenplay of the film should've been improved upon, as the dialogue of the film is its focus. The dialogue is so caught up in descriptions and locations that it forgets to characterize anyone. Also, it manages to confuse the viewer, who has to view the film multiple times in order to understand which character is which, and how each character relates to the story as a whole.Overall, however, this film is worth a watch, especially if the viewer has time for multiple viewings. Try to pay close attention to the dialogue for better understanding.Overall Grade: A-.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When a director goes for high stylization--he / she takes a huge gamble. If its not done exactly right---it becomes pretentious, and hollow. This Millers Crossing is .......pretentious......put simply--------it just doesn't work. Its strictly pseudo intellectual, but it will be loved by those Coen fans who wet there pants at the very mention of the name...Coen. The over use of the trendy gangster words is embarrassing....and tedious. Prohibition was never as plastic as this.......it happened in the real world. The characters are extravagantly absurd. The story line is in keeping with everything........its preposterous. This attempt at a gangster film fails spectacularly. Even the actors look......lost in space....perhaps they too were bored.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most beautiful gangster films ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Millers Crossing", directed by Joel Coen and written by Joel and Ethan Coen is arguably one of the most gorgeous films from the gangster genre ever made. Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne) is the right hand man to Leo (Albert Finney), who is the reigning crime boss in an unnamed town in the 1930's. Hot on Leo's heels for control of the town is Johnny Caspar (John Polito), and to make matters worse, Leo is making bad decisions regarding crooked booker Bernie Bernbaum (John Turturro), whom Caspar wants dead. We find out that Leo is keeping Bernie protected because he is involved with Bernie's sister Verna (Marcia Gay Harden). However, when it is revealed that Tom and Verna are an item, Leo and Tom break ties, resulting in Tom trying to play both sides against each other in order to ensure his own survival.While "Millers Crossing" does not yet show the signature eccentricities of their later films, the Coen brothers' dark humor is definitely present, as is their unabashed use of violence. Their excellent use of music in their films is on prominent display here, particularly in the incredible "Danny Boy" sequence that I remember rewinding several times the first few times I rented the movie years ago. Barry Sonnenfeld's cinematography is beautiful, whether it is a forest scene or simply a short scene in Tom's apartment. The acting of the primaries, some of them later becoming Coen brothers regulars is excellent, particularly Turturro's performance. It was this film that put him on my radar and I have subsequently looked out for his work since then.I first saw this film in the theater because it was a gangster flick, and I have always been a fan of that genre. "Millers Crossing" was the first Coen brothers' film that I had ever seen, and even back in high school when I saw this one for the first time, I knew that they were special filmmakers. While not on the same level of oddity as David Lynch, they don't shy away from including bizarre moments (the goon in the chair screaming over and over for no discernible reason). Films like "Millers Crossing", viewed while in my mid-teens certainly cultivated my later love for alternative cinema and made me a near-obsessive fan of the Coen brothers' work, an obsession that continues to this day. 9/10 --Shelly</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is like it was a custom order from Mafia to entertain their criminal minds in a special theater. Mafia talk about their problems, mafia war (or gangster war if you prefer) and I couldn't care less.But even they would be disappointed. Too slow, too much blah, blah (if they talked that much they wouldn't be murderers in the first place), even naive and boring -at least up to about the 40' minute where I stopped watching. I wasn't convinced at all that it was worth a viewing but I was sure that up to that minute it was a waste of my time.Such films present criminals and their criminal ways of thinking and acting as if they deserve a presentation and even a promotion. Sorry I don't buy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A monument to style over substance, "Miller's Crossing" may quite possibly be the worst gangster film ever made. Apparently the Coen's couldn't decide to play this rip-off of Hammett's "The Glass Key" straight or for laughs with the result being a dreadful mishmash that's virtually unwatchable. Gabriel Byrne's laconic performance is soporific. Jon Polito humiliates himself with an over-the-top performance and given his career of embarrassingly poor performances, that's saying a lot. The rest of the cast either sleepwalks or hams their way through this dreadfully paced piece of dreck. The Coen's script appears to have been written during an extended bender and is practically incomprehensible. The only positive I one can say about "Miller's Crossing" is that the cinematography was not particularly bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"What's the rumpus?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story gets pretty complex, as this is from the Coen Brothers. It focuses Tom, a cold and smart-aleck lieutenant who works under an Irish Mob Boss, Leo. Things get ugly when Leo gets into a disagreement with an Italian under-boss who feels that he is getting a raw deal. Things also get more complicated when Tom falls in love with Leo's woman. Sooner or later Tom's going to have to decide who's side he's on and who his enemies really are. All of this leads to an uncontrollable scenario with the signature Coen twists and surprises. The acting is also superb. Gabriel Byrne is fantastic as the cold and heartless Tom, who always has something smart or sarcastic to say. There is no way I could see anybody else playing the role. It suits him that well. Turturro has some of the best moments. First when he begs for his life, and then when he cynically tries to quote his begging to save himself again. One of his better roles, I think. Everybody else in it is also terrific.A few brief words about some of the other elements of production. Barry Sonnenfeld's sure-footed photography, as always, is smooth and steady where appropriate, and frenetic where necessary. The set design and costuming make for such an astonishing illusion that were this not a color film, you might actually forget that it was released 9 and not 69 years ago. And even the sound from the music (diegetic and otherwise) to the crystal-clear sound effects that pierce the visual and draw you in by the ears, like they're supposed to is a presence in its own right throughout the film. I mean, when was the last time ice cubes dropping into an old-fashioned glass or the wringing out of an alcohol-soaked rag into a tinny dish felt truly woven into the designed effect of a scene in a movie? Overall rating: 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant - the first sign of the Coen Brothers' genius for film-making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brilliant - the first sign of the Coen Brothers' genius for film- making.Tom Reagan (played by Gabriel Byrne) is the right-hand man, and chief adviser, to a mob boss, Leo (Albert Finney). Trouble is brewing between Leo and another mob boss, Johnny Caspar (Jon Polito), over the activities of a bookie, Bernie Bernbaum (John Turturro) and Leo and Tom are at odds on how to deal with it. Meanwhile, Tom is in a secret relationship with Leo's girlfriend, Verna (Marcia Gay Harden), who happens to be the sister of Bernie. In trying to resolve the issue, Tom is cast out from Leo's camp and ultimately finds himself stuck in the middle between several deadly, unforgiving parties.Fantastic storytelling from Joel and Ethan Coen. Clever, complex plot. Good ramping up of the intrigue, tension and claustrophobia as the movie goes on. You can feel how Tom is being hemmed in from all sides and how no matter which way he turns somebody is going to be out to kill him.Some good comedic moments too. Wonderful camera-work and cinematography. The forest scenes are particularly beautiful and haunting. The score helps there too.Great performances all round. Gabriel Byrne gets the icy coolness and wise cracking of Tom down perfectly, like he was Humphrey Bogart and this was a Sam Spade/Micky Spillane movie. The other standout performance is John Turturro as Bernie - his under-pressure hysterics are something to behold.A wonderful modern film noir-type movie, and who better to do it than the Coen Brothers. Until this movie they had shown, with Blood Simple and Raising Arizona, that they could make good movies, but there was a spark of genius missing. With this, their third movie, they showed they could make GREAT movies, movies that were incredible works of art. And it didn't end here. After this they would scale even greater heights with movies that rank among some of the best the world has ever seen - The Big Lebowski, Fargo and No Country for Old Men.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Miller's Crossing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew this was a gangster movie, but I didn't know, or just forgot, that it was directed by brothers Joel and Ethan Coen (Fargo, No Country for Old Men, True Grit), so it would be interesting to see how they do with this specific genre. Basically set in Prohibition era 1930s, Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne) is the adviser and right hand man for Irish mobster and political boss Leo O'Bannon (Albert Finney). Italian racketeer and Leo's partner Johnny Caspar (Jon Polito) announces his intent to kill bookie Bernie Bernbaum (Quiz Show's John Turturro), against Tom's advice he extends his protection to Bernie, Verna Bernbaum (Pollock's Marcia Gay Harden) is Bernie's brother, she is in a relationship with Leo, but continues an affair with Tom. To end the war, Tom tries to convince Leo to give up Bernie to Caspar, he attempts to convince him he is being played by Verna to protect her brother, but Leo is not swayed, and after an assassination attempt on Leo, Tom reveals his affair with Verna to prove her dishonesty, Leo only beats her and turns his back on them both. Tom approaches Caspar for work, to prove his loyalty Caspar commands him to kill Bernie at Miller's Crossing, Bernie is taken into the woods, he begs Tom to spare him, saying "Look into your heart", Tom fires the gun to fake the murder, he tells Bernie to run and hide. Caspar assumes Leo's position as boss of the city, controlling the police and using them to destroy Leo's operations, meanwhile Tom begins settling disagreements between Caspar and his trusted but brutal and homosexual enforcer Eddie "the Dane" Dane (J.E. Freeman). Dane confirms that Tom's men did not see him murder Bernie, he is taken to Miller's Crossing to find Bernie's body, Tom nearly cracks as they near the location, but they find a body that has been shot in the face and birds have disfigured him. Tom finds out that Bernie returned, killed Dane's lover Mink (Steve Buscemi), also his lover, and placed his body in the woods, Bernie tries to blackmail Tom into killing Caspar. Eddie Dane denies betraying Caspar, after Tom uses Mink's unknown whereabouts to convince Caspar, he needs to decide who to trust and who to kill, in rage Caspar beats Dane before shooting him in the head, Tom then arranges a meeting between Caspar and Bernie, Caspar is under the pretext that he will be meeting Mink. Bernie gets the jump on Caspar and kills him, Tom arrives after this and tricks Bernie into handing over his gun, after a discussion of who will be blamed and the retribution for blackmailing Bernie again blames Tom to spare his life, saying "Look into your heart", Tom replies "What heart?" and shoots him. With Caspar and Eddie Dane dead, Leo resumes his position as top boss, Verna has her way back Leo's trust, but reacts coldly towards Tom, on the day Bernie is buried Leo announces he and Verna are engaged, he also offers Tom his job back, Tom refuses and stands back watching Leo depart, the future is questionable. Also starring Mike Starr as Frankie, Al Mancini as Tic-Tac, Richard Woods as Mayor Dale Levander, Thomas Toner as O'Doole, Home Alone 3's Olek Krupa as Tad, Michael Jeter as Adolph, Sam Raimi as Snickering Gunman and Frances McDormand as Mayor's Secretary. Byrne is brilliant as the cool, calculating man behind the throne of the boss, Finney is impressive, Harden gives a great Bette Davis style performance as the woman two men are in love with, and supporting actors like Polito and Turturro give terrific performances as well. I will be completely honest and say that I had to really concentrate to understand everything going on, but even if I didn't it had plenty of moments to remember, including the gory assassination attempt with guns blazing, there are some perfectly over-the-top violent sequences, it is a well written, well acted and has all the right ingredients to keep you fixed, a satisfactory neo-noir black comedy crime drama. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coen brother's gangster film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very well written Coen brothers's gangster film. It has sharp dialogues and has depth and soul to it without going into the mindless Tommy Gun shootouts. The main lead is a character named Tom Reagan who starts out as the right hand man for his boss Leo. Now Leo O'Bannon is one of the coolest mob boss in film history. Sure he gets his hands dirty but he treats the people that work for him right and he does have a heart. Well at least a heart when it comes to gangster bosses anyways. Anyways Tom is a smart, cunning skimmer that is a bit over his head. But also has this charisma and pretentious loyalty which leads him to be liked highly by whoever hires him. He is also has this bad boy persona that women find irresistible and keeps his cool for the most part. He is also very good at manipulation. He is a gambler that takes huge risks with his life and act cool continuously like he doesn't give a crap (which is another reason why some women find him irresistible). In another words he is a good bluffer, which is few of the reasons why you would want him to be on your team while also not wanting him on your team. The reason why I go about Tom's personality is because his personality plays a pivotal role in the plot. And when he sleeps with his boss's twist which leads things to intertwine and sets off in a very different path than what could of been. That acting for the most part is done quite well in this, but that also has to do with the well written dialogue and direction. The ending is pretty gritty, bleak and stays far away from the warm heartfelt wrap up. "Nobody knows anybody, not that well".9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It took me three views to figure out the entire plot. It is a terrific story about the incorruptible at the bottom of the heart that can't be told but can't be beat. Dashiell Hammet, wherever he is, must be applauding. The first time I was caught by the style. The second time by the acting. The third time by the craftsmanship of the plot. The nice thing about the 30's is that corruption was so simple then. To the people who lived in it, personal loyalty was the only thing to hold onto, or not. This incredibly elaborate movie is simply about one man with that one motive. The plot, of course, is something else. A violent war between gangs gets won by wits after so many twists and turns that you wonder how someone can be so smart... oh, and there is lots of black humor. If you like film noir, and if you think nothing new could be done with it, watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They wear heavy trenchcoats and fedoras, but remove them before a fight. They drag on cigarettes endlessly. It is prohibition era, but that does not stop them, and each clink of ice on gin glass is a sign of their luxurious freedom and power. They use words like dame, which swiftly becomes whore when necessary. They have gender-specific designations for guns. This is a pure distillation of Hammet and Chandler. Verna twice closes the door in the face of her secret lover, and when the thuggish Dane breaks it open, she doesn't shriek like the fat lady in the restaurant, but brandishes her weapon with scorn and venom spilling out of her mouth, as if to loudly signify her as the designated femme fatale (and Tom is just as spiteful in return). Does it matter? She is the only female character of any significance anyway. Like many Coen films, the dialogue is heavily stylised and easily quotable. And overly so, because we fixate on the snappy dialogue that comes in troves instead of the actual characters, and how cleverly and quickly they respond. Think "Leave the gun. Take the cannoli." but replicated a dozen more times. Tom, buffeted by a never-ending series of difficulties and double crosses and betrayals, has a ready made one-liner for any confrontation. It does not feel like he is under an intense moral and ethical dilemma. Verna and he dance around each other dangerously, attack viciously and never show an ounce of vulnerability towards one another. And then he grips her roughly, and they fall into each other's arms, but the Coens seem to do this more than twice without a hint of irony. There is less and less conflict each time. Coincidently, the one time he is silent is the one time he is under the most threat, and he vomits instead of firing out another quip. These gangsters run the town their own way. The best scene of the movie, Casper's wide-smiling, pompous presentation, immediately paints a picture of each side's entitlement towards what they feel they deserve. They are rivals, but both possess the same twisted sense of ethics that makes them so good at controlling those beneath them. Polito sells it earnestly; see how righteous and adamant he is in claiming that if he rigs a fight, he should expect a profit from it, and how he complains about the state of affairs that sees dishonest crooks corrupt this innocent little system and hierarchy. And observe the Coens weave in other little signs of this. See how pleasantly the gangsters greet the men in blue, and the delightful way in which the chief, when questioned of his loyalty, stammers a docile and polite reaffirmation, as if he was the one being questioned by a police officer: "I-I was just speculating a hypothesis, sir." Watch how politicians cower and are bullied into obedience because of how they have been kept in office ("I voted for him six times.") And when Tom strides into the women's bathroom, it is as if he owns the place, and is walking right into enemy territory.Technically, the film is gorgeous, and perhaps this is where it betrays its intentions. Sonnenfeld's imagery and compositions are elegant and haunting; the opening credits peering through the treetops, the man with a gun and the cowering, weeping figure begging for his life from a distance, later a crowd gathering around the supposed corpse like a coronation, the twice reveals of Bernie, obscured by shadow and murky intentions. Burwell's piercing flute twists itself around the film and gives it a similar atmosphere. And the production design is intoxicating; the musty, dim oak-lined rooms with great big desks for formal affairs, a dinghy and green-tinged warehouse for dirtier deeds, and chairs and beds of increasingly ornate design. These point to a darker, brooding, more morally complex film that does not match Miller's Crossing. When Tom refuses to sell out Leo, he must fight his way out, but the Coens go for the humorous route, and the thug scurries away like a child running to his father after being teased. It is very funny, and very much tonally inconsistent. And when Leo is the target of an assassination attempt, mystery and tension is mustered and built-up via little hints given in close-ups, but again it descends into a farce. Leo dispatches the killers, and then in the most ludicrous and over-done segment, empties about a dozen clips of his tommy gun into one of the bodies, and it flails around beyond bodily functions as if having an epileptic fit, and in turn empties his own gun all around the room. And the plot too, is beyond comprehension, especially if you are watching for the first time. Tom is a muddled character, even for noir standards, and he chases something that is never fully described or realised within the narrative. So potentially, Tom is a man of his own ethics. He remains loyal even as Leo and him are through. He attempts to make sense of the world and survive, but sometimes jealousy and desire leads him to waver (see how Verna takes off his hat just before they sleep together). But this characterisation comes thick and fast and without any real sense of development. Turturro's sniffling and weaselling performance is fantastic but his character see-saws wildly from one demeanour to another, and does not really justify the shot to his head that was just so earlier causing so much emotional distress. He is physically intimate, but not mentally so, and his motivations are so highly guarded they never really appear, but in a better film the subtext would ring hard and true. Caspar is the most honest of them all. He knows what he wants, and as convincing as his speeches are, thinly veil the ends he will go to get them. And he babies his chubby little son, and slaps him, and then immediately comforts him.</fullReview>

The impressive art direction, the performances, and the violent nature of each scene really drag you deep into the film's setting. Marcia Gay Harden, while not having much of a role in this, gives a stunning performance. Also includes the Coen debut of John Turturro, who does an amazing job for a small role, an underrated actor who will go on to do Barton Fink and O Brother, Where Art Thou.A very unpredictable piece that keeps you on your feet. You feel like you're fighting alongside these characters, and just when you think they'll do something, they do something else.Not one of the Coen's better films, but very interesting nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been on the fence about this one because on the one hand I tend to find the Coen brothers' "genre films" less interesting than their genre-crossing films (admittedly the distinction is vague to non-existent, but I feel like True Grit is Coens doing western, something like Intolerable Cruelty is them doing romcom and this is them doing a gangster film, whereas movies like The Big Lebowski and O Brother, Where Art Thou? find them doing more of their own thing), but on the other hand, they again and again prove that they can master every genre they take on, and perhaps none better than Miller's Crossing's gangster film. Here, the brooding mood and the dryly humorous dialogue really shine, and Gabriel Byrne's amazing character is so hard-boiled and taciturn that he would fit just as well in a noir. He rarely speaks, but when he does, he seems to be little concerned with whether or not his comment will result in a punch in the face; in fact, the way he gets slapped around becomes a running gag of sorts.The opening reference to The Godfather suggests that we're in for a traditional gangster fare, but as often with the Coens, they strike a balance between homage and subversion by exploring themes beyond the surface plot. Here, they use the amoral American prohibition-era setting to delve into questions of morality in a more philosophical way than other gangster films (that might sound a little pretentious but the film is anything but) ? what place it has within the world of crime, and where our moral decisions take us. Ethics is "what separates us from the animals", Johnny Caspar (played by a sleazier-than-ever (perhaps bar Coens' own The Man Who Wasn't There) Jon Polito) speculates, an interesting hypothesis that sheds little light on how the intricate relations of Miller's Crossing will play out, but we do learn that the line of separation is thin and vague. A more straightforward question is raised by Caspar later in the film: "you double-cross once, where's it all end?" Miller's Crossing ends when there's no one left to cross.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First i thought it is gonna be an old boring movie, but i was very surprise and amaze by this movie after all it's Joel Coen, Ethan Coen direction. movie is just gr8 the twist and turns keeps the movie very interesting, the was Tom plays with the mafia bosses. I think the perfect villain is Bernie Bernbaum (John Turturro) the whole story revolves around him. Tom first wants him separated from Eddie Dane so he can get Verna but then circumstances changed, Tom teamed up with other mafia boss Johnny Caspar but it was just Deception. Tom plays both Bosses but he likes Eddie more, all he cares about was Verna. The story line is just gr8 and very strong, i like the way Tom manipulates both bosses all credits goes to story and direction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>pros: Best movie of the Coen Brothers: The film is something of a quintessential gangster movie. He has style, substance and class.| Story about The 30s: A complex tale of love and betrayal among gangsters. | Danny Boy-Tommy Gun-sequence: A symphony for revolvers and machine guns: rough, loud and beautiful. | Actors: Gabriel Byrne and Marcia Gay Harden are memorable leads and superb performances by the supporting talents of Albert Finney, Jon Polito, J. E. Freeman, Steve Buscemi and a weaselly John Turturro. | Cinematography: The film looks sensational. Thanks to Barry Sonnenfeld's autumnal, achingly nostalgic cinematography. | Original Music: One of the greatest soundtracks&#xfeff; of all time! At times romantic, other times jazzy, and for the most part passionate. | Best Song in a Movie: Most passionate and soulful version of the song "Danny Boy" by Frank Patterson i've heard. | One of the best Quotes: Johnny Caspar: I'm talking' about friendship. I'm talking' about character. I'm talking' about - hell. Leo, I ain't embarrassed to use the word - I'm talking' about ethics.cons: nothing</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest, and the best Coen film. Short review with a big spoiler.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall, Miller's Crossing is just a great cinematic experience. Everything from the acting to the writing to the cinematography is downright perfect. Gabriel Byrne, as always, is a treat to watch, and here he is a tongue-in-cheek type of gangster who almost seems to smirk his way through life, but he's tough as well. John Turturro becomes the epitome of what a supporting actor should be by almost stealing the show with a searing performance. Then you have some fantastic other roles played by Marcia Gay Harden, the always charismatic Jon Polito, and Albert Finney to add icing to an already delicious cake. The Coen writing shines here with a brilliant story about a conflicted gangster in the particularly vicious town of Miller's Crossing during the Prohibition era. The brutality is great, and you feel like you're in that same world with Al Capone, and all the other famous gangsters of the first several decades in the 1900s. Highlight of this film for me is definitely the twist when we're waiting to see how Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne) is going to get out of his precarious situation after having let Bernie (John Turturro) go earlier on. It was supremely tense for me, and I could feel Tom's relief after they find some other dead body lying in the woods, as we're left in a similar state of disbelief like he is. Great, great writing; I can't say it enough.I purchased Miller's Crossing years ago simply because I was a fan of the Coen brothers' work, and I had never seen it before then. I do not regret the decision, as each time I watch the film, I'm reminded why the Coens are some of the best filmmakers of their generation. 10 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Coen Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne), an adviser to a Prohibition-era crime boss, tries to keep the peace between warring mobs but gets caught in divided loyalties.What do we have here? The Coen Brothers with a great story, a great-looking film, a pinch of their brand of comedy... films about the underworld are instantly entertaining, just to watch the hoodlums scheming -- often against each other. But you have your bottom shelf and your top shelf. This is top shelf all the way.The Coens know how to use their actors, and they get some of the best performances out of their regulars (Buscemi, Turturro). Heck, even the dialogue writing is impressive; they have worked the slang of the era into the film flawlessly, as if it was the most natural thing in the world. Their versatility is amazing, and I am thrilled to see they have worked their way to the top in Hollywood in recent years... it was long overdue (heck, it was overdue by the time of "Fargo").A great mix of action, comedy and visuals comes in the police raiding scene. Those few precious minutes almost make the entire film worthwhile, if the rest of the film was not already wonderful (which it is).Of course, the film seems to have gained some respect in later years. Time chose "Miller's Crossing" as one of the 100 greatest films made since the inception of the periodical (a strange list, but still an honor). Richard Corliss called it a "noir with a touch so light, the film seems to float on the breeze like the Frisbee of a fedora sailing through the forest." Which I agree with, though I find his choice of phrase a bit odd. (Yes, I know he is referring to the opening shot.) Also, in 2008, the film was nominated for AFI's Top 10 Gangster Films list.Most interestingly, is that the film is partially inspired by Hammett's "Glass Key", the same book that inspired Kurosawa's "Yojimbo" and Sergio Leon's "Fistful of Dollars". While the themes here are much closer to the original Hammett novel, it is interesting to see the parallels in these three (or four) works, and watching the films back to back would bring a whole new outlook on their plots and characters.How the film failed to make back at the box office half of what it cost to make is beyond me... this is truly among the Coens' best work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ambiguity is a great film's trademark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Miller's Crossing is one of my absolute favorites. As many Coen brothers' movies, it is a remake. A quite accurate remake of a 1942 Alan Ladd-flick the Glass Key, a good film on its own based on a Dashiel Hammett's story. This is the kind of material the Coen brothers like to start with to add their unique spin.I just watched the movie about the 18th time and I will not bother you about the plot (I'm not expecting to get a top position, so you probably already know it). Suffice it to say it is complicated, and as always, again I found something new.This time it was the homosexual aspect. There is a strong connotation. Dane for one is in love with Mink, who is enticed by Bernie who takes the advantage on him to place good bets. Bernie is a bisexual, incestuous (by his own confession) manipulator and a most repulsive character but still the protagonist Tommy-boy gives him a break, once. "Look into your heart!" Finallly he kills him, but even then somewhat reluctantly. In the final cut Tom takes a long heartbreaking look... not for Verna, who left the scene already... but for Leo! So what if it was all about Tom being secretly in love with Leo? That would explain some of his moves pretty well, wouldn't it? For instance at some point he had the opportunity of fleeing with Verna which he didn't use. As others have pointed out, it was also a bit unclear why exactly he had to kill Bernie, unless it was a crime of passion. In my humble eighteenth opinion it all makes sense only if Tom's ultimate motive at all times was just to protect Leo's feelings.Not to mention the fact that the single clearly heterosexual character in the whole film, Johny Caspar with his ethos of bringing up a family is somewhat ridiculed. Or the slightly masculine appearance of Verna.Well, this is only one reading of the film and quite possibly wrong. At least if the creators went for a single right purpose. Don't think they did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me first start out by saying that I am a huge Coen Brothers fan. I have yet to see a film of theirs I truly disliked. There have been a few that were not up to par, but the movies weren't horrible. This is my third favorite Coens film. The acting in this is brilliant, Gabriel Byrne is by far the best. The way he plays the character, and the way the Coens have written it, you never know what he'll do next, and it will always surprise you. Jon Polito gives a terrific performance as Johnny Caspar. The scenes with his son are hysterical. But what I think I like most about the film is that is really isn't a gangster movie, it focuses more on emotions and the way people feel for each other. Whether it be Leo's love for Verna, or the double-crossing that happens throughout the movie, and the emotional strains it puts on the characters. This being my first review, it may not sound great, but believe this. You won't be disappointed by this film if you are a fan of film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good gangster film by the Coen brothers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Miller's Crossing is a prohibition era gangster film set in an unnamed North-Eastern American city (properly New York or Boston). The plot of the film was a two leading gangsters are clashing over control of the crime empire in the city and slowly more towards a gang war. In the middle of this was Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne), one of the loyal lieutenants of Leo O'Bannon (Albert Finney) was throw in the middle. At the same time Tom and Leo's relationship was becoming strain because Tom doesn't like Leo's girlfriend, Verna (Marcia Gay Harden). The film was well written and well plotted. The film is a hybrid of films like the Godfather, Goodfellas and Road to Perdition. The film has traits of Coen's brothers writing and direction, such as witty dialogue, humour and dark humour and violence. The film shown how gangsters would have operated during the prohibition, using violence, owning clubs and bribing cops. It also had complex relationships in the film and none of the characters is portrayed as good guys. If you are a fan of the Coen brothers or the gangster genre then this film is worthy to be a part of your DVD collection and even if you're not Miller's Crossing is worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Verbose, darkly comic and visually energetic deconstruction of the gangster genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As Blood Simple and Raising Arizona had previously done with the respective genre of film-noir and the screwball comedy, Miller's Crossing attempts to do with the American gangster film. Here, the Coen's aren't simply attempting to pastiche the style of Hollywood mob films of the 30's and 40's, but rather, create a customised deconstruction of every single narrative contrivance or characteristic prevalent in those films. Naturally, in keeping with the film's they'd made before (and those that they would go on to create throughout the subsequent decade) the various signs, themes and signifiers have been dusted off, stripped away and re-adapted with an equal amount of warm nostalgia and distancing post-modern irony, and then, finally, restructured with those trademark characters and idiosyncrasies that only the Coen brothers can really create.The style of the film is trapped somewhere between the straight (though perhaps stylised in order to meet the requirement of the genre) reality of Blood Simple, with the over-the-top characters and set-pieces of Raising Arizona. On top of this, we also have the gorgeous noir-like cinematography of Barry Sonnenfeld, which draws on genre films of the 30's as well as more recent gangster pictures like The Godfather and Once Upon A Time in America (to quote the two most-obvious reference points). It also seems to predate the slick, handsome style of a film like Road To Perdition, with both films sharing that same colour-scheme of muted browns and autumnal reds, as well as the use of dramatic lighting, which here seems a little more expressionistic than most other mob/noir films of the last few decades. As well as the gorgeous style of both the cinematography and production design, there's also Carter Burwell's fantastic and evocative theme music (which was used in a long running Caffrey's commercial towards the end of the last decade; see also The Hudsucker Proxy) and the standout performances from the excellent, ensemble cast.Like much of the Coen's earlier works, the story, and indeed, the characters, are both wildly over-the-top and the actors seem to be having a great time imitating the Hollywood genre stalwarts of the 30's and 40's. Gabriel Byrne as the laconic Tom is the protagonist, the "man behind the man", who watches over his careless boss Leo, perfectly rendered by a stoic Albert Finney. There's also fine support from seasoned character actors and Coen regulars like J.E Freeman, Jon Polito, Steve Buscemi and a career best John Turturro, all of which adds further layers of narrative tension, drama and strokes of broad, darkly comic humour to an already fantastic film.</fullReview>

GOD! That was to me the best scene of the movie! Kudos to COEN brothers yet again for giving a master piece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Riveting Contemporary Classic Entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Famously pulling from other gangster films, film noir, and Dashiell Hammett novels, the Coens cook up a coldly volatile tale following Gabriel Byrne, a samurai-like Irish mobster who is right hand to stubborn crime boss Albert Finney, who dismisses Byrne's advice to accommodate the ambitious Italian, hilariously animated Jon Polito, and when caught in a gang war Byrne finds that he's more at home looking out for his own interests. Albert Finney was born to play a mob boss. That's just the way he's wired. He has the look and the personality that can take on a character like that. I've never been a very big fan of Gabriel Byrne and can't make myself like his presence, however he never ruins a movie for me, for he was in The Usual Suspects, and here in Miller's Crossing, there's no denying he is good. Miller's Crossing is the sort of film that you cannot stop once you start, because it creates an entire world and seclusively involves all of the actors, camera, dialogue, and tone.The dialogue, for instance, takes you on a long, fun, rhythmic ride, partially mimicking noirs like Double Indemnity or The Big Sleep and detective novels, but really using the familiar earthy style as a springboard to transcend it with its own lightning-quick, exhaustingly sharp semantic understanding throughout the film's created universe. It's just a riveting entertainment, boosted by very small clever touches in the story that turn into powerful blots.The movie's biggest highlight is the uproarious Jon Polito as the Italian boss whose temper and animation are those of cartoon characters that Bugs Bunny would outsmart much to our enjoyment.The score unfortunately guts the atmosphere that is promised by a magnificently stylish scene early on when Finney confronts hit men in a Tommy gun fight in and outside of his house while his Megaphone plays Ol' Danny Boy. But that's not to say it severs you from the movie's tractor beam, which is quite a strong one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best gangster films ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This takes place sometime around the 1920s and 30s. Ganglord Leo (Albert Finney) is having troubles with rival gangster Caspar (Jon Polito). His best friend Tom (Gabriel Byrne) works with him and advises caution in dealing with Caspar. Leo's girlfriend Verna (Marcia Gay Harden) has eyes for Tom and she has a crazy brother named Bernie (John Turturro) who's getting out of control. Got all that? Convoluted but great movie by the Coen brothers (Joel directed and him and Ethan wrote the screenplay). This is an off putting movie to a lot of people. I've heard complaints that it's too dark, too quiet, gloomy and confusing. It is dark and gloomy but that appropriately fits the tone of the movie. It is quiet but that helps when there are bursts of graphic violence--it makes them all that more shocking. Also you need the quiet to figure out what's going on half the time! I loved the movie back in 1990 and still find it impressive today. It's very moody and stylish--they captured the 1920s-30s perfectly. The story is very complex so you have to pay strict attention to follow it. The cinematography is just gorgeous and this is very well-directed with some knock-out sequences. Byrne nicely underplays his role; Finney tears into his part with relish and chews the scenery repeatedly (and fakes an American accent credibly); Harden surprisingly is pretty bad; Polito and Turturro are both good and slimy in supporting roles and Steven Buscemi shines in his one scene. This is a very intricate film and not for casual movie viewing. It challenges the audience and always keeps you guessing and wondering. Next to "The Godfather" this is one of the best gangster films ever made. I give it a 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Millers Crossing is in my opinion one of the best gangster movies of all time and in some way it's even better then most of the similar movies. Why? Because, Coen brothers are trying to show us a interesting story, full of riddles and unexpected plots that forced you to watch this movie again. I like crime dramas and Millers Crossing is really one of the best out there. The story is excellent, very complicated if you're not paying attention all the time, and delivers a lot of twists, shocks and wicked events. The dialog is the most important part of the movie, because there is a lots of it. The characters are talking a lot and some should say that this makes this movie boring, but really it doesn't... the movie is full of clever, intelligent and funny dialogs, so don't expect to be bored to death. The acting is superb; John Turturro is my favorite actor and in this movie he's also great as sick twisted Bernie, Gabriel Bryne is fantastic as cold blooded mafia killer Tom, Marica Gay Harden is pure "famme - fetal" as Bernies sister and Toms lover. Jon Polito is so funny as nervous crime boss Caspar... overall, everything is perfect in this movie. The script, the acting, story... everything.In short; Millers Crossing is probably the best mafia based crime drama of all times.</fullReview>

This movie has got it all: a complex plot that keeps you on the edge of your seat, interesting and well developed characters, and as per usual with the Coen brothers, great dialog. Virtually every line in this movie is dripping with hilarious black humor quotes. But have no fear, that doesn't take away from the seriousness of the movie, it just adds an extra layer of depth.Due to the fact that this movie is so complex and well written it stands up to repeat viewings as well as The Big Lebowski, a later Coens' masterwork.

		<shortDescription>Not Only is it the Best Coen Brother's Movie (Along With No Country for Old Men and Fargo), it is One of the Best and Most Underrated Movies Ever Made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm going to speak plainly. This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I loved every minute of it. It is one of the most underrated movies ever made in comparison to how good it really is. It got the respect of the critics but after one week it kind of just disappeared. An injustice to this movie.Plot: This movie has a very strong plot. I takes about two viewings to really appreciate it. The reason being is that it is hard to follow until the very end when everything comes together. I applaud both Joel and Ethan Coen for their writing, with the excellent dialog, and the major twists that always keep you guessing but never knowing until it finally happens. Is Tommy betraying Leo and joining Johnny Caspar or does he have other plans? I didn't know until the very end and I doubt you will either. Top notch story which will keep you glued to the screen to the very end.Acting: I love Albert Finney, as Leo, the boss of the Irish gang and the boss of the city. He's one of my favorite actors. I also love Marcia Gay Harden, as Leo's fianc, Verna, and John Turturro as Bernie Bernbaum, a bookie who Caspar wants dead but is the brother of Verna. They all did fantastic and gave very believable performances But the performances that really blew me away were from the equally great actors Gabriel Byrne as Tommy, the protagonist, Jon Polito as Johnny Caspar, the Italian boss, and J.E. Freeman as The Dane, the adviser and 2nd in command to Johnny Caspar. Gabriel Byrne gave a performance that like the story always kept you guessing. Combining him and the script is what made this movie. Jon Polito was Johnny Caspar and the Italian boss. J.E. Freeman played the most intelligent guy in the movie along with Tommy. Known only as The Dane he was cold, calculating and ruthless. I also loved the quick scene with Steve Buscemi. Enough Said.Genre/Quality: This is a crime film. But it is unusual in that it deals with the Irish mob. It involves a war between the Irish mob who currently control the town and the Italian mob who want control. One of the great points in this movie is the music. The Coen Bros. have always had great music in their movies, but this may have been the best score I've ever heard in a Coen Bros. movie. The camera work was excellent as was the set and art direction. Mixing these four together made this film a low budget but technical masterpiece. The music always fits the scene and the scene always fits the music.Overall this is probably the most underrated movie I've ever watched. It got praise but not enough. I think that the only recent praise I've seen from a critic was Time Magazine where it was included in their Top 100 Movies of All Time. This is a well deserved position. Forget The Godfather Part 3 for the Best Picture Nomination that year. While a great movie it was not better than Miller's Crossing. Goodfellas deserved Best Picture that year but had it not been made that year, Miller's Crossing would have deserved it. This film is all around spectacular and it's a movie that I can watch over and over and over again and never get tired of it. This film receives my highest praises.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sadly, Miller's Crossing is not universally recognized as such, and to this day remains more of a cult classic. The dialog is razor sharp, fast paced and witty, steeped in quirky language from a bygone era. The acting is stellar, the photography poetic, and the score has a haunting melancholy about it. The sets perfectly portray a prohibition-era city. They create a world you want to jump into and inhabit for a while, even though it's a world full of deceit, treachery, mayhem and murder. The complex plot may require an additional viewing or more to capture all the nuances that make up a terrific story, that at it's core, is less gangster movie and more of an existential meditation. I can think of no other movie with writing as good as this. Simply masterful, it is laced with dark humor and acerbic wit, and once you put all the pieces of the puzzle together, you realize what a tremendous achievement the film really is. The litany of quotable lines is endless. Some of the action scenes are legendary, the actors are all well cast and developed, and do a superb job. My only complaint about this great film is that it had to end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It would be hard to envisage a bad film that includes a cast comprising, amongst others, Gabriel Byrne, Albert Finney, John Turturro, Marcia Gay Hardin and Jon Polito. It is rare to come across a disappointing Coen Brothers film (Intolerable Cruelty, anyone).When you combine the Brothers with this cast you are likely to come up with a masterpiece. Miller's Crossing delivers on this expected outcome in spades.Gabriel Byrne is an actor of rare intelligence, with a smouldering on-screen presence that draws the viewers attention in every scene. He has been woefully treated in Hollywood over the years, with the honourable exception of The Usual Suspects. Here he gives a career highlight performance in a role that allows his outstanding qualities to shine. Tom Reagan is a complex, taciturn, flawed but razor sharp man who is the brains behind Leo's (Albert Finney)Irish mob operation. Byrne is the undoubted star of the show.Finney and Polito (Johnny Casper) are flawless as the feuding hoods. Hardin is wonderfully world weary, strong willed and sexy as Verna trying to protect her brother and juggle her relationships with Tom and Leo.Turturro is magnificently believable as a complete sleaze-ball.The rest of the cast are uniformly excellent particularly J. E. Freeman as Eddie Dane.The plot is complex and draws liberally from Hammett. The script is tight, well written and occasionally hilarious. It is certainly the most consistently well scripted film from the Coens.Barry Sonnenfeld's cinematography is vivid and illuminates the setting beautifully.I could go on ( and on and on...) but, look, just sit back and savour two hours of cinematic genius!</fullReview>

I feel very sorry for the people who see the film as slow or boring ? the script is perfection, the imagery sublime and the casting/acting as dead-on as I have ever seen. Perhaps these dissenters just don't get the whole stoic Irish thing?.there is a world spinning in Gabriel Byrne's eyes in every scene ? if you can't see that ?well?I can't help you.Tom Regan is a perfect tragic hero ? a man who triumphs via his analytical machinations and at the same time loses everything emotionally. I have always read it that he did love Verna; you can see it in Gabriel Byrnes subtle acting and in the willingness of his character to keep seeing her. He is fighting his reason and lying to himself about his level of detachment in having even started the affair with her. Tom sees love as a weakness and sacrifices it. At the end he has won - but really, all he has left is his hat and his cunning.That this came out of writers block on Barton Fink..gotta love the Coens.</fullReview>

Most movies they've made have had great stories, a great entertainment value clubbed with fabulous performances."Miller's Crossing" is no different. In fact, this could be my #1 Coen Brothers' movie if I were to rank them."Miller's Crossing" tells the story of two rival Mob bosses, Leo (Albert Finney) and Johnny Caspar (Jon Polito) and Leo's most trusted adviser, Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne). Things take a turn for the worse when Leo refuses to comply with Caspar about getting rid of one bookie who he feels has been cheating him. The story continues and what follows is a thrilling tale of double-cross and shifting loyalties.Right from the opening sequence ("I'm talking' about friendship...."), in which the brilliant Jon Polito as Johnny Caspar is relating his problem to Leo (Finney), this film makes an impression and it is immediately clear that the rest of the film is going to be just as impressive!The performances are all top-notch, including John Turturro, Gabriel Byrne, Albert Finney, Jon Polito and J.E. Freeman. Marcia Gay Harden is decent as well.On the technical front, cinematography by Barry Sonnenfeld is superb...so is the haunting musical score by Carter Burwell. The film has been edited really well. The dialogs are superb and well-written! And of course, let's not forget Joel Coen's brilliant direction."Miller's Crossing" is a fine gangster film, not to be missed by any respectable movie buff and deserves to be ranked amongst the best gangster movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There are three..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a decade and a half the debate has raged whether "Godfather" or "Goodfellas" is the greatest of the multitude of modern mob movies. My two cents has always been that they are equally good, distinct, works of art but that "Miller's Crossing" belongs in the conversation as well. Released three days after Goodfellas in Sept. '90, MC happens to be the best script of the three, sorry Mario, and while it can't match the sheer verite' thrill of a Deniro Pesci improv, the Hammettesque dialog transports you to another place entirely. Godfather's style is equaled as is the (GASP) cast. Finney-Brando (edge to Brando) Byrne-Pacino(edge Pacino), Keaton-Gay Harden (edge Gay Harden) Polito-Duvall (pick-em), Cazale-Turturro (edge Cazale), Caan-Freeman (edge to Caan).. Close calls most of them and tough to judge since stylistically they're doing very different things. All three bear the voice of the artists that made them. That's what makes them great. All three.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Coen brothers redefine the classic gangster genre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gangsters and dames, good guys and bad guys- it's all here...and more. This film is the Coen brothers' vision of 20's or 30's gangster pulp, and it's excellent!Beyond the obvious choices of gangster swagger and style (which is all here in spades!) is the Coens' incredibly original dialog. They've created one-liners and gangster slang you won't ever hear anywhere else and it works in every instance. The viewer understands exactly what the characters are saying, even though it's never been said quite this way before. The totally original dialog is just a small part of what makes this film truly unique. Most of the scenery is certainly typical of the genre and the Coens' have captured a great look in this film. The wardrobe, the cars, the style...they're all perfect. This is one of Gabriel Byrne's best performances. He smolders and sparks all at once as Tom Reagan, a mob confidant who finds himself between warring gangs trying to smooth things out and stay alive at the same time. John Turturro, a Coen brothers' favorite, plays the weaselly Bernie to perfection- also one of his best films. Crime boss Leo is more than adequately portrayed by the great Albert Finney. In fact, all the performances in this one are spot-on. It's a loving homage to the great gangster films of the 20's and 30's but it's also an incredibly original piece of film. It's almost like an 'alternate reality' mob movie. This one-of-a-kind movie is a classic and should not be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome Plotting; Possibly The Coen's Cleverest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Undoubtedly one of the great contemporary noir exercises, MILLER'S CROSSING is a highly potent and quixotic mix of grossly exaggerated caricatures and subtly underplayed winks. The storyline is remarkably adept at confounding expectations while still playing basically fair with the facts, which is high praise, given the state of modern cinema. The production values are high, the cinematography is solid, the dialogue crackles, the red herrings abound, and there is sex and violence aplenty (including a raging love triangle between the two goodguys and a hooker, no less).And yet...this is still one coldblooded and convoluted Coen Bros. effort. There is not a single character who isn't working all the angles and there's quite a bit to track. Gabriel Byrne in particular is confoundingly inscrutable; we're never quite sure whose side he's on which makes the rooting interests confusing. Albert Finney is winning and likable in a flashy but over the top mafioso role. Marcia Gay Harden also shines as the hooker with a heart of hot lead. Jon Polito is hilarious and completely hamfisted as the man constantly being given "the high hat." In the end, though, John Turturro steals the proceedings with his amazingly slithery and greasy portrayal of the ever adaptable Bernie Bernbaum. Turturro has the benefit of a great part in a great script and he makes the most of it. Still, with all of the triple crosses, it took two viewings for me to figure everything out and I suspect most might benefit from a second look. It's a bit confusing to sort.The overall result is an amazingly well-conceived script. Every main character is integral to the story and the Coen Bros. economy in their utilization and integration has never been better. Cold, dense and complex, MILLER's CROSSING is probably among the best three or four plotted noirs in the last quarter century. If you don't have patience for the cognitive dissonance in movies like MEMENTO or MULHOLLAND DRIVE, you may want to pass on this one. However, if you're a fan of this kind of pulpy noir / crime drama, this movie is a must see and one you'll probably review again shortly thereafter. 9.5 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On my my list of favorite films, Miller's Crossing ranks #1. There's simply no wasted motion. Every scene, every frame counts. All of the Coen brothers films have at least one memorable scene, but Miller's Crossing has several. Plus, the cast is exceptional. Gabriel Byrne turns in his best film performance. John Turturro is excellent. And Albert Finney is one of the best actors in this language. Recently, I came across a film from the 1940's titled The Glass Key starring Alan Ladd and Veronica Lake. Clearly, the Coens based Miller's Crossing on this film. All of the archetype characters are there. The plot is different, but many of the same plot devices are there. It's worth seeing. I caught it on Turner Classic Movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie doesn't quite have the prestige of other gangster films such as the Godfathers or Goodfellas, in many respects, it is just as good. I know it's a bold statement to mention a little-known film like Miller's Crossing with such classics, but it is really a great film. The dialogue is terrific, although some people I know seem to think it's a little cheesy. The story is both wonderfully told and filmed. The most memorable scene from the film, in my opinion, is when Tom is walking Bernie into the woods. Never before have I seen the dilemma of taking a man's life so well portrayed. I would recommend any fan of gangster films, the Coen brothers, or film in general to see this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Miller's Crossing: A reality in three steps</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ethan and Joel Coen gave the world a masterpiece in 1990. This is pure perfection. Perfect casting. And the lead, Gabriel Byrne, did a great performance as the realistic, cynical but yet sympathetic Tom.To be a total masterpiece, you need a good start. I didn't like the start the first time I saw Miller's Crossing, but I changed my mind the second time I saw it. Just the great first picture with the ice falling into the glass ...'Miller's Crossing' is not a common crime-movie. It has elements of film noir and mobster-movies from the first generation (1930's) rather than from the second generation (1970's). The Coen-brothers doesn't try to hide that they have been inspired by the novels of Dashiell Hammett. For the first time, a movie filled with different important characters works perfect. I could understand the complicated relationships between all the people, and because I did, 'Miller's Crossing' became amazing. Everything seems so realistic but yet twisted, which is the greatness with 'Miller's Crossing'. It is so unpredictable and unconventional at the same time. And I also think that Coen by purpose filmed it in colors that looked like the old Technicolor from the 50's.Warning: SPOILERS AHEAD In the end, if you have understand, everything becomes clear in a weird way. Tom lefts Leo, but what does he plan to do? I don't think he becomes a happy man, and it is possible that he is afraid ... of chasing his own hat. Otherwise that is something he already managed to do before the plot in the film started ...Rating: 10 of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Hidden Gem...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For years I have been struck by the fact that various self-styled cinema experts, although they laud the work of the Coen brothers, rarely mention "Miller's Crossing" as a sterling example of the genius of these two men. Similarly, friends and acquaintances of mine might rave about "Fargo" or "The Big Lebowski" but are often completely unaware of what is, in my opinion, the best film the Coen boys have made. I have some thoughts about this odd phenomenon..... 1. "NOBODY KNOWS ANYBODY; NOT THAT WELL ANYWAY..." It's always dicey and a bit pretentious to start throwing around words like "auteur" and "oeuvre", but it seems to me that the leitmotif of the Coen's cinematic output is the possiblity of relationship, the price of intimacy,the longing for closeness in what is often an inimical world, and the need to assert one's own personal idiom in the face of various external demands. So I'm prepared to argue that "Miller's Crossing" is a vast metaphor for these profoundly human concerns that people (by and large) don't like to think about too much, and this accounts for the odd dismissal of "Miller's Crossing" as just another (albeit rather clever) gangster movie. It's rather like saying that "Hamlet" is about this young Danish kid who was somewhat indecisive.Speaking of Shakespeare, many critics have taken the Coens to task for the "snappy dialogue" of "Miller's Crossing", arguing that the quicksilver repartee is unrealistic or somewhat contrived, but repeated viewings of this film (like repeated readings of Shakespeare) reveal the wonderful thematic complexity of the language - the constant reference to "friendship" and the beguiling ambiguities each character in the film attaches to that word. If (as a favorite author of mine argues) Sigmund Freud ultimately posed the question, "What are other people for?", the Coens have artfully rephrased this question in this stunning and complex masterpiece.2. "I DIDN'T ASK FOR THAT, LEO, AND I DON'T NEED IT..." It seems to me that the final scene of "Miller's Crossing" as the camera slowly moves into closeup of Gabriel Byrne's face as he watches Albert Finney slowly walk away from him is one of the most astounding moments in all of cinema. Gabriel Byrn (in a capstone moment to an impeccable performance) wordlessly conveys what we have all felt at one time or another: what we try to grapple with in terms of what we want and what we need; the compromises that can bring health to a relationship or be the death knell of personal integrity. Tom Reagan embodies a kind of existential "Everyman" trying to define his humanity in what can be an incredibly inhuman world. It's by no accident that the script is liberally sprinkled with the word "animal" in a film that demonstrates the difficulties of dealing with the primitive side of ourselves, the complexities of ruthlessness, and the struggle to define one's own humanity. I truly believe that these powerful and somewhat disturbing themes account for the curious aversion to this remarkable film.</fullReview>

Not just a profound version of the gangster film, but also one of the Coen Bros.' best cinematic meditations on their great, central theme of human stupidity and cluelessness. Having dealt with dumb hicks in Texas and Arizona, as well as a fool Jew in Barton Fink, the Coens turn their satirical laser on the Irish (and, to a lesser extent, the Jews) in Miller's Crossing, to even better, more complex effect. Acting doesn't get better than Gabriel Byrne, Albert Finney, John Turturro, Marcia Gay Harden, and the whole superb cast. Brilliant, hilariously dark script. Amazing cinematography.

Beautifully Photographed with an eye for Fashion and Architectural Artistry. An unsurpassed pastiche of gritty Characters delivering a rat-a-tat-tat of violent, verisimilar, colorful, underworld utterances. A Masterpiece.It is still the Coen Brothers crowning jewel to this date. A hypnotic, sleepy, yet hyper-boiled Picture that mesmerizes with both words and pictures. You cannot help but be moved along this highway to Hellish Gangsterdom. The Film is Homage and then some. The Brothers put their modern eyes on the Classic sensibilities of the Genre and what results is a smooth, unrelenting, unabashed Urban utterance of Prohibition speak. The dress up of the Movie is elegant and pristine. The Cinematography vies constantly for attention with the dialog as neither will relinquish its place as nothing less than supreme.This is one of the best Films of the Nineties and could arguably be considered one of the best of all time. Repeated viewings are invited because there is literally so much to take in. Its a simple and bloody Story told with Artistic complexity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Underrated Film Requires Your Attention</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Coen Bros. go gangster. This can't miss, can it? Well, I suppose it could have, but it doesn't. In Miller's Crossing, Joel and Ethan Coen have once again hit one out of the park with their tale of 1930s mobsters doing battle with the police, and each other. Not an easy feat when you consider that another all-time great and much better known Mafia movie, Goodfellas, was released the same year. Not to mention the Untouchables just three years before. But Miller's Crossing demands its own place in the gangster spotlight, featuring Gabriel Byrne as the wise- ass wiseguy who can't quite decide whether he has it better under current bossman Albert Finney, or Finney's rival (and Coen Bros. mainstay), played perfectly by Jon Polito. Other than a mismatched romance between Byrne and love-interest Marcia Gay Harden, this film fires on all cylinders, and will surely creep into your thoughts for days on end. Byrne is effective with his typical nonchalance, but it's the supporting roles, which include John Turturro and Steve Buscemi, that give this film the depth that most attempts at conquering the genre lack. J.E. Freeman practically steals the film as "The Dane," Polito's unforgiving enforcer. Has it been done before? Yes. And arguably, it's been done better. But rarely is it done this well. See for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A visceral experience ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the start of the film, Tom Regan - played to perfection by Gabriel Byrne - stands dutifully behind the swivel chair of Leo O'Brannon (Albert Finney). At the end, Leo walks away from Tom, at Miller's Crossing ...And that is the summum bonum of the entire film ... the slow turning of the tables. The entire experience remains unforgettable even for the unpredictability and ambivalence Byrne brings to his portrayal of Tom Regan, imbuing the character with an underlying menace which pervades his portrayal throughout, so that his query, towards the memorable close of the film, "What heart?" assumes a significance all its own. Though John Turturro's turn as the homosexual Bernie Bernbaum is often touted as the star performance in the film, I myself was not so enthralled by it; the character appears to me to be a bit sketchily drawn, with some gaps remaining to be filled in. And Turturro, in my view, pitches his act just a wee bit overboard, so that it does not remain entirely credible.No ... The film, in my view, belongs to Byrne and Byrne alone. Further, it is also memorable because it essentially abandons the usual bullets-and-bloodshed formula which most gangster epics adopt, and concentrates on the psychological aspect of the whole thing ... it's a fascinating exercise in mindplay and, perhaps for that very reason, is intellectually draining as well.What was going on in Tom's mind at the end of it all? I've yet to figure out the answer ... and that's where 'Miller's Crossing' scores.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Coen brothers TRUE best film of the 90s and perhaps their best overall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yep, you saw my title correctly! I believe MILLER'S CROSSING (1990) to be Joel (director) and Ethan (writer) Coen's real best film of the 1990s, not the monumentally annoying and overrated FARGO or the monumentally annoyingly too-cult-for-it's-own-good THE BIG LEBOWSKI. The "fact-based" FARGO is boredom incarnate disguised as quirky, "original" seriocomedy and stereotypical as all get out! The "too-cool-for-school" LEBOWSKI (anchored by the increasingly annoying Jeff Bridges) is just a plain empty "stoner" movie.But MILLER'S CROSSING is definitely the most interesting of the Coen's 90s films as it is a lot deeper than originally given credit for. I think the stylishness of the film hampered it from being given the recognition it deserved in 1990, especially with more star-powered gangster films like GOODFELLAS, THE GODFATHER PART 3, and DICK TRACY coming out the same year.There is real humanity in MILLER'S CROSSING...start to finish and it is mostly thanks to star Gabriel Byrne (robbed of a Best Actor nomination) as protagonist Tom Reagan, right-hand man to gangster Leo (played superbly by the great Albert Finney), the most powerful in town. Leo's main competition is Johnny Caspar (brilliantly played by Jon Polito, his best ever role), angling to take over as top gangster. Johnny wants Leo to get rid of Bernie Bernbaum (John Turturro in possibly the best performance of his career), a 2-bit hood that double-crossed him, but Leo won't do it, because he is involved with Bernie's sister Verna (played with cold-hearted sex appeal by Marcia Gay Harden in the most lusty performance of her career). In addition to the aforementioned actors, J.E. Freeman is imposing as Caspar's right hand Eddie Dane and Steve Buscemi is a scene-stealer in a cameo role as fast-talking Monk. This has got to be the best cast that the Coen's have ever assembled.The dialogue in MILLER'S CROSSING is top notch, as it skillfully blends old-school noir and modern touches and is delivered with 100% conviction by the actors. This is truly a great screenplay, with a great deal of natural humor. I found myself laughing (for all the right reasons and at all the right times) just because of how true much of it rung. The film of course has a lot of style and several "payoff" scenes, but they just add to it's appeal. The ending is truly magnificent, as it belies the nature of the main character. So, as far as 90s Coen movies goes, as far as I'm concerned, MILLER'S CROSSING is it!</fullReview>

In a Prohibition-era war between Irish and Italian gangs, the aide (Gabriel Byrne) to a shady politician (Albert Finney) tries to broker a peace ? but then he and his employer fall for the same woman.Here are the Coens at the top of their game, with a dark saga, almost operatic in tone, that pays homage to the films of the time it depicts, and also to the stories of Dashell Hammett. The acting is spell-binding, with Byrne and Finney both mesmeric, and the sense of menace the brothers conjure up is squirmingly uncomfortable ? especially when the action reaches that remote part of the woods named in the title, a favoured location for assassinations.</fullReview>

You can't tell me that the rest don't though. It is really restrained but it is just under the surface. Look at Byrne's pained expressions whenever Verna is around or even spoken of. Leo seems to really care for Tom. Frankie and TicTac even have soft sides. Caspar clearly does but since he's "runnin things" he can't show it much. No one can.

There's a sense in which they never did better than this - if FARGO is more satisfying, it's because the story is tauter: MILLER'S CROSSING is perhaps over-elaborate in this respect, but it's so much fun it really doesn't matter.The performances here are a sheer joy. If Gabriel Byrne did anything better, I don't know what it was. Marcia Gay Harden is totally wonderful.It's interesting, the way the Coens don't shy away, in what are essentially comedies, from using pretty graphic violence. Some of the sequences in MILLER'S CROSSING are so over-the-top they're very funny. But I appreciate they won't be to everyone's taste.

		<fullReview>I'll make my comments short and sweet since so many others have managed to express what makes this film a true Noir masterpiece.I've watched it about a dozen times now since its release and I rarely watch even a good film more than once or twice. This one just has so many layers that make it interesting, and I don't think you can catch all the witty rapid-fire dialog after one or two viewings.For me, there is one scene that I rewind and watch over and over again because I think it's truly one of the great cinematic orchestrations ever: I speak of the Albert Finney (Wow, what a consistent pro he is!) scene in which he's home relaxing with a cigar and "Danny Boy" (the definitive Irish-American anthem) playing on the Victrola near his bed. Then all he** breaks loose and we see Finney/Leo dashing under the bed as he senses the gangsters slipping up the stairs, dispatching them quickly after carefully extinguishing the cigar. He then grabs a sheet, swings out the second floor window as the house burns down, grabs the confiscated Tommy gun and dispatches the gangster army one by one with great precision while standing outside in his robe and slippers. Satisfied that he's vanquished the enemy, he tenderly pulls out the cigar from his robe pocket, torches it up again, and proceeds to enjoy the final refrains of Danny Boy as the house burns. Amazing scene! Not only was it incredibly well-constructed by the Coens, but Finney plays it with such a sense of "just another day at the office" that you can't help wanting to light up a cigar of your own to enjoy it with him.I can't get that scene out of my head and have even dreamed about it. A few years ago, I would have rated this film around an 8, but after watching it and the entire, almost-perfect film repeatedly, I have to concede it's become an all-time favorite, and I'd rate it 11 if I could! Great cast (particularly Finney, Byrne, and Harden), great screenplay, fantastic cinematography, and the Coen Brothers are the only team that could have pulled this one off so well: about the best in American film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Huge Inside Joke</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Because the Coen brothers style was relatively unknown when "Miller's Crossing" was released back in 1990, most critics and viewers took it to be just another run of the mill gangster thriller; notable only for the complexity of its story elements. The Dashiell Hammett type story is told from the point of view of Tom (Gabriel Byrne), an adviser to a prohibition era Irish crime boss named Leo (Albert Finney). Although it appears to be a serious (and violent) gangster film with a straightforward story, it is actually a huge inside joke with the Coens showing both reverence and irreverence for their genre. Or more correctly "genres", as there is mixing of 1920-30's gangster movie elements with the film noir style of the 1940-50's. "Miller's Crossing" has a very fabricated production design with the stylized dialogue to match; giving it an unreal feel, a bit like the "Serenity" movie which mixed space and cowboys. Albert Finney and Jon Polito (as Johnny Caspar) are especially good as rival crime bosses. The film can only be truly appreciated by those well acquainted with the film traditions of its two genres, but it still works on a basic gangster picture level.The obvious comparison is "Reservoir Dogs", if only because the Coens and Tarantino are serious students of cinema history and film theory who carefully wove this stuff into their respective films. Yet there is considerable originally within these otherwise derivative works, both self-conscious reverential tributes and biting parodies of film conventions. Both films fit the writer/director classification, where the director is responsible for translating his own vision to the screen. The Coen vision is translated into an expressionistic world, which is superficially convincing as being real. The pseudo realism is self-sustaining because the characters behave as if they believe in it. The repeated inquiry "what's the rumpus" works within the film's reality but would be a strange question to hear today on a sixth grade playground. As the film progresses and these phrases of stylized gangster talk are repeated in service to the plot, the viewer assimilates them and the world of the film becomes increasingly familiar, becoming a world they know. "Miller's Crossing" has a more complex story than "Reservoir Dogs" and more of a comic book quality. Its main exaggeration is the transitional device of having the hero get unrealistically beaten up between virtually every scene change. The sequences with the corrupt mayor and police are also comic book surreal. At the time of release critics and audiences were not familiar with what would become the Coen's comedy trademark, the disconnection between the way their characters should talk and behave (per film convention) and the way the Coen's actually script them. This was less apparent in "Miller's Crossing" than in their later films, coming mainly in the discourses by Leo and Casper on ethics and codes of loyalty, and in the caricature of Casper's fat spoiled son.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a theatrical canvas of film noir and gangster displayed before once eyes. I've seen this movie at least ten times and I still find it intriguing, beautiful and bitter at the same time.It's no secret it's made with clichs and an all to gritty dialouge, and that what's make it beautiful.It's a bootlegger paradise and anyone romantic about the 1920's has got to love this.Lines like: "He's still an artist with the Thompson" and "Maybe we can have tea some day." Is probably lines never said outside the world of movies and old Dashiell Hammet novels but it still works.And it has everything what one can want, Irish, Italian and Jewish gangsters, an imbecile boxer, a femme fatale, a plethora of costume and paraphernalia that just shines in every scene.The humor and the horror is equally present and makes this one for all breeds.SPOILERS: And to add to the classic setting of a fantasy, gangster cityscape it probably contains two of the most sadistic, horrible shoot outs in my regards. Albert Finney turning the Italian hit-man into lead-pie, a killing that never seems to end, suspended in time and than the army of police men turning the Irish Club Erin into Masada acts cayenne to this stew of pleasurable viewing.In my regards one of the best Coen-flicks and gangster movies</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Polished, Philosophical And Staggeringly Beautiful Prohibition Gangsters Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a big city during the Prohibition era, an Irish crime boss is protecting a small time bookie from a rival Italian gangster because he is in love with the bookie's sister. His friend and counsel advises against this stance, which leads to their falling out and the rival gangster taking control and hiring the counsel to work for him. His first assignment is to kill the bookie. This tangled web of different agendas leads ultimately to double-crossing and murder.I've seen tens of thousands of movies, and can count on my fingers the number which were near-perfect. This is one of them. Technically, every aspect of the production is perfect - the period sets and costumes unobtrusively drip with style, Barry Sonnenfeld's photography is incredibly classy and Carter Burwell's rich, spare score, with its haunting flute theme, is one of the most memorable musical motifs ever to grace the screen. The cast are similarly wonderful. Byrne's complex, thoughtful portrayal of a man torn between loyalty to his friend and to himself is as rich a leading man as I can think of in any movie. Finney and Polito as the rival gangsters give two memorable and thoroughly contrasting performances, Harden is terrific as the moll, Turturro chews the scenery with relish as the jumpy bookie and Freeman is incredibly scary as the toughest, meanest gangster in any movie, bar none. But the real genius of this film is the writing and direction by the Coen brothers, which manages to simultaneously break lots of rules and yet deliver a film steeped in genre tradition. Their characters are simply unique. Tom Regan, the "hero", is a one-of-a-kind in modern films; a man who does not know his own nature and is figuring it out as he goes. The dialogue is quite simply the most consistently witty, brilliantly stylised and endlessly quotable I've ever heard in any movie ("I get you smart guy, I know what you are. Straight as a corkscrew. Mr Inside-Outsky. Like a goddamn bolshevik, picking up your orders from Yegg Central."). This is one of those films where every element blends seamlessly into a beautiful work of art. It's a piece of pure poetry both visually and aurally, a fantastic story, a poignant character study, a rich and multi-layered thematic puzzle, and an unforgettable film, made by and for lovers of pure cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Coen Bros masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know of anyone familiar with the Coen brothers that doesn't like at least 1 of their films. Miller's Crossing happens to be my fave of them all, with Raising Arizona coming in a close second.First of all, let's talk about star power: Gabriel Byrne, Marcia Gay Harden, John Turturro, Albert Finney, Steve Buscemi and Jon Polito are a few of the big names in this film, but there are many character actors who help to round things out nicely (Michael Jeter, J.E. Freeman, et al).Albert Finney was absolutely magnificent in this movie: The scene where the mobsters try to put a hit on him with the song, "Danny Boy" blaring in the background has got to be one of the best scenes EVAHHH! Marcia Gay Harden, the babe with a heart of coal, is excellent as the gun moll, who tries to save the life of her brother, played by Turturro. Jon Polito as the Italian mobster does a phenomenal job, and his intensity kicks up the action more than a notch.With beautiful cinematography, an excellent script, and not a slacking actor in the mix, I rated this film a 10.For those of you who like period action/dramas (this movie takes place in the 30s-40s) with a punch, and LOTS of plot twists, this film is for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film just one time on HBO about 14 years ago and I can't really say I remember every detail of the plot...but it is filled with some scenes that will probably stay with me till the day I die.Specifically I mean those scenes that take place in the woods! John Turturro was simply unforgettable in his big march into the woods scene as he perfectly personified every person's ultimate desperation and Gabriel Byrne almost matched his desperation when he had to prove he had actually carried out his orders. I'll never forget this film because no other two scenes have ever caused my heart to pound so loudly in my ears like that!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gangster Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although this film is directed by the Cohen brothers who are well known for comedy such as Raising Arizona and Oh,Brother Where Art Thou, it is violent and quite dark in places. Set in an anonymous American city during prohibition an Irish mob boss has the mayor and chief of police in his pocket but an up and coming Italian decides he's had enough of being second best and starts a war. The power behind the throne (Gabriel Byrne) finds himself in a web of deceit and danger as he plays both sides against the middle and faces a bullet to the head at any given second! This is a brilliant film and I cannot recommend it strongly enough. I just wish I had the ability with written words to fully convey how much I love this movie.

		<shortDescription>Perhaps the Coens' finest hour.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Miller's Crossing" is the third film produced by the brothers Joel and Ethan Coen, two of the modern masters of cinema. The film is based in large part on Dashiell Hammett's classic "The Glass Key", and its various film adaptations. I have always loved a good period piece, and the Coens transport us into the early 1930s, an era of gangsters, dames, and a whole lot of Irish cops. The film melds the 30s gangster movie with the 40s film noir, mixed in with the Coens' trademark dark humour. Gabriel Byrne stars as Tom Regan, the right-hand man to Leo (Albert Finney), who is the kingpin of the mafia in an unnamed city (that looks like Chicago). Both Tom and Leo are in love with Verna (Marcia Gay Harden), which is a problem, because Verna's brother Bernie (John Turturro) is in trouble with local underboss Johnny Caspar (Jon Polito), and his henchman Eddie Dane (J.E. Freeman). Tom wants to sacrifice Bernie, while Leo fears losing Verna. The ensuing mob war threatens to leave no one standing. There are several standout scenes, the best being a classic gun battle between Leo and Caspar's assassins, set to the tune of 'Danny Boy'. Leo proves that he's still an artist with a Thompson sub-machine gun. The entire film oozes style, and is complemented by excellent performances from all involved. Real highlights among the cast are Albert Finney, looking quite convincing as a tough guy, and Gabriel Byrne, as the troubled Tom. I give this excellent film a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Coen Brothers' Finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will start by saying that I have always been a sucker for the finely-executed gangster picture. And until they came out with "Intolerable Cruelty" and "The Ladykillers," I thought the Coen Brothers were an unmatchable team in consistently good and original films. So to call this one of their finest, I don't know, isn't really saying that much.But considering how good their movies have been, is saying something. And in tackling what is perhaps their first out and out genre movie, a 1930s gangster pic on a par with the best of Cagney and Bogart, they have created another masterpiece.With an environment borrowed from Dasheil Hammet's "The Glass Key," and a plot turn borrowed from his "Red Harvest" (also known in the movie world as "Yojimbo," "A Fistfull of Dollars," and "Last Man Standing") they have brought back Prohibition-era gangsterism as less about a plague of heartless gangsters, and more as a game of power, where the one who has respect holds ownership over the police and the mayoral office. Leo O'Bannion (Albert Finney) is the political boss who enjoys this luxury. But he doesn't quite understand it. As he sees things, he is the only one who can hold influence over politicians, and no one can take it from him. His confidante, Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne, in his American debut) knows otherwise. And now Leo's about to throw it all away for a girl.Johnny Caspar (hilariously played by Jon Polito) is an Italian hoodlum whose ethics dictate how he handles his work. He is going to whack Jewish bookie Bernie Baumbaum (the unmatchable John Turturro), and Leo wants to protect Bernie. Bernie is a sexually-ambiguous con man who is also the brother of Leo's mistress, Verna (Marcia Gay Harden, as a tough-but-vulnerable femme fatale). It also turns out Tom is sleeping with Verna, a piece of information he only reveals when Leo, misjudging Caspar's power, initiates a gang war. This, however, puts tom at odds with his best friend, and he makes the most of it, digging himself in so deep he destroys any human emotion that could truly render him heroic. He becomes a classic antihero of the film noir, one of Hammet's godless protagonists who you still root for, because whoever he's up against, you know that person's worse.J.E. Freeman, as Caspar's menacing henchman, Eddie the Dane, turns in a creepy portrayal of a man who is twice as smart as his boss, but still only half as smart as Tom. This movie follows almost every rule of the gangster film, with a few modern additions. When people have sex, the camera moves to the window, keeping with the censorship of the early 1930s, before the Golden Era. You may hear a few g-d's, but nary an f-word is spoken. And while a great portion of the film has little or no violence in it, when machine guns open fire, blood flies. And even more so as we near the end.This is perhaps the beginning of the shock violence that would mark several of the Coen Brothers' later pieces. "Blood Simple" was shocking, but it was also their most serious movie to date, even more serious that "Fargo." "Raising Arizona" had a slapstick quality about it. Here, while we know that these men are all killers, the violence is still a little shocking. Watching Albert Finney shooting a man to death with a Tommy gun, to the tune of "Danny Boy," is in keeping with the pulp irony that would mark "Barton Fink," "Fargo," and "The Man Who Wasn't There," as twisted masterpieces of bizarre humor and ironic drama.</fullReview>

Gabriel Byrne is quite simply better than hes ever being. While John Tuturro's Machiavellian traitor is to put it mildly the best performance in a gangster movie since Pacino's, Michael Corleone. The support from Finney, Polito and Marcia Gay Harden is also top notch. the set pieces, the old style cagney like speak, the atmosphere of the piece and the complete and other cynicism of the film help to make it one of the most underrated and eloquent films of the last twenty years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterpiece of American mythology</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Miller's Crossing has stood as one of my favorite films since the first time I saw it. Some have complained that's it's not a "realistic" gangster film, and they're right. But this is quite intentional on the part of the filmmakers. In this film, the Coen Brothers are not concerned with gangster films as a realistic depiction of organized crime. They are interested in gangster films as a form of American mythology. They are interested in revealing what it is about gangster films that speaks to the American psyche.In the service of this interest, the movie takes place in a world of its own. The city is no particular city; the gangs are no modelled after any real gang. The characters are dense, complex, and eroded by the world they live in. The plot twists like a snake with it's competing interests and deadly repercussions. And the dialogue is a thing of beauty. Simultaneously hard-bitten, lyrical, colorful and economical, almost every line is memorable.I can't think of a thing about this movie that I don't think was done right. I waited forever for it to come out on DVD and got it as soon as it did. If you get the chance, take the time to check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has one of the best screenplays and cinematography compositions in motion picture history. The frames of this film are perfectly composed and lit like art paintings that, in addition to compelling acting are put in logical progression and tell the story almost without the need for words. It is very rare to see such artistically well done movies. Of course it is also pretty funny watching gangsters lamenting about a code of ethics that constitutes the violation of ethical behavior. Other great examples good movies in the same vane with completely different stories are the silent films of Fritz Lang (Siegfried and Metropolis); or more recent examples: Executive Suite (1954), and Doctor No. (1962).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can find no flaw with this film. Every time I see it I find another subtlety, a detail, a turn of the phrase that impresses or amazes me. The plot is serpentine but never convoluted; the dialogue is superb and witty. It is beautifully shot, well-paced, a great experience for the intellect and emotions alike. While violent, it is never gratuitous (I don't know if I would say the same for Fargo). Above all, the performances are grand and fantastic; Gabriel Byrne gives one of the most perfect performances I've ever seen, one of those actors who can convey the most complex emotions by the smallest mannerism or change of expression. Everyone else is nearly as good. Every scene feels like a piece unto itself, yet vitally furthers the plot. It's serious, yet witty and wry, and somehow completely avoids being pretentious. It is the Coens' finest, as far as I am concerned, and one of the finest films ever made. I am eagerly waiting a DVD release; for the impatient, the widescreen laserdisc is quite satisfying. A rare 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What gives Miller's Crossing resonance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom: "I don't hate anyone."Verna: "Or like anyone."Tom Reagan is a smart guy. Easily the smartest gangster in the circles he travels in. He sees all the angles and knows all the right plays to make. But he is a terrible gambler, as his outstanding debts to Lazarre will attest. Why is that? Simple: this is a man who wants to lose. He has brains, but no heart, he knows it, and he can't stand it. How else to explain the actions of a man who could easily run the whole town yet who manages to screw himself out of everything?This, I believe, is what gives Miller's Crossing its resonance for those of us who champion the film to the mostly indifferent masses. The movie itself is a caricature of a gangster film, with a nicely twisting and turning plot, as should be expected from the Coen brothers, but at its center is Tom, tragic in his own mind. How a viewer reacts to this character will determine his or her feelings about the film. If you see some (maybe even too much) of yourself in his cynical nature, his orchestration of events which lead to his being repeatedly beaten and having his life threatened, and culminating in the complete loss of his former stature and the woman he almost loved, can be pretty affecting. On the other hand, the character might understandably leave the viewer cold or even contemptuous of his behavior. In this case, someone might admire some aspects of the film but feel the movie is without a heart, and this person would not be wrong.Regardless of how one feels about Tom's apparent masochism, the film has some undeniably wonderful scenes (which I won't spoil here), first-rate acting all around, and another beautiful score by Carter Burwell, who has yet to disappoint me. And despite the impression someone might get from my analysis of Tom Reagan, this is a movie with sometimes hilarious rapid-fire dialogue, especially whenever Tom is dealing with people he doesn't like. Which is nearly every scene he is in. Like Rick Blaine in Casablanca, Tom Reagan is a master of projecting his cynicism onto others with effortless sarcasm.And also like Rick Blaine, he always does it without a smile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>IMPROVES on Hammett's original...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As only one other comment pointed out (as far as I could see), this is an adaptation of Hammett's _Glass Key_ -- and a big improvement. It's like a dash of cold water on Hammett's ache to be upper-crust, bringing the story back down into the streets where it belongs. Small but important things, like Ned Beaumont/Tom Reagan's obsession with hats as a symbol of control, carry through in strange ways from the book to the movie. Cartoonish as it is, the plot to Miller's Crossing makes much more sense than that of Hammett's novel.This is probably the Coen's best marriage of lyrical, highly-visual storytelling and intelligent script. The Finney character's "Danny Boy" scene is both one of the greatest action scenes and one of the greatest satires of action scenes in American cinema. Be forewarned -- this movie doesn't really happen in a "real" world, so be prepared to see things working with a b-movie logic that lets square-jawed heroes take repeated blows the the jaw from sturdy irish cops. But the visual sense, from the opening close-up of ice cubes and scotch going into a glass through to the final shot of Finney &amp; Byrne walking silently side by side down a perfectly framed lane of trees, is just overwhelming.In the Coen brothers catalog, only Barton Fink comes close.</fullReview>

First, as a straightforward gangster story, and it works perfectly well as such, with endless brilliant scenes and the cutest dialogue you could imagine. Secondly, in a deeper, more philosophical level, it is a reflection on such themes as personal ethics, chance, destiny, and one's command over one's own life. There is a clue to this in the final dialogue between Byrne's and Finney's characters. A truly complex and superior movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish though, possibly, excessively so</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a pleasant film to look at: the palindromic blocking of police raids on first Johnny then Leo's speakeasies; gaping gaps in rooms that close up disproportionately fast when punches start to fly; surreal wide shots for correspondingly staged action.It's a tricky film to follow though. Nothing is made particularly easy for the audience with characters names, intentions and plot twists being sucked into the aesthetic vortex. Style is important but so important that it begins to consume the ebb and flow of the narrative. Making a (period) gangster movie that's off the beaten track is a noble project. The irony is that I felt myself hanging on the few tropes and trappings that they felt they couldn't abandon in order to help orient myself through the first 45 mins.Still, Gabriel Byrne is is a wonderfully noirish, flint-hearted player in this game-of-mirrors episode of ongoing gangster life. Marcia Gay Harden's is an unconventional moll (as intended) and Finney and Turturro both impress by playing types that turn at the drop of a hat. It all needed to be played a little straighter though. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong plot with great dialogue delivered with the Cohen's unique touch (suggestive spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Reagan is the second-in-command to Prohibition-era gang boss Leo O'Bannon and, as such, the brains behind much of the operation. He is also has a gambling addiction, bad luck and, in a very real way, has poor judgement when it comes to women. When rival gangster Johnny Caspar comes to O'Bannon for permission to kill bookmaker Bernie Bernbaum, ill-advised refusal sees a gang war breakout, with O'Bannon suddenly losing all his political support as the corrupt officials see a new master on the rise. Tom has no choice but to tell O'Bannon some home-truths in order to try and save the gang but finds himself out in the cold between the two gangs.No Country for Old Men's success had the knock-on effect of bringing the back catalogue to many film channels in the UK (specifically FilmFour) and took the chance to rewatch some of them again, but the one I was most looking forward to seeing again was Miller's Crossing. It has been pretty much fifteen years since I last saw this film and I did wonder if I thought it was good because that is how I want to remember it or if it genuinely is that good. Happily it turned out not to be my aging memory but rather the fact that the film itself is great. The central plot is a strong gangster twist on the duplicity of Jojimbo but with more of a straightforward flow to it but the material is unmistakably that of the Cohen brothers. The world of these gangsters is ripe with characters and cracking dialogue that makes it such a unique place to be ? but yet also still very much a genre film.The dialogue is endlessly quotable and, although "made up", never sounds out of place ? "the high hat", "take your flunky and dangle" it is all great stuff. The cast react well to both this and the engaging plot, turning in mostly very good performances. Byrne probably hasn't had a better role and he rules the film surprisingly well considering the sheer amount of time he spends being punched. Polito is the real scene stealer though and his quick-tempered Caspar is a great character. He is well supported by the black hearted Dane in Eddie Freeman, who again is a well-written character delivered with gusto. Turturro has a small but important role and delivers a memorable character. Harden, Finney and Buscemi all deliver as you would expect them to but in the mix are also some good turns from Starr, Mancini and others.Miller's Crossing is a great film that feels fresh and unique even nearly twenty years down the road. The plot is strong but it is the dialogue and characters created by the Cohen's and delivered across the board by cast and crew. Not to everyone's taste perhaps but easily one of the all-round best films the Cohen's have done ? and that is a high standard.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this bubbling Coen gangster story, Gabriel Byrne plays heartless hit-man Tom Reagan who struggles to keep the peace between his Irish boss Leo and the rival Italian boss Caspar. In the seedy 1930's prohibition and depression era setting, people are both morally and economically bankrupt ? which means a whole lot of violence, hard-boiled jargon and complex relations that can set off the balance of an uneasy peace.Miller's Crossing successfully combines the gritty gangster tone of 1930's with the glossy noir of the 1940s, creating a film so sprawling with contemporary crime surges that every scene acts as an invitation to soak up the wonderful atmosphere. With all of its hard-edged gangsters and its token femme fatale (Marcia Gay Harden, a dutiful Coen inclusion), it becomes a downright pastiche of the morally corrupt underworld that so many directors have recreated in previous decades. It needs to be said that Coens greatly prefer individual scenes to continuity and as a result, the already dizzying plot becomes more difficult to follow. Names like 'Mink', 'Leo', 'Caspar' and 'Bernie' snapple and crackle like kindling in a fireplace. The audience is left befuddled at the mess but arguably this is a large part of Miller's Crossing's appeal ? it offers a big slice of the era rather than a well-sketched story.The acting, by contrast, is simply top-notch. Gabriel Byrne brings calculating intensity to Tom Reagan, John Turturro goes the extra mile and gives an unspeakably emotive performance as he prays of his life and Albert Finney is amazingly hard-edged and no-nonsense as crime boss Leo. Together the triumvirate of skilled actors ? along with a wide-ranging cast of mandatory Coen actors ? blow smoke, down whisky, gamble, cheat, fix and beat up every chance they get. The dialogue between them is compelling, fluent and viciously quotable with token 30's expressions like "chewing the fat" that form part of the love letter to the depression era.Miller's Crossing in its entirety boasts of no mindblowing appeal and it is mostly talk and little action. Dissecting its individual parts, however, and it becomes a truly great film with scenes so memorable and poignant that it floors you. The warehouse chair fight. Albert Finney defending himself in his own house with a machine gun. John Turturro kneeling and begging for his life. Tom's ominous hat flowing off. This is Coen in his element and if you are even a slight fan of the latter I urge you to see Miller's Crossing.7.5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Miller's Crossing is a popcorn movie for intellectuals. Full of the usual Coen Brother sparkle - colorful dialogue, creative imagery, and otherworldly feel - the intricate plot is also wonderfully constructed. Paced like a mystery, we follow Tom Reagan as he makes a series of odd choices that seem, one by one, to be the wrong choices but ultimately are the right ones. The Coens keep pulling out formulaic tricks, particularly the one where Tom is ALMOST done in for several times before some last minute twist of fate saves his life. This kind of thing can be exasperating for a chronic film-goer, but the way the Coen's have set it up we are so involved in the story that anything incongruous with reality is immaterial- the Coen's have made their own reality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most powerful uses of dialogue in modern film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A rare gem of film that has remained relatively unacknowledged (when compared to more commercially successful Coen brothers films), Miller's Crossing stands alongside The Big Lebowski as the Coen's best film to date and indeed as one of the finest examples of it's genre whether that be the Gangster or Noir genre. This is a film that boasts perfection from all quarters from the acting, the casting, the writing, the directing, the cinematography, to the scoring.Of course, its standout strength is the dialogue which is not only the best example of Coen dialogue but perhaps the most powerful use of dialogue in modern film. The main thrust of the film's quick and steady pace comes from the lyrical and relentless back and forth between the film's characters (and in typical Noir fashion, this is usually between Tom and someone else).As is the case in most films, the level of the writing raises the level of the acting. Each of the actors' performances are first rate and indeed there are many career bests given here. When I lament the fact that the likes of Pachino and De Niro don't consistently produce the quality they did in the 70's and early 80's, I remind myself that we just don't have the quality of writing as we did then and while films have become better in other respects they've never quite reached the same heights from the point of view of the writing. Joel and Ethan Coen are amongst a relatively small number of contemporary writers who are consistently working on that level and Miller's Crossing is the perfect example of great actors being fueled by great writing. Finney and Polita clearly revel in the expounding of their luscious lines while J.E. Freeman simply burns a whole in the screen. Of course, this is Byrne's film from start to finish and he carries it well with a distinct and unique brand of cool as he delivers immortal line after immortal line with pure gusto.Those who claim the violence in this film is gratuitous need to re-watch. For example, in the most violent scene involving Casper and the Dane, the violence is used to illustrate the complex aspects to Casper's character (e.g., his paternal attitude towards his 'boys' and his sociopathic attitude towards killing; his adherence to ethics and his vengeance against those who betray theirs). On top of that, speaking from a technical point of view, violence in Coen films is typically choreographed into the action scenes in a relatively artistic manner where it is used as a counterpoint or visual exclamation mark to augment and punctuate the action and/or tension of a scene. Nowhere is this more true than in Miller's Crossing a film that boasts some of the Coens most memorable and best choreographed action scenes.As for the symbolism of the hat and the dream sequence where Tom must chase his, I heard before that the Coens claim there was none. This is difficult to believe as the film is very much about thinking oneself out of problems and not loosing one's head and Tom himself explicitly equates thinking to hats during the film. But that's the great thing about symbolism in clever films - there's a lot one can make of even a hat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark comedy, rating appears a bit too high.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title refers to a particular suburb Chicago spot, Miller's Crossing, where gang members often drive the victim to be marched into the woods then whacked. Somewhat like "Pulp Fiction", this film is not to be taken seriously. This is evident from the first scene, where the mobster laments that there isn't enough honesty and integrity anymore, because he can't set up a legitimate "fixed" fight without someone else telling about it, which results in too much betting, and by the time the fight is thrown his odds have gone unfavorable. How can he make an honest crooked living? It is also evident in a couple of the gunfights where machine guns never run out of bullets and the good guy never gets hit. The film is about cross, double-cross, and triple-cross, the mob with the police in their pockets. Interesting to watch, but in the end not much to be taken away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was slightly better than average. Not bad but not really that good. I can't believe it has a rating of 8 or greater. I could see justification for that high of a rating if the ending was a lot better, and I mean a lot better. As far as closure, which is necessary for any good story, there is none. I was left with no idea of who Tom was and why he did everything he did. Didn't even know whether he had a goal from the beginning at all. In fact this whole fact makes this movie horrible. The only reason why I gave it a 6 was because it could have been a good movie if they had just had a real ending. Tom had absolutely no personality that one could connect to in a certain way. He protects this mob boss and then he decieves him to protect another for no given reason at all. It just doesn't make sense whatsoever. The only reason I watched this movie is because of the high user rating of it. Just goes to show you how peoples taste differ I guess, except for the fact that there is no discernible point to this movie at all, and I don't know one of my friends who would like this movie. I never have commented on a movie on this site but I couldn't let this go. Thanks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's with the high rating?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found it very hard to take 'Miller's Crossing' as a serious film. I didn't see it as a serious piece...I don't think this film is supposed to be taken seriously. With all the comedic, and frankly idiotic/illogical occurences (i.e. Leo's shootout at his house), there is no way I could even MENTION this movie along with other gangster film classics such as 'The Godfather' and 'Goodfellas'. Hell, Road to Perdition was hardly a gangster film and even THAT is better than this! The screenplay was razor sharp, very witty and entertaining; there was also a good share of action, but to say that this is the greatest gangster film of all time is just asinine! The film was actually entertaining somewhat; the 'Casper' was excellent. But having Tom be beaten up throughout the film, was very annoying and took a lot away from the movie. As said before, the Leo shootout scene was so unrealistic, to the point there was no way I could take the movie seriously. I was REALLY fooled by the IMDb rating, for this to be on the Top 250 list is really overdoing it. This movie in my opinion is NOT that good to be on that list My assessment is that 'Miller's Crossing' is a satire/parody of gangster movies that tries to be serious at the same time....but ultimately fails. To even mention this with the classic gangster films is an insult to those films. ** out of **** stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Contrary to what Blackavaar says in his comment (opposing what Pete the Geek said in his comment)... this film may not just be a comedy, but it is not a pure crime flick either. Jon Polito's character for instance: this is not a comedy character? Gettaheyouttahey! And there are plenty of other comedy characters here, as well, as there also are some rather funny scenes (check the confrontation in the warehouse, the interactions between Johnny Caspar and his son). I'm not sure what the Coens intended this to be (the only genres here on IMDb are crime, drama and thriller), but perhaps they had some 'black comedy' in mind, also.Of course, the mixing of comedy with the crime (and drama) genre doesn't have to be a problem, but for me, it just doesn't work here. In that respect, this a rare Coens film, because it is actually their 'worst'... though it still is a more than enjoyable flick, let's call it an over the top ode to the good ol' crime and film noir genre. And there where the drama element peaks - Bernie on his knees in the woods, pleading for dear life with Tom, and later when they return to the woods again, and Tom is just 'sick' of it, and, finally, when Tom decides he has no heart left for Bernie) - the film is simply brilliant. It really makes me wish they hadn't put in those extravagant comedy elements.Other than that, 'Miller's...' shows some terrific acting, some tasteful costumes and settings (although a couple of trees steal and a hat the show), and some clever and funny dialogues - unfortunately, a great amount of others didn't work for me at all.A good 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great script from the Coens in this prohibition drama...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This DVD was lent to me some time ago and I decided it's time to get it returned? but I thought I'd better watch it first! I quite like the Coens' work, but this is one that has escaped me thus far, hence the borrowing of said DVD. It's very definitely a Coen brothers script with some excellent dialogue and plenty of plot twists. I'll give you my thoughts later, but here's a brief summary first (summary haters and those that don't wish to know anything about the plot please take that guy out into the woods &amp; deal with him while I write the next paragraph).Tom Reagan is adviser to Leo, the mob boss who runs things around here. Rival boss, Johnny Caspar wants Leo to give him permission to have Bernie Bernbaum killed because he's making problems for his gambling syndicate. Now Bernie's sister, Verna is seeing Leo and so Leo is reluctant to upset the apple cart (if you know what I mean). Also, Verna is seeing Tom on the side and if Leo ever found out about that there was gonna be some big trouble for him. Add to this the fact that, Tom is also a bit of a gambler and has run up quite a debt, but insists on paying it off without any help. So, one day Casper makes Tom an offer and, as you can probably guess, this is where all the fun starts? I hope you understand that lot! I'm gonna leave it there so as not to enrage the spoiler police too much.As I said at the beginning, this film has a truly excellent script with some great dialogue and clever plot twists. It's a very well made film with a very appropriate soundtrack (you'll know what I mean if you've seen it). All the main cast put in very good performances; Gabriel Byrne as Tom Regan, Marcia Gay Harden as Verna, John Turturro as Bernie Bernbaum, Jon Polito I particularly liked as Johnny Caspar, Albert Finney as Leo and it was nice to see a cameo for Steve Buscemi as Mink.Although it has a great script, I found it didn't grab my attention the way other Coen brothers films have. Or maybe films have been made since that do what this does, but better. I don't quite know what it is, but this one seems to lack the punch that other Coen brothers films have. I felt that, although he is very good, Gabriel Byrne seems very subdued all the way through and this appears out of character for someone in his position. But aside from that, it's well worth seeing? Recommended (if only for Albert Finney wielding a Thompson Machine Gun to great effect).My score: 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated Gangster Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Coen brothers are known as quality filmmakers and while this movie is one of their best it failed miserably in the box office when it first came out but has now become a cult classic.Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne in his best performance) is a consiliere (trusted adviser) who gets into a heap of trouble when his boss Leo (Albert Finney) decides to protect shyster Bernie Bernbaum (John Torturro) from up and coming Italian mob boss Johnny Caspar (Tom Pollito). You see, Leo is in love with Bernie's sister Verna (Marcia Gay Harden) whom Tom happens to be having an affair with.The plot is convoluted and complex as Tom is in a love triangle but also ends up having to take on another love triangle, this time a discreet homosexual one concerning Bernie, a fast-talking bookie named Mink (Steve Buscemi) and Johnny's top enforcer, The Dane (JE Freeman). It's a clash of idealism versus reality as Tom outwits them all, somehow staying above the fray as violence and chaos swirls all around him.Every character is unique in which they have their own quirks and vices. Tom is far from perfect due to his gambling problem and yet he is superior to all the others due to the fact that he is a realist while everybody else is an idealist, meaning they tend to trust their allies and lovers too much while Tom knows the evil that lurks in the hearts of all men (and women). In the end, it is Tom who is the most ruthless of them all because of his cynicism.If you like period drama, complex plot machinations and gangsters, this is a must see film. Don't be afraid if you don't understand it all, it takes several viewings for most people to get it.</fullReview>

This movie is one of their less funny movies (even though it still has the typical absurd humor). It's nonetheless one of their greatest movies. It's pretty much flawless. Great story, intelligent conversations (might have been too artificial sometimes), great atmosphere, great music, great characters and perfectly fitting actors.****Spoileralert****Still, I am not sure if I want to rate this movie with 9 or 10 points. It's somewhere in between for me. While everything in this movie was pretty much perfect, I was missing some sort of sympathetic figure. There was no single good guy in this movie. It shouldn't make a movie worse, but it's sort of hard for me to evoke feelings of tense excitement if I barely care for the actors. This movie is far from good and evil. If you like that, this movie might become one of your favorite. If not, you might have a foul aftertaste in your mouth after watching this one.****Spoileralert ending****I have decided to rate this movie with 9 points. Simply because I find that there are better Coen Brothers movies out there. Especially more wicked ones.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Puzzle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This one is a puzzle. The movie is admittedly stylish and a great physical production. It features smart dialogue, occasional humor (sometimes broad, sometimes not), and fine performances from Marcia Gay Harden, Albert Finney, and Gabriel Byrne. It pays homage to the gangster picture of the 1930's and 1940's and to the pulp fiction of Dashiel Hammett, and gangsters, like grifters, are as American as cherry pie. So far, so good. On the other hand, the plot, with its crosses and double-crosses and double-double-crosses, is virtually undiagrammable. No wonder the Coens found completing their script so difficult. Is "Miller's Crossing," as a perceptive reviewer suggests, really a meditation on honor, friendship, and ethics? Is it, as another reviewer asserts, really about "chasing your own hat," that is, about seeking and finding independence? From a mob boss? From a two-timing moll? Without giving up killing? Maybe so, but it's hard to take pleasure in such rarefied notions when the storyline here is so tangled. "Miller's Crossing," with its production values, holds the viewer's attention from beginning to end, all right, but the plot is driven by the rapidly changing machinations of Tom Reagan (Byrne), the lieutenant to Irish mob boss Leo O'Bannon (Finney). Those machinations, springing from the mind of a thug and not of a Nobel Prize winner or Wall Street derivatives specialist, are intended to be realistic and plausible, and -- more than that -- convincing to other thugs, and they plainly aren't. 7.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A strange little film. Once again the Coen Brothers want to make an anti-genre film. This time they attack the genre of the gangster mafia in an eastern city that does not need a name but has to be big during prohibition. That mafia is working in clubs with bars and gambling tables, and in racketeering for protection. Two rival gangs and one chap taken in between Irish and Italian bosses or would-like-to-be-sole bosses. He has an affair with the girl friend of the Irish man and he shifts to the other side but then he is demanded to execute the brother of the woman, which he fakes and then this brother turns against him and he finally manages, after many sessions of punching and upper cutting that leave him every time healthy and strong, to trick and trap the brother who belongs to the Irish gang and the Italian boss into confronting each other at his own place and the brother kills the Italian boss and our man kills the brother and disguises the two deaths in a mutual gun fight and killing. He is back with his first boss the surviving Irish man who is going to marry the woman of before and forgives our man. But this one refuses that forgiveness that he has not asked and walks away. We will note a slight touch of Jewishness on that Irish man for the funeral of the brother. The cops in that prohibition situation are providing the street entertainment and the cleaning sessions in some clubs that are so wide open that a whole brigade of cops could run in without breaking the slightest piece of glass. But the best part remains the machine gun fights between the Irish boss and the hit men sent to assassinate him by the competitor. The chandelier turns into a "windmill" that is in fact a "bullet mill" and it is funny though it lasts only a second. Overkill is the motto and so many bullets and noise for just nothing is like using the space shuttle to go buy your daily bread at the next block bakery.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 12 Crteil, CEGID</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Miller's Crossing" is a prohibition-era gangster film from the Coen brothers. In it, a mob war erupts when an Irish crime boss foolishly takes a stand to protect his lover's brother. It soon becomes apparent that just about everybody has an angle to play and it's up to the one man who sees all of the angles to try to keep the peace.The cast is excellent. In my mind the standout performance comes from Coen brothers mainstay Jon Polito, who plays an Italian crime boss who's sick of getting 'the high hat'. There's also quality work here from Gabriel Byrne, Albert Finney, Marcia Gay Harden, John Turturro &amp; J.E. Freeman.The direction is well-handled, as you might expect from the Coen brothers, and the film also features a memorable score from Carter Burwell. The script, co-authored by the Coen brothers, is filled to the brim with snappy dialogue and has no trouble navigating the many twists in the tale without losing the viewer along the way.Given the film's polish, along with the fine script and top-drawer acting, I'm very surprised that it went entirely unnoticed during awards season. Luckily, the reputation that the Coen brothers have built since then has ensured that this worthwhile film will have a devoted audience for years to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A mobster movie has to be different to get attention. It has to show some aspect that other movie's don't, or else it's just your average mob movie. "Miller's Crossing" takes from all the mobster and gangster films, along with other movies, but at the same time it's so original. The cinematography is beautiful, and the characters are uniquely molded, as is the plot. This is one of the Coen's best films, and one of the better mobster movies ever released.Two gangs are fighting, and Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne) is right in the middle. He first works for Leo (Albert Finney) and his Irish mob, but after sleeping with his lady Verna (Marcia Gay Harden) he is kicked out. He then goes to Johnny Caspar (John Polito), the Italian crime boss. Tom's first order of business is to kill bookie, Bernie (John Turturro). Bernie is the brother of Verna, who Tom has fallen for. In the end, what we have is a tale of finding compassion, and having morals (no matter how backwards they are).The highlight of every Coen brothers film is the lovely camera work. They always have good acting, an original and darkly funny story, but on top of everything, the camera work always stands out. Each shot is set up as perfectly as it could be and this is a great looking film.Gabriel Byrne is a very good lead, and my only gripe is sometimes I couldn't decipher what he was saying beneath that thick Irish accent. The accent was necessary for the character, so it's not even really a gripe. Albert Finney didn't have a whole lot of screen time, but he grabbed all he could from what he does have. Whoever knew a scene with Finney shooting a nobody with a tommy gun could be so dramatic. John Polito is menacing. John Turturro is excellent as a coward posing as a slick tough guy. Marcia Gay Harden gives a wonderfully reserved performance. Wonderful performances all around.This is the Coen brother's first film to be both humorous and dramatic. The drama is plentiful as is the suspense, even with characters who weren't created to be cared about. When Tom stands in the forest deciding whether or not to shoot Bernie, my heart was racing, and I could have cared less about Bernie. The cops who give into the mob's every whim and tip their hats to Tom are humorous. This is more action and drama, but there is still a perfect amount of humor thrown in.Overall, this is an excellent mob movie, with inspired performances, an original plot, nice looking cinematography and typical Coen brilliance found everywhere.My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 115 mins. R for violence.</fullReview>

There isn't much to say about the actors, top class names like Byrne, Finney, Turturro, Gay Harden, Buscemi and in here great Polito, speak for themselves just like brilliant script from Coen's. Also music is one of the reasons why I gave this movie excellent grade; version of 'Danny Boy' is just outstanding!!! To compare this movie with other gangster movies is all right but not to untouchable "The Godfather". Although I have a great sympathy to one of the best Coen brothers movies ever, I must also say that it doesn't touches sky high Coppola's "The Godfather". But "Miller's Crossing" is a movie that everyone should view and judge for themselves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, this is one of those rare gems of a movie that everyone should see, and I have little to add to the several excellent reviews of it already given here ? but let me just say I think it is simply a flawless film in every respect: story, camera work, acting, milieu, dialogue, music, rhythm, mood ? you can watch it any number of times and still (like a good piece of music, or like some other of the Coen brothers's movies) derive even more pleasure from it. And even so, once you think you've penetrated the multi-layered cinematographic "surface" of this story, you will find that it's actually very far from an allegedly postmodern rip-off of gangster movies and novels from the 40's (although it uses Hammett in particular to great effect): below the slick surface there's an intricate psychological ? indeed a psychoanalytical drama in disguise ? being played out, the complexities of which may take you the better part of your life to work out. What is intriguing about it, not least, is the way the plot seems impossible to work out, at least from Tom Reagan's point of view: as he asks to his boss Leo, at the end, "do you always know why you do things"? Leo says sure he does ? but Tom, obviously, just like this viewer remains very unsure of why he acts as he does?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great gangster movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most gangster movies put the violence and the sinful or unlawful behaviour of the characters in the foreground, making them, at best, culturally interesting. This one presents the reasoning and clockwork behind the criminal organisations during the prohibition period and puts a modern character in lead.Basic plot is that a counselor to a gangster is playing things so that they fall how he wants them, in a terrible game of chess, where people are pieces and they die. The best part is that in this game of chess, he is merely a pawn, but he topples kings.Bottom line: this film was destined to be a classic. It is all about the brains and keeping it cool in the face of chance and brute force. Gabriel Byrne makes a great role as does, as expected, John Turturo. Without it being an overly complex movie, you need to be in a cinema mood to really enjoy it to the fullest.</fullReview>

In one of the seedier parts of an altogether pretty seedy prohibition-era New Orleans, a nameless boy stumbles upon what seems to be a passed-out drunk propped up against the wall in a back alley. In an intricate interplay of shots and cuts, the dog makes the boy realize that the man he thought was drunk is in fact dead. The scene has no dialog, but displays and evokes a wealth of emotions that has since become one of the Coen brothers' hallmarks. At the same time, it touches on their philosophical trademark theme of perception and reality. In this respect, the alley scene is a variation of the movie's major mystery, a murder that may or may not be what it seems, depending on how (and when) you look at it. - Also watch out for Frances McDormand's nearly silent, uncredited appearance as the mayor's personal assistant in one of the final scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A unique gangster film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Widely regarded as the Coens' best film alongside Fargo, Miller's Crossing is a quite singular take on the gangster genre, worth contrasting to the more "classic" Goodfellas: ostensibly an homage to Dashiell Hammett, it is in fact a pure Coen brothers' movie (though not as pure as Fargo), replete as it is with their trademark sharp writing, cold but gorgeous visuals and superb performances.The incredibly complex screenplay revolves around a Jewish bookie, Bernie Bernbaum (John Turturro, in his first Coen film). Apparently, he has angered an Italian boss, Johnny Caspar (Jon Polito), a volatile fella who wants him dead, plain and simple. However, Irish leader Leo O' Bannion (Albert Finney) disagrees, mainly because Bernie's sister Verna (Marcia Gay Harden) is his mistress. And in between these two stands Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne), a taciturn, calculating hit-man who has an agenda of his own, derived from a bizarre moral code and a tendency to favor rationality over violence. The full extent of his involvement is too complicated to explain - the fact that he's sleeping with Verna and has huge gambling debts is just the tip of the iceberg.The Coens' detractors often accuse them of creating beautifully framed yet hollow pictures, their characters being ice-cold constructions instead of human beings. Miller's Crossing proves, perhaps better than any other film, that statement's lack of veracity: it's the characters and their interactions that carry the narrative. In fact, more often than not they're what keeps the viewer alert in spite of the labyrinthine plot. Exactly who is double-crossing who and why might not seem clear at first, but seeing those people talk and act in a universe that gets more violent by the minute gives the film that special something that separates it from lesser crime movies.Byrne, being the one who has to guide us through the entire feature, is cold and seemingly merciless, but beneath the icy facade lies a warmth that makes his performance all the more effective. Finney plays to similar strengths, giving the impression of his godfather being an old fool and then showing he is actually the most dangerous person around. Polito, Harden and J.E. Freeman (Eddie Dane) are asked to play their roles (edgy boss, femme fatale and psychotic henchman respectively) by the book and do so while still adding that peculiar Coen ingredient, and Steve Buscemi's one-scene appearance provides some fun amongst the mayhem. And then there's Turturro, the man without whom the movie would, in a way, fall flat: his character is the MacGuffin that sets everything in motion, an opportunistic, unreliable scumbag to whom the actor gives life with a subtle, creepy intensity. Perhaps he's the reason the Coens are accused of coldness: the critics saw how chilly Bernie was in his actions and found it apt to brand everyone involved with the same adjective. How wrong were they: Miller's Crossing is a piece of cinema that will mesmerize, move and terrify in equal measure, a gangster picture that diverts from conventions by sticking to them. A masterwork.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The proof of the excellent Coen Brothers work in every genre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here we are, a gangsters movie by the Coen Brothers?? Yep, At first look, It seems strange from the Coen Brothers to do this kind of movie. But every films genre that the Coen Brothers make It turns into a gold work.First: The casting, I don't very like Gabriel Byrne's acting but this time he surprised me, in the role of Tom Reagan he made the difference. Jon Polito, John Turturro (in the role of a Jewish gangster was good as usually), J.E Freeman, Steve Buscemi(It's almost a cameo, he appeared in one scene and die again in this film) and finally the great Albert Finney plays in this film too. He's "the guest-star" of this film, he's pretty terrific in the role of Leo.The Story : I was a little disappointed (just a little) by the script I was expected a more complex story, but The Coen Brothers I think have a best written with Comedy Script even if there are funny dialogues. Some scenes remind me some gangsters films, The Coens certainly wanted to make a homage of the classic gangsters films.The directing is again excellent with this time more poetic and slowly shots (The "hat shot" is beautiful) to show the drama feeling of the film cause 70% part of the film is drama, the other 30% are Action and Comedy situations.So, to resume It's again an excellent film By the Coens. You're genius guys!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved it when I saw it in 1990, and repeated viewings have only increased my appreciation for this astonishing film. While "Fargo" may be the Coens' most accessible and darkly funny movie, "Miller's Crossing" is, in my humble view, their very best. To say that MC is a gangster movie is like saying that "Harvey" is a movie about rabbits, however large they may be.Superlative writing, acting and directing. Not one false note. Each character has motivations that are revealed gradually, through their words or through their actions or through their eyes (hidden by hats or not). Gabrielle Byrne has never been better, Marcia Gay Hardin terrific, and Albert Finney? Well, let's just say that he's absolutely convincing whether he's playing a mob boss or a ladies room attendant.Of course, if, like Leo, you "don't like to think," you probably won't care for this movie. But if you enjoy complexity of idea and character motivation, beautiful cinematography, set and costume design, score, and mood, if you liked movies like "Chinatown" or "Donnie Darko" you should check this one out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So much has been said of this film already. Yes, I am a Coen fan. Yes, this is the best Movie of all time. But to merely consider it a Gangster Pic - to then cast a thought (or even comparison - heaven forbid) back to the Godfathers or Goodfellas does not give this film its just desserts. Miller's is meticulous in detail - from design through to the lip-dripping dialogue. It is such an obvious labour of love for all involved - the casting of Gabriel Byrne, Albert Finney, Jon Polito, John Turturro all perfect; like classical theatre, but even better. The music by Carter Burwell brings tears to my ears!?! Shakespeare could not have written a better study of conniving doublecross and tragedy!Go COEN go!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a great fan of the Coen brothers; ever since I saw "Blood Simple", I've eagerly awaited the release of each of their movies on home video (I'm not up to the sticky floors and noisy kids at our local cineplex). I've had a couple of disappointments ("Barton Fink" and, especially, "The Big Lebowski"), but there's no accounting for personal taste. In my opinion, "Fargo" has been their crowning accomplishment to date, but "Miller's Crossing" runs a close second. Be forewarned, though, this is NOT another "Raising Arizona"; if you liked "Casino" and "Goodfellas", you'll probably love "Miller's Crossing"; if you found either of them heavy going, you might want to settle for a rerun of "The Usual Suspects".</fullReview>

But to couple this with such immense depth and complexity of plot and character is astounding. Add to this Barry Sonnenfeld's dazzling cinematography, a memorable soundtrack, and the Coen's penchant for constructing one magical movie moment after another, and you have as close to perfection as film-making gets.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Miller's Crossing is a movie that I first viewed early in High School. At the time, I was an incompetent movie-watcher. I didn't pay much attention to the film and, as a result didn't "get" much of it. When I watched it again, years later, the movie really seemed to come to life. Even though I've now watched this film well over a dozen times, I still catch new details with each additional viewing. For instance, how many people have noticed the creaking trees from Miller's Crossing in the last scene with Tom and Bernie outside of Tom's apartment? At first I simply thought it was the floorboards creaking. If you watch and listen carefully, you'll notice that it's not in sync with Tom or Bernie walking -- or even moving. How many people have noticed the silver ring on Tom's right hand? It's an Irish wedding band, turned to signify that his heart belongs to another. To whom does it belong? Verna? Leo?Anyway, as almost everyone here has said, this is a great film with a lot of great performances and cameos. I know I'll never forget such memorable characters as Tom, Bernie, Verna, Leo, The Dane, Jonny, Tic-Tac, Frankie, Terry, Mink, Drop Johnson, and Tad.</fullReview>

Now *that's* acting.)."Miller's Crossing" rivals the "Godfather" movies in its portrayal of organized crime as a ruthless, godless enterprise; it doesn't quite have the scope or grandeur of Coppola's classics, but no sequence in the Corleone family saga can match the assassination attempt on Leo (which, by the way, is best served with the surround sound cranked).They've made funnier, more "enjoyable" films, but few of the Coens other efforts before or since have equaled "Miller's Crossing" in its balance of style and content.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MILLER'S CROSSING is an ambitious outing from the Coen Brothers, considering their previous credits included a low-budget Noir (BLOOD SIMPLE) and a hysterically ridiculous comedy (RAISING ARIZONA). This film truly put them on the map of fans and critics alike on a broad scale. They also did an ingenious job of casting by bringing the always interesting Albert Finney on to play the head of the Irish mob, Leo. MILLER'S CROSSING is another mob movie from 1990, the year of the mob come-back with GOODFELLAS and THE GRIFTERS. This one is shot in beautiful period style (1930's) and has some of the best nicknames of mafia henchmen in the history of the genre. Sometimes, the nicknames can lead to confusion as to who the characters are discussing or how the plot is evolving. When you have a "Caspar" and the "Dane" mixing with "Leo", "Tic-Tac", and "Mink", you tend to lose some dialogue along the way. However, the Coens have created a wonderfully original world and use a blowing hat to symbolize the film's most important plot elements.Barry Sonnenfeld is back to shoot with the Coens and adds to his ever-growing list of good-looking films. It is no wonder he became a talented director later on with MEN IN BLACK and GET SHORTY. If you notice, whenever a character is not wearing their always treasured hat, they are at their most vulnerable. John Turturro, as the sad-sack gambler "Bernie", pleads for his life in the woods, bloody and hatless. Miller's Crossing is where the mobsters take their unwanted prey and properly dispose of them. Some very suspenseful scenes occur in the innocent greenlands of these woods. At one point, Gabriel Byrne (in a crass, wiseguy role) is walking towards possible doom at the Crossing when he looks up at the trees. They signify nature and how disastrous and evil events can happen under the most simplest pieces of life.A blowing hat is the keystone of the film's title sequence. It blows innocently away and, in essence, leads us into the underworld the Coens have created. An awesome shoot-out scene with Finney is incredibly well-done. It all happens so fast you long for it to go on. Finney does some pretty acrobatic things and appears impenetrable as he just follows his would-be assassins with a blaring tommy-gun. Many shocking scenes of violence play out and pay off by film's end, a nod towards the famous ending of THE THIRD MAN. Joseph Cotten had his hat on when he lost out on life and simply tosses his cigarette in disgust in THIRD MAN. MILLER'S CROSSING is more of a character study of the Gabriel Byrne character, because when you think about it, the story does indeed revolve around his questionable actions. It is a good performance amongst some beautiful sets and old cars that echo, yet again, a time that seemed more innocent, but was just as bloody and reckless as society now. If only it could be as bloodless as the blowing hat.</fullReview>

I think the thing I love best about this movie is the music. The title music is beautiful and haunting, and I believe another post here mentioned the Danny Boy scene-- incredible stuff. While it's hard to understand Tom's motivations, I think that's what makes this film so great.By the way, keep your ears wide open; it's hard to tell because people talk so fast, but there is an explicit homosexual love triangle going on between Dane, Mink, and Bernie. The hell you say! But I can prove it:Tom says to Caspar, "There's always a wild card where love is involved," referring to Mink and Dane Mink uses a .22 -- a woman's gun Mink says defensively that he and Bernie are "Just, you know, amigos."Mink is Eddie Dane's "boy." The list goes on and on. Anyway, look out for that. I didn't catch it until my 3rd screening...sigh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warning: 100% Spoilers aheadThis film gets better every time you see it and IMHO the finest Cohen film out there. Anyone who thinks this film is second rate simply doesn't understand it...and it is hard to follow the first time around which is a justifiable criticism (for example, the first time I saw it I had no idea that there was a huge homosexual subplot to the story).This movie involves a gang war during the Prohibition era between the entrenched Irish mob and the growing Italian mob, with a sleazy bookie (who is homosexual and Jewish) caught in the middle. You will never see a more brilliant performance by Byrne or Turtorro and Harden is fantastic as well.Comparing it to the Godfather is accurate, because both are romanticized versions of the mafia (e.g., handsome mafia dons in tuxes and machine guns). A comparison to Goodfellas is silly, which portrays a more stark and gritty view of mafia life with ugly people in ugly clothes getting addicted to drugs, and therefore totally different in character. There are many homages to Godfather throughout, the most obvious is the opening scene: both involve a bald, mustached italian man coming to the godfather to ask for a murder. The second most obvious is at the very end, right when Tom is walking up to his apartment after setting up the final killing and a TRAIN runs by (even though it is 4:00 AM), an homage to the scene in Godfather I when the train goes by and Michael wacks Salazzo and the Police Captain.Stylistically, it doesn't get any better than this with simply gorgeous camera work panning over the shoes, the clothes, the cars of the era.The triangles of love betrayals exist on every level: Tom betrays Leo, through his affair with Myrnah. Myrnah betrays Leo, through her affair with Tom. Tom betrays Myrnah, by almost wacking Bernie the first time. Mink betrays Dane, by his affair with Bernie. Who among the principal characters remains "true"? Caspar. So Caspar's funny talk about ethics, which most write off as humorous dialogue, is central to the issue of moral code in this film.</fullReview>

The Man who Wasn't there, although good, is slow and a bit cold around the heart and the Big Lebowski was just plain nasty. All of the above average or just slightly above average.Miller's Crossing, although rather good, is still just slightly above average. It has good acting, good script, etc. But, for some reason, the first 20 minutes are boring. It lags a lot during, and can be a bit too slow. And it, yet again, it's cold around the heart. It lacks a sense of human warmth (that Fargo had, although not at first glance).It dissapointed like most of the Coen brother's film, and, although I know you should view each movie on it's own merits, I hate to say that Miller's Crossing has very few.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliantly plotted, cleverly done.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Twice in my life I've left a theater feeling awed by the intelligence of what I've seen. Once was on Broadway after seeing Tom Stoppard's "Arcadia." The other time was my first viewing of "Miller's Crossing."Yes, the cinematography is gorgeous. Yes, the production design is lush and rich in masculine colors. Yes, Carter Burwell's music is haunting and perfectly suited to the story. And Yes, the performances are all spot on perfect.But I had to see this movie several times to figure out what happened and why. Gabriel Byrne's character of Tom is as complex a character as you're likely to see on screen. As Vera says to him at one point, "Christ, Tom, all ya had to do was ask." And yet, he is someone who is incapable of asking for any sort of favor, whether it's from Leo, Vera, anyone. And the mechanisms he puts into play to resolve his problems are complex, interwoven and not a little self-destructive. He someone who is capable of taking a punch (and he takes plenty) and yet seemingly incapable of delivering one. Ultimately he gets what he wants and loses everything he values.The Coen brothers said this was a story about men in hats. And clearly it is, but what the hell does that mean? Tom is clearly "chasing his hat" which means he is seeking something that escapes him. But he refuses to ackowlege that he's chasing it, and by refusing to accept that there are things he wants, he loses that which matters most to him.The Coens are routinely criticized for being brainiac manipulators of their characters, more concerned with the conceits and gimics of their gags than with the humanity of their characters. What a crock. They are not maudlin sentimentalists and thank God for that. The fact is they have a great deal of compassion for people who don't seem to have any themselves. Jerry Lundegard in "Fargo" was clearly the character they felt the most for and his increasingly desperate and tragic actions were the heart of that film, not Frances McDormand's chirpy sheriff.The Coens make movies as well as anyone. They write scintilating dialogue, they use the camera as well as anyone, they use color like a painter. But they have always been shortchanged by people like Owen Gleiberman of EW because they "have no heart." Like Tom Regan in "Miller's Crossing" they have a heart, but you have to look to find it and it might be a troubled one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So, what's the rumpus? While overall not a bad movie, it was missing something. It did have Gabriel Byrne in one of his usual strong roles, however, so that helped. If you like crime dramas you will like it. There's a good amount of deception, deceit, and mind games. And if you like seeing John Turturro whimper in fear and seeing Gabriel Byrne be beaten to a bloody pulp every ten minutes or so, this is definitely your movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best postmodern gangster film every made, rivaling even The Godfather in cinematic perfection.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The deep-focus in almost every scene combined with the consistently Rembrandt-like cinematography, with faces lit or half-lit against a dark background, make for a compelling visually satisfying aesthetics in this film. Yes, there is blood galore, but never is it gratuitous. Killing is not pretty. Guns have consequences. The dancing figure of a mobster being riddled by machine gun fire makes death a reality, not a glamorous event. The Coen Brothers reference the 1930's gangster films, especially Public Enemy and White Heat, as well as The Godfather. Their own twist is the element of a homosexual love triangle, the irony being that the most brutal and conscienceless mobsters are not heterosexual macho men. The issue of having a heart is raised again and again through the film, and the consequences of having one in such a brutal world provides another irony in this often sentimental, but honest look at man's greed, at man's essential lust for power. Only Verna has a heart and seems capable of love. Tom, too, has a heart, but his love for Verna can easily be dismissed as lust. However, he and Verna both have unswerving loyalty, loyalty that is assuredly misplaced, but loyalty nonetheless. The theme of family which is part of the gangster genre also has a postmodern twist here. There is the ludicrous family of Johnny Caspar, the sibling connection between Verna and Bernie, and the father-son relationship between Leo and Tom. This last verges on the homoerotic in the last scene. The haunting musical score is reminiscent of old movies, with Tom's theme, a melody played at the beginning, the end, and points between when Tom is on screen and in trouble. One is reminded of Tara's theme in Gone with the Wind. The dialogue is fast paced, so much so that even my students, normally highly acute when it comes to movies, found it difficult to follow on the first viewing. Actually, the subtlety of expression adds to this difficulty. Listen, for instance, to the clues to the fact that there is a gay love triangle. If you don't catch them, the plot makes little sense. The homosexuality is never overtly stated, nor are the comments about the gay relationship ever highlighted in any way. There is no use of words like "faggot" to finger the gay characters, but it is clear who they are if you're listening. This is a movie that has to be seen more than once. It itself, so referential to older gangster movies, has been referenced by more recent ones like Road to Perdition. To date, I think it is the best of Coen Brothers' movies and I like almost all of the others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intriguing mix of gangster and film-noir genres with small bits of the typical dark humor.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Miller's Crossing" is an intriguing mix of gangster and film-noir genres with small bits of the typical dark humor that usually found in the films only done by the Coen brothers (Ethan and Joel).The film is only focused around Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne - "The Usual Suspects"), the right hand man to Leo O'Bannon (Albert Finney - "Erin Brockovich"), an Irish mob boss who runs the city of Chicago in his office (even though he isn't the mayor) who get themselves into a bitter and bloody war with Johnny Caspar (Jon Polito), an underground Italian mob boss and his cold and calculating right hand man Eddie Dane (J.E. Freeman - "Wild at Heart").Early in the movie, the war begins when Leo refuses to let Johnny kill Bernie (John Turturro - "Cradle Will Rock"), a small-time bookie who double-crossed Johnny over a few fights. Tom and Eddie are also watching and see what goes on.There another interesting twist added to the film for more tension when Tom is sleeping with Verna (Marcia Gay Harden - "Pollock"), who is both Bernie's sister and Leo's girlfriend.What made me enjoy the movie is the tight line that Tom is forced to take when the war in town and between himself and Leo gets ugly and extremely fierce. And in certain scenes throughout the movie, Tom takes some serious beatings from a few people including Leo, Verna, Bernie, Dane.Despite a few violent and unpleasant scenes, there are a couple of funny moments and the best one is when a young boy and a dog look at a man who has been shot in the chest and is now dead. So the boy pulls the man's hair, stops, and sees it as a toupee. Then he takes it and runs away with the dog barking at his side.The performances are both terrific and chilling, ranging from Byrne and Finney to Polito and Freeman. Steve Buscemi and Sam Raimi appear in small roles and Frances McDormand also appears unbilled as the mayor's secretary.To be honest, "Miller's Crossing" is one of the best Coen brothers' films in my mind. No doubt about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An overrated film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>BEWARE OF SPOILERS BELOW I found this film painfully slow and wondering around pointlessly up to about the first hour. The second hour was more interesting though not brilliant, it began to get somewhat interesting from the time Byrne was asked to shoot Turturo his Jewish girlfriend's brother.The plot was muddled and hard to follow in many of its details while it lacked real depth and tension and many of the major characters came across as very cartoonish and wishy washy, Polito and Finney for example weren't at all convincing as authoritative top mafia bosses in their city though Byrne's character was quite satisfactory.The study of human reactions gave it some depth e.g the refusal of Byrne to shoot Turturo and the latter's behaviour towards the one who spared his life at enormous risk to himself.Overall a very mediocre film that's just about worth watching and while granting that in the subject of films personal tastes can differ enormously and one may find a film as being excellent and another as being totally dull I just can't understand why this film is considered as one of the greatest mafia films ever made. It just doesn't have the attributes of a great film particularly an easy to follow yet deep, coherent and suspenseful plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>subpar Coen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Take the most well-known Coen films such as 'The Big Lebowski,' 'Fargo,' and the recent 'Oh Brother;' remove the comedic aspects, creativity, and uniquely intriguing characters, and you'll have a good idea of what 'Miller's Crossing' is. This is the Coen brothers attempt at a plot movie. They put all their eggs into one basket and if the basket breaks they're out of luck. Personally, I thought the movie was so-so. It added little to the gangster genre. The only thing keeping me attached to the movie was the fact that I am a big Coen fan and was interested in seeing their take on gangster film.If you've seen 'The Big Lebowski' a few times, you'd be amazed at how complex the plot is because there are so many other perks to keep you distracted. In 'Miller's Crossing,' it is plot and nothing else. If you don't like the plot you don't like the movie. I think I was most disappointed with the homogeneity of the characters. Everyone from the girl, to the police chief, to the mayor, to each and every gangster is shown as cold, calculating, and arrogant - just like every gangster film. Without novel characters or dark humor, this movie looked devoid of its Coen-ness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The piece is a fabulous testament to taut and grown up crime film writing/making.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Miller's Crossing is the superb gangster drama not necessarily covering the exploits of a man who is a gangster. Certainly, the lead is surrounded by organised crime and folk more apt to the gangster or criminal way of life, but he is more shrewd; he's the weakest, and certainly one of the more soft bodied characters in the piece, but almost certainly one of the more intelligent. If most crime dramas, of this ilk or otherwise, appear to revolve around tough guys doing what they do and throwing their weight around in getting what they want, using their minds only when they're required to get the upper hand in an aggressive conflict, Miller's Crossing is about a guy whom trembles at the thought of having to kill someone, but is instead able-bodied enough to balance several relations with some rather unremitting people. We enjoy the film that is born out of this notion, the film driven by a man getting on with things via his mouth and his mind, not his aggression; items which bring about great dialogue and twisting, turning narratives we are asked to keep up with rather than wall to wall stunts.Gabriel Byrne plays Tom Reagan, a likable Irish-American rouge in amidst the filthy upper echelons of a crime syndicate in an unspecified American city during the time of prohibition. He stands, in his bosses office, as the Coen's open their film in a fashion akin to that of The Godfather: a long take of a man speaking in a gangster's office relaying a 'pitch' to a rival gangster; a man outlining this-and-that to someone whilst going on at length about an issue which means a great deal to him. We cover a chapter in the life of a middleman, a middleman intermingling with several parties more broadly representing the amoral American dream; a guy hopping around from camp to camp and ultimately getting himself up to his neck in trouble as a result of his actions. When the time comes for Tom's boss to speak, the film has both men clash over what it is that either party desire, establishing conflict but either of their respectively stubborn natures so as not to be threatened in what is a threatening environment. The individual whom speaks first, the Italian-American Johnny Caspar (Polito), wants a man dead; Tom's boss, Leo (Finney), a power-mad gangster with delusions that he is invincible, doesn't, and the film constructs Tom's own manoeuvring around the screen in a fashion that has him blend into both mob bosses compositions ? thus, alluding to a greater extent of cross pollination which will come about later on.There is a theory more broadly linked to that of writings on the genre of film noir that classical leads of said genre struggle to come to terms with their environment when they are let loose from the locale of the urban, crime drenched city and placed into a countryside. Historically, leads of film's such as Miller's Crossing have flagged in rural-inclined places of trees and fields and farms, or whatnot; the film's unnerving cut, to what looks like the perspective of someone looking directly upwards at the sky during a process of being carried on something, greets us after this office-set opening ? is it a person's literal perspective? Is that person perhaps dead? The locale will come to play a greater part in the film later on, the name of this place being the titular Miller's Crossing; a zone on the outskirts of the city in which those therein are permitted to extend their travels in another direction; a fork to other place, if you will - a later scene of great intensity acting as the stepping stone to a bleaker, more cold blooded existence for our lead Tom away from the path to that of what he's presently on.The narrative is what it is, a water-tight labyrinth that takes care of itself; we enjoy our lead's company and aligned ourselves with him enough to become greatly enthused in his ventures that come to feature an array of other lowlifes as a mob war comes to break out around him. Other prominent players in Tom's life lie in the form of the girlfriend to Leo in Verna (Gay Harden), as well as John Turturro's feral gambler Bernie Bernbaum; Verna wears very little when we first see her interact with Tom, and the tone of their conversation encapsulates the nature of the world they occupy: blunt and dry in spite of the fact they're quite close. We identify that he's there to collect his hat at her place, which he left having been too intoxicated to remember to take it, and there is this prominent sense of Tom walking a fine line in his life when it becomes obvious he's seeing Verna behind his bosses' back; a man, in Leo, to whom he is so close that either character appears to just be able to visit the other at whatever hour they desire if there is a problem needing fleshing out.Turturro does well with his character, a guy whom we first observe just seemingly 'appear' in Tom's dwelling ? sat there in a chair, as his presence catches us all off guard. His attire has him eerily blend into the furniture within which he's perched, while his nature of manoeuvring around as he does and getting the jump on us all alludes to a greater extent of trickery and slipperiness which later becomes apparent when things intensify, and Bernie does not play by the rules laid down to him. The film is an often spellbinding crime drama; a glorious period piece weaving its way down challenging avenues and indulging us in the sort of narrative filmmaking with which we ought to engage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Miller's Crossing" is a film that carries us back to a time when crime was classier and simpler. A time when a good head and a smart plan could take you to the top, if you wanted to be there. Our main character here, Tom Regan, decides he doesn't. Maybe too smart, Tom gets mixed up with the boss' girl. He never shows disloyalty; he just does what he wants because he can. With a few memorably awesome scenes, the story moves relatively slow until we are finally shown the portrait of a man who knows his time and his place. The story takes us through a month or so in the life of Tom as he plays all sides of a hairy situation to his advantage."Miller's Crossing" suffers from one or two sub-standard actors. This would be fine in most Coen brothers' films, but here, it really shows because the film is meant to be taken so seriously. Marcia Gay Harden is terrible as the gangster moll girlfriend. She hams it up and overacts. I thought the guy who played Johnny Caspar was bad also. Too funny and he should have been more serious. It didn't fit.All in all, "Miller's Crossing" is a well-done piece that has a wonderful ending that makes all the bumps in the road getting there worthwhile.8 out of 10, kids.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Gangster Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has become one of my favorite gangster films. It has all the hallmarks of a good film: a great cast, a plot that keeps one intrigued, beautiful cinematography, and first-rate editing. However, it becomes a great film because of how it portrays the complexity of the human experience. It's a film that should be watched many times, not just for the pleasure of the acting and how it flows, but because it makes one deeply think more deeply about human virtues. Can a criminal have virtues? In a simplistic world view in which things are either black or white, good or bad, one would have to say no. But this film challenges this notion and sees the contradictions inherent in our humanity. Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne) is a criminal, a gangster, yet in spite of that, he has a strong sense of ethics and this film is largely how this man maintains his ethics in a world that is not. There is a consistent sense of justice in how this character acts, even if it is not apparent at first. It is in the play of what society considers ethical behavior to be and what it is in an unethical situation that is at the heart of this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really, really dug it. Everything just worked for me. The meshing of gangster with film-noir just seems right, and the fantastic dialogue combined with the twisty (but not too twisty) story makes for one helluva screenplay. Byrne is terrific here, making his protagonist both likable and unlikeable, switching from charming and witty to morally questionable to downright evil and back without a problem. I loved the way he played every character in the film, and basically drove all the events of the story; the fact that we connect with him, and then feel his terror when he thinks he's been caught, but then revolt him when he spins his webs, is just brilliant. I also liked the undercurrent of really dark comedy that runs throughout the film. Technically, it's superb, and for pure entertainment, you can't do much better. A real treat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit it took three viewings of "Miller's Crossing" to fully understand the nuance involved in the development and relationship of the characters, and just what Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne) was doing to juggle the precarious balance between life and death in the middle of a mob war. Even then I made liberal use of the re-wind button to replay scenes and conversations to be sure I had it all right. When all is said and done, this is just a brilliant film, my favorite among the Coen Brothers movies.I don't want to get into a lot of the story details like others on this board have. What I'd like to consider are a couple of thoughts I had after my most recent viewing. I was wondering whether the movie would have had more impact if it ended right at the point when Tom begins to place that last bet after the hit on Bernie (John Turturro). It seems to me that would have cemented the idea that Reagan was as cold hearted a killer as Eddie Dane (E.J. Freeman). Not that the actual ending wasn't satisfying; it got to the heart of Reagan's loyalty, which after all wasn't so much to Leo (Albert Finney), but to himself.The other thought had to do with the Coen Brothers use of a classic element utilized frequently by the master himself, Alfred Hitchcock. A maguffin in film is a plot device that might seem important but winds up having no bearing on the outcome of the story. In that regard, think about how many times Tom Reagan's bookie Lazarre winds up being mentioned in the movie. Yet the character Lazarre never actually appears in the story, nor do we ever hear Lazarre's voice in connection with Tom's bets. True, a couple of his toughs work Tom over outside the phone booth after the phone call to Bernie, but that just adds to the mystique of the unseen bookie. Very clever actually, and something you don't even think about as the story unfolds.One of the things I got the biggest kick out of was Johnny Caspar's (Jon Polito) use of the term 'schmatta' to describe Bernie Bernbaum. Growing up with a Polish grandmother, 'schmatta' is a word I remember as referring to a dish rag. Which seems kind of appropriate, because Bernie seemed to have the temperament of a wet dishrag, especially in that 'find it in your heart' scene. Yeah, 'schmatta', that's just so colorful not to be part of the current vernacular.Anyway, "Miller's Crossing" is a great movie with terrific characters and an intricate plot that out-stings "The Sting" for witty dialog and a grand double cross. If you're looking for a rumpus, this is it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Miller's Crossing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a modern gangster film noir. It plays with the stereotypes known from the early gangster films and film noirs from the 40ies. In a more modern way there is a lot of screen violence, film blood is used very excessively. The violence in this film, however, is a very artificial one. It doesn't hurt the viewer, but it doesn't have to, because film noir was never a genre of forced realism. It's much more a genre that examines the "dark side" of humans, the way he treats his unmoral wishes and drives. The Coen Brothers add to this mix a comic-y approach to this story, which isn't quite my taste, although they build up some great moments that remain. But in some moments of this movie, I asked myself what is this particular scene contributing to the movie (or is this just an exercise in style?). Gabriel Byrne plays very well in the lead, and also his co-stars Marcia Gay Harden, Jon Polito and Albert Finney are convincing in their parts.</fullReview>

The movie benefits from a dark and powerful performance by Gabriel Byrne in a film of like substance that tells an unusual tale of the life of a manipulative, clever gangster. Supporting cast are strong, including Marcia Gay Harden, Albert Finney, John Turturro and Jon Polito.The plot from brother Joel and Ethan Coen is fantastically worked and, after a slow start, really hooks you in as it is put to full use by director Joel. We need more powerful cinema like this; it truly blew me away.Saturday, February 23, 1991 - Forest Hill Chase"Millers Crossing" is still as entertaining second time around.

		<shortDescription>Miller's Crossing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom(Gabriel Byrne)is Leo's(Albert Finney)right hand man and intelligent voice of reason. Being the city's top gangster, Leo depends on Tom's advice. The pot is stirred when Leo's moll, Verna(Marcia Gay Harden)has a pesky brother Bernie(John Turturro)who is stealing from rival mob boss, Casper(Jon Polito). Casper wants Bernie dead and will clear Tom's gambling debts with a local shyster Lazarre if he'll complete the task. Tom has another problem besides his debt and that is his sleeping around with Verna. Casper makes it known that he wants to be head honcho of the city and offers a partnership with Tom if he'll switch sides. Casper even tries, and fails, an attempt on Leo's life sending goons with tommy guns to kill him. Leo does lose his position, but won't go away. It appears that Tom has switched sides, but things are always uncertain in a Coen brothers film. The story unravels as circumstances surface such as Dane(JE Freeman), Casper's heavy who doesn't trust Tom and follows him. You have Bernie who is indeed a thorn needing removal even towards Tom. But, one figures that the "cool-under-pressure" Tom has a scheme brewing that will benefit himself first. Leo seeks blood for the death of one of his men, tailing Verna. Also, a pal of Bernie's, Mink(Steve Buscemi)plays a special part in certain key moments in the way the plot carries out regarding both Tom and Verna's annoying, thieving brother.As in most film noir, the characters are all flawed, imperfect and corrupt..there's no one who escapes unscathed without at least one skeleton poking it's head from the closet to wink. The protagonist, Tom, isn't exactly the kind of hero one roots for as he is, it seems, merely out for himself. But, the motivations of Tom and his manipulation, without the blood caking in the cracks of his hands, is the real reason to check out this nasty piece of work that represents the noir genre dutifully. The photography, and era detail are flawless. The complex story as it unwinds is a lot of fun. Twists abound and many characters will just about have Tom licked when it seems a guardian angel rescues him from underneath the tightening noose.</fullReview>

But anyhow, this film was great too, I can see why many love it, great performances, written very well. It is very different from other Coen films though, i thought it was much more brutal and Tarantino-esquire than ony other Coen film. But it worked, a great cast especially Turturro and Gabriel Byrne, as well as Polito and Finney. The entire cast was perfect in this film and really made it work, a great atmosphere and also nice cinematography from Barry Sonnenfeld. -- IMDb Rating: 7.9, my rating: 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No, I am not Tom Reagan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's time to take a balanced view of MILLER'S CROSSING. It is a very good film, with some approaches and scenes touching on genius and pointing ahead to some of the great Coen Brothers work to follow.However, on its own, it is a well-realized film in most regards. Mode, narration, dialog, performances, music, cinematography, and direction are all first rate. MILLER'S CROSSING finds its own "feel" for its topic, for its times, for its genre, and that is a noteworthy achievement for a movie as dark, uncompromising, and uninspiring as it is.The movie seems to say we must live within our destinies--efforts to overcome, or, in Tom Reagan's (Gabriel Byrne's) case, straddle between one destiny or another can be fatal. Tom is razor-smart, smart enough to see several moves ahead in the big game of gangster politics, but also smart enough to see the emptiness of it all. He constantly tries to fight off his own sentimentality, and it gets the best of him, as he needs to be smart or sentimental, not both. And that sentimentality proves fatal for some.What keeps this film short of greatness, in my opinion, is that MILLER'S CROSSING seems to straddle that very line of sentimentality vs. intelligence. In turn, it is a great send-up of gangster pictures, a terrific historical commentary on the ethnic dimension to American gangsters, a wonderful depiction of characters within their era, an existential neo-noir. In the end, however, it seems to fall short of having a lot to say, being content at putting on its show. This makes it, as I said, a very good movie because it has put the show so well.Highly recommended--but beware of the over-praise. It also drags in spots, and at times its over-the-top satire cuts into its effectiveness as drama, or maybe the other way around. In my mind, FARGO remains the most complete Coen film, in a fine body of unusual and idiosyncratic works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thought-provoking and funny movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hardly watch any movies more than once, but "Miller's Crossing" draws some of its intrigue from the main character's ambiguous intentions. Each time I watch it I keep looking for clues as to when Joe changes his mind. Who can keep their eyes off Gabriel Byrne here?It's a high compliment that with the sheer volume of movies from the U.S. and abroad available today, this one has left an unforgettable imprint on my mind over the years. Hardly any Coen brothers' film fails to leave an impression. It's hard to forget a film where the main character gets beaten up a few times, loses his best friend, and loses the girl, but wins the peace.Definitely a favourite.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie, was so infectiously funny, words alone could not express the joy I had watching this movie. The Coen Brothers(Joel &amp; Ethan) never cease to amaze people like me. This movie is worth seeing. This is by far, one very well done movie, with lots of thriller content and quite a few "one-liners". I definitely can appreciate the kind of film-making the Coen Brothers do, as they look at different angles during the process of the movie making. I am glad to see such creativity of characters they brothers conjure up. Miller's Crossing is definitely one of those movies, I would gladly shell out some hard-earned money &amp; buy it outright. I don't really know if there is much more I can write except one has to see the movie. It was hilarious!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It took me too long to catch this classic, tough gangster drama. The characters are quite vivid and unique, although barely likable. The film feels like an artistic rendering from the first image and always keeps you guessing. Not the best gangster film, but a profoundly unique cinematic voyage into the underworld.It's dark and long and not a feel-good movie, so be prepared. But it's easy to see why this film remains in the IMDb top 250 15 years after its release.Gabriel Byrne's inspired performance makes you wonder why he never hit the big time.

		<shortDescription>One of the best gangster movies ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I were to make a list of favorite gangster flicks it would probably look like this:1. The Godfather 2. The Godfather Part II 3. Goodfellas 4. Miller's Crossing 5. CasinoThe plot structure of Miller's Crossing might actually be the best of them all. When you look at it, the story is driven almost entirely by two love triangles: a straight one - Leo, Verna, and Tom; and a gay one - Mink, Bernie, and The Dane. You will notice that most of the plot is influenced by who is sleeping with who. Visually, this film is similar to the Godfather in its darkened, brownish tones. Plotwise, it is certainly the strangest of all the stories on my list -- the Coens always seem to manage to put their own weird spin on the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine Coen Brothers Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Miller's Crossing Gangster films are violent, take themselves too seriously, and are slow (well, most). Luckily, Miller's Crossing only takes one of these characteristics, and is, along with some others, considered mob masterpieces. Many will disagree with me, but I found this to be a more entertaining and well-made film than The Godfather and Bonnie and Clyde, but not as good as Goodfellas or The Public Enemy. It has situations that are uncomfortable, suspenseful, and grim, and turns them into black comedy hilarity. This film not only succeeds on the gangster picture level, but on a number of other levels: black comedy, suspense, and a dab of film noir that it seems the makers enjoyed referencing to. Not only that, but it is brilliantly written. This has perhaps one of the most clever screenplays I've ever encountered, with dialogue and situations. The Coens make this film hilarious, bleak, and very violent all at the same time as we try to decide just who we are rooting for and, every once in awhile, what exactly is going on during this complex black comedy. For intelligent viewers, you got one for the brain here. The intellectual film buff should view this film immediately as it is lots of fun and likes to trick it's characters and sometimes the viewer into thinking things that are not. Seeing what our anti-hero will do next is quite worthy of the money spent at Blockbuster. I highly recommend the film. 3.5 stars out of four. Written by Joel and Ethan Coen. Directed by Ethan Coen. Cast: Gabriel Byrne, John Turturro, Albert Finney and Jon Polito. 1990. Rated R for language and violence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Coen brothers kept true to Hammett's use of the dialogue of the day and the plot spins are mostly accurate. Byrne does great work as the punching bag. I had a harder time with Finney fitting into his role, but he does well and is a great actor. How his Tommy gun has 150+ bullet's in it, is amazing to me, but then I've seen six-shooters have 15 or 20 rounds, too. More Buscemi would've been good, since he fits the atmosphere of the film perfectly and Tuturro is in his element, too. All in all, a very well made film, but don't give the Coen brothers all the credit, Dashiell Hammett's Glass Key was the impetus of this film.

		<fullReview>'Miller's Crossing', the third film from the Coen brothers, opens with a monologue from the pig- like Johnny Caspar (Jon Polito). He is discussing ethics, and is also trying to see if Irish crime boss Leo (Albert Finney) will do anything if Caspar were to take someone out. After seeing that Leo would, Caspar leaves along with his brutal henchman Eddie Dane (J.E. Freeman), and in a sense has threatened Leo by saying he's 'sick of the high hat'. Leo's advisor Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne) disagrees with Leo's decision, and knows he refused Caspar because he is dating the target's sister, Verna (Marcia Gay Harden). Things began to get messy as a war begins to take shape, and Tom is afraid Leo will not be able to hold up against Caspar anymore. More-so, the target Bernie Bernbaum (John Turturro) begins to meet more with Tom, causing him problems. The main factor in 'Miller's Crossing' is the superb writing. The dialogue is quite refreshing and flows extremely well, (also see 'The Man Who Wasn't There' for an example of this). The characters are individual, living, breathing human beings and most of them want different things. The dialogue comes alive the most in several scenes between Tom and Leo. The performances are also good too, most notably Finney as the like-able Leo, a kind man who doesn't realize what trouble he's starting for everyone. Also worth mentioning are Bryne as the somewhat cold Tom, a man who is extremely intelligent and knows what he's doing. The supporting cast puts in some refined work as well, Polito as the temperamental Caspar, Turturro as the slick Bernbaum, and a nicely done cameo by Steve Buscemi as Mink, one of Bernie's friends. The photography by frequent Coen collaborator is also very nicely done, with some very beautiful shots. The action scenes in the film are also great to watch and the music by also frequent collaborator Carter Burwell is a nice touch too. Joel Coen also did a good job directing, making the scenes work out dynamically and getting the viewer into the film all the while building up momentum and throwing some surprises to the audience. The style of the film also was a different approach for them, it came after the dark and suspenseful thriller 'Blood Simple' and the whacked out comedy 'Raising Arizona', and instead transferred to a more smooth looking feel. 'Miller's Crossing' is definitely a must see for all fans of the Coen brothers, a nicely styled little masterpiece and a refreshing look at the mob of the 30's. 10/10</fullReview>

On the surface, this is the usual Cohen fare: rapid-fire dialogue, camera swoops and twirls, invention and subversion. What separates this wheat from the?em?other wheat of the brothers' output is the potent love-triangle (a much-abused phrase I admit) that glues the explosive theatrics together. Tom and Verna, Verna and Leo, Tom and Leo? There's love here pilgrims, real love, though the principals can't bring themselves to utter the word.What of the performances? Well, Mr. Byrne ambles his way through one of the most wonderfully laconic performances since Jimmy Stewart kissed goodbye to the silver screen. Attention, breast-beating METHOD actors?this is cinema, deliciously underplayed. Marcia Gay Harden matches Tom/Gabriel step for jaded step, and Albert Finney shines as the (dangerous) boob in the middle. And hats off to Carter Burwell for his delightful appropriation of ?Lament for Limerick'. Recommended?in case you haven't guessed..</fullReview>

One particularly strong point is the way that the seedy doings of gangsters is depicted with the Coen Bros' absurdist touch. Another is the way that the whole story ties together; there isn't one plot hole that I can think of, the Coens just cover all their bases really well. This movie is really *written*, if you know what I mean. I've seen Goodfellas, The Godfather, Scarface, etc. and I say this movie beats them all simply because it provides an element that all those other films lack.

		<shortDescription>Truly captivating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Miller's Crossing' is a captivating story, brewed slowly but ever so sweet to taste once the plot thickens. A truly wonderful masterpiece that leaves 'Godfather' riddled with bullets in comparison. Unfortunately it failed to inspire similar cult following due to its lack of strong character. Don't get me wrong, the performances were magnificient, but other than Casper the rest of the characters were quite dull and unlovable. That 'Irish' charm is missing in the Mob and the Mafia didn't even seem Italian. I guess if you had mixed 'miller's' plot with 'godfather's' class and character you'd get the best movie ever conceived. Anyway, I enjoyed this more than 'the Godfather'.Just a suggestion: In the end of the movie when Bernie pleads to Tom to look into his heart, Tommy should have replied something like 'Not today' instead of 'what heart'. That would have captured the impulsive nature of the storyline. That much like anyone else, a gangster will make decisions based on impulses at the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A work of art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another Coen Bros. work that doesn't disappoint. This is a masterpiece of the filmmakers' art. There is not a bit of fluff; the writing is at the same time rich and gemlike, the sets and scenes at the same time sharp and moody, the acting at the same time natural and stylized, the editing flawless. Movies like this are merciless; once you've seen something like Miller's Crossing, you can never make lame excuses for lesser celluloid artistry.All that said, I did have a problem--I did have trouble following the dense, labyrinthine plot. The patois is thick, the references "inside" and oblique, and the horses are seriously out of the gates even before the opening credits. I think I got my "legs" as the movie progressed, but it was a full-time job. I have no problem with movies that make me work a little for my enjoyment, and MC does.The final image--the hero's face--summarizes the Coen Bros. signature style; asking if, at film's end, we can see the spiritual realities underlying the outward signs of our deceit and depravity; can we see in our mind's eye the Portrait of Dorian Grey in the back room.How do these guys do it? How do they inspire the acting we see? Are the actors in some kind of thrall to the beauty of the script? What?Here's a tribute; the metaphor of Tom's hat is so obvious it bonks you on the nose, yet speaking for myself I never resented it and still embrace it with love and respect. That's how masterfully this movie invites you into its multilayered cosmos.</fullReview>

With an incredible cast of players, Byrnes takes you along on a ride filled with twist and turns, and filled with suspense.

		<shortDescription>The Coen Brothers' Best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Coen bros. previous efforts (BLOOD SIMPLE, RAISING ARIZONA) showed their capability of producing films in a small budgeted quirky landscape, but MILLER'S CROSSING did much to prove that they had a unique vision in serious film making. This film set the tone for the bros. more dramatic projects to come: BARTON FINK, FARGO, the talent heavy missed opportunity MAN WHO WASN'T THERE, and the high-concept HUDSUCKER PROXY. The true source of genius in this film is the look. Barry Sonnenfeld's photography, and Dennis Gassner's sumptuous production design (you can almost feel the woodstain soaking into the paneling in Leo's office) help to make this one of the most visually distinct films in recent memory. The pan shot of the tree tops, the hat in the wind, the shoot out, all great scenes developed with a resonating style. Carter Burwell's score helps to create a bucolic aural backdrop to the on-screen happenings. The performances are all A-list: Gabriel Byrne as Tom Reagan, the film's oft abused protagonist; John Turturro's scene at the crossing is worth the price of admission; Albert Finney's Leo is wonderfully single-minded and bullish; Jon Polito's rival gangster is scene stealing; Marcia Gay Harden is perfect in the film's only center stage (if underdeveloped) female role; and J.E. Freeman as the Dane is chilling and nuanced.The plot of the film is not perfect, however. It revolves around Tom Reagan's machinations (many of which seem to happen by chance or dumb-luck) to help Leo, his boss and friend, out of a difficult situation, involving love, betrayal and gangland confrontations. The plot, which becomes a bit more lucid upon repeated viewings, is helped along by the quick and fun dialogue (terms such as "twist", "dangle", "insky/outsky", "yeg", etc) and keeps things moving. The absence of sex and foul language help make the scenes of intense violence even more so, by allowing the Coen bros. to make these instances more graphic. I must admit that I am not that big a fan of the bros. more recent popular work (THE BIG LEBOWSKI was a funny-in-places surreal romp and O BROTHER, I think, is their worst film to date), and I choose to look back at MILLER'S CROSSING as setting the standard. I'm sure by now that you are bored of listening to me gush about this movie, check it out and decide for yourself. It at least is a gorgeous pulp drama with clever dialogue; I think it is one of the best films of the 1990's and I tend to distrust anyone who says otherwise. There have been instances where, having found myself in the same room as someone such as this, I will transfer the money I have on me to my sock at the first available opportunity...for certainly they would cut me off at the heels if there were two bits in it for them. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually stunning, the best dialogue ever, great actors, yet it has a very confusing plot and resolution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a big Coen brothers fan, I jumped at the chance when I noticed this one at the video store. What I loved the most were the larger than life characters (obviously parodies from the old gangster movies with James Cagney) the beautiful cinematography, the Coen's artistic sense of direction (one in particular was the long shot of Albert Finney's character turning his back to Tom, right before he beats the tar out of him), the over the top, campy violence, and of course, most importantly, the dialogue. Never have I ever heard such impressive dialogue...sorry Kevin Smith, though some of your films are funny (like Mallrats), they can't hold a candle to this one. This one is so intelligent it is a pleasure to watch. Gabriel Byrne was incredible in the role of the 'heartless' crook, Tom, who plays a deadly game of switching sides between two rival gangs. Always a pleasure to watch, and without a doubt, his best performance, ever. I must say that J.E. Freeman's 'The Dane' character was just too cool. He was so brooding, so calm and precise, yet, you could feel his thirst for blood just by the look in his eyes. Definitely a memorable character. I was pleased to see John Turturro and Steve Buscemi turning in yet two more good performances for the Coens. All in all, every actor was excellent, and the film was very entertaining.My only complaint is the same as many others who have reviewed this film on this site. That feeling of 'huh?' at the end, and often, during the film was honestly a turn off. I know the Coens always have a message about the human condition or human psyche in their films, but save for the fact that Tom is obviously trying to find his heart throughout the film, it is never quite clear, nor is the resolution. To tell you the truth, I don't even know why he told his boss of the affair he was having with his girlfriend (which starts the whole crossing/double crossing/Miller's Crossing acts), perhaps futility? I definitely need to see this one again, which I definitely plan to. Unfortunately, though, the wonderful film Memento, though it grips you just like this one does, Memento at least gave you a hint that there was something deeper to things, and after about three viewings, you suddenly get it and it makes the movie ten times better. I did not get this feeling with Miller's Crossing, primarily b\c I saw very little of the vulnerability of the main character. Every now and then, his girl would mention how cold his heart is, but other than that, you really don't see him struggling, nor reach an epiphany at any point. The only part that gives any indication of a dawning moment of comprehension, or clarity is the final scene, which to me it totally ambiguous...but perhaps that was the intention. If so, kudos for making the audience think, but at the same time, it feels a tad bit like a cop out. Is he running away from his life and now starting over again? Did he feel that he was incapable of love at the end and decided to keep his loyalties, but not his love? I just don't have the answers, but hopefully I will after rewatching it again, soon. Another minor gripe was how they kept referring to all of these other characters, some of whom we hardly see...with the local color from Irish, Italians and Jews, the accents alone, in addition to the countless characters mentioned can cause a headache, and good use of the rewind button. But despite these complaints, I can't help but feel like this was a good movie, and for me to say that, that is definitely a rarity, indeed.Anyway, on a first viewing, I give it a 7.5, b\c it is very entertaining to watch. Because of the incredibly intelligent dialogue that comes at you a mile a minute and had me in stiches or sitting in awe more times than I could count, I give it a strong 8. For anything else, see this as a somewhat 'satire' of gangster films, while still being a good one...yet, like all of the Coen films, don't take the situations seriously or it will ruin the experience for you. 8/10 stars...That's my story and I'm sticking to it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS ALL OVER ITAgain I'm surprised by the unbelievable talent of the Coen Bros for creating their own, personal, unique atmospheres for each one of their films and by their awesome creativity. And I also love, as a fan of classic cinema and a constant reader, their constant references and winks to books and films.This one features the enormous Gabriel Byrne playing the part of a cold-hearted assistant for a gangster who surprisingly has never killed anybody and has a recurrent dream in wich he's standing in the middle of the Miller's Crossing forest and his hat is taken away by the wind to never come back. The funny part of it is that during the whole movie this stands as a metaphor, for the hat is constantly falling from his head but he always manages to get it back when it seems it's too late. Finally, is really too late because he does murder someone (and for no reason at all). But in the end he goes to the guy's funeral in Miller's Crossing and the hat stays in his head all the time. Again we find a completely meaningless subject paid too much atention.There's also a lot of laughing-out-loud parts, specially the ones featuring Jon Polito and constant witty remarks, just like on the classic film-noir novels by Dasshiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler.The acting is another chapter entirely. Gabriel Byrne's superb in his role, but the supportings really deserve the palm. John Turturro, Jon Polito, Albert Finney, Garcia May Harden and a short but well-played Steve Buscemi character.However, I still prefer the Coen's most recent works (and I'm talking about "Oh Brother", "The man who wasn't there" and specially "The big Lebowski" here). But this one's worth more than a view.SAY NO MORE</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Superb venture by the Coen brothers into the gangster genre suffers because of comparisons to "Goodfellas" and "The Godfather". No, it's not as good as those, and it does fall into some of the genre's cliches, but the storytelling is so good it's easy to ignore what flaws it may have. The plot concerns a mob boss's right hand man (Gabriel Byrne), and the complicated events that follow after his boss (Albert Finney) refuses to give up protection to a bookie. (John Turturro) The excellent script is performed well by the entire cast, but Byrne and Turturro in particular, top off with some incredibly beautiful cinematography.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I really start to be a Coen Brothers fan...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>.... sorry for being so late, but yes, I really start to love everything they do, without exception! Love is blind, so let it be blind and let me love them and the kind of cinema they perform. Over here in Europe, we need to know that America is not only the aggressive and powerful "Hollywood". We want more of these independent film producers, like the Coen brothers, it redeems the movie industry, gives it back all its splendor, its dreams. The strive for perfection is here sustained, not only by money, but first and above all by the creativity and the genius of a man, of men, here of two men: the Coen brothers.About the movie Miller's crossing, I have watched it three times in two days (I had never seen it before, cause I just start to discover this style of movies..) and I adored it. You need to watch it more than 1 or 2 times to really get inside it. The dialogues, the amounts of details with the meaning you want to give them, are just perfect...Like the "hat": did anyone notice that, how many times an hat appears in this movie? At the beginning it is blown away by the wind, at the very end, Tom (alias great Gabriel Byrne) pulls it closer to his eyes, trying to hide what? Is it to hide his broken heart, as his friend Leo walks away from him to live with the woman he secretly loves? This gangster does have a heart! It touched me deep inside!In between it (THE HAT) plays its part, like a real actor, being put or removed from people's head, and telling his part: I wear it, I distrust, I remove, I (kind of) trust... It is indeed, as many have said, a drama about love, friendship, loyalty, betrayal, and yes, what you see and is necessarily what you get. So goes life!Gabriel Byrne is not only, as usual, wonderful: in this movie, he is perfect! So are the others actors. I especially loved Polito and Turturro's performances.Go America, Go Coen brothers. The times are difficult, but who will ever be able to break into one person head and destroy his/her dreams?This is real cinema! Love</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe I omitted a few things</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a previous review I said that Miller's Crossing had few merits. I should maybe ad one of the merits.(SPOILERS START HERE)This movie plays around with the idea of loyalty. And the Coen Brothers play around with a lot of irony, as they usually do in their movies. In the movie we see Tom (Garbriel Byrne) switch sides to the other mob in town, but secretly he is still loyal to his old boss Leo (Finney), even though Leo doesn't know it. His new boss (Polito) thinks he's loyal to him, but Dane, Polito's 2nd in command, sees through Tom. Yet Dane in the end gets killed by his boss for something he did not do, and then get betrayed by Tom anyway.Another one is Finney's relationship with Verna. He would never cheat on her but she's cheating on Tom. Also Tom is loyal to his friend Bernie and, ironically, Bernie ends up being disloyal to his friends, especially Tom.(SPOILER ENDS HERE)It also shows that trust (or distrust) should be well founded and not taken on what people say because trust, as truth and loyalty, depends on how it is perceived by an individual.Then there was the "Danny Boy" sequence.Other than this, Miller's Crossing was disappointing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A roller-coaster ride of a 1930's gangster film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This wacky, off-the-wall, deliciously violent gangster film is a remake of Dashiel Hammett's "The Glass Key," first filmed in 1946 with Alan Ladd and Brian Donlevy, with Gabriel Byrne and Albert Finney respectively taking up their roles. It sets the theme at the beginning with a monologue, a howler of convoluted logic, by racketeer Johnny Caspar (Jon Polito): if you can't trust the mob to put in a fix, who can you trust? "It's about ethics," he says to Leo (Albert Finney), the local crime boss, who sits quietly rolling his ice in a glass of scotch. A sullen Gabriel Byrne is Tom Regan, Leo's best friend, confidant, and hatchet man who keeps his cool and whispers sound advice into Leo's ear, advice that Leo too frequently ignores. Poor Mr. Byrne! I've never seen a protagonist get beaten up so many times - he's even sucker-punched by Leo's girlfriend! Tom is a black-hearted Irishman in a black hat, and therein lies the imagery of the film: say "heart" with a bit of an Irish brogue and you have "hat." "There's nothing so ridiculous as a man chasing his hat," Tom snarls, and the image of a black hat rolling across the countryside, propelled aimlessly by the wind, recurs frequently. Tom's a man who goes through life chasing his "heart." The supporting cast is flawless with Marcia Gay Harden as Verna, Leo's cynical, hard-boiled girlfriend; John Turturro as her brother Bernie, the born loser who sets things in motion by upsetting Johnny's fix, begging for his life on his hands and knees ("Look to your heart, Tom! Look to your heart!" and Steve Buscemi, always a joy to watch, as Mink, a fast-talking two-bit hoodlum. Like all the Coen's films, the characters and situations are surrealistically over the top. The image of Albert Finney, with the map of Ireland all over his face, wearing a yarmulkah at Bernie's orthodox Jewish funeral, is hysterical; likewise the machine-gunning of an innocent bystander whose body is pumped so full of lead during a police raid that he bounces on the sidewalk like a rag doll. If you like the Coen's (which I do) you'll love this film; if you don't, you won't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I believe this to be the Coen brother's best movie, and it's my favorite movie of all time. Usually I don't like gangster movies, but this seems to reach deeper levels by having an interesting plot and good characterizations from all involved. Marcia Gay Harden is especially good, as are Albert Finney and Gabriel Byrne, but all are effective, even Steve Bushemi in only one scene.The movie transports you to that time in a way I've never felt a movie do before. I've literally watched it over 50 times and always find something new and interesting. It's beautiful even while being violent, a very difficult thing to do. It's also very funny, in a wry way, without losing any dramatical punch.I don't often give a 10 but this is worth it on every level!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Coen brothers are quietly the best filmakers working today. This film is the best example of what they're capable of in a body of work that is unprecedented amongst their peers. Gabriel Byrne delivers the role he was born to play. The story focuses on Byrne's friendship with Finney's character and the illicit affection he has with Finney's love interest, Hardin. Torturro as Hardin's brother steals every scene he is in.The film is beautiful to watch with some of the most intellegent symbolism ever captured in a mainstream picture. Impossible to predict and filled with the always intelligent Coen dialogue, this movie demands multiple viewings and stays with the audience long after the conclusion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is definetly a film that should be viewed by all. It is suberb and very stylish in it's storytelling of a heartless mobster who goes by him own rules, with no loyalties to anyone. Gabriel Byrne is perfect as the jaded, chief aide to Albert Finney, who gives the best performance he ever given in any movie.(The 'Danny Boy' scene is one of the best moments in filmdom history) Ultra slick dialouge, matched with unforgetable characters, make this a movie to watch again and again. Joe Polito gives an incredible performance, as a rival mobster who wants to take over the racket that Finney and Byrne have. J.E. Freeman is especially powerful in the role as his right hand man, The Dane. Great cinematography, brilliant settings, and of course the razor-edged stylized directing all make this dark, brooding, very atmospheric work the Coen Brothers best movie.P.S. I have a fun drinking game, every time someone says, "Jesus Tom." during the movie, you have to do a shot of Irish Whiskey!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"So take your flunkie and dangle." I love that line, spoken by crime boss Albert Finney to underboss Jon Polito in Miller's Crossing. This is a neatly woven, gorgeous film, written almost a little too smooth.Gabriel Byrne finds his perfect role here as the noir-ish troubled loner who lives by a code and despises himself when he breaks it for anything (love, friendship). Albert Finney is Leo, his boss, whose love of Vera (recent Oscar Winner Marcia Gay Harden in her fist role) has clouded his judgement and caused his empire to crash down. The movie follows Byrne walking a thin line of lies and loyalties, but to whom.Jon Polito and JE Freeman make perfect pair as Italian underboss Johnny Casper and his henchman Eddie Dane. Dane is the violent, loyal second in command who really carries many of the films best scenes.I highly recommend this film. It is very enjoyable and the kind of movie that cries out to be watched over and over again. See the Coen brothers before they were perfect (Fargo), but still better than most.***1/2 out of ****.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Coen Brothers' best film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Can I give this film a 12? Miller's Crossing is one the most beautifully shot, acted, written, and directed films ever made. The Coen Brothers manage to encorporate mild plot twists, violence, unique characters, and there own brand of humor in this masterpiece.Once again, the Coen Brothers have created an entire cast of memorable characters. Each character, even the less-developed one, is an important building block. Even Steve Buscemi's character, with literally a few seconds of screen time, manages to make an impression on the viewer. Along with Buscemi, there are faces familiar to other Coen films, such as John Turturro andJon Polito, who turn in dynamite performances. Gabriel Byrne is superb in the lead role, and Marcia Gay Harden gives a firey performance as the woman torn between a mob boss who can protect her brother, and his right hand man(Byrne). The really amazing performance though, is Albert Finney's as an Irish mob boss. Other than Joe Pesci in "Goodfellas", Finney's performance in a supporting role is the best of 1990.In a year of mobster flicks, ("Godfather III", "Goodfellas", etc.) the originality and beauty of "Miller's Crossing" stand out, making it an essential piece of American film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Coen Brothers pay homage to the gangster film and succeed for the most part. The opening scene, somewhat reminiscent of the opening of "The Godfather," sets the stage for the mob wars as rival gangs seek to take control of the underworld. Although the plot seems somewhat convoluted initially, it comes into focus after a while. The period (1930s) is recreated with all the right details and is helped by an evocative score. Byrne has perhaps the role of his career as the low-key gangster who is torn about his allegiances. Polito and Finney are quite good as rival crime bosses while Freeman makes a mean henchman.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was engaging, complicated and intricate, and well thought out and put together. I still don't think I'd put it on the top 250 list, but I'd definitely give it a 7/10.My one qualm in this was realism. It was very realistic in many senses, and the characters were realistically portrayed, but it's the minor details that bugged me while I watched. My best example for this is Tom's apparent invincibility. It seemed like every time he stepped out of a doorway, phone booth, room, building, car, etc etc etc, he was getting punched in the face, and then kicked in the head, and then punched and slapped around and just generally having the crap kicked out of him. Repeatedly. Okay, I can believe that someone in his line of work would get beat up sometimes, especially if he's not a big guy. But you *have* to show some bruises if you get beat up that badly. The best we got was some short-lived blood, and once a small split in his lip (which vanishes very quickly). In general, two seconds after the baddies finish knocking him around he's back on his feet and totally fine, not even disheveled.The other problem I had was more with me than with the movie, but when someone is standing right next to you or in front of you or over you with a gun three inches from your body *telling* you that you're about to die, the least you can do is grab the gun and hit the guy a few times and see if he drops the gun. Everyone in this movie seemed too afraid of the all-powerful handgun held half an arm's-length away, and unwilling to even try to escape its narrow range of effectiveness. It could be that I'm too well trained and am overanalyzing the potential combat situations which were to further the plot and not act as plot themselves, and it's true that this isn't a Jet Li action thriller, but the least they could do would be to take away the possibility of stopping the gun-weilder by having them step back one pace.In all I enjoyed the film and marveled at its intricate construction and effective visual style, and everyone delivered excellent performances. My qualms with it are primarily superficial, so although this movie in my opinion isn't top 250 material it is still very good.</fullReview>

Possibly because there's no real way to relate to the characters. Tom is simply a fast talking yet clever thug. The problem, though, is that he's simply a satire on past 30's and 40's crime characters. Perhaps he's too clever and too fast talking. He steps over the bounds of suspension of disbelief. I would recommend Miller's Crossing to friends because so many people tend to like it but it's not one for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very thinly plotted and just above average acted. Some mix ups and double crossings from some of the mafiosi crossing paths, but we don't really care about any of them really, no background on them, just some vague talk on game fixing. The minor character of Casper is a joy to watch and there are some brilliant understated comedic lines from him, but the others are all paper thinly written and forgettable. I don't like Gabriel Byrne, he's not much of an actor, but he's half decent here, just barely. Marcia Gay Harden is atrocious though. They are making this fuss about this plain broad, the guys who own every working girl in town. Give me a break. It's very easy to tell she got the part from the window, good connections though I ll grant her that.What else. Ah, again it proves that most film viewers are morons if they proclaim this thinly written and forgettable story as a masterpiece. Fairwell my lovely is a great film, and so is the other raymond carver film they shot, the big sleep, but this is just trite. Of course its not the disgrace with Stuart Cox characters that the Cohen's write these days (malcovich in burn after reading) but it ain't good either. Of course as per usual some brilliant Cohen wit every thirty minutes or so, and the usual great cinematography but that's about it.I am giving it four stars while it should be five or six just because I had high hopes for it and didn't meet the expectations at all.A very disappointing film all in all. It really bugs me how a film like this gets such high grades, a film so vacant and soul less as this, a gangster farce, and vapid in its own genre really. Who cares about a half wit small time gangster who never as much as emotes to anything in the film, at least give us some clever twists here, everything is so boringly predictable. Well, the Cohen's being the jewry they are got all the funds they could to keep making more films after this and luckily we did get a masterpiece in Lebowski. But it seems lately their films are worse than millers' crossing, very stupid crap they make nowadays, just utter farce garbage...shame really cause they are some of the people that are really doing cinema in the states. Let's hope they get some of that talent back, because I am sure they too know it that burn after reading and the other one with clooney and zeta jones are phone ins.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lack of energy and clearly overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the prohibition era, Tom (Gabriel Byrne) is the closest and loyal Lieutenant of Leo, a crime boss (Albert Finney). Rivalry and war between Leo and Johnny Caspar, another crime boss, starts when Leo refuses to kill Bernie, a small time crook (John Turturro). Leo could not kill Bernie because he has an affair with Verna (Marcia Gay Harden ) who has also an affair with Tom. When Tom says that to Leo, Leo ends violently their collaboration and Tom decides to work for Caspar. Things get complicated when Caspar orders Tom to kill Bernie. Does Tom have a heart not to execute this order?From the beginning to the end, this movie is lacking energy in the direction. As it is usually the case in movies by the Coen Brothers, humor is present by appears only in small and secondary scenes. These moments of comedy seems to come at some points where the directors were probably bored by what they were showing. This story of loyalty and betrayal (between Tom and Leo and Tom and Verna) doesn't go straight to our hearts because we have no sympathy for the characters. Gabriel Byrne with his beaten-dog eyes is good but his performance has nothing exciting. Only Albert Finney and John Turturro are above the rest of the cast. This movie was inspired by the `Glass Key', an excellent movie by Stuart Heisler with Alan Ladd and Veronica Lake (and also an adaptation of a novel by Dashiell Hammett). Some scenes are similar in both movies, but overall, the story and the ending are different. I was clearly disappointed by this one. The Coen Brothers should not attempt to do dramas but keep up the good work with comedies. Clearly overrated 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Miller's Crossing" Is A Homage To Classic Noir, Whilst Consisting Of Every Element Which Makes A Coen Brother Film Instantly Recognisable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much of the Coen's films frequently contain evident homages to classic crime-capers, from The Big Lebowski being an ode to The Big Sleep, to Miller's Crossing being a homage to long-established American noir, such as The Glass Key. Miller's Crossing is the film which indisputably established the Coens' talent as a pair of film-makers who would go down in history, following their prior success of Blood Simple and Raising Arizona. The tangled web, fuming with deceit, betrayal and vengeance has now become a fundamental trademark for the Coens' films.Gabriel Byrne performs as Tom Reagan, an adviser for the mob, who thinks before he speaks, yet is prepared to speak his mind, whatever the cost, something he learns is dangerous in the company of the men he is surrounded by. He is essentially a man who lives in a world surrounded by crime, while being a criminal himself, nonetheless he does not attempt find trouble, but rather trouble finds him due to his fraternising with countless mobsters and the dangerous use of his tongue. Due to the frequent swaying of Tom's loyalty it is inevitable that he is going to make enemies; eventually "changing sides" and turning-the-tables on his long-time friend and business partner Leo (played by Albert Finney). Leo is the king of the city, yet because of a disagreement and rejection of a "hit" proposed by fellow mob-boss Johnny Casper (Jon Polito), Tom and Leo fall out. Set around America's prohibition in the 1930s, the film charts the tale of gangsters abusing a corrupt system of injustice and moral decay.Tom Reagan is an immoral man who is striving to gain a meaning to his unethical lifestyle, attempting to balance his apprehension, guilt and moral-values. If problems such as never knowing who to trust and choosing whether to "dispose" of a friend are not enough, he is also subconsciously seeking to build a relationship, something which is painfully difficult under his circumstances. He is struggling to find values beneath his brutal lifestyle of criminal activity. Tom Reagan has "friends" as such, but most of them are with him for protection, or in some cases, the other way round. Acting is one of the countless aspects of flawlessness in Miller's Crossing, considering everyone from Gabriel Byrne, to Albert Finney, to John Turturro and Jon Polito give career-defining performances of enthusiastic supremacy.It is fact that the characters of Miller's Crossing are all intelligent people, in some way, even unexpectedly. Everyone is in search of something and hold some sort of initiative and hidden prerogative behind their decisions. Written with an almighty gusto, the characters roll off the screen from both the hard-edged, bitter script and the unsentimental, glaringly robust performances. Miller's Crossing, as with most Coen Brother films follows a dialogue-driven narrative, invigorated by dark humour, blunt, snappy one-liners and quick-fire conversations which feel humanly laboured and distant. All this helps to create the cold ambiance of the film; capturing the period through convincing set-pieces, props and costumes of the time, giving the film that extra level of accuracy.As expected with a film of this kind, Miller's Crossing has scenes brimming with grandiose violence, which is blood-thirsty and brutal in capturing the irrational foolishness of a human's lust for brutality. Shot in a method which is almost fantasy-like, the now-timeless imagery will become lodged in your mind for eternity. The cinematography is moody, smoky, edgy and cold. Miller's Crossing successfully captures the meaning behind a scene through evocative environments, which etch varied tones of emotion into the viewer. Many of the film's key themes are told through metaphorical imagery, a key image being the hat, a metaphor which is open to interpretation. The film benefits from morose lighting and shadows, emphasising elements such as the furniture and architecture of buildings. Camera angles are also a leading importance for Miller's Crossing, with moments of uncomfortable, gawky positioning, serving to accentuate the thorny, paradoxical plot. The use of zooms, slow fades, quick-cuts and stretching shots make addition to the film's stunning technical achievements. Gracefully placed editing alleviates the low-brow humour and tension, and not forgetting the beautifully poetic score, which fits the characters' distant desires.Complicated, high-strung, cold-blooded storytelling, which is unlike anything you will ever see. Miller's Crossing does stick to its film-noir and "gangster movie" roots, but ultimately it is an illustration of an individual's principles and the senseless violence of gangsters struggling for power. Twists and turns can be rarely executed with such perfection, Miller's Crossing offers viewers much to ponder, meaning revisiting such an underrated masterpiece is obligatory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>7.9 or top ten all time?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coming home drunk one night, I found myself looking for some low rent entertainment on my fancy, new cable box. I found a forgotten classic in "Miller's Crossing." I find it incredible that the Coen Brothers are not more recognized for their contribution to American cinema,particularly this movie. Not as flashy as Tarantino, not as epic as Spielberg, the Coen Brothers are flat-out interesting.It escapes me why the IMDb Top 250 doesn't include this movie. "Children of Men?" "Batman Begins?" These are top 250 films that I love. I don't want to say that the United States makes the best movies, but if anybody knows of an obscure, non-American film maker with the inspiration of the Coen's, please tell me.That having been said, do yourself a favor and watch "Miller's Crossing" again. Please see the beauty of the story and, of course, Turturro's scene in the woods. It is one of the best ever filmed. I am not being arrogant in saying these things. I just want somebody to see the beauty in this movie that I see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plot sucks you in nicely...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite its overtones from "The Glass Key," this movie does a tremendous job of hooking you into the premise very quickly.There's an immediate conflict for the protagonist here, and like Blood Simple, the Coen's earlier films seemed to give more care to the plot as it winds up tightly. Of course, the role of Johnny Caspar is delicious and Polito knocks it out of the part in ways few actors could, and coupled with the savvy of Finney's mob boss, you quickly and clearly gain the gist of the dilemma that Tom faces, and immediately snuggle in for the rest of the movie. Too bad the Brothers abandoned their faith in plot and headed towards a wild disregard for any coherence after "Fargo." I miss the sense of fate that plays a part in their best movies, stories that seem like they are headed towards a serious and inevitable conclusion. The clumsy ones all feel like they lost their willingness to see the narrative through to its natural end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Follow up to Raising Arizona</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**** Serious spoilers ahead *****I highly anticipated watching Millers's Crossing because I am a big fan of Raising Arizona, Fargo, The Big Lebowski, and anything with Gabriel Byrne. But, having said that, I feel really let down by this film. I understand that it is a modern day version of the 1930's gangster genre but I found it lacking in all respects.The dialogue is poor and you may need an Irish interpreter to appreciate the rare good lines, as Gabriel Byrne lays the brogue on pretty thick. The screenplay is supposedly worthy of accolades but I found it to be another example of a film maker's vain attempt to define a genre for the viewer.The saddest part of the film is the waste of Byrne's talents. He is the only redeeming feature of this film yet he's hindered by whatever scraps the Coen brothers give him. Albert Finney is a consummate professional but it's painful to see he is just performing to pay his bills with this film. John Turturro is a great actor and he seemed believable in his role, but the script made his contribution difficult to appreciate. Marcia Harden is forgettable as the love interest that provides conflict between Byrne's and Finney's characters and the cameo from Frances McDormand was ruined by her obvious smile into the camera as she made her exit. Steve Buscemi has 10 seconds of screentime as a gambling hoodlum, and 5 seconds of screentime as a faceless corpse. Don't see this film for the acting.The sets poorly depict a 1930's setting and the odd splash of depression era vernaculars seems contrived. The "plot twists" that are supposed to set this film aside from it's peers are as predictable as they are unbelievable. If you want to see the Coen brothers at their best see Fargo. If you want to see an entertaining gangster flick with great acting, see Goodfellas.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this more than any other Coen brothers' movie. It shares the quirky virtues of their other movies, but the dialogue, acting and mood of this film come together to make an experience I found engrossing even on multiple viewings. But that, of course, is a matter of taste.What isn't a matter of taste is this: In the middle of the movie one of the most beautifully choreographed sequences ever filmed. It begins with a phonograph needle hitting a 78 record of "Danny Boy," and ends roughly three minutes later when the music stops. Albert Finney's physical acting (and use of a cigar and a Tommy gun as props) transform an already brilliant scene into visual poetry.You should see Miller's Crossing for this scene alone; the rest of the film is gravy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Coen at it's best in a well staged gangster saga of friendship, betrayal, well designed intrigues in a perfect plot, playing out perfectly by a cat lead by Albert Finney, Gabriel Byrne, John Turturro and Marcia Gay Hayden, however cast over by certain blasts of brutality. Not suitable for younger people in any case, as it also requires a lot of focus to follow all the well designed threads of the master plot. In my view, much better as "Once Upon a Time", so never so high rated. Watch it, if you like this type of movie, you won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My personal favorite from the Coen Brothers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Miller's Crossing appears in the guise of a mobster film, but it is a very clever parody of mobster films. It uses the genre to portray in an endearing manner the several themes that are constants of the Coen Brothers -- Crime doesn't pay. Violence doesn't solve anything. Deceit collapses on itself. Cleverness is only useful when it is not self-centered. People are frail and prone to evil, but are capable of surprising goodness. Miller's Crossing is my personal favorite from the Coen the Brothers.Coen Brother films divide into two categories: Dark Films with comic undertones (like this one and Fargo), and Comic Films with dark undertones (like Raising Arizona and O Brother Where Art Thou?). One or two split the middle (like The Big Lebowski). Miller's Crossing is definitely as dark as they come, but it is also mystifying, witty, enchanting, alluring, and yes, even romantic in a weird way.Okay, it draws character traits and some one-liners from one or more Dash Hammett novel (which I also enjoy), but this is also a wonderfully creative, memorable, and (aside from the Hammett borrowings) original work.I give it a "9." I would give it a "10," but then what would I give to the Coen Brother film that someday tops this one?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the risk of sounding like everybody else who has commented on this film, I think this film represents movie making at its best. I love the way the "bad" guys in this movie tend to tell the truth and indeed are primarily concerned with "ethics". Visually this film is stunning. From little details like the shine on a gangsters shoe as he puts out a cigarette to the scene that can only be described as loving depiction of Thompson artistry - this movie is frame by frame gorgeous. In the Big Sleep when Lauren Becall first meets Humphrey Bogart she tells him he's not very tall to which Bogey replies "I try to be". I'm pretty sure W. Faulkner wrote that dialogue, which in my opinion has nothing on the dialogue in Millers Crossing. Come to think of it- wasn't the guy Bogey was hired to find in the Big Sleep named Tom Regan?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great gangster film. The Coen's have taken the old gangster film style but have just simply used that. They haven't tried to update it, or add modern dialogue. This gives the movie a genuine feel and also, for the early nineties anyway, makes it original and interesting. The performances are excellent perfectly cast, but the real heroes of this film are the Coens. The film is perfectly paced to let the viewer in on what's happening gradually and letting the story run it's course without falling over itself to explain things but the viewer is never lost or confused. Byrne's character is really great. I love the line "Nobody knows anybody, not that well" It is so cynical.I think this Joel Coen's best outing as a director. It is more adventurous visually and he works hard to keep the viewer enthralled. It is interesting that there is no jokes or humor in this film. I think this is the only Coen brothers film where I haven't laughed once. This isn't a bad thing by any means. It just shows they are versatile and can change the way they write to suit the style.This movie is excellent, with so much in it. I have watched five or six times and it is still as interesting.</fullReview>

This story of double, triple, and quadruple crossing is quite possibly one of the best pieces of cinema ever produced. The writing and timing and pace of the film are flawless. The acting is wonderful by Gabriel Byrne as the main character. With perfect supporting work by Albert Finney, Marcia Gay Harden, John Turturro, Steve Buscemi, Jon Polito, Mike Starr, Al Mancini, and especially J.E. Freeman as Eddie Dane the ruthless hitman who's onto every move of Gabriel Byrne. Great character development and flowing story keep this really interesting with great scene after great scene. A good score that features the classic Irish folk tune "Oh Danny Boy" in probably one of the best scenes in any movie ever. A great concept story of fictional 1920's gangsters at war.

A very good script with many twists, good and sometimes amusing dialog, a great all-round cast (only a pity Buscemi had such a tiny part) with Turturro perhaps the standout. Ranks right up there with the very best movies of all time. Fun on additional viewings. Roger Ebert, that fat, pretentious moron, gave this one good marks but criticizes it more than he praises it, which leads me to suspect that he felt pressured to give good marks to a movie the "cool crowd" loves, so as not to appear too old-fashioned and "unhip". He complains (in the nicest possible way, of course) that there is only one "human moment" in the film (I forget which). "Human moment"?!???!

		<fullReview>..."Miller's Crossing" is the Coen's Godfather. It is cool, gripping, suspenseful and even funny. Most think the plot revolves around the love triangle between crime boss Leo (Albert Finney), his (Marcia Gay Harden) and his advisor Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne), but they'd be wrong. The real story focuses on Reagan's falling out with Leo and his joining rising boss Johnny Caspar (Jon Polito), but it is still unclear where Reagan's real loyalty belongs.You'd think it was impossible for movies to get this good, honestly. The performances and script make the movie. Byrne created what's definitely my favorite anti-hero in the character of Tom Reagan, his manor cold and his cause menacing. Harden makes a character you love to , and Finney is cool as the childish Leo. Of course, other great performances come from Polito, who's Caspar is Oscar worthy. Also, J.E. Freeman creates a great villain as Caspar's henchman Eddie Dane, and John Turturro does a great job as the slippery Bernie Burnbaum.Another thing worth mentioning is the gripping fast-pace. It reminds one of The Godfather: Part II, but I must admit that even that had some slow scenes.Miller's Crossing has none, 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a magnificent moody, atmospheric movie, alwaysmaintaining a tension that keeps us glued to the screen. It showsboth the fragility and vulnerability of Tom as well as a sense ofinvincibility. Coen Brother's movies are typically full of ironies andapparent contradictions in the human condition; they certainlyunderstand human nature, as we often drift between these statesof being and feeling. Because they understand and portray humannature so well, their films will remain timeless, as Shakespearehas. Has Tom got a heart? The answer becomes clear, and hismotives become clear in the very last shot of him pulling his hatdown and staring down the track in the forest. Tom survives byusing his brain and tact; some live by instinct, such as Verna, most rely on guns and violence, or a perceived code of underworldethics, or talking alot ( Bernie )... all of which Tom is very reluctantto use. His mind is his weapon. He also has maintained contactsin high places. He doesn't say too much or perform heroics; heknows how to survive in this dog eat dog world. The soundtracksuperbly complements the mood, with its Irish melancholy. Theperformances are immaculate. The plot is rich, and as complicated as allegiances and trust. Tom is very believable andhuman, such as when we see him vomiting. We all have a heart,emotions, and conscience; Tom supresses these elements as heknows they will be weaknesses in this dangerous world. Do wesupress ours?</fullReview>

Phrases like "What's the rumpus?" and "Always with the high hat" aren't heard in too many crime films, where verisimilitude is considered necessary for a "realistic" depiction of criminal enterprise. The setting seems to be some mythical second tier city with little connection to a larger crime syndicate, and the period seems to be perhaps the twenties, with some of the cops still wearing handlebar moustaches. If you've read anything about the Coen Bros., you know they grew up as film junkies, enamored of Hercules movies and Don Siegel style '50s B flicks. "Miller's Crossing" is a thesis movie, a comment on the remote, mythical world of film, with little regard for any kind of faithful depiction of American crime. In this regard, it has a lot in common with the works of Sergio Leone. The "Danny Boy" sequence is one of the few examples in recent memory of a scene in a movie that clobbers you with its greatness before you are told by some film critic that it is a valid "great scene."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's nothing more foolish than a man chasing his hat - except anyone who misses this film. Fred McMurray, now lying in his grave, wishes he had done Double Indemnity the way Gabriel Byrne does Miller's crossing. Forget every film noir gangster film you've ever seen. The Coen brothers stand on the summit of that genre with this masterpiece of violence, irreverent humor, and the best shot ever made of a decomposed body lying in the woods, heightened only by the laughter of Tick-Tack.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When the Coen brothers make a movie I am almost sure I will not be disappointed. Even in the movies not as good as 'Blood Simple' and 'Fargo' there is enough to enjoy. I had that with 'Raising Arizona', 'Barton Fink' and 'The Hudsucker Proxy' and I really had that with 'The Big Lebowski', 'O Brother, Where Art Thou', 'The Man Who Wasn't There' and now finally 'Miller's Crossing'. This movie is a gangster movie although it never really feels that way. I have that feeling with most of the Coen movies and in a way I like it.The movie is good. The story is pretty clever and everyone does what's expected from him. The little things make this movie a little better than just good. The opening shot is one of them. The dialogue is another, although sometimes it feels a little too clever for real people. I also had that with 'Pulp Fiction'. There it worked really well, here it works really well for most of the time. As you expect from the Coens everything looks great. I mentioned the opening shot but there are more. In one scene a whole police force is shooting at a club because there is someone in that club shooting at them. It looks beautiful. And I must not forget the performances. Gabriel Byrne as Tom, Marcia Gay Harden as Verna and Steve Buscemi as Mink are good, Jon Polito as Johnny Caspar, Albert Finney as Leo and John Turturro as Bernie are even better. I think the greatest performance was from J.E. Freeman as Eddie Dane. All this together make 'Miller's Crossing' a very good movie and if you like movies from the Coen brothers, crime movies or actually just movies in general you have to see this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>excellent 90s version of an old gangster flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie reminded me of an old Warner Brothers gangster flick--the sort of ones that Humphrey Bogart and Jimmy Cagney made famous BUT with the addition of blood, violence and a little bit of sex to make it for a contemporary audience. Plus, in addition to these updates, the plot is quite a bit more complicated and the characters' motivations (especially the lead's) are often unclear. The movie's language, especially, seemed straight out of this Hollywood past and was very enjoyable. The acting, writing and direction really couldn't have been much better. It was especially exciting to watch the characters LEO and CASPER chew up the scenes like Edward G. Robbinson! Despite this film coming from the Coen brothers, it is NOT a comedy, though there are a few mildly amusing moments.Also, because of the high level of gore (and a scene of a person puking in close-up), the movie was given an R-rating and should not be seen by kids.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Joel and Ethan, I love these guys!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How do they do it? How do these two guys get such talent and get it to work, time after time? Amazing? You bet. Hey, even their dogs, e.g., "The Hudsucker Proxy," are great. [I'm still mystified that some people didn't like Raising Arizona] But, this film, dark, moody, sparked by stellar performances by Finney, Bryne, Turturro, Buscemi and of course, the lovely Marcia Gay Harden. The comments here have touched on the many fine points that make this a paragon of the genre of film noir but let just say something about the music. Carter Burwell, who has done a number of things with the Coens has outdone himself. The opening credits begin with an oboe solo playing the haunting traditional Irish theme Limerick Lament which is spliced in several places throughout the film and then returns as the final credits role. Now, as an oboist and fanatic fan of traditional Irish music, I was taken in from the start. But, Burwell's other pieces and arrangements work so well with the whole film. The soundtrack CD is fantastic. This whole effort on the part of these brothers who have never disappointed me yet is utterly awesome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A certain lack of realism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, this is a very good film. In fact, I just watched it for the third time. But I can never give it better than an 8 because of one major lapse in realism. During the movie, Tom (Gabriel Byrne) is punched hard (bare knuckles) in the face no fewer than 7 times, he is thrown down a set of stairs, and twice kicked in the head by grown men (not to mention he suffers a series of brutal body blows). All this is supposed to happen within 2-3 days. Yet, at the end of the movie, Tom is walking around just fine and barely has a marked on his pretty face. Gimme a break! This part of the movie is so stupid, it almost ruins an otherwise great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Revisionist '30s gangster flick a la Coen Bros.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MILLER'S CROSSING (1990) ***1/2 Gabriel Byrne, Albert Finney, Marcia Gay Harden, John Turturro, Jon Polito, J. E. Freeman, Steve Buscemi. The Coen Brothers sterling salute to gangster flicks of the Thirties with grandstanding production values, trademark snarky humor and Barry Sonnenfeld's all-over-the-map photography encapsulates the small world of beat-upon Byrne as a henchman on the outs to influential mob leader Finney (clearly enjoying every second onscreen) and finds himself in the middle of a gang war while involved with a nowhere affair with his boss' skirt and the target of several setups/backstabbing/double-crosses. Fine overall actingwise and one standout sequence after another (i.e. Turturro's `look into your heart' begging for his life and Finney's dispatching of would-be assassins to the tune of `Danny Boy' {!}). Look sharp for filmmaker Sam Raimi as a smirking gunman. And what exactly is up with the hat symbolism? I get it but many may not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just took too long to go about its business. Why watch this when you can watch the real thing (The Godfather)?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It wastes an hour and fifteen minutes before it gets interesting. Then very quickly gets boring again.I don't like Gabrielle Byrne, I don't like Marcia Gay Harden, I don't like Albert Finney; the music matches the irish characters, but turns the action into a tele-movie. Like many Coen efforts every moment plays out too slowly. Every moment drags. Its tone is so only half funny you're always wondering whether its a parody or serious: and it ends up not effective as either.The cinematography was the biggest disappointment, and the biggest factor in making this looking like a tele-movie trying to do a gangster movie. From Barry Sonnenfeld, who everybody talks about, I expected something flashy. I expected Godfather-quality evocative pools of light: what I got was the Coens' usual cartoony over-bright, too-colourful look, which suits a gangster story about as well as the music does.The gems are few and far between: the scene where the little boy pulls the wig off the corpse twenty minutes in is a gem. Steve Buscemi. John Turturro. When Turturro returns at one hour fifteen.This was a laboured, uninteresting movie experience for me.4/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pornographic Violence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gone are the days when an ultra violent exercise like Miller's Crossing would earn an X rating. The film attempts a more realistic approach to gangland Chicago during the 1930s. If you can imagine those old George Raft pictures, with the addition of modern permissiveness for onscreen displays of real gut wrenching violent action, then you have this. I just can't get past the violence this film delivers. Its too much, not in quantity but in quality, and just stays with you in a bad way. And I don't think that is a talent moviemaking-wise. In fact, I think it would be rather simple to do. But all of the major scenes that involve death bother me greatly, to the point where I won't watch it again. The fact is, that this stuff didn't or doesn't happen in real life. So why do we make films like this? I mean think about it, is this any more redeeming than filming people having consensual sex? As the conventional wisdom answers this question for me, I feel secure in declaring us as humans, a warped species.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst Coen brothers movie ever made...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sloppy, dark, confusing, excessively mean-spirited &amp; violent, this movie also has some of the worst acting in any movie I've ever seen, not just by the brothers Coen. Gabriel Byrne, normally a fine actor, has about 6 distinctly different accents in this but mumbles so much (or the sound is just plain bad) you can't understand most of his lines. The Coens must have been letting out a lot of aggressions between shovels slammed in the face &amp; one scene where Byrne is pounded in the belly about 25 or 30 times (&amp; in the immediate next scene is blithely strolling about with no apparent ill-effects). I waited 10 years to watch this. It wasn't worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I got to tell you, when I saw this film last week. I thought it was a astonishing movie. I was left speechless. Miller's Crossing was one in a few Coen Brothers films that I haven't seen. Now I need to see tow more of their films: The Hudsucker Proxy and Blood Simple. When I first heard of this film and around the time I have heard of The Coen Brothers, I had no idea this film was directed by them. I thought it was directed by Martin Scorsese. Anyway, this is arguably the best film by the Coen Brothers. I mean, it was a good movie. This is my first time seeing this film so I need to see it again sometime. I hope someday it will be released on DVD. Because I have a Surround Sound so when the action sequences are on, the box will tremble. Excellent gangster movie. I recommend it.10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I didn't enjoy it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know that this film gets a lot of good reputation, but I do not see why there is all the fuss about this film. Personally, I did not like it or care for it. I found it difficult to follow, and I found the story to be slow-moving and the plot and characters to be unengaging. Generally speaking, I think the detail to the period was done quite well, but as a story, it lacked the ability to hold my attention. And, the best character was that little chubby, unintelligent kid. He should have been the star of the film. Maybe I will catch this again at some point to see if I feel differently about the film in a second viewing, but I must say that this film really put me off during the first viewing that you'd probably have to tie me down and force my eyes open (think Clockwork Orange) in order to rewatch this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Like Crime Films, But This Is Too Nasty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't mind this on the first viewing but in two subsequent attempts over the last 5-8 years, I couldn't finish the film either time. It was just too profane with way too many abuses of the Lord's name in vain and filled with too many unlikeable sadistic-like characters. In other words, this is too hard-edged, at least for me, and I love crime films.Neo-noir might be the proper label for this film, a noirish look at a gangster war between the Irish and Italians in Boston, Mass. It focuses on Gabriel Byrne's character who tries to play both sides and getting in trouble for it. Albert Finney is another Irish mob guy while Jon Polito, John Turturro, Steve Buscemi and others are the Italians. Marcia Gay Harden plays a love interest. How she fit in here, ethnically, I don't know.I have to say the cast fit the picture well, some coming across very convincingly as tough, double-crossing gang members. If you like really hard-nosed, profane characters set back in the "old" days, you'll like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is ridiculous. The most painful part of the film is when each actor opens their mouth. Give me a break...all of the brothers films are much better than this one. The only reason you morons like this is because it is a "oldschool gang flick" with all the token scenes you would expect. This does not hold a candle to any true film depicting the era. I will admit that the scene where the hit men come to kill Leo is pretty amazing, but that is about as good as it gets. All you who put this in a top category need to go watch some real gangster films. PS - Gabriel Bryne is the SAME character in every single movie...but it only works in Usual Suspects...that is it.</fullReview>
