		<shortDescription>Hilarios and slightly poignant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very intelligent, hilarious, and slightly poignant movie. The 'dinner' of the title is a regular gathering at which some smug young Parisian gentlemen compete to invite the most amusingly ridiculous character as their guest. Pierre Brochant (Thierry Lhermitte) believes he has a sure winner in François Pignon (played brilliantly by Jacques Villeret) whose passion is the construction of intricate models from matchsticks. Ironically, it is Brochant who ends up looking the fool, morally if not intellectually. And it is the slightly sad but hilarious antihero Pignon who emerges as far the wiser of the two. Despite the premise, which seems to offends some delicate souls, this is a very humane, as well as witty, movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guess Who Is Coming For Dinner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A group of well-to-do snobbish and obnoxious professionals have dinner parties every Wednesday to which each of them is required to bring an "idiot" as a guest. The victims have no idea that they are invited merely to be humiliated and their boorish "sponsors" compare their notes later to determine whose "idiot" was the best. Pierre Brochant( Thierry Lhermitte), the smug publisher thinks that he's got a winner in the tax accountant François Pignon (Jacques Villeret, sadly passed away in January 2005 - great French Comedian whose performance in "Robert and Robert" I enjoyed very much) who reproduces the famous landmarks with the matchsticks and would talk about them with never ending enthusiasm. Unfortunately for Pierre (but fortunately for us, the viewers) he throws his back just before the dinner and has to rely to Pignon's sincere generosity. The tables are turned and look who is an idiot after all...With the modest running time of 80 minutes, the "Dinner Game" is a delightful and very funny comedy. I would not expect anything else from Francis Veber, the director of Le Jouet, (1976) aka The Toy , La Ch?vre, (1981) aka Knock On Wood, Les Comp?res, (1983) ... aka ComDads, and Les Fugitifs, (1986) and the writer for Le Grand blond avec une chaussure noire, (1972) ... aka The Tall Blond Man with One Black Shoe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the funniest movies, ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Le dîner de cons (Dinner Game)" is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. I have been watching it for more than twenty (20) times, and every time I could capture new details and see it under new angles, making me laugh again and again. Jacques Villeret (aka Francois Pignon) and Thierry Lhermitte (aka Pierre Brochant) both play great roles and I particularly liked a couple of scenes (plus many others): 1) where Francois Pignon has been asked to call Just Leblanc and received very confusing explanation from Pierre Brochant about how someone's name could be "just" Leblanc and 2) of course the phone discussion itself where finally Francois Pignon makes a movie production deal with Just Leblanc, but eventually forgot to mention Pierre's wife... Lots of hilarious situations and true overall Chef d'Oeuvre!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Le Diner de Cons" is one of those great comedies that the French know really well how to produce: The action is fast, the scenes are hilarious, and the viewer just can't stop laughing as totally extraordinary things happen in totally ordinary circumstances. The mastery in this type of films is that they need not be big-budget productions ("LDdC" has been actually shot mostly inside a single apartment), while they manage to achieve a very high rating for their impeccable viewing pleasure they bring to us."LDdC" is about a group of rather cruel friends, who have fun by organizing dinners in which they invite idiots and get amused by them. The winner is the one who will bring the biggest idiot, and Pierre (Lhermitte) thinks he was found the world champion in the face of Francois Pignon (Villeret). He therefore decides to invite him in his house for a drink, and then take him to the dinner. However, things do not go as planned, as during Pignot's stay in Pierre's house unbelievable things begin to happen...Villeret is simply amazing in his role as Pignon, standing above everyone else in this film. This should not mean that the other performances are not good, however: In fact, everyone does a good job, despite the fact that most actors perform very short appearances."LDdC" is a movie that will make you laugh, but in fact, it will also make you think; behind the fun, the film conveys a very humane and meaningful message. Don't miss it! 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The wealthy editor Pierre Brochant (Thierry Lhemitte) and his friends have a competition: every Wednesday, each one of them invites the dumbest jackass he can find for a dinner, where each one of the guests is invited to talk about himself as much as possible. Later, after the guests say goodbye, the group of friends makes fun and elects the more stupid and imbecile guest. Pierre invites François Pignon (Jacques Villeret), a man that works in the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and makes "maquettes" of matches to forget his beloved wife, who had went away with a friend of him two years ago, for the dinner. However, a tough pain in one vertebra of his spinal column does not allow Pierre to meet his friends for the game and he stays alone with solicitous, but clumsy and stupid François in his apartment. Every attempt of François helping Pierre goes wrong, becoming the night of Pierre a terrible nightmare."Le Diner de Cons" is a witty theatrical movie, practically set in the room of an apartment. However, on the contrary of what a reader may think, it is one of the best comedies I have ever seen, and I do not recall the last time I have laughed this way. The work of Jacques Villeret as an authentic jackass, with a stupid grin and trying to help Pierre, is amazing. The dialogs and situations are very intelligent and hilarious. I highly recommend this film, awarded with three "César" and two "Lumiere Award", for one of those days when the viewer is upset or stressed, for a perfect relaxation. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "O Jantar dos Malas" ("The Dinner of the Jackasses")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious - definitely recommended</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll keep it short and sweet. This movie was hilarious - even if you've never watched a French movie in your life, this is one of the quirkiest movies you'll ever see. I was laughing the entire time. The acting was good and the directing average. But the writing and screenplay were absolutely fantastic. You don't need to know French to watch it as long as you can get your hands on a copy with subtitles. Many foreign movies require you pay attention to the imagery, etc., thus making it hard for those needing subtitles. In this one the script carries the movie. I watched Le Diner de cons about 5 or 6 years ago, and it definitely sparked my interest in foreign movies 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a great comedy held up by two great actors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before this film was released in 1998, it was, originally, a play. This play was performed on stage in 1993 and had a huge success. Francis Weber felt like adapting his play (he was the author) for the screen and he had a good idea. The action takes place in a beautiful Parisian flat. Pierre Brochant (Thierry Lhermitte) lives there and each week, he and his friends take part in a special dinner: a "dîner de cons". They've got to invite someone silly and the one who has found the best dumb is the winner of the evening. Brochant has chosen François Pignon (Jacques Villeret) and before going to the dinner, Brochant has invited him in his flat. Then, in a few minutes, everything's wrong: his wife's leaving him, he's got a backache, he's got to face his mistress etc.... and Pignon is a bit responsible for this! There are two main types of comic in this film: on one hand the comic comes from the dialogues which are very funny with a lot of successful puns. Moreover they're never vulgar. On the other hand, the comic comes from the situation where Brochant is: not only has he got to face Pignon but he's got to face unexpected events like the arrival of a fiscal inspector (Daniel Prévost). Above all, the film is worth watching for its incredible main actors: Lhermitte who is the perfect hypocrite and Villeret who is full of goodwill and kindness in spite of its idiocy and its naivety (in 1999, he won the Oscar for the best actor in France and he deserved it). Moreover, the other actors are very well used, especially Francis Huster and Daniel Prévost who are both excellent. The only weaknesses of this film are the moment where Prévost comes in Brochant's flat and then the plot is resolved very laboriously. The other moment is when Pignon is calling Mrs Brochant to tell her his real thoughts about her husband: you've got a quite conventional dialogue. Nevertheless, if you want to have a good time, watch this comedy it's worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very funny in a slightly cruel way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pierre Brochant and his friends have a weekly dinner party where each invites an idiot they meet to attend. They then let the `idiots' talk and laugh at them - each week the winner is the one who brings the biggest idiot. However this week Brochant's idiot, François Pignon arrives at his house to find that he has injured his back and cannot go. About to leave, Pignon stops when the answer-phone reveals a message that Brochant's wife is leaving him. He tries to help the situation and Brochant sort of needs him to, but he can't help but make things a little worse every time.The premise of this film made it sound like it was set at the dinner party of the title and it put me of a little as I didn't like the cruel sound of it. However the actual plot occurs in Brochant's flat, but it does still have a cruel streak that is a little unpleasant. Because Pignon is such a nice little man it is hard to see him so openly reviled and mocked by Brochant, I know the plot requires it but it was done with more than a little malice and at times left a bitter taste in the mouth. However, for the majority the film is actually very funny in a slight way. The laughs generally come from buffoonery from Pignon at Brochant's expense!The plot does turn around to be one of lessons towards the end which is good, and the story does have a good message of acceptance through it. The actors do pretty well with their broad characters, although they are allowed a little expansion towards the end of the film. Lhermitte's cold hearted bastard is a little to hard and cruel without enough in the way of being judged by the film. Villeret makes the film and perfectly makes Pignon a likeable and warm little fellow but still undeniably makes him the type of person who you would cross the road to avoid. The beauty of this is that, when Brochant learns his lesson, we as the audience also learn something too. Support roles are good but this film is mostly a double-hander which the two leads carry well.Light and funny despite the slightly cruel nature of the plot, this film is well worth a watch. The humour is very much situation based and relies on plot devices to move it on, but it's quite fresh and amusing and makes for an enjoyable 90 minutes.</fullReview>

The winner is the one who can find the perfect «con», the king of idiots! From beginning to end, this movie makes you laugh. Excellent performances by Thierry Lhermitte (one of the top French actor today) and Jacques Villeret. Watch it again, you'll laugh more than the first time!7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Amazing! This word describes perfectly the simplicity and the incredible sense of humour of this movie! The plot is really too straight to follow, as it is very simple: Pierre and his friends do, once a week, a "special dinner" to make fun of stupid guys they meet, and their absurd stories. They call it "idiot's dinner". For them it's like a championship where they try to find the dumbest guy on earth! But this time Pierre can't go to the dinner, because he hurt himself when he was playing golf, so he must stays in his own home. However, he had already invited Mr Pignon (the dumb guy) to the dinner and when Mr Pignon arrived, Pierre's nightmare will begin! This movie is really funny because it transforms little common circumstances into hilarious sequences! For example, a simple phone call is turned into a hilarious scene! I mean, I cried of laughing when I was watching this movie! There are four/five scenes that are really funny and simple at the same time. It proves that is not needed a large budget to make a great film. In fact, this movie even seems to be adapted from a theatrical play. I don't know if it is or not, but it seems so, because of the simplicity of its setting (almost all the film is shot inside Pierre's apartment).About the acting: It's done a very good work, especially by Jacques Villeret, the actor which plays Mr Pignon's character. He's really impressive as a dumb! He's truly a world champion! It's not the first time I watched this movie, I had already seen it some years ago when it was released in theatres; but today, when I watched it on DVD, I laughed as much as I was seeing it for the very first time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guess Who's Ruining Your Dinner?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is set almost entirely in the living room of an apartment with a spectacular view of Paris, and involves dupes, mistaken identities, pratfalls and misdirection. Once a month, wealthy and handsome book publisher Pierre Brochant (French heart throb Thierry Lhermitte) organises a dinner party with several of his friends, in which their sole purpose is to compete for the honour of who can invite the best "idiot." Desperate to find his latest dupe, Pierre is tipped off about a man named François Pignon (Jacques Villeret), a tax inspector who rambles on and on about a collection of monuments he made entirely out of matchsticks. Inviting him to his home under the guise of wanting to publish a book about his collection, Brochant seriously injures his back just prior to Pignon's arrival. Thus it is that they never quite make their dinner - or do they? Judge for yourself. With great hilarity, the intended victim and his victimizer reverse roles. In short shrift, Pignon manages to aggravate Brochant's back injury, permanently alienate the man's wife Christine (Alexandra Vandernoot) and his mistress Marl?ne Sasseur (Catherine Frot), and set in motion an audit by the very angry tax inspector Juste Leblanc (Francis Huster). This is a light and perfectly digestible fare, in the genre of the classic French farce. Bon appétit!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deliceuse comedie française</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Refreshing comedy replete with subtlety, punning and panache, this film evidently derives from a stage play (confirmed by a French contributor in his commentary). Witty repartee flows throughout its eighty minutes (slightly shortened here in Spain in a recent viewing on TV), allowing diverse nuances as the situational comedy builds up and becomes intermeshed in cross-purpose intentions and priorities. Almost `borrowing' from the classical theatre of this genre, such as `Boeing, Boeing' back in the late fifties, `Le Dîner de Cons' is a refined comedy almost totally carried out in a luxury Parisian flat. Jacques Villeret is magnificent as a steadfast modeller with match-sticks - the invited idiot. His playing of the part keeps on line, such that it never veers off into the ridiculous or absurd, and the result is enchanting, charming, endearing. Well supported by Lhermitte, Huster and Prévost above all, the dialogues are at once sharp and hugely touching. Unfortunately, of course, you will lose a lot of the wit in any sub-titled or dubbed version, so do get your best French well and truly polished up.Totally different Franco-Belgian `comedy' but with that transcendental background, is the highly recommendable film `Le Huiti?me Jour' (1996) (qv) directed by Jaco van Dormael. In both cases my reaction is the same: Chapeau! Merci beaucoup! Both these films are thoroughly enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just because someone looks and sounds like an idiot doesn't mean that he is not one?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the face of Steve Carrel in "The Dinner of Schmucks" remake, I knew they got the meaning of the word totally wrong, 'cons' is not about being retarded or eccentric, it's a state of mind, something that doesn't strike the eyes, not at first sight anyway."Con" is a generic insult in France that takes a lot of meanings, it either refers to a dumb or extremely naive person, a socially awkward geek, a dork, someone so blinded by a passion that he can't realize how ridicule he is in the eyes of common people, stupid is not the most faithful synonym, because a 'con' can have a high I.Q, but what do they all have in common, they don't have the intelligence of the situation, and are the target of mean-spirited people who use them as foils to appear smarter, and that they can easily be fooled allows society to label them as 'idiots'. This is sad but true, and Veber's "Diner de Cons" aka "The Dinner Game" builds its plot on a cruel purpose with mean spirited snobs inviting idiots to elect a winner at the end of the evening, and Thierry Lhermitte aka Pierre Brochant, a wealthy publisher, is one of these bad guys.There is a French word to describe a man like Brochant, a 'salaud', a bastard if you prefer, a guy eager to make fun of less smart people, while the so-called Dinner Game can be seen as a tacit bullying, all these dumb-chasers would argue that they don't harm anyone because the purpose of the game is not to let the idiots know why they were invited. It's like 'a crime without victims'. And the players really take their hateful game seriously, each participant having a sort of scout to find the right idiot, either a colleague eager to express some 'new' ideas, a man with strange hobbies, finding a good idiot is not that an easy task. And one day, Brochant receives a phone call from a friend who found a 'world champion': Jacques Villeret as François Pignon, a civil servant working in the Minister of Treasury and building replicas of landmarks with matchsticks, what a promising pedigree! Many people tend to minimize the emphasis on the word 'con' by arguing that we're all the idiots of someone. While it might be true, it doesn't appear to be the message of the film where the personality traits are clearly defined. While not a plain idiot, Pignon is a sweet and lovable buffoon and despite his meanness, Pierre Brochant strikes as a brilliant and intelligent person. The film doesn't try to reverse roles to demonstrate the former idea, and the lyrics of the opening song brilliantly deliver the message that age has nothing to do with brains, when we're an idiot; we're an idiot, period. The genius little song from George Brassens foreshadows the inevitability of the mayhem caused by François Pignon, directly affecting Pierre Brochant's life. And it all starts with the nice twist (indeed) when Brochant hurts his back while golfing and is forced to cancel his participation. After discovering how brilliantly dumb François Pignon is, he decides to go anyway, much to the reluctance of his wife, who therefore leaves him.The movie takes off when Brochant is left alone, incapable to move and with Pignon trying to help him, to see where his wife have gone. And as soon as the movie starts (the set-up took a little time, but for the best) the film features a succession of never-ending misunderstandings, gaffes, and remarkable displays of clumsiness that elevate "The Dinner Game" to a masterpiece level in the comedy of errors genre. Surprisingly, the film is mostly set in Brochant's luxurious apartment, conveying a sort of trapped sensation. The film is adapted from a play written by Francis Veber and the unity of time, space and plot contributes to a coherent plot getting crescendo, each disaster provoked by Pignon leading to a bigger disaster when he tries to make up for the first. In the progress, other characters make their entrance, Brochant's ex-friend played by a brilliant Francis Huster, Just Leblanc (whose name will create one of the most hilarious cases of misunderstanding in French cinema) not to mention the scene-stealing performance of Daniel Prevost as François's friend, a hard-nosed tax inspector. Alexandra Van Der Noot and Catherine Frot also deserve accolades for the two female parts that will get mixed up by the poor Mr. Pignon.The casting, while minimalist, is enough to conduct the movie with laughs and laughs, creating one of the greatest and most unanimously praised French comedies and Veber's true masterpiece. Indeed, Veber's comedies often relied on the simple but efficient buddy duo, with the white-faced clown and the Auguste, when the laughs mostly came from the reactions of the straight guy rather than the actions of the funny one, but this time, there's also a cynical yet delightful pleasure from seeing the Lhermitte character so tormented. His nightmarish journey seems deserved, and it would take a lot of pains to feel sorry for him because his wife left him, after all, she left him because he wanted to play a humiliating game. Not a villain or an antagonist, he's still a hardly redeemable character, and all the laughs are mixed with the satisfaction to see him get through this pain. As he'd say to Pignon, he avenged in one night all the idiots who ever participated to dinner games before, and he couldn't be truer.But as usual, Veber films don't take their 'seriousness' with seriousness, when we know where the film is going to, we're immediately surprised by a twist that gets the final spice, a masterpiece of wit, sophistication, laughs and cynicism, leading to one major conclusion : never take one's personality for granted. Indeed, just because someone looks and sounds like an idiot doesn't mean that he is not one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Situation comedy has got itself a bad name over the years, but at its best, this is undeserved - think, for example, of 'Fawlty Towers', of which this film reminds me. The similarities are clear: exaggerated but essentially believable characters pushed into absurd situations by malign circumstances; great writing; and impeccable performances, which in 'Le Diner du Cons' come from the perfectly balanced double act of Thierry Lhermitte and Jaques Villeret. Moreover, the particular premise - of the comeuppance of a smug Parsian bourgeois who invites idiots to dinner to laugh at them - is fresh, and while this might not be the deepest of movies, it never over-cooks itself and leaves you after just 75 minutes still wanting more: a light and delicious movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE DINNER GAME (Francis Veber - France 1998).It's always a joy to see an old-fashioned but very funny farce. Pierre Brochant is a smug Parisian riche who has the habit of playing a game with his wealthy upper-class friends to see who can bring the biggest idiot to a dinner party. When an acquaintance has found him a candidate, monsieur François Pignon - the biggest idiot of all time - he gets more than he bargained for when Pignon unwittingly bulldozes through Pierre's life and everything comes crashing down upon him.This French comedy by Francis Veber, a huge hit in France, was based on his own 1992 stage play. It's a bit in the old screwball mode of classic Hollywood, think DINNER AT EIGHT (1932), with some echos of Neil Simon and Billy Wilder. If you like those, you will no doubt have a good time watching this comic farce. But as far as comedies of errors are concerned, the French have a long tradition of their own.Apart from a few outdoor scenes in the beginning, the film is set entirely in one Parisian living room with just a few actors. It's nothing more than a filmed play, quite static, but the cast consists exclusively of comedy pros. Thierry Lhermitte as the wealthy Parisian snob and Jacques Villeret as the grand idiot, form a wonderful team. Now, I'm gonna find me an idiot.Camera Obscura --- 8/10</fullReview>

The acting and comedy is faultless bringing me to tears of laughter on several occasions.Jacques Villeret portrayal of the oafish Pignon is one of the best comedy performances I have ever seen, up there with the Marx Bros and other greats like Laurel and Hardy. This however is not mere slapstick and the mental cruelty of Thierry Lhermitte's character is all too familiar in the clique based social circles I am sure most of us have encountered.I would recommend this to anyone with a penchant for intelligent farce.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>After all, he was just a complete fool</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pierre Brochant (Thierry Lhermitte) and his friends have a contest for every Wednesday dinner that consist in invite a fool that they know and have fun with them all the dinner. Pierre find in Francois Pignon (Jacques Villeret) his own gem for the dinner but he can't go due to a problem with his back. Now Pierre must deal with this fool all the night in his apartment.A couple of months ago i watch a film of Francis Veber for the first time in a festival and i enjoy it so when i found a DVD of another film of Veber i decide to get it. I didn't know what to expect of "Le Diner de cons" but if i were expecting a very funny comedy with an hilarious character, definitely this film was the perfect to fill my expectations. I really like this film, first because it has a very original contest as the main subject that is very cruel too,but we never see the reactions of Pierre's friends about Pignon, actually the entire film is in Pierre's apartment so the characters must have a lot of great lines and funny situations to keep going with the film in the same place. And that's the second thing i really like of this film, the character of Pignon. This man could be a really headache to anybody who meet him, making any situation a big problem. And is played in a great way by Jacques Villeret. The support characters are just fun, specially Pignon's friend who loves football (that scene, when both are talking in the phone, in probably my favourite).And the final message of the film could be the classic one, actually it is but the very last scene is really great and change everything because after all, he was just a complete fool.Conclusion: i enjoyed a lot this film,which runtime is only 80 minutes, and left me desires to continue checking Veber's filmography. And yes there is a good message for all the Pierres around but also another that says: don't trust in fools. 9.5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Idiots are fair game," everyone agrees in THE DINNER GAME. It doesn't take much to figure out who's coming to dinner... "This tops my wildest dreams," says the boor, Brochant (Thierry Lhermitte), when he meets his soon-to-be "guest of honor," the redoubtable Pignon. Things quickly go awry and it's Lhermitte's deadpan reactions to Villeret's Pignon that are absolutely priceless; Buster Keaton himself would be impressed. When a friend vouches for Pignon- "He's no fool."-, Brochant immediately plunges ahead with making Pignon memorize his lies. The tables are inadvertently turned again and again as the hole is dug deeper and deeper. Just when it looks like a sappily-ever-after ending, the rug is yanked out from under us one last time. Lots of fun, and not a bad idea at all for a dinner party...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When Aristo and Molier write a play together.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was long long time ago I have watched this movie. 'A nice French movie' I thought and never forget it. I liked Aristotales when I was kid in school. His plays always make me have constant smile that it looks like it is stuck on my face. My other hero is Molier, a version of Aristo that more close to my century.Now, I can clearly see why I do like the movie. Because Le Diner de Cons includes all the things that I like in both writers' plays. Clear dialogs, nice easy links in the play that you can connect and over the top very clever jokes. Aristo and Molier used that a lot in their plays. Their characters were using the very low level comedy, like falling in a stupid way and highest level of comedy black humor. Francis Veber is using his teachers' idea in a very clever way.This movie is a classic in comedy. Actors are very well performed and easy humor combines with black humor on every step. That is easy because the characters in the play already from 2 different worlds. So, when ever one of them is making black humor, the other one backup the viewer with easy humor. In this big chaos you finally found yourself smiling without control and you cannot stop. The writer Francis Veber carries you to the top of the hill and throws you down from the hill. Even when the movie ends you cannot stop anymore because till the last scene he still paunches you to roll down faster.I wish I could see this play at a theater one day.Well done! ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Le Dîner de Cons (1998)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wonderfully simple, but emotionally engaging comedy. The film takes its audience on a wonderful journey as we start feeling very sorry for Villeret. The film is very cruel towards him at first. He's just a sweet, naive man looking for some acceptance. He soon turns into the guest from hell, as his lack of intelligence does turn into annoyance. Finally, his acts bring justice upon those that would make fun of him. It's a feel good comedy, that gradually builds an unexpected friendship. It's also nice to see the characters in on the joke as well. Too often comedies have their own characters ignore the hilarity around them. The dialogue is quick and witty and the film does what it can in its space and time. About to be remade with Paull Rudd and Steve Carrell, the trailer for that promises to expand on the events, but will the heart and humor remain intact? This is a mini French gem.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Le Diner de Cons is, in every possible way, an enjoyable movie. It's funny, it's witty, it's well written, it's fantastically acted. In all honesty, though, I can't really see any justification for its cult status or the raving reviews; in the end, it's a comedy, and nothing more, and a pretty cruel and crude one at that, with an old-fashioned and non-PC value system, though it almost redeems itself in that aspect a couple of times. French culture and mentality do play a part, for sure, but frankly I can see the exact same movie being released in English and getting much less critical attention.But once again - the film is a comedy, and it's a funny one. And since it's a very minimalistic in scope and setting, the comedy rests mostly on the shoulders of the two leads, who both deliver hilariously. At under 80 minutes, it's just entertaining enough to make for a good watch and good fun.</fullReview>

The humor comes from situations the misunderstandings. The story is refreshingly simple, the script is perfect, and the acting is superb. This film also shows how one can create excellent entertainment with low budget (a fantastic value). The film is in French and I watched the DVD with its excellent English subtitles.

Guess who has found an idiot for the next dinner party. Only don't say poor Mr Pignon yet. Pierre may not know it but the night of their meeting will forever change his life. Soon it will be poor Pierre.This film is hilariously funny. Mr Pignon is so dear and so sincere that he doesn't know he is causing Pierre's life to fall apart. The trouble is he is just trying to help. Is Mr Pignon a total idiot OR is he just playing dumb because he's really smart?? Just sit back and enjoy this ride!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Francis Veber's movie "Le dîner de cons" ("The Dinner Game" in English) is the same type of comedy as "Planes, Trains and Automobiles": a "normal" man is forced into a situation with a complete boor, only to have the joke turned on him. In this case, stuffy Pierre (Thierry Lhermitte) invites dimwitted François (Jacques Villeret) to dinner with the aim of making him out to be the stupidest person there...but things don't go as planned. Hilarious stuff ensues.There was an American remake of this movie, but I only heard negative things about it, as can be expected with American remakes of foreign movies. So, I'll stick to the original version and luxuriate in the goofy predicaments that the not-so-brainless François creates. I definitely recommend it. Also starring Francis Huster, Alexandra Vandernoot, Daniel Prévost and Catherine Frot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quick, simple and hysterical farce with a nice moral</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It doesn't get much more classic than a French farce, which is exactly what "Les Diner de Cons" or "The Dinner Game" is at heart. Francis Veber's film stays sharper than most modern farces, however, by merely being able to stick with just a handful of characters and only a couple subplots. To weave comic mayhem in such a simplistic way is rare, but "Dinner" focuses on character and a simple message, both of which help transform a timeless comedy formula into a witty, hilarious and surprisingly touching film.It all starts with Jacque Villeret, a versatile actor in both comedic and dramatic ability, who plays the sweet-natured idiot Francois Pignon. Francois is invited by Pierre Brochant, a successful young married man without kids, to a dinner party that Brochant and his friends host each week to see who can bring the biggest idiot to the dinner. Francois qualifies easily with his chubby, balding appearance and his obsession with making models of famous landmarks out of match sticks.Villeret commands this film despite his character behaving subordinately to Pierre, played by Thierry Lhermitte. With the flick of a switch he goes from making the film an outrageous laugh fest to something curious to something poignant. We go wherever he takes us and all the stops are enjoyable.The film takes place essentially in one evening. Pierre has invited Francois over to his apartment prior to the dinner party against his wife Christine's wishes, but earlier that day Pierre threw out his back and he can hardly move. When Pierre receives a phone call from his wife who tells him that she's leaving him for good, the hilarity begins. Out of pity, Francois offers to help Pierre discover where his wife's gone so he can make things right. Pierre agrees, but Francois only continues to muck things up much to our delight with every simple task. And just as it looks like he's about to go home on his merry way, he finds a sneaky way to make himself valuable to Pierre once more.As the film reaches its conclusion (and rather quickly with an 80-minute run time), it becomes abundantly clear that this film is all about posing the obvious question: who's the real idiot? Francois acts it, but it's Pierre's life that's crumbling before him. For a short burst of farcical comedy, that's just the perfect moral to wrap this hysterical tale up with some significance. "The Dinner Game" does not set out with the purpose of only desiring audience laughs, but something they can take away too. You're likely never to think about the bizarre people you meet in the same way again.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A splendid movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not often that I find comedies funny, but this was really amusing.Every week Mr.Brochant (who works in publishing) and his over class and snobby friends have a dinner party where they all should bring an idiot, whereby they afterward decide who had brought the biggest idiot. (It's worth telling that idiot in this context really means a nerd, someone who can tell for hours about their hobby.) In this manner Mr.Pignon suits very well. Mr.Pignon is a humble and nice man who besides working at the tax office and cheering his favorite team Auxerre, makes models of famous buildings with matches. It's a friend of Mr. Brochant who has "found" Mr.Pignon and tipped Mr.Brochant about him. And to get to know him a bit Mr.Brochant invites him to his place in the hours before the dinner. But hey are denied from going to the dinner because of Mr.Brochant's injured back, but before Mr.Pignon gets to leave the apartment things really start to happen.At times I felt really sorry for Pignon, like I suppose almost everybody feels, but at the time develops he's getting funnier and funnier in his always failing attempts to help struggling Brochant. It's not overdone (except from a scene in the beginning where another idiot gets his boomerang in his head) and the dialogs are really good and entertaining. Some of the scenes are worth watching over and over, I never stop loving them.If you don't know french and aren't used to reading subtitles that might be a drawback, but I can highly recommend this movie. It's just lasting 1h20min, which I appreciate. Some movies last too long. If this one was a 2hours-movie things would had to be overdone, but this avoid this trap. Enjoy it!</fullReview>

Reminiscent of films like meet the parents where the characters constantly manage to get themselves into tougher and tougher and more cringe worthy situations. By the end of the film the audience feels very played with. Such a unique film, cleverly written with fantastic mise en scene. The film deals with some complicated and taboo issues yet confronts them daringly, even so much as to derive humour from it. It is impressive that the entire film is basically set in one location and still manages to draw so much drama and comedy and keep the audience interested. Definitely worth watching.

The story is about a group of high society gentlemen who on a weekly basis invite the stupidest person they can find to dinner for their own personal amusement. However, this time the stupidest person invited unwittingly manages to give his sponsor who invited him the comuppance he deserves. It is adapted from the director Francoise Weber's successful play. Like Neil Simon, the humor depends on great characterization and craft, not pratfalls. I am glad that this Veber comedy was not remade by the US, as many of his films (La Cage Aux Folles, The Toy) are, as the cynical and mean spirited sense of humor is a unique to the French and, and not since Billy Wilderhave we had American films comedy that could successfully pull this style off.This is a comedy not to be missed.</fullReview>

Also keep in mind that it's in French with subtitles in case that's a problem for you. Othewise rent it or buy it. You'll be glad you did.This last line is added so IMDb will post it.

For this film however I am not only happy to make an exception I can honestly say the comedy is so good I might have understood +without+ the english subtitles! The facial expressions of the actors involved are as priceless as the ridiculous situations they get themselves into. Just when you think you've got it all sorted out, the writers of the screenplay up the ante in ironically hilarious twists the likes of which are rarely seen in your average Hollywood comedies full of punchlines and quips and non-existant plots. Even at the film's very end when the so-called "idiot" has proven how wrong people were about him, he commits one last great gaffe that screams "STUPID!" and will have you rolling on the floor. Forget Julia Roberts, forget Woody Allen, and forget Chris Tucker - if you want really good laughs rent or buy "The Dinner Game" (American release title) and enjoy a wry comedy you won't soon forget.</fullReview>

Its fast pace was easy to follow and just when I thought it was time for yet another wicked insult to poor Pignon, the latter turned the tables and delivered the film's most touching scene. I only wish we could have seen more of the 'Cons' besides Pignon and Cheval--maybe Veber is saving them up for the sequel. I hope so.</fullReview>

At the end of the film it got prolonged applause from the crowd which is something rarely done at movies anymore.I'm sure that some American director will try to adapt this and make an English-language version of it as is done with all French films.

		<fullReview>This is a beautiful masterpiece of comedy. In today's whiz-bang world of moviemaking, THE DINNER GAME's elegant simplicity is a pleasant change. The pacing is swift revealing the work of a truly skilled director. There was never a slow moment and the laughs were endless. American comedies can have big budgets, fancy sets, special effects and overpriced actors but it'll take a lot more than that to make a truly funny comedy. Incidentally, this is the eighth Francis Veber film that is getting an inferior U.S. remake (this time DreamWorks will do the honors).It's interesting to note that you will never see somebody as ugly as Jacques Villeret (playing Francois Pignon) in an American film. That's one of the sad facts of Hollywood. One of the first changes they'll make in the US version is to find a good looking guy like Brendan Fraser and then make him ugly through makeup but they'd never hire a genuinely goofy-looking guy like Villeret, who also happens to be an extremely talented actor.The comedy, retitled THE DINNER GAME for American audiences, will get a U.S. release in May from Lions Gate Films. This is truly a great film and shouldn't be missed!</fullReview>

How dare they try to have a film industry of their own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been years since we have laughed that much. The screenplay mixes all kinds of comic arts, the situation, the mime and, especially the dialogue. The story is an adaptation from the theatre, and most of the movie takes place in one room. The successful businessman invites an anonymous guest to dinner, just because he is dumb, to make fun of him. But things change, in a sarcastic crescendo, where laughter becomes uninterrupted. Do not miss it. It is a masterpiece</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this movie is the perfect comedy. The situations of the characters are incredibly terrible, yet they are possible ; the movie surprises you because the fun doesn't come from where you expected it ; and the actors bring a really fantastic performance.Thierry Lhermitte interprets the really bad minded guy, making fun of not-too-bright people using his situation. His character lives in a world cut in two : the hosts, bright, intelligent, cynic and sarcastic, detached from the difficulties of the "common man", and the guests, faithful, hopeful, passionate... and dumb. On this other side of the balance, Jacques Villeret, gives us an extraordinary performance. He succeeds in using his gentle and friendly physic to reveal a not-so-dumb guy, accumulating mistakes with good will. Pignon admires Brochant because of his social situation, but he is sad for him because of Brochant's cruelty. He plays a formidable clown and a real touching man... he once again reveals a real talent and shows how great an actor of comedy can be.But the actors are not all that deserves compliments. The story is rich, and well explored. And there's no need for giant sets to see Brochant's cold world crash and change : a single apartment is enough (and they even don't blow it !!!), no special effects (apart from the car crash, which wasn't really necessary to show to let the audience understand)... and still the story goes strong and triggers laughters every second !You really must go and see this movie. Not only is it great entertainment, but it's also a deep reflection on the human nature and how people's behavior transform when they get richer, how they forget the simple pleasures... I wish I could have given 11 to it !</fullReview>

Of course, the fool never catches on..However, we never really DO make it to a full dinner, in this movie.Instead, we find ourselves stuck in a man's apartment, and follow through his dilemma of trying to get rid of his idiot.This movie is kind of like The Cable Guy, but not as silly.

		<fullReview>This French Comedy is better than America's some what classic Dinner at 8. Both films fall under the comedy genre but only, The Dinner Game is funny! An interesting cast of characters, The Dinner Game, much like the dinner in Dinner at 8 never happens. The movie is more about the pre-dinner events as oppose to the dinner itself. A stage comedy, much of the movie happens in one location. A delight and a surprise, the movie is very enjoyable and suitable for most of the members in your French or American family. Thierry Lhermitte is wonderful. His ignorant innocence makes you laugh out loud. He is the backbone of the movie and the draw of the biggest laughs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ever want to attend a dinner party simply to humiliate the guests right in front of them? That is the premise of Le dîner de cons, a comedy from Francis Veber.Thierry Lhermitte plays Pierre, the owner of the apartment in which this party is to take place. Here, he invites François (Jacques Villeret), who is not aware of Pierre's true intentions of the dinner. After a last minute cancellation, Pierre finds himself alone with François and tries to hide the secret that -- for lack of a better word -- he thinks François is an idiot and he was the main attraction for the party.Jacques Villeret is an absolute joy to watch in every single scene. He makes it look easy ranging from slapstick to complete absurdity. Villeret definitely deserved the César he received in 1999. You want more of him every time he's not on screen.Taking place mostly in one apartment, Veber's direction doesn't make it feel like you're watching a filmed play. It feels cinematic. While it's not a laugh a minute, it's without a doubt, a fun, enjoyable ride and Veber knows how to make it work.Having seen the remake in 2010 as "Dinner For Schmucks", Le dîner de cons is simply better in every aspect from writing to acting.The quick pacing and short length makes it enticing for another viewing. Even by the end there is a little moment of disappointment that the film is already over.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Jacques Villeret and Thierry Lhermitte are in top form of their acting,this Francis Veber comedy allows us to recognize the real 'Con'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It would be interesting to view director Francis Veber's comedy film 'Le Dîner de Cons' in the context of a monumental work about laughter written by the great French philosopher Henri Bergson (1859-1951). According to Bergson's theory of laughter, comedy is necessarily human : we laugh at people or the things they do. He goes on to add that laughter is purely cerebral : being able to laugh seems to require a detached attitude, an emotional distance to the object of laughter. Bergson also added that the laughter has a social function. These three points have been perfectly assimilated in 'The dinner game' but with some differences. Firstly, rich people like Pierre Brochant do not simply laugh at ugly people like François Pignon as what they do is more than a simple act of laughter. They mock people whom they consider to be inferior to them in intelligence. This is a very flawed idea as nobody has been given the authority to judge other people's intelligence. Secondly, most acts of laughter shown in 'Le dîner de cons' were not cerebral. This is because a person like Pierre Brochant maintained a lot of emotional contact with people whom he mocked. Thirdly, that laughter has a social function was not properly respected in the film as snobs like Pierre Brochant used innocent simpletons like François Pignon as guinea pigs for their own personal pleasure. They always made it a point to invite idiots for mockery but never cared to invite them for laughter. No prizes for guessing what the difference between mockery and laughter is. As a comedy film, the success of 'Le Dîner de Cons' is quite phenomenal as a lot of its humor is specifically country specific. From this yardstick, it is nice to learn that a French film has been able to make viewers of the entire world laugh heartily. This has to be recognized as this film's redeeming quality as without it, 'The dinner game' would have ended in a fiasco by hurting people more than making them laugh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Le Dîner de Cons" is one of the funniest French movies of all time. It's adapted from a play and this can be guessed when watching the movie since much of the plot is set in the same place, the main character's Parisian apartment. Apart from the actors' pay (all of them are very famous in France), the movie is low budget. While this doesn't sound appealing, let it not fool you. There are sufficient plot twists for it to stay entertaining from start to finish, and the comedy is pure gold. Obviously, the actors are stupendous, delivering believable yet hilariously funny acts. Unlike most French comedies, I believe this movie is very accessible for non-French people, as the humor in it is pretty much universal and simple. I saw the movie when I was 11 or so and I was roaring with laughter. Now I'm 24 and it's still a great movie for me to work my abdominal area. So I can confidently say that it's a comedy accessible for all ages.As is now common for successful French movies, Hollywood remade it to cash in on the great plot idea. And thus we were graced with "Dinner for Schmucks" staring Steve Carell. While I love Carell and many Hollywood comedies, "Dinner for Schmucks" was a disgrace, and can't be compared to the great original French version (the American version is also very different plot-wise although the main idea is the same). So if you have seen and disliked the American remake, let it not stop you from watching "Le Dîner de Cons" which I am absolutely sure you will like, wherever you're from and whoever you are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amusing comedy that takes a while to get going</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>French comedy has always been something of a required taste. Whether it be the madcap, over-the-top physical comedy of Gerard Pires' 1998 Taxi, or the outrageous campness of 1978's La Cage Aux Folles, it's always been a hit-and-miss affair for me. One of France's more critically- acclaimed comedies, Le Diner De Cons (Dinner For Idiots), pretty much sums these feelings up for me. On one hand I found it clever, hilarious, and refreshingly savage, yet on the other hand I found it clumsy, obvious, and a bit up it's own a**e.It tells the story of a Parisian bourgeois Pierre Broachant (Thierry Lhermitte), a successful publisher who every week attends a dinner where the upper class get together and each bring along someone they consider an 'idiot' for their amusement. These 'idiots' are usually someone in a boring job and who have a peculiar interest or hobby. Each week a winner is selected when the biggest idiot is chosen. Pierre can't believe his luck when a friend recommends Francois Pignon (Jacques Villeret), who has a passion for building replicas of famous architecture out of matchsticks. Pierre pretends to be interested in publishing a book of all Francois' works, and invites him round to get a feel for him before taking him to dinner.The day doesn't start well for Pierre when he injures his back playing tennis which renders him unable to attend the dinner, and his wife walks out on him after being tired of his sadistic dinners and overall feeling of arrogant superiority. When Francois arrives, Pierre is gobsmacked at the man's ineptitude and general stupidity, and is visibly excited about the prospect of taking him to dinner. But as the day goes on, Pierre finds it difficult to get rid of him. Francois' lack of social skills land Pierre into hot water, and only digs a bigger hole when he tries to resolve the situation.The film takes a while to get into it's stride, spending the first 30-40 minutes basically showing what arseholes Pierre and his friends are. It's such an obvious and rather lazy attack on upper class arrogance that I failed to raise more than a smile during the first half. It's the kind of social commentary that Bunuel and Godard were so successful at in the 60's and 70's, and especially in the case of Bunuel, were also very funny. Thank God, then, that when the second half kicks in, the comedy starts to hit it's mark and the laughs come. Francois bumbles from one scene to the next - mistaking Pierre's wife for his mistress, inviting a tax inspector over when the house is full of undeclared antiques - and as Pierre disillusionment increases, the laughs come thicker and faster.It's a fantastic performance by Villeret (who sadly died in 2005). He truly is an idiot, and doesn't overplay it . Same can be said for Lhermitte, who has to put in a much more subtle performance in stark contract to the Tati-esque baffoonery of Villeret. Watch this before you see the American remake Dinner For Schmucks, starring Paul Rudd and Steve Carrell. I haven't see it, but judging from the trailer something tells me that this one will be superior.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

A dash of violence is thrown in to wake people up somewhere towards the end ,don't sleep or you will miss little tidbits of genius slapstickery. Even a tax scene thrown in for good measure.

		<fullReview>I know that's a tall order...but this French farce...is such a delight that it is hard to tell what is better, the acting, or the script and direction by Francis Veber.I don't normally gravitate towards comedies about cruelty - yet the way this one is presented makes all the difference in the world. The premise is so simple and yet it escalates to such a pitch at certain times that you're sure your guts will burst open.Kudos really have to go to the two main stars, Jacques Villeret as the buffoon with a heart of gold and, Thierry Lhermitte as the self-proclaimed sophisticate and cretin who sets up the straight lines. My hope is that this one is NEVER remade in English by Hollywood, as other French comedies in the past have been massacred, diluted and "Americanized". Let's leave this treasure alone. I challenge Hollywood to come up with two more perfect actors for this role. Who can be as urbanely supercilious as Thierry? Who can be such an oafish dolt as Jacques? The answer is: no one - at least no one that is alive today - perhaps Cary Grant as 'Brochant' and, Zero Mostel or Charles Laughton as 'Pignon'?Nahhh...this one is perfect. Mr. Veber, many thanks for a wonderful 80 minutes!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Throw a boomerang and it can come back and crack your skull. Call a man an idiot and likewise beware of the repercussions! Pierre Brochant (Thierry Lhermitte) has chosen his own special idiot to take along to the weekly idiots' dinner party arranged by his close business associates. It's a fun game at the idiots' expense. Mr. Francois Pignon (Jacques Villeret) is a bumbling, absent-minded naive hobbyist who likes to build models with matchsticks and glue (and he likes to talk about them too!). But deep down he's a nice guy, sensitive and understanding.If you liked "La Cage aux Folles", you'll love this film too. It's just such wonderful entertainment...with some great dialogue and of course some really funny situations. Because Pierre has twisted his back, his attendance at the dinner is cancelled and he must rely on the idiot for help and regretfully spend the night with him. One of the funniest scenes precedes the visit of a Taxation Officer when they try to hide some art treasures and put vinegar into a top class vintage wine in order to disguise the fact that Pierre is quite well-to-do. Mistaken identity (so often used in farces) plays a large part in the humorous antics of this perfect cast of players.Pierre learns a hard lesson and one feels that he will not be present at any subsequent idiots' dinners. If there is a moral in this little comedy, it is this:"Judge not, lest ye be judged!".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Light, Easy to Take French Farce</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Silly French farce that gently explores eccentricity versus snobbery and how we like to view ourselves versus how others really do view us. It involves a group of snooty men who have a dinner party each week and must each bring one 'idiot' with them. The 'idiots' usually involve some socially challenged individual who has some goofy hobby that he can't stop talking about even to the boredom of everyone else. The twist occurs when Lhermitte wants to interview his 'idiot' first before 'presenting' him. Then unfortunately he hurts his back, putting him at the complete mercy of this 'idiot' who won't seem to leave.The majority of the story happens at one place, which gives it a certain static quality. Also it plays itself out more as a stage play than a film, which this apparently was initially. The characters and situations are so broadly written that it is reminiscent of a old Lucy TV series or worse JERRY LEWIS. The whole thing is saved by Villeret as the 'idiot'. He resembles the late James Coco and is hilariously inept at just about everything he does. He is also lovable and good natured.Although at times it looks like nothing more than TV styled antics with no center, it does manage to tie itself together. The ending can best be described as 'cute'. Best for those who are in the mood for something French, but want it short, and with some good simple laughs.One quibble is that it could have been just as interesting and funny had it stayed with it's original premise and not had the 'twist'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very funny - better if you speak French</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was surprised that this film got such a low rating in France. The language is very coarse and even the title uses a strong word for "idiot" ("The Dinner Game" is a very tame interpretation). However, it is no worse than the films Hollywood gets away with making (or even Britain for that matter).You really do need to understand French quite well to get all of the humour, and if you do then this film will have you in stitches. I haven't laughed so hard at a French film since "Les Visiteurs". The film is also mostly dialogue, so it may not appeal to people who prefer slapstick to witty repartee.The male characters are very well defined and particularly well played by Lehrmitte (M Brochant) and Villeret (M Pignon). You find yourself feeling sorry for both characters at the same time, even though they are in a form of "conflict" throughout the film. I particularly liked the part where Pignon invites a tax inspector friend over to Brochant's apartment without knowing that Brochant is a tax-evader.In summary this is a very funny film which will be better appreciated by those who can speak the language.</fullReview>

As you can guess, he truly messes stuff up.

		<shortDescription>A wonderfully engaging, likable and hilarious comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a likable film about a wealthy man named Pierre Brochant, who frequently arranges dinner with some guests, who each bring along an idiot to amuse themselves. The winner being the one who has the best idiot. But Pierre is struggling to find a good idiot for the next dinner, until his friend spots a perfect candidate on a train, who makes things like Concorde and The Eiffel Tower out of match sticks. Pierre then arranges for the dolt, named Francois Pignon, to meet him at his house. Then Pierre injures his back playing golf, and can't go to the dinner. He still meets Monsieur Pignon at his house, and that's where the rest of the film is based. The two men get into all kinds of discussion and antics, mostly involving Pierre's wife and other lover. Monsieur Pignon turns out to be the world class idiot that Pierre thought he would be. Some very funny scenes, and a delight to watch from start to finish. C'est Magnifique.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Le Dîner de Cons is a very funny movie. You will laugh from the beginning to the end. This French movie is a pure comedy in which Pierre(Thierry Lhermite) plays a very cruel game: each week, he invites an idiot at a diner with his friends which also bring an idiot. The winner is the person who brings the most idiot of all the idiots. This week, Pierre has found the perfect idiot, François Pignon(Jacques Villeret, at his best). But Pierre will have problems this week...Le Dîner de Cons is a typical French comedy, in which the jokes are found in the excellent text. It is an adaptation of a play and it shows. While the script is excellent, the camera is almost always static. It is almost a play simply filmed. Still the actors(the Villeret/Lhermitte team is excellent)and the very funny dialogue make you forget the simple camera. It is short, but never lets you down. Every second is jammed with funny moments. A lot of fun...9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Four friends have a contest to see who can invite the biggest idiot to accompany them to a dinner party. If the premise makes you uncomfortable, you may feel a bit better when the main protagonist's wife expresses her view of the idea by walking out on her husband. This early scene I think is key to reassuring the audience that the filmmakers are aware the "game" which underlies the film is not ethically neutral. Having been reassured on this front, the audience can then settle back and enjoy the fireworks choosing to ignore that little voice of conscience warning you that this isn't very nice. And fireworks there are as Monsieur Pignon (the idiot) manages to destroy Pierre's life in a single evening. This is a hilarious farce with a perfect ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have almost never seen a good french film, although I didn't look or hope it could exist. This was way over my expectations: a comedy... and it is hilarious.It has a dynamic plot. This "idiot" is annoying, confused and stupid. The character of François Pignon is so sincerely willing to help, and he is Pierre Brochant's only option. When Pierre reluctantly agrees that he helps him, he screws up, which complicates the situation even more, and Pignon is needed once more.At the end, Pignon figures that he was going to the "Dinner of idiots", and he is deeply insulted. Here viewers could direct their leniency from Pierre to Pignon, because of Pierre and his friends' behavior to "idiots". Although very insulted, Pignon agrees to help Pierre to put things as they were. He redeems for every screw up he has done... OR NOT?!?I highly recommend this to you all!

		<fullReview>This movie was lots of fun to watch, especially in my French class! The entire class was laughing during the course of the film. It is sort of like "Planes, Trains and Automobiles" with a twist. You hate Pignon, but at the same time you love him. It might not be 'slap-stick' enough for kids, but adults are sure to enjoy it for its subtleties and the thought of "Oh jeez, that could be me." There are moments where you feel sorry for the characters too. This is pulled off extremely well for a movie that seems so... silly!Though I do wonder about what it would be rated in English. The swearing and a sexual reference or two make me waver between PG-13 and R. If you want to learn French swear words, this movie is basically the guide.</fullReview>

Hollywood has an abysmal track record in remaking great French movies and there's no reason to suppose it's going to improve. Meanwhile we have this delight to savor. Although I have read several negative comments I can vouch that the story is solid, having seen it on stage in both Paris and London as well as this film.

		<shortDescription>ever deeper into the do do</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This funny french film by Francis Verber predates the wonderful Tais Tois and has made me want to see others by this director. Two funny films by the same chap bodes well. What came to mind in first viewing was "Hoisted by your own petard" What is a petard? I discover it was a small metallic bell shaped engine of war used to blow breaches in gates or walls. The significant feature was that they were full of gunpowder - basically what we would now call a bomb. And there is also another French word 'péter' - to fart, which it's hard to imagine is unrelated. But this isn't one of those gaseous comedies and although light it is full of wit.The film is about a group of snobbish friends who once a week have a meal and invite a victim. The victims are stupid and the winner is the person who can find the imbecile of the Week. The story mostly centres on Pierre Brochant (Thierry Lhermitte) who selects a boorish tax accountant François Pignon (Jacques Villeret). But Monsieur Pignon fails with every task he is set and gets monsieur Brochant into ever deeper do do.It struck me that this must have first been a play as only one scene is really needed for the play - the affluent flat of the arrogant Monsieur Brochant. Its like the old Brian Rix Whitehall Farces. Jolly funny as everyone gets the fate they deserve. I think its worth checking out this and other films by Francis Verber.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From a period (personally) renowned for brilliant French comedy, Le Diner de Cons (literally The Dinner of Idiots) is a masterpiece. Seen it twice and wouldn't hesitate to see it again.A brilliant movie if you are feeling blue and need something to lift your spirits.Subtitles tend to put a lot of movie goers off, but don't let that be the case. You'll be amazed how natural it seems once you get used to it. Unless you are really stupid of course - in which case you should stick to anything by Steve Segal. ;)Other French movies from this period that I like are Sitcom, and my favourite movie of all time, Ma Vie en Rose. Most definitely watch the latter. Sitcom is a bit mad, but fun all the same.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An excellent example of a boulevard farce. It is superbly constructed. It is hilarious most of the time. It is, typically, heartless and sentimental by turns. The performers are experts in the genre. One of them, the late Jacques Villeret, somehow reaches beyond the two-dimensional being provided for him by the script and is, when circumstances allow, genuinely touching. The movie's stage origins are all too obvious, unfortunately - the pre-credit sequence is the most extended section of opening out that the director manages: perhaps he was too fond of his own stage play, in which apparently M. Villeret originated his character of Francois Pignon. The other central character, Brochant, played with great élan by Thierry Lhermitte, might almost be taken as a symbol of farce itself - cruel, but charming.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is certainly not the funniest film I have ever seen, but it deserves high marks for originality and having a certain infectious charm. It seems the main character in the movie is a total jerk. Not only does he cheat on his wife and have contempt for most people, but he goes to a weekly "dinner party" where he and other friends challenge each other to see who can bring the biggest loser with them--so they can laugh about how stupid the guests are and how superior they are. Nice people, right?! Well, in this case the snob gets more than he bargained for, as his "idiot" turns out to be a walking disaster area and completely makes a mess of the snob's life. And, with each terrible thing that happens to the snob, the viewer takes great pleasure in watching his well-earned pain.This slight film has a relatively modest budget and plot. However, its freshness and energy make it a different and delightful diversion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhat funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been reading a good deal lately about how wonderful "The Dinner Game" is supposed to be, but I didn't find it to be quite as good as the press would have people think. The set-up is very clever, as a group of friends holds a weekly contest to determine who can bring the biggest idiot to a dinner party, and one finds a true moron who spends his days making matchstick models of feats of engineering. The rest of the movie mainly finds ways for the idiot to unwittingly foil all the plans of his host. Most of these developments are more clever than funny, and as the film rolls along, the audience is more likely to smile knowingly than laugh out loud. The problem here is that the film's formula becomes predictable rather quickly. As with most French farces of the type, the basic premise ("Idiot reverses double-cross on snobbish host") becomes too obvious too quickly, and the jokes therefore become predictable. We may not know exactly how the chaos will develop over the course of 90 minutes, but after the first 20 we have a pretty good idea. So, "The Dinner Game" ends up being funnier than the average American or European comedy, but certainly not one of the year's best or even funniest films (both "Bowfinger" and "South Park" have bigger laugh-per-minute ratios).</fullReview>

The premise had promise. The acting was excellent. The characters worked. The movie flowed somewhat logically, and the ending was great...yet something was terribly wrong. Instead of laughing out loud as we did during La Doublure, we cringed as one stupid thing after another happened to people we didn't like or care about. It wasn't funny: it was embarrassingly dumb. In La Doublure, the main character may have been down and out, but he was a genuinely nice person, and we wanted him to succeed; here, everyone was either rotten or downright dumb. We lost interest in everyone, and thus lost interest in the movie.</fullReview>

While "The Last Supper" preyed on conservative right wingers, "The Dinner Game" is even crueler, exploiting innocent odd eccentrics. Perhaps the best way to judge someone's character, is by observing how they treat people who can do them absolutely no good. "The Dinner Game" has protagonists who are absolutely the worst. They abuse people, not for personal gain, but simply for amusement. It is quite gratifying to see the tables turned, where the meek, dinner guest, "idiot", unwittingly outsmarts his host, and in the process teaches him a valuable lesson. - MERK</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A definite groaner, with the contrivances of the single-set setting hardly eased by Veber's plunkingly static camera-style, which seldom goes against the material's most obvious grain. Only occasionally does a distinctive deadpan oddness assert itself - like the moment when they discover that the vinegar poured into the vintage wine to foil the tax inspector has actually improved it. The actor playing Just often seems genuinely overtaken by laughter, which is engaging at least (but in this context seems self-congratulatory); the others have differing degrees of finesse, with the marginalization of the women rather too obvious (and the token attempts to mine a vein of seriousness are blatant tokenism). The material contains bad backs, nymphomania, blatant idiocy, near-vomiting (the wine) - but no farting, which is something I guess. It's watchable of course - the movie often strikes good lines and keeps such a brisk pace that you can hardly be bored, yet it gets close, even at a mere 80 minutes. Could no doubt be spun off into a long-running TV series, which isn't meant as a compliment.</fullReview>
