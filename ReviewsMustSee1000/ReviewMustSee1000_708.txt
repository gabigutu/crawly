		<shortDescription>Hitchcock's Final Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcock had been in a bit of an artistic slump when, after some thirty years, he returned to England for this, his next to last film--and the result was his final masterpiece.Scripted with ghoulish humor by Anthony Schaffer, FRENZY opens with a ceremony on the banks of the Thames in which Londoners inaugurate legislation to rid the river of pollutants... only to have the corpse of a naked woman wash ashore in the midst of their celebrations. She has been strangled with a tie--the latest victim of a serial killer who savagely rapes and then murders his victims by twisting his necktie around their throats. With the city in a panic and Scotland Yard desperate to catch the killer, suspicion falls on a down-on-his-luck bartender named Richard Blaney. Trouble is, he isn't the killer.In a sense, FRENZY has a strangely Dickensian flavor. It is a film that by and large seems to happen in public places: pubs, parks, offices, hotels, and most particularly Covent Garden with its constant hustle and bustle that serves to conceal horrors that occur inches away from the safety of the crowds. Indeed, the city seems almost a "master character" in the film, constantly pressing in upon the humans that inhabit it.Fans of the British comedy series "Keeping Up Appearances" will recognize Clive Swift in a minor role, but for the most part the cast consists of unknowns--but while they lack name recognition they certainly do not lack for talent, playing with a realism that seems completely unstudied. Leading man Jon Finch (Richard Blaney) is perfectly cast as the attractive but disreputable suspect on the run, and he is equaled by his chum Barry Foster (Robert Rusk.) A special mention must also be made of the two female leads, Anna Massey and Barbara Leigh-Hunt--not to mention the host of supporting characters who bring the entire panorama of the great city to life.In his earlier films, Hitchcock generally preferred to work by inference, implying danger and violence rather than openly showing it on the screen. PSYCHO broke the mold, and with FRENZY Hitchcock presents a sequence that many believe equals the notorious "shower scene:" a horrific rape and slow strangulation that leaves the viewer simply stunned. But having given us this horror, Hitchcock ups it with a scene in which we see no violence at all: just a camera shot that glides away from an apartment door, down the stairs, through the hall, and out into the busy street... as we shudder with the knowledge that the woman who just entered that apartment door is now being horrifically raped and murdered.Hitchcock made one more film, a comic wink with twists of suspense starring Karen Black, Bruce Dern, and Barbara Harris called FAMILY PLOT--and it is an enjoyable film in its own right. But it is FRENZY that is the final jewel in the Hitchcock crown, a film to rank among his best. The DVD presentation includes a number of extras--including numerous interviews with the cast--that Hitchcock fans will find fascinating. All in all, FRENZY is fearsome, wickedly funny, and strongly recommended... but not for the faint of heart!Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitch back in London</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After 30 years in the USA and after the disappointments of "Torn Curtain" (1966) and "Topaz" (1969), Alfred Hitchcock came back to his native Britain for this film -written by Anthony Shaffer from a novel by Arthur La Bern."Frenzy" is his penultimate movie, certainly the best one of his last period. The way the Master films is very classic -deliberately old fashioned; at the same time all the charachters are very modern -they belong to a more and more decadent and neurotic London. Almost from the beginning we know who the criminal is, and Hitchcock enjoys himself in showing how the man tries to escape and how he betrays people. Director's trademarks are also back in force: suspense (a lot!) and humour -more sarcastic and sharper than ever. For "Frenzy" the Master doesn't get movie stars, instead he chooses local stage actors. In my opinion he does this because, first, he wants the film to be very English. Furthermore, he wants this time more ordinary faces for making the story more shocking (with famous actors in the main roles, the plot -in a certain way- could be identified mostly with them and loose strength, instead Hitchcock avoids that "paradox"...).Maybe "Frenzy" is not an unforgettable masterpiece like "Psycho", "Vertigo", "Birds" or many other works. But it is a great movie indeed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The grand man of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock, directs this dark film about a man that kills women with neckties with relish, aplomb, and an atypical grimness. The story is typical Hitch as an innocent man is pushed into a world of intrigue around him as everyone believes him to be the necktie killer. Jon Finch plays the innocent with earnestness and is quite good in his role. The rest of the cast is very effective as well. Hithcock, however, is the real star with his camera. Although much of the film is nothing more than tried and true material, Alfred Hitchcock makes the mundane spectacular with his camera and some great shots and spaces of silence. The scene where a girl coming back from lunch is awesome as we the audience are made to wait what seems an eternity for her to discover what has taken place since she left. The scene of the camera moving in and out of the house of the killer is also wonderful, as is the scene with the killer in the potato truck. That scene is easily the most suspenseful of the entire film. The film is particularly dark for Hitchcock as a women is raped rather abruptly(for lack of a better word) showing naked breasts and genuine terror. To counter-balance the more lurid aspects of the film is a subplot story of a police inspector, played with charm by Alec McCowen, whose wife constantly feeds him nothing but gourmet meals that sound and look quite horrible! These scenes are so funny and charming! A good thriller from the master of suspense!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You should be warned that "Frenzy" has one of the most gruesome rape/murder scenes ever filmed - beautifully filmed, of course, so that you don't look away, but that makes it all the more terrible. It's followed by one of Hitchcock's great signature shots, as the camera draws back, out of the building, into the crowded and noisy streets, where the scene of the crime becomes just one room among many. That's "Frenzy" for you. It's one of Hitchcock's most assured and gripping films; but it's pretty grim. Everyone in London looks surprisingly ugly. Their characters, from hero to villain, are a trifle uglier too. But don't expect a happy ending. Things go just a little bit past the point where a happy ending is possible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Revisiting the Wrong Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the disaster that TOPAZ represented, Alfred Hitchcock took a three-year hiatus, did an about-face from the United States, and returned to his native England to produce this extremely graphic, violent film which not only made him return full circle to his cinematic origins, but also sent him back to square one -- THE LODGER -- in which a wrong man is accused of a crime he didn't commit. If he had not made FAMILY PLOT it would be a fitting close to a remarkable film career.Despite the fact that FRENZY is a story about a rapist-murderer laying terror unto London, this is not a mystery by far. From the very beginning we're introduced to the man behind the murders, but also to the man who ultimately comes to be convicted for those very murders -- one of them his very own wife. Hitchcock, of course, loves the dark side of humanity and has expressed a need to tell stories about "the wrong man" as well as explore the natures of depravity hidden underneath a smiling surface, always with his trademark humor. That humor is as black as ever here, seen mainly in the scenes involving the inspector in charge of the investigation of the crimes and his wife (who can't cook to save her life), and especially in the grim sequence when the real killer goes through hell to retrieve his tie-pin which has remained within his latest victim's death grip.By far the most graphic film in his career, Hitchcock manages to pull some clever camera stunts which service not only the plot, but the sense of voyeurism as an experience. In a great shot, he pulls back from the scene where the killer and his victim enter his apartment, down a flight of stairs, and onto the indifferent streets of London. He's made us witnesses and therefore, accomplices, because he knows we can't do a single thing to save that woman's life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exceptional Hitchcock thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Frenzy" was Alfred Hitchcock's next-to-last film. And though it's not a great classic like "Psycho" and "North by Northwest", it's still a very good movie. After making mostly American movies for four decades, Hitchcock returned to his native Britain to make "Frenzy". It's about a series of murders that's devastating London. These murders have two things in common: 1) The victims are all women; and 2) they're all raped and then strangled with a neck-tie. When a marriage counselor is murdered this way, the police suspect the woman's ex-husband is the culprit. But actually the husband is innocent, and is forced to hide out from the cops. "Frenzy" has all the usual Hitchcock elements: thrills, suspense, comedy, and Hitchcock's cameo appearence. The two best scenes in the movie are the hilarious moments when the police inspector (who's heading up the investigation of the neck-tie murders) is served two gourmet dinners by his wife. These scenes are very funny. The comic moments is what gives "Frenzy" a edge over Hitchcock's previous film "Topaz". Plus, it's a more entertaining thriller.*** (out of four)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly engaging nail-biter!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcock did one hell of a job! I was planning on watching this movie just for about 30 minutes before going to sleep and was gonna finish watching it the next day, but instead I was so engaged that I couldn't stop watching and stayed awake the whole 2 hours. I loved the irony of the actual rapist having no clues pointing to him and the innocent man having all clues pointing to him. The scene involving the rapist in the back of the truck, rummaging through a sack of potatoes (and that's all I'll reveal) is classic suspense. I also loved how Hitchcock left the rape scenes (excluding the first one) up to the imagination. There is a great shot where one of the victims is being raped and we don't even hear any off-screen yells or screams. The camera simply tracks backwards down a staircase and out the front door, where people walk by minding their own business, ignorant to the evil that's being committed a floor above. Any amateurish director would've went for true shock value and showed all the rape scenes in explicit detail. We don't call Hitchcock the master of suspense for nothing. The scene is still quite haunting. In horror and suspense, what you don't see can be a lot more frightening than what you do see, since the imagination is a powerful thing. The last line of the movie should go down in history. It had me bawling with laughter! Just that one line gave perfect closure to this wonderful film. My score: 8 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding Alfred Hitchcock Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed Frenzy. I think that Alfred Hitchcock, although he may not have been on top of his game was still sticking to his style. I particularly enjoyed all of the suspense, actors, and screenplay. It got me more and more curious until the end. I think that Hitchcock also stuck very well to his medium in this movie. He also picked the best spots in London to film it. Although I did not necessarily appreciate the rape and murder scene he showed because it was disgusting, I really enjoyed the action. Hitchcock also did a very good job of the camera angles in this movie. For the most part it is just a regular Alfred Hitchcock film except for the nudity,the rape scene, and some slight use of horror. Overall, I think it was just the time that Hitchcock had reached the end of his career and did his best to please his audience. With his age and his state of health, I think that he did an outstanding job of his second to last film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock's last good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a necktie murderer running around London. He attempts to rape women (he can't he's impotent) and, in his rage, strangles them with his ties. A "nice" guy named Rusk (Barry Foster) is the killer but his best friend Richard (Jon Finch) is the one accused of it...Hitchcock's first (and last) film in London since the 1950 "Stage Fright". Something about London seemed to rejuvenate him--his two movies before this ("Topaz" and "Torn Curtain") were slow, uninvolving and deadly dull. This moves quickly, has a good script and large doses of VERY black humor--much blacker than Hitchcock had ever attempted before. The film was also Hitchcock's first to get an R rating for a pretty explicit rape/strangulation and flashes of female nudity. To be honest, it's pretty tame by today's standards but still disturbing. It's kind of surprising that Hitchcock would get so vicious...but "Psycho"s shower stabbing was considered shocking for its time as was the scissors killing in "Dial M for Murder".The acting varies wildly. Mostly everybody is very good--especially Foster, Jean Marsh (in a amusing small role) and Anna Massey. But Finch, as the main character, is terrible. He is handsome but his character is brutal, obnoxious and his acting is just horrendous. That drags the movie down as I didn't care for him at all.The movie also contains many incredibly-directed sequences--especially the potato truck sequence and a reverse shot sequence. Also it has an infamous--and very funny--final line.Bad acting from Finch aside this is a good movie and worth catching. I give it an 8.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great, but not Hitchcock's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some of Hitchcock's final films weren't great; some went so far as to call them really bad. True, they are not the masterpieces that Vertigo and Psycho are, but I don't think they are all as bad as some claim. I finally got a chance to see Frenzy, and I must say that it's a great piece of typical Hitchcock thriller. The story is about a killer who strangles women with a necktie, after raping them. After a bunch of unfortunate(but not unlikely) situations the police suspect the wrong man, and we follow his actions as he tries to evade the police. Like all the Hitchcock greats, it features great characterizations, dialog and situations. Not to mention those little details that lift him above the level that most other directors are at. The plot is very good, and well-paced. The acting is very good; I was particularly impressed at how 'British' they managed to be, considering how many of the actors are Americans. I suspect Hitchcock played a big part in making the film so authentic and true to life. The characters are well-written, credible and interesting. The suspense and tension is extreme at points of the movie, and Hitchcock (once again) proves his perfect understanding of the film-making elements and his ability to put them to good use. I found it interesting to see so much nudity, in a Hitchcock film. Of course, it wasn't just graphic and pointless, like it is in most films(not just from that period); it's there for a purpose. The famous "continuous" shot looked great, though it was obvious where the cut was. Hitchcock is known for his innovative shots, angles and pans, and this is no exception to the greatness of his cinematography. I doubt that we have seen a much more innovative or intelligent film-maker since him. It's nice to be able to see that even such a short time before his death(about 8 years, I suppose), Hitchcock delivered something so great. Much better than the dime-a-dozen flicks that most films released consist of today. A great film for any fan of Hitchcock, or even of thrillers in general. I recommend this film to any fan of thrillers or Hitchcock. Great film. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One final note</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Those who blame Hitchcock for the intensity of the rape/strangulation scene should realize that he wrote neither the screenplay (which was written by playwright Anthony Shaffer, best known for his marvelous comic/mystery "Sleuth") nor the novel upon which it was based ("Goodbye Piccadilly, Farewell Leicester Square" by Arthur La Bern)...and that the scene in the film runs exactly the same course, with precisely the same detail as the scene in the book. In fact, now that I think of it, the scene in the film is actually tamer. Hitchcock's film does not, after all, make any reference to the post-mortem insertion of a letter opener. If anything, Hitch showed restraint with his version of the scene. Not as much restraint as is usual for him...but restraint, nonetheless. And he achieved what he set out to do. The scene is absolutely chilling. And not only is it memorable...it's the most unforgettable scene of its kind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mr. Rusk, you're not wearing your tie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For being developed and released in the year 1972, this is a very impressive film. Frenzy, directed by Alfred Hitchcock, gives us one of the last glimpses into the mind of one of our greatest cinematic geniuses. While his style in this film is a bit different than what you may expect from seeing his earlier films, Frenzy is still a complete and utter Hitchcockian thriller. From the opening shot, to the uncanny cameo, to the swiftly tilting plot, anyone who has witnessed Hitchcock at his best will be able to see the mastery behind this film. The acting is superb and only helps to accentuate the brilliant eye that Hitchcock had to give us just what we came asking for. While he gives us a story that we may all be familiar with, it is the way in which he tells the story that makes Frenzy worth mentioning to friends and family.The genius about this film is that instead of having your usual murder mystery that Hollywood has reproduced a thousand times, Hitchcock balances this story between our hero and villain. In complete Hitchcock form, he tells us, the audience, whom the murderer is right from the beginning so that we do not sit in our seats trying to bend our minds over whom it truly is doing this evil deed. He does this so that we can focus on the insanity of being the "wrong" man and the sadistic pleasure the other finds from not being in the police spotlight. He does this will sheer delight and the brilliance of a true filmmaker. What is continually enthralling about this is that we, the audience, are still kept on the edge of our seat. We know who the murderer is, we know why he is doing this, yet we still bite our nails and wonder how it will turn out. You do not see films of this caliber any more. Even at the end, Hitchcock has us guessing what will happen next up until the final credits roll. He does not allow us a break, and for that I am grateful.There were some incredible scenes in this film that left a lasting impression on me as well as my idea of film. For example, the way that Hitchcock filmed the rape scene early in the film was shocking, powerful, and very risky for its time. Here we have a man, repeating the same monstrous words to a woman that he has forced himself on, while she repeats the inner voice inside of her out towards us. It sent a shiver down my spine like no other scene of this nature had. It was graphic, yet honest. It was raw, yet somehow cinematic ally intense. I had never seen a scene filmed like this in the past, so this was a sheer bold and stunning. Another scene that literally caught my eye was the moment when Babs leaves the bar, pauses, and right behind her is Rusk. The irony was killing me. It was so macabre that you couldn't help but laugh at the situation that was about to unfold. I felt that same way when I was watching Rusk with the potato sack. While I did think the length of the scene was a bit too much and at times a bit over-dramatic, I did see why Hitchcock left it in there. He was literally giving you the light side of serial killing, the parts that should perhaps make you smile, but instead they have this deeply rooted dark underbelly that keeps your hands firmly in front of your eyes or behind a pillow. It is frightening to think how Hitchcock could have changed the face of cinema today if he were alive to wave his magic wand. It would be powerful.Outside of the brilliant man behind the camera and the fascinating way to tell an age old story, I thought that the actors did a decent job with what they were handed. While I think that the Golden Globe was mostly for Hitchcock himself, I was pleasantly surprised with Jon Finch's character portrayal and the suave coolness of Barry Foster. I thought that both of these actors did an exceptional job of counterbalancing the story. One was truly evil, while the other just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Both controlled their roles with ease, but then again, with Hitchcock behind the camera, a story like this should just fall into place.While I have spoken very highly of this film, there were some small moments where I just felt Hitchcock could have gone further, pulled back, or just found the point instead of rummaging around a potato truck for it. That scene in particular did it for me. It was way too long and a bit too humorous for my liking. Also, the nudity was not needed in this film. I don't remember seeing a Hitchcock film with so much nudity, and I understand he was just trying to keep his films fresh for the 70s, but something can be said for style and class, and I felt there was just a bit of both lacking from this film. Outside of these small bits, the rest was flawless. I especially loved the court scene where all we had to rely on was the emotions of the convicted. Finally, who couldn't laugh at the fact that the only one to mess up the life of Blaney, to see the truth blurred and hypothetical, was the secretary that wore glasses. Ahh, it was good to see that Hitchcock has not forgotten all of his roots.Overall, this was a very dark and disturbing picture that has captured the essence of originality and suspense. You need to see this film more than once to fully absorb everything that Hitchcock has to offer.Grade: **** out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just as bad as ever. . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greeted with derision by most critics when it first appeared, 'Frenzy' has recently done the rounds of UK TV. I remember seeing it on its original release, and thinking then that if Hitchcock wanted to parade some kind of screen confession about his ingrained misogynism, he couldn't have found a nastier little vehicle to do so.But Time alters perspective, and so what was nauseatingly bad in 1972 might, all these years later, be worthy of upward re-evaluation.Might. . . but not. 'Frenzy' is dross. The dross of an ageing director who desperately wanted to exploit the artistic freedom of 70s movie making without seeming to realise that freedom imposes its own obligations -- notably, the need to bring integrity to one's work.There's none here. And not much evidence of the earlier directorial brilliance, either -- the switch from spine-tingling implicit to odious explicit is neither shocking nor, for a supreme stylist, stylish: it's just banal (the prolonged murder scene is precisely that: prolonged, without pace, without reason, without purpose other than the cheapest of directorial desires to appear as contemporary an artiste as, say, that other acclaimed practitioner of cheap sleaze, Michael Winner).And it goes from bad to worse, with dialog that defies any human provenance (not least in the ludicrous diversion into the Home Life of Our Dear Wooden Inspector, and his wife's cooking).Perhaps the scene that best sums up 'Frenzy' (and endures as the most explicit indictment of Hitchcock's persona) is the clunking exchange between two lawyers in a bar, where they discuss the serial killings and then agree that at least the women had a good time first by being raped.I remember my revulsion at that scene back in '72, and it's still undimmed, because this wasn't Hitchcock being clever, or sardonic, or trying to make some universal point (big themes, big truths, were not Hitchcock's forte, nor personal preference.) It was just Hitchcock, allowing a reflection of his own distorted mirror on life to shine through the texture of the movie.Calling 'Frenzy' Hitchcock's last great masterpiece is to betray little if any understanding of just what Hitchcock actually achieved in the way of cinematic trickery, cinematic thrills, and dazzling cinematic mastery.'Frenzy' is therefore now what it always was: a cheap, nasty, and ham-fisted movie that did no service to any of those involved, or to the memory of a film-maker who really was, in his Hollywood days, one of the greatest there has ever been.</fullReview>

Bewildered Richard chased cross London by the police who think he is an assassin as his ex-wife (Barbara Leigh-Hunt) has been also murdered and all caught by the circumstantial evidence . Later on , Richard learns the real murderer and he's headed to seek revenge against him.All typical Hitch themes are here as a man wrongly accused of murder , his Quintaessential issue , numerous amazing camera shots and slightly black humor . Hitchcock was encouraged to return to England and promptly made this unusual film for his eventual British period. The picture packs tension , thriller,suspense and excitement. The intriguing story written by Anthony Shaffer -Sleuth- is one of the splendid thrillers with 'false guilty ' as its theme, achieving the maximum impact on the audience and containing numerous exciting set pieces with usual Hitchcock elements . The movie is full of lingering images as when the camera shows the astounding killings , the strange fighting with a corpse in a truck load of potatoes , the camera descending from a first floor flat , the Inspector 's mealtime along with his wife Vivien Merchant , among others . However , it contains some nudism and disturbing scenes as the unsettling rape, strangling and murder scenes. Colorful cinematography by Gilbert Taylor showing marvelously the Covent Garden streets. Suspenseful and enjoyable musical score by Ron Goodwin . This good thriller by the master himself, who preys on the senses and keeps the suspense at feverish pitch . The movie is directed after ¨Marnie(64)¨and ¨Topaz(69)¨his worst movie, subsequently made ¨Frenzy¨ and ¨Family Plot¨ his last film. Rating : Better than average, worthwhile seeing thanks some Hitch's touches.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In London, a serial-killer is raping women and then strangling them with a neck tie. When the reckless and low-class with bad temper bartender Richard Blaney (Jon Finch) is fired from the pub Global Public House by the manager Felix Forsythe (Bernard Cribbins), he decides to visit his ex-wife Brenda (Barbara Leigh-Hunt), who owns a successful marriage agency. Her secretary Miss Barling (Jean Marsh) overhears an argument of the couple, and Brenda invites Richard to have dinner with her in a fancy restaurant. Then she put some money in his overcoat and does not tell him to avoid his embarrassment with the situation. Meanwhile Richard's friend Bob Rusk (Barry Foster) visits Brenda in her office, rapes her and kills her with his neck tie. When Richard finds the money in his pocket, he visits Brenda but finds the agency closed; then he goes with his girlfriend Babs Milligan (Anna Massey) to an expensive hotel. Miss Barling sees Richard leaving the building and finds her boss strangled; she calls the New Scotland Yard and Richard becomes the prime suspect. When Bob kills Babs, he frames Richard that is arrested and sentenced to life. But the Chief Inspector Oxford (Alec McCowen) that was in charge of the investigation is not absolutely sure that Richard is the serial-killer. "Frenzy" is a dark thriller of Alfred Hitchcock about an impotent man that strangles women after raping them. There are powerful moments, like for example the rape of Breda, blended with funny sequences, like the dinners of Inspector Oxford with his wife, who is intuitive and aspirant chef, or the speech of a politician in the very beginning, or Bob in trouble with the corpse in the truck transporting potatoes. The acting is excellent and the camera work is wonderful, with long shots, like for example when Babs enter in Bob's apartment, associated to a disturbing silence. This time, the cameo of Alfred Hitchcock is in the crowd twice in the beginning of the film wearing a hat. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Frenesi" ("Frenzy")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When it comes to making films, Alfred has made some of the best ever. Frenzy is regarded by many to be Hitchcock's last great film. For me however I feel his best days were long behind him by the time Frenzy was made, and I'm not alone here. This is a good film in plenty of ways. Good enough for a 7.5 out of 10 in my view. To me however it doesn't stand besides classics like Rope, The Birds and Vertigo. Frenzy is definitely worth watching, but overall it falls far short of Hitch's best works. The film is solid in most aspects, but the thrill is not what you may hope for with a Hitchcock suspense piece, but there is enough comedy mixed in to still make it an enjoyable picture. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hitchcock, one of the most famous British expatriates in the cinema industry, came back for one film in England, in London very exactly and he demonstrated in the early 70s he was able to build a cool thriller, in the traditional English style and rhythm and make it fascinating. The case is of course so quaint, so passé and he enjoys making thinks look the way they looked not in the 70s but in the 60s. He concentrates the film on Covent Garden when it was still a fruit and vegetable market, on their pubs, their dealers, their night life and their busy running hectic at times life. Today all that has disappeared and you can find the London Transport Museum where you used to have banana and orange wholesale dealers. Then he worked hard on finding the particular ways Londoners lived at that time, just after coal was banned around 1962. And of course his killer is well integrated in this extremely regular disorganized precipitation. The fashion is just right, the home furniture and various small equipment are just right, authentic, and yet the sarcastic eye of Alfred Hitchcock cannot forget to show the flaws and the drawbacks of this life that is slowly opening up to continental Europe and the whole world. The gourmet classes for housewives teaching them all kinds of French recipes that are of course deliciously failed by these amateurs while the good old bacon and eggs are getting out of fashion. But then we are in pure Hitchcockian fiction. A serial killer who strangles his victims with his ties and then dispose of them, both the victims and the ties together. An imbroglio that makes a friend of that killer be suspected and then, with a little of effort from the killer, that suspected person becomes the convicted killer who is no killer at all. He escapes the prison in the simplest British way you can imagine: he gets himself hospitalized so that he can go and have his vengeance on his friend who had had him arrested. And there the surprise will be total. Fiction again that shows a policeman who gets someone convicted for a serious crime and yet doubts his own conclusion and starts asking some more questions. Why did he not do it before? And he could have listened to his wife who, between serving pig trotters cooked with grapes or some partridges or pigeons cooked with cherries, had suggested that the suspect could not be the criminal for obscure reasons that have to do with feminine intuition. And he adds a good layer of gossip on publicans who both are tyrants in their pubs and informers to the police. That makes a pleasant film altogether whose rhythm is slow enough for peaceful enjoyment and fast enough for some thrilling pleasure. The title is of course one of these tricks Hitchcock was so fond of: he is not lying really, he is just overstating with a tongue in his cheek and that works all the time and we smile after the film since we were trapped into believing it was frantic and it was just intense.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uncommonly vicious for Hitchcock, but a classy film all the same</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frenzy is the most vicious of all Hitchcock's films. More violent than Psycho and The Birds, and with more detailed scenes of murder than Torn Curtain, it is almost jarring to find the master of suspense resorting to such sadistic detail. However, he just about gets away with it, because the film is blessed with a superior script and a gripping plot.Jon Finch plays a bad-tempered RAF pilot accused of the sexual assault and muder of his ex wife. The real killer is a market tradesman names Rusk (Barry Foster). Finch is eventually captured by the police and sent to jail, but Rusk makes a mistake during one of his murders and leaves a vital clue behind. Having busted out of jail, Finch pursues Rusk to his London flat in the hope of catching him and proving his innocence.The film is very well made. The sex attack near the beginning is a bit tasteless, but it needed to be shocking in order to convey what an evil and psychopathic person Foster really is. It may be uncomfortable to watch, but it makes its point effectively. The most memorable sequence of all is the extraordinary bit on the potato truck, where Rusk has to recover a brooch from the hand of a dead girl. Rigor mortis has set into her fingers, and in order to prise it from her grasp he has to snap each finger one at a time until the brooch comes loose. Now that's nasty.... but it's also pure Hitchcock!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top director but cheap junk</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh dear - quite how Alfred Hitchcock (North by Northwest, Spellbound, the 39 Steps) could turn out this nasty, cheapjack shocker is beyond me. Don't bother looking for hidden depths or deep meanings - there aren't any. This is just horrid, seedy and cheap. The one redeeming feature is the home-life of the inspector who leads the investigation - his wife fancies herself as a gourmet cook and constantly serves up her revolting culinary experiments to her poor husband. This is amusing, and just about saved me putting the film in the 'awful' bracket, but the film as a whole is one of the most unpleasant I've ever seen. I believe this was Hitchcock's next-to-last film - perhaps someone was trying to tell him something.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie that summarizes the filmography of Hitchcock.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the late 60s and after rolling "Topaz", Hitchcock shocked everyone by making this film. Now back to his native country believe this incredible film, which contains all the keys of his work taken to the limit. A perfect script that does not need and do not spare any sequence, magnificent staging, hiding and giving information when needed and a great accomplishment. Anyone who has seen the film can not forget two sequences, when the secretary finds the corpse of the former wife of "Blaney" to Off (the camera remains in the street) and the murder of the bride, the camera accompanies them to the door and then gradually decreases until the bustle of the street, making the audience think about the crime and giving naturalness and realism rarely achieved before.Hitchcock repeats the theme of false guilt. His usual neuroses (sex, madness and death) articulated in a narrative like never (bitterness, irony and disappointment). Best of "Frenzy" is the cruelty that draws the characters and their relationships selfish. And the scenes of the murderer in action, that freeze the blood, not in vain, Hitchcock teaches us that death is a frozen picture.It was unjustly despised at the time we certainly before the last great work of the master of suspense. After having declined in his last films before this, Hitchcock created his last great film, a film that is clearly the focus of his films, the story of the false guilt.In "Frenzy" we have a great film, and though soon know the identity of the murderer, the film does not suffer and got to identify with the poor protagonist, certainly a guy with a disastrous fate. The character of the choke is dazzling and imposing, and his chivalry contrasts perfectly with her dark side. The researcher is also a very well established, and it is in him and his wife in which the director gives the film its comic side.With all, that cocktail out an excellent film that deserves to be seen by every movie lover and surprise many by some nudity, so clearly unpublished so far in the films of Hitchcock.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well it's better than 'Family Plot', even though that's not saying much. : (</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading many of the reviews on here stating that this film is Hitchcock at his peak, I feel very out of place. I did not find this film to be pulse pounding and thrilling like Hitch's other films. Although, this is no where near as lifeless as "Family Plot", I would say that this is a Hitch film I do not care to see again.But Hitch cannot be blamed for it all. It's not his fault the script was terribly dull. The characters were two dimensional, and I just couldn't bring myself to care for them. However, there were directing highlights in this film for me. Such as the long dolly backwards out of the building, no sound as we peer through the door to hear the jury's verdict, the close up of the steel bar in our hero's hand during the finale. I'd also like to add that I was impressed that Hitch showed such dark material during the murder scenes. The 1st victim we see saying a prayer while topless and being strangled, and then the close ups of eyes wide open and tongues hanging out.Overall, direction is superb as usual, but the script is terribly dull. Only watch if you're a die hard Hitch fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Hitchcock's darkest - and best - films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A serial killer is on the loose in London - a sex maniac who rapes his victims and then strangles them with his tie. This couldn't matter less to Richard Blaney (Jon Finch), a bitter, washed-up veteran who loses his job at a pub and is generally mad at the world. But Blaney soon becomes the prime suspect after his ex-wife (Barbara Leigh-Hunt) becomes a victim of the killer - and the circumstantial evidence implicating him becomes overwhelming. With the help of co-worker/lover Babs (Anna Massey) and the reluctant help of an old RAF buddy and his wife (Clive Swift and Billie Whitelaw), he goes on the lam, further implicating him. After Babs is found strangled, Blaney is arrested - but Chief Inspector Oxford (Alec McCowan) of Scotland Yard begins to doubt his guilt. Soon, he realizes that the wrong man is in jail - and that the murderer is actually Blaney's buddy Bob Rusk (Barry Foster), a seemingly cheerful Covent Garden grocer. However, Blaney has escaped from jail, and Oxford must get to Rusk before Blaney does in order to sure that the right man is caught.On the surface, "Frenzy" is a rather typical Alfred Hitchcock film, exploring the familiar ground of a man implicated in a crime he didn't commit, but against whom the evidence is overwhelming. But Hitchcock is able to add some new twists, and a great deal of darkness which make the film stand out in his canon. While not held in terribly high regard by most Hitch enthusiasts, I would name Frenzy as being one of his two or three best films.After years of self-imposed exile from his homeland, Hitchcock makes a triumphant return to London, and the early sections of the movie show a director sending a big coming-home Valentine to his native land. But the movie is more than that; the attitude quickly becomes dark, sour and sardonic. A British official (John Boxer) giving a speech on pollution is interrupted by the discovery of a body in the river beneath him. Two Englishmen have a rather dark discussion about serial killers and their "appropriateness" in London; indeed, London is the home of Jack the Ripper, so a serial killer on the prowl is business as usual for most. Unlike Americans, the British are rather blasé about the prospect of a murderer in their midst. This essentially British attitude pervades the film, as Hitchcock employs his trademark dark humor to accentuate the violence going on around him.The movie has several striking images and scenes which make it stand out. The most obvious is the murder of Barbara Leigh-Hunt, an uncomfortably long and graphic scene of rape and violence, where Hitchcock takes full advantage of the increasingly lax censorship. The shot of Leigh-Hunt's corpse with its tongue dangling out is extremely chilling. Even more effective is the murder of Babs, as Hitchcock sets us up, then pans back through the apartment and out into the bustling street - a bravura piece of film making that says more than another, equally graphic strangulation could have. The scene where Rusk rides a potato truck to recover a bit of evidence from one of his victims (another typical Hitchcock device - making us sympathize with the killer) is effectively suspenseful. The scenes of comedy, particularly the Inspector's gourmet dinners with his wife (Vivien Merchant), go along with rather than provide relief from the violent goings-on in the main plot. And the denouement is classic Hitch.Another ingenious twist is the character of Dick Blaney. Blaney is another Hitchcockian "wrong man" who, seemingly trapped by circumstantial evidence and afraid of the police, goes on the run, seemingly implicating himself. But unlike previous such characters - Henry Fonda in The Wrong Man, Grace Kelly in Dial M For Murder, Cary Grant in To Catch a Thief and North By Northwest - Blaney is a completely surly, unlikeable character who nags his ex-wife, carries on in public, and is a complete an utter jerk (as evidenced by a surprisingly affective shot where he tramples a box of grapes on the street). Bob Rusk, by contrast, is cheerful, friendly and helpful - when he's not strangling women, of course. It's very hard to work up much sympathy for Blaney; while some consider this a drawback, I'd actually consider it a benefit, and it's an intriguing twist on a hoary old idea that Hitchcock pulls of brilliantly.The cast is uniformly excellent. Hitchcock probably benefits from the lack of established stars; the B- and C-list actors here are probably better for not having the baggage of a screen persona with them. Jon Finch pulls off his rather difficult character well, avoiding the temptation to make Blaney likable. Barry Foster turns in a chillingly effective performance as Rusk, making him one of Hitchcock's greatest villains. Anna Massey and Barbara Leigh-Hunt are both charming, while Jean Marsh is effective as the cold-hearted, man-hating secretary who is key in convicting Blaney. Alex McCowan and Vivien Merchant provide several scenes of hysterical black humor as the Investigator and his wife. Clive Swift, Billie Whitelaw, Elsie Randolph and Michael Bates round out the cast nicely.Frenzy is arguably the best of Hitchcock's later efforts, and it stands up very well even next to his best work. By adding a few neat twists and a welcome edge of darkness, the Master of Suspense creates another masterful thriller.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't realize that Frenzy was so divisive among Hitchcock fans. As with the last Hitchcock movie I watched, The Trouble with Harry, Frenzy seems to have more than its fair share of critics. The criticism of both movies seems to derive from a similar source ? Hitch deviated from what people expected. I'm not sure why people want to see the same movie over and over, but if you read the negative user comments on IMDb, you'll get that impression. What's wrong with shifting gears and making a comedy like The Trouble with Harry? And what's wrong with turning up the violence and making a movie like Frenzy? In each case, I appreciate what Hitchcock was trying to do and thoroughly enjoyed both movies.Frenzy is essentially a "Wrong Man" type movie that Hitch visited several times throughout his career. You know, an innocent man is accused of a crime and spends the rest of the movie on the run from the police trying to prove he's not guilty. In this case, Richard Blaney (Jon Finch), a down on his luck and out of work bartender, is accused of violently raping a series of women before using his necktie to strangle them. Through some really bad luck, the case of circumstantial evidence against Blaney grows to the point that he becomes the only suspect. Tried and convicted, Blaney vows revenge against the man he knows to be guilty.I don't know that I would call Frenzy Hitchcock's best movie as some have, but it is a very entertaining thriller. It's an odd but satisfying mix of the most violent images (the first rape and murder are difficult to watch) and some of the darkest, funniest comedy (the potato truck or the dinner scenes for example) that Hitch ever made. Hitch proves his genius by masterfully balancing the two ? violence and comedy. And if you weren't already convinced of his reputation as a director, Hitchcock throws in a couple of very nice tracking shots, a clever use of sound, and a few other tricks that I won't begin to attempt to describe (just watch the movie) for good measure. Hitch also shows his genius through some of his casting choices. Other than Finch in the lead (he's just not a very sympathetic figure to me), the rest of the actors are incredibly strong. Barry Foster gives one of the more memorable performances I've seen recently. He's just so creepy. In fact, all of the supporting players, from the prim Monica Barling played by Jean March to the hysterical Vivian Merchant as a would-be gourmet chef, are perfect. And when you add the nice location shots and an interesting, well written script (have the words "you're my type of woman" ever been so menacing) to the direction and acting, Frenzy becomes a very worthy and memorable entry in Hitchcock's filmography.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rusk- Your Not Wearing Your Tie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the last film Hitchcock made in Britain. The cast is a relative group of unknowns but perform well. This film does prove that even late in his life &amp; career, &amp; even almost 10 years after Psycho, Alfred could still surprise viewers.This is his only film to earn an R rating because there are several sequences of female nudity in the film. There is a rape scene. There is some early deception to the viewer as to who the murderer is going to be but that is given to the viewer when the rape scene happens.None of the nude females are the actual actresses in the film. Body doubles were used for all of them. Hitchcocks trademark stairway sequence is in this movie, &amp; very effectively too. The sequences through out the film are brilliant. The British locales are very well placed throughout the film.A big surprise is the use of a British courtroom sequence in a court room which looks very much like the one used in The Paradine Case many years earlier (1947). It is used more effectively in this film as the courtroom seemed to bog down that film. This time, it is quickly used.The films move along at a good pace, &amp; there is lots of humor. Several times there is humor about food with the detectives wife. There is a lot of ironic humor used too. The opening sequence with a speech about cleaning up pollution in the James river &amp; then the dead body found floating in it a a great example.Alma, Hitchcocks wife, had a heart attack during work on this, but bounced back from it &amp; helped the films finish &amp; outlived Alfred anyhow. The ending of this film is as strong a sequence as any film he ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"ALFRED HITCHCOCK'S FRENZY"-(Universal,1972)-Running Time:116 minutes Cast:Jon Finch,Barry Foster,Barbara Leigh-Hunt,Alec McCowen,Anna Massey, Vivian Merchant. MPAA Rating:"R"-For Nudity,Graphic Violence,Language.After the huge success of "Psycho" in 1960,Alfred Hitchock went over to Universal Pictures to make the runaway boxoffice horror shocker "The Birds"(1963),and "Marnie"(1964)with Tippi Hedren,a beautiful former model with serious limitations as an actress,and then the disappointing "Torn Curtain"(1966)with the miscast and mismatched Paul Newman and Julie Andrews,and then "Topaz"(1969),based on the internation best seller by Leon Uris and starring John Forsythe which was so boring that it hardly seems like a Hitchcock movie after all. When "Frenzy",his first British film since 1950's "Stage Fright",and the first Hitchcock feature film to be rated "R" by the Motion Picture Association of America was released in June of 1972,the advance word was that this was vintage Hitchcock and then some. "Frenzy" is murder most explicit and then some. The film has a all British cast and it is set in modern day London where a modern day Jack The Ripper is killing women and framing the man is was not at the scene of these crimes. Jon Finch stars as Richard Blaney,a bartender who gets fired from his job,only fruit stand owner Bob Rusk(Barry Foster)and cocktail waitress Babs Milligan(Anna Massey)seem to like him,so when his former wife(Barbara Leigh-Hunt)is strangled,he's the prime suspect. Another murder occurs in broad daylight,but even before we see the body,we can imagine every grisly detail as the camera retreats from both killer and victim back down the stairs into the bustling street. Alec McGowan and Vivian Merchant are absoultely wonderful as Inspector and Mrs. Oxford. They discuss every graphic aspect of the case,but Mrs. Oxford believes in Mr. Blaney,and while her husband dreams of humble cups of tea and coffee at some diner,she lists the evidence that show how Richard Blaney couldn't possibly have committed any murders,let alone two. However,the suspense of Mr. Blaney's innocence leads to the effective cilmax of the film and this is where Inspector Oxford catches the real killer and the suspect,Mr. Rusk at the end where he has a dead girl's body in a private trunk. All of the murders let to one thing: a man's necktie as the evidence of the crimes. However,"Frenzy" is very striking and disturbing,and it was one of Hitchcock's most personal pictures,but at the time this wasn't his best work since it wasn't very likable by the critics at the time of release. In this one,there are no major stars here,and thus no narrative compromises. This is Hitchcock's most graphic film to date since Psycho. Here we are shown the obvious since Hitchcock doesn't show us what we expect to see-he shows us what we don't want to see.Very effective piece of work about what happens behind the privacy of closed doors,especially when two people are dead and no one knows what happens,even in the broad daylight. Based on the novel by Arthur LaBern titled "Goodbye Piccadilly,Farewell Leicester Square".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock's Disturbing Comeback</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a young Hitchcock fan who loved his big hits of the 50's but felt that he was declining steadily in the 60's, I was literally shocked to read rave reviews for the film from Newsweek, Life, and Time before it came out in June 1972. That giddy pride in a "fallen master reborn" was somewhat mitigated by the smallish, starless, and horrific "Frenzy," but the truth is, it was a comeback indeed.In "Frenzy," Hitchcock returned to London (where he made his name), returned to the "wrong man" thriller, returned to the "doubled hero and villain" of "Strangers on a Train," and, perhaps best of all, returned to the Great Hitchcock Villain.Joseph Cotten had been Hitchcock's great 40's psycho; Robert Walker the same in the 50's; Tony Perkins the same in the 60's. Now came Barry Foster's suave, cheery -- and quite insane -- Covent Garden greengrocer Bob Rusk as Hitchcock's fourth great psychopath, and his most graphically violent.Hitchcock created in "Frenzy" both a return to old times (London, "the wrong man") and a nod towards new times with "Frenzy." That's why it worked in 1972, and yet seems ugly and gritty today. Around the same time as "Frenzy" came many more R-rated films from a dark period in American cinema: "Straw Dogs," "A Clockwork Orange," "Dirty Harry" and "Deliverance" all featured, like "Frenzy," graphic sexual violence. But the rape-murder of "Frenzy" is perhaps the most meaningful: heartbreaking and not titallating at all; a horrific look at what real psychopaths do to their real victims in real life.There's plenty of British humor and plenty of Hitchcock style to leaven the single horrific (on screen) sex murder of "Frenzy." (Try the staircase scene, the potato truck scene, the Scotland Yard man's dinner scenes, and the line "You're my type of woman" as examples.) It is indeed a fine Hitchcock film -- if not quite a "great" -- and fits its particular brutal film era live a glove.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Movie quote) - "Now, do I look like that sort of a bloke??" OK. Here's my slant on things - For starters - "Frenzy" was certainly no "Psycho". Nope - Not even by a long-shot.And, speaking about "Psycho" - Character Bob Rusk (the fruit &amp; veggies guy in "Frenzy") was certainly no cross-dressing momma's boy like Norman Bates, neither. Nope - He sure wasn't."Frenzy" was released 12 years after the classic, twisted, shocker "Psycho" - And, if you ask me - It was clearly one monstrous step down the ladder when it came to direction by Alfred Hitchcock. This was especially so if the viewer was expecting to see an "in-depth" character study of a deranged serial killer. (I mean - Hello!!?? - There was no character study of this killer here, at all!) And, finally - I can't believe that Hitchcock actually had the low-down gall to substitute the sharp blade of a knife (slice. slice), as the killer's weapon, for (of all things) a frickin' necktie. (choke. choke) Anyway - Because of these 4 serious strikes against "Frenzy", I had no choice but to reduce my rating of it to just 3 measly stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock effects an awesome comeback with his penultimate film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This. This is more like it. After the last few Hitchcock films left me wanting a little, FRENZY returns to the type of film that he did so well. The plot is one that he frequently used: an innocent man wrongly accused, but he didn't just rehash old material. He upped his game and brought his filmmaking style into a more modern sensibility, all while maintaining the suspense and black humor that had become his trademarks. While I've yet to see any of the films from his British period, I am aware that FRENZY hearkens back to his first real success, which was THE LODGER. And in terms of what I've actually seen, I noticed a lot of DNA from earlier efforts like SABOTEUR, REAR WINDOW, and PSYCHO. The film grabs you and sucks you in from the opening notes of its title sequence, a fanfare which triumphantly announces that he's back: back in his native England, and back in top form. And it wastes no time in thrusting you into this familiar, yet slightly changed world. One thing that benefits the film a lot is the screenplay by Anthony Shaffer, which is filled with great dialogue and biting wit. There was also a sinister, Victorian elegance to the score. And, as with all of his other films, there are a few sequences which stand out. The best of these is probably a long, continuous shot which pulls back from the scene of a crime as Hitchcock leaves it (and its aftermath) to the audience's imagination. Still, perhaps in concession to the changing times, this film does contain some nude scenes and somewhat more vicious-minded, if not particularly graphic, violence. It reminds us that the gory details are often best left to the imagination; they're the icing on the cake, and not the cake itself. Another audacious thing Hitchcock does is make the protagonist rather unlikeable and have us sympathize (at least in one protracted scene) with the villain. Overall, I thought that he was in top form here, adeptly mixing suspense and comedy, all while exploring his favorite themes of sex, death, and food. In regards to food, the Chief Inspector's wife has perhaps a couple of the funniest scenes in the whole film. For me, FRENZY was a welcome return to form after the last few misfires, and it's great that Hitch seems to be going out on top.</fullReview>

What's best about this little gem is the fact that you can tell the old guy was having a bit of fun with it, he knows it isn't going to be his best or even close, so he fills this with nice touches of black humour, tonnes of bad language, and plenty of suspense. This is very much a middle of the pile addition, but the cast is good, it's very well structured, and it never allows itself to be taken seriously.

		<shortDescription>Mr Rusk, your not wearing your tie........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>London is terrorised by a vicious sex killer known as the neck tie murderer. Following the brutal slaying of his ex-wife, down-on-his-luck Richard Blaney is suspected by the police of being the killer. He goes on the run, with the help of a few friends who believe his stories, determined to prove his innocence......Some have said that Hitchcock had lost his sharpness for detail and storytelling when he made this wonderful movie, but when you look closer, and can appreciate the sense of humour in the film, and the early seventies London setting, you will realise what a brilliant movie it is.What makes the film so watchable is the little things that have nothing to do with the story or the narrative, but flesh out supporting characters. Much like the Inspectors meal times, which, without a doubt, is the single funniest thing in the film. Here is a man who would like nothing more than a good old working class meal, but his wife keeps making him all this expensive, yet disgusting fodder.And not only that, even though she comes across as an ignorant socialite wannabe, she sometimes seems to usurp her husbands professionalism when discussing the case (films plot). Or maybe this was cleverly included by the auteur to provide a sort of explanation of the narrative, because hey! it was the seventies, and it was okay to make out that working class people who saw this may not understand what was going on....Despite all the humour, the film is extremely tense, and the scene where the killer hunts for his tie pin, is one of the many highlights of this movie.Finch and Foster are brilliant, and Finch has that nervy, sweaty tick down to a tee. It's no wonder he is a suspect, he may at the wrong place at the wrong time on several occasions, but he acts like a ticking time bomb throughout the film.Foster on the other hand, is the seventies wide boy you still see today down the big smoke, your atypical Londoner, who turns as quickly as you can say brewers droop.It's wonderfully filmed,the tracking shot during the second act is marvellous, and even though it's aged badly, it's still a lovely little thriller, albeit very, very tongue in cheek.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock proves once again that he is the master of suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When we think of Alfred Hitchcock then our minds tend to shift only towards his most popular films like Psycho, Vertigo and Rear Window. This is for good reason since they are most certainly incredible films and helped revolutionise cinema. But at the same time with a film career spanning around 53 films he has many incredible classics that seem to be forgotten overtime. This is unfortunate seeing as it leads to great films such as Frenzy being less talked about then his other films.Just like all the great Hitchcock films, Frenzy is a suspenseful thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat through the entire film by creating interesting characters and placing them in dangerous situations. It's pretty similar to the other Hitchcock plots like North by Northwest in that there's one man on the run for a murder that he did not commit whilst the real killer remains at large.Though there are two differences to this formula. The first is that the film is far more brutal then his previous films creating much more detail and realism within the killings. So much that it was the first Hitchcock film to be given an 18 rating on release. Also unlike most of Hitchococks films which will maintain an element of mystery as to the killers identity for most of the film, this one shows who the killer is within the first act and maintains a lot of focus on the killer throughout the film. Whilst it is risky revealing this so early within the film it does have the benefit of allowing a far more in depth and interesting portrait in to the mind of the serial killer throughout the rest of the film. We get to witness his complete lack of sympathy or regret over what he is doing and how unnoticed he is by the rest of society. The reveal even leads to some incredible scenes that I'd place amongst Hitchcock's best. One of which is when we first witness the killer strangling his victim. Hitchcock uses a similar style to the famous shower scene in Psycho where he uses quick editing and varying close ups to add a feeling of horror and struggle that the victim is going through. There are two key differences however to the style being used in Psycho, with the first being seeing the killers excitement as he throttles the victim so we see it more from the victims perspective rather than the killers. The second being that this does not have a score and instead we hear only the muffled screams of the women as she is throttled, creating a more threatening feeling of eerie realism. Whilst not quite as iconic as the shower scene in Psycho it is still extremely intense and suspenseful and amongst Hitchcock's best scenes. Along with the killer the film also builds up the leading man who is falsely convicted of the murders called Blaney. Unlike the usual Hitchcock leading man Blaney is not an impressive person. If anything he is extremely reliant on other people throughout the film and is actually quite aggressive, to the point where you can understand why the police would be hunting him as a suspect. This not only makes the story more believable but also since we know that he won't catch the killer it keeps us curious as to how the real killer will get caught.I doubt that this will be anyone's favourite Hitchcock. But that's just because his classics just can't be beat and this remains an incredible film. It does everything that we come to expect from Hitchcock films, from maintaining his nail biting suspense to innovating his own formula by increasing the role of the killer within the film. There is never any doubt that this is a Hitchcock film and any fan of the director will be certain to enjoy the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hithcock's penultimate is one of his best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening title sequence scenically shows us the Thames, and the London shores surrounding it, announcing and advertising Hitchcock's return to England, after several decades away from his homeland. After a couple of duds, (Topaz, and Torn Curtain) Hitchcock returned to a more traditional story of an innocent man being accused of horrible crimes tracking down the real killer, updated and brought into the 1970s, with more graphic sex and violence used to tell the story. He also chose not to hire well known, "name" actors to fill the roles here, opting instead to go with fully competent, yet unknown, actors, possibly to avoid the studio forcing him to do a contrived happy ending, as happened with The Lodger, and Suspicion.In the lead, Jon Finch seems to be a sort of antihero, his odd behaviour really does lead one to suspect that he could be the real killer; and when we learn of his acrimonious divorce on the grounds of supposed violence, his excuse seems implausible, and only casts more shadow on him as the killer. He is far from the Cary Grant-type of leading man Hitchcock was known for having in the past.Best scene has the killer searching desperately for his tie-pin in the back of a truck barreling down the highway hauling potatoes, and having to wrench his most recent victim's stiffened fingers open to retrieve it, and then still having to get away unnoticed from the truck.The violence is balanced with enough humour, particularly involving Chief Inspector Oxford, and his wife, who insists on feeding him the most grotesque looking meals imaginable.Oxford also delivers the brilliant final line, which would have been the perfect close of Hitchcock's career.Perhaps with the bombs that were his two previous films, and with his advancing age, Hitchcock thought "At my age, I might as well have a go at graphic horror"? Or perhaps this was his attempt at going back to his first suspense film, The Lodger, crossed with his first real horror, Psycho, and updated? Whatever the reason may be behind Frenzy, it works extremely well, and is one of my favourite of Hitchcock's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good return to form for Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A good return to form for the master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock. Since The Birds in 1963 Hitchcock's movies (Marnie, Torn Curtain and Topaz) had not met with commercial success (though, personally, I think Marnie was great).Frenzy sees Hitchcock back to doing what he does best - suspenseful murder dramas. Great, intriguing plot with the usual clever direction from Hitchcock. Some of his camera angles and exterior shots are straight from his own book of how imply something and create tension without saying a word, or using manipulative music.The movie also has some great comedic moments. The Chief Inspector and his wife having dinner were always hilarious.Much more edgy in terms of nudity and sex than any previous Hitchcock movies. This could be ascribed to censorship restrictions being relaxed. Also tells you what Hitchcock could have done with is movies if all the stupid, puritanical censorship wasn't there all along.Not as tightly wound as his greats (Rear Window and Psycho especially), so not perfect as far as suspense and enthrallment goes.Good performance by Jon Finch in the lead role. Good support from Alec McCowen, Barry Foster, Anna Massey and Barbara Leigh-Hunt.Sadly, this was to be Hitchcock's penultimate movie. His final movie, Family Plot was released four years later, in 1976. He died in 1980.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine (almost) last salute</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, I know Hitchcock made Family Plot after this film but Frenzy is the one where he put all his trademarks in and brew another great work.Frenzy was Hitchcock's first British production since WW II and you recognize the atmosphere of films like Sabotage or The Man Who Knew Too Much. But Hitchcock added some modernity's like nudity and visible extreme violence to the mix. Already in Psycho he pushed the limits by showing a bath scene but in the years between that classic and Frenzy the standards of what was acceptable in mainstream films had shifted enormous. Hitchcock combined modernity with his old quality of showing violence without filming the actual crime. The rape and murder of Brenda Blaney is very graphic, in fact it is one of the most disturbing scenes I ever watched. On the other hand the murder of Babs Milligan is not shown in the movie but you know it will happen when Rusk closes the door and the camera moves backwards down the stairs and outside the building. Another great piece of cinematography by the master.There are a lot of other trademarks of Hitch in the film. The innocent man who is accused of the necktie murders. The actual murderer who is shown already early in the film so there's no who-dunn-it question. And there's the early death of the leading women. And of course Hitch made the villain a lot more interesting (and even sympathetic) than the wrongly accused man. Richard Blaney (played by Jon Finch) is a frustrated ex-military whose life is in a downwards spiral. A lot of failed projects, a divorce and no job. Furthermore he is a bad drunk and his aggressive behavior makes him a usual suspect for the police when his ex-wife is murdered. Robert Rusk on the other hand is flamboyant and funny but also an impotent and frustrated lover who blames his victims for not being able to make love the normal way.Frenzy certainly doesn't belong to the great masterpieces by Hitchcock. It lacks the normal suspense of his great movies and sometimes doesn't find the right balance between action and humor. The scenes with Inspector Oxford and his wife where she presented him with all kinds of French meals are funny but they draw the viewer away from the story. Then there are some imperfections in the script. The escape of Richard Blaney from the hospital is very unreal and the interview with the secretary of Mrs. Blaney where she stills works at the office where her boss and the owner of the company had been killed is an error. Also the climax of the movie in the apartment of Rusk is not one of the best Hitchcock has ever made.Still Frenzy has a lot to enjoy, some good acting and some scenes you'll never forget. I already mentioned the rape scene but also the scene where Rusk tries to retrieve his tiepin from the hand of one of his victims he dumped in a potato sack. There is the camera movement downstairs from the apartment of Rusk and also the opening shot where Hitch turned the camera from the Thames to the group of people who in a short moment will discover the first dead body of the film. So a very good farewell from the master hadn't he made Family Plot afterwards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock at his most extreme</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By 1972 Alfred Hitchcock's career had went into decline. He had suffered several box office failures in the 60's, including the lacklustre cold war thrillers Torn Curtain and Topaz, the films that immediately preceded this one. So it was perhaps not entirely through choice that Hitchcock returned to Britain to make his next film. Frenzy is noticeably lower budget than his other films, while it featured British character actors as opposed to movie stars. As it turned out, this set of circumstances led to the best film from the last decade of his career.The London setting is pretty far removed from the glossy locations he had become used to using. The gritty streets and washed out colour scheme contributed to the atmosphere of unpleasantness. Hitchcock also made the most of the changes in film censorship that had recently taken place. These were the days when major studios released violent and disturbing films such as A Clockwork Orange, Dirty Harry and Straw Dogs. With Frenzy, Hitchcock certainly responded to this change in the cultural climate. It's easily the most explicitly violent film of his career and indicates that his natural sensibilities may have tended towards this earlier in his career if censorship restrictions had allowed it.Its screenplay was by Anthony Shaffer who was also responsible for Sleuth (1972) and The Wicker Man (1973). Frenzy doesn't equate to those two masterpieces though it has to be said. But irrespective of who actually wrote it, it does contain a pretty standard Hitchcock narrative - an innocent man is wrongly accused of a crime and thrust in the middle of dangerous situation in which he must fight to prove his innocence. It's a storyline used in many of the director's films. It's just that on this occasion it is within a story with explicit sexual violence. There are some moments of the director's stylistic genius, such as the chilling tracking shot that takes us out the killer's stairwell and into the busy street; we are left looking up at the apartment where we know a horrible act of rape and murder is happening. It's an especially disturbing moment in that it forces the viewer to confront the horror that lies behind normality. The technique contrasts with the depiction of the first brutal murder. In showing the horror explicitly first then implicitly later both approaches ultimate compliment each other. While, there are also some moments of pulse-pounding suspense too such as the scene in the potato wagon, which shows that Hitchcock still knew how to pace a thrilling scene for high impact. Ultimately, Frenzy isn't one of the director's best but it is his last very good film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock's darkest and most lurid thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcock at his most lurid; the perverse, slyly satirical abstractions of Psycho (1960) brought into shocking, sensational colour. The heightened stylisation and implicit prevision presented on screen in a way that is still shocking nearly forty years on. It might not be his greatest film, but Frenzy (1972) is nonetheless an important work for the filmmaker; standing as his penultimate film - his first shot in the UK for more than a decade - and one that utilises many of his most common themes and preoccupations, such as murder, rivalry, mistaken identity and the presentable face of evil. It doesn't quite compare to the films he made in the 30's, 40's and 50's, however, it does, nonetheless remain a powerful achievement on Hitchcock's part, with at least three single scenes of exciting technical innovation alongside the more recognisable aspects that we've come to expect from the filmmaker's work.Unlike the more glamorous pictures that he produced in Hollywood, the return to Britain and the more relaxed approach to censorship of the time seem to have brought out the grittiness of Hitchcock's vision; giving us a film that takes place in a number grey, cramped and damp-looking locations that are cold and uninviting. Creating a squalid, slightly loveless feeling that is perfect for a film of this nature; reminding us of Michael Powell's masterpiece Peeping Tom (1960) - a film famously released around the same time as the aforementioned Psycho and one that presents a number of similar themes and ideas - as well as fitting into the sub-genre of films produced in the late 60's and early 70's that were incorporating the on-the-streets grit and confusion of the more radical European films of the 1960's. The tone of the film is fairly severe and austere throughout; shockingly so when we see the film in the context of Hitchcock's career, with the wit and humour reserved mostly for the scenes between the police inspector and his morbidly interested and yet still entirely cheerful wife.These particularly scenes really don't work that well within the context of the overall film; being far too extreme when we see them in direct contrast with the scenes of murder and rape that are still incredibly scandalous, not least by Hitchcock's standards - with the violence here seeming to be far more perverse and uncomfortable as a result of the director's keen, cinematic stylisations - but even in comparison to the similar violence of other films of this era, in particular A Clockwork Orange (1971), The Devils (1971) and Straw Dogs (1971). Without question, this is an ugly film; the ugliest Hitchcock ever made and one that strives to show rape and murder as if part of an exhibitions at a carnival sideshow. Some would perhaps argue that elements of the film are gratuitous, and indeed, this was the critical opinion of the time, but for me, it reinforces this hellish world that Hitchcock creates for these characters, alive with the daily grind of drab, everyday existence, and yet, cast beneath this shadow of murder and sexual assault.Although the indecency and uncomfortable violence (which is often more psychological than merely physical) of the film's central rape scene and the later depiction of murder in all it's complicated ordeal-like abandon are uncharacteristic of Hitchcock, the themes behind the film are some of his most successful and recognisable. So, as the wheels of the plot being to turn we have the issues of paranoia, suspicion and escalating tension being continually pushed as characters end up in the presence of the most ordinary of evils. Again, there's that element of grit, often lacking from Hitchcock's glossier, more mainstream features, such as those of the 50's and 60's, which again, adds to the atmosphere and the somewhat ill feeling of the film, which leaves us as used and beaten down as the central character himself. Really, this is an incredibly bleak and unpleasant film when you really get into it, with Hitchcock seemingly free of the interference of Hollywood producers and the rigid confines of American censorship and finally able to present his ultimate treatise on murder at its most basic and disturbed.The helplessness of the central character, as played vividly by Jon Finch, mirrors our own helplessness when faced with Hitchcock's cold manipulation; confounding us with expectation and taking influence from the then quite radical exploitation cinema to confront the depiction of violence in a way that had rarely been presented in a mainstream thriller. It is flawed to some extent, with the aforementioned scenes between the police inspector and his wife seemingly plucked from a macabre Ealing comedy, whilst the film is so dark, drab and ultimately unpleasant that it will no doubt turn many potential viewers away (particularly in the more darkly comic moments). However, fans of Hitchcock and those that understand cinema on a visceral level will be able to appreciate the impeccable style, with the use of sound in particular really helping to maintain that cold and claustrophobic depiction of the world that is further explored by that naturalistic, yet subtly stylised approach to editing and cinematography.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On the surface, Alfred Hitchcock's FRENZY seems to be a compelling thriller about a serial killer stalking young London girls. It almost is a horror film about film. Jon Finch is a London Bartender caught stealing DRINKS, and is fired. His best pal, Rusk (where are you, Barry Foster?) a GREEN-GROCER, offers him FOOD and encouragment. Meanwhile Scotland Yard is seeking a serial killer who rapes and strangles his victims. The head detective on the case has to endure his wife's HIDEOUS GOURMET COOKING while tracing clues such as a body found in a POTATO SACK, or the half eaten APPLE at a murder site. Also the food refernces abound in the dialog "Don't squeeze the goods till they are yours" the killer tells his victim, or the cop saying "We have to catch him before his appetite is wetted again."All this makes FRENZY a rich, creepy classic thriller. The food refrences aren't overdone. They are cooked just perfect. Delicious!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For those of you who haven't seen this, I won't spoil the "surprise" for you, except to say that I've owned FRENZY on VHS for two years now and it is quite a powerful Hitch murder thriller, making extremely fine use of its Central London locations and featuring many suspenseful moments which are enhanced by excellent camera work. Jon 'MacBeth' Finch gives a convincing portrayal as Dick Blaney, a down-on-his-luck ex-RAF officer who has just been sacked as a barman after 'stealing' some gin. He is penniless and he can't even afford to bet on a winning horse recommended to him by his best pal, Bob Rusk (Barry Foster), a well-dressed fruit and veg merchant. Meanwhile, a series of gruesome killings are plaguing the area. All the victims are young women who are stripped of their clothes and strangled with neckties. The killer is an impotent psycho-fiend who gets his pleasure from brutalising his victims. As if things can't get any worse for him, Dick becomes prime suspect after both his ex-wife Brenda and sexy girlfriend Babs are found dead. I won't reveal who the killer is, but you'll find out for yourselves anyway 30-40 minutes into the film. The supporting actors do an able job, considering none of them were very famous (maybe with the exception of Bernard Cribbins, cast against type as a seedy landlord). Alec McCowan is effective as the detective on the trail of the Necktie killer, Billie Whitelaw makes for a willing adversary against Finch and Anna Massey provides some brief warmth as the beautiful girl who stands by Blaney as he goes on the run and faces persecution.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Master's last hurrah...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the sort of film that Hitch would have made more often had he been born twenty years later. Some might be put off by the violent nature of the film and the unusually blunt sexual themes, but Hitch always pushed the envelope when it came to the subject of sex. In "Torn Curtain", he depicted an unmarried Paul Newman and Julie Andrews in bed together, and in "Blackmail", made in 1929, he showed a rather graphic attempted rape scene. In the case of "Frenzy", one must simply accept that Hitchcock was, as always, making the most of what the standards of the day would allow. All that aside, what we have here is a tremendously suspenseful film, and one that is often hysterically funny. Granted, the laughs are often guilty ones, but that's the sort of thing that made Hitchcock Hitchcock. If there's a downside to the film, it's the fact that the "hero" isn't all that likeable. True enough, but that makes the film more realistic. In real life, we don't often have Cary Grant handy in times of trouble. Tough, gritty, blunt, funny, and shot by a man who knew how to use a camera like few others before or since. Not to be missed. *** 1/2</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a disappointment Frenzy turned out to be. I always wondered why nobody talks about this Hitchcock film, and now I know why. It is entirely devoid of the style and nuance and subtle humor of the master's classics. Crime and violence are needless to say the focus of this director's oeuvre, but usually he manages to approach those themes in very artistic and creative ways. Not here.Frenzy basically offers the viewer insight into actual rapes and murders. Very unpleasant to watch and not mitigated by any aesthetic agenda--at least as far as I could see. But I won't be watching it again to find out whether I was just somehow obtuse. This was a unidimensional work which might titillate viewers who share the culprit's tastes, but for anyone else? Just plain gross. Way too graphic, and gratuitously so. Unlike Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange (equally disturbing), this film does not redeem itself in either message or form. There really is no message or investigation going on here. Perverted sadistic murderers have untamed desires and are to be avoided at all costs? Please.

		<fullReview>This is a terrible film. I decided to chance it based upon the laudatory reviews. If the name "Hitchcock" wasn't attached to this film it would have been dispensed with and forgotten.The real problem with this film becomes apparent in the last 2/3 of the film. Reactions of the lead character is wildly out of place with regard to how he is supposed to feel about some of the victims. The first 2/3 are drawn out leaving the last 1/3 to accelerate so quickly through a story to feel so contrived to be ridiculous. Hitchcock obviously needed to tell the meat of the story but hadn't the time to do it so he connects all the dots conveniently over just a few minutes.The discussion about rape and naked female bodies during this era only make me wonder about Hitchcock's own feelings toward women. I can stomach that but not the horrendous script. It gets two stars only for being slightly entertaining at times and in starting off with some reasonable promise. But make no mistake, this is not a good film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A most effective thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Post-Psycho, it is at first apparent that perhaps Hitchcock had lost his touch on how to hook an audience and keep them intact. There was the mediocre The Birds, the psychological thriller Marnie which I didn't care for, and the politically-charged Torn Curtain. Here, Hitch moves back to his roots, that is the busy and bussling streets of London.In terms of all of Hitchcock's thrillers, this may be the most grim and dark. It not only is the story of a serial killer but also that of a man being falsely accused, which Hitchcock used in several of his films, and also of a man who cannot seem to catch a break or get his side of the story out. There is a seemingly graphic murder sequence, but it reminded me more of the shower scene from Psycho. Hitch was not a sadist, but rather was able to convey the worst emotions and feelings through the camera and the quickness of his editing. Just as terrifying and beautiful as that sequence is clever and terrific shot of the camera moving down a stairwell after two characters enter a room.What also intrigued me was how much I got involved in the story. Hitch gives us many characters and really touches into their lives. Jon Finch is fine as the lead man and is able to raise adequate sympathy for his character despite his shortcomings. In my mind, the best performance came not from the dark Barry Foster who was great, but from the sensible and understanding Chief of Police Oxford played by Alec McCowen. It is something to watch he and his wife eat dinner after following a murder story. There is a lot to digest here, and more than one viewing may be needed. But, for me it is worth it as this is certainly the best of Hitchcock's later in his career and I think deserves to be considered among some of his best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frenzy is a very atypical Hitchcock film. The men aren't charming, the women are neither blonde nor beautiful, lines like "He's been pulling your tits" and "I let you finger me!" are fired off casually, while Hitchcock's black humour descends into borderline tastelessness ("I hear he rapes the women before he strangles them," "Well at least this cloud has a silver lining ? hahahaha"). That said there still some typical Hitchcock tropes present, mainly the idea of the wrongly accused man, but it's clear that Hitchcock is intent on challenging audiences' perception of him with a more atypical style of direction and scenes of remarkable brutality.Oh yes there is brutality. Free from Hays Code restrictions, Hitchcock seems to have gone wild with the possibilities of shocking the audience. Nudity, swearing and violence litter the film, but it's the disturbing, excruciating, almost painful rape scene cum asphyxiation that really stands out. Even by today's standards this scene is brutal, so imagine how it would have been in 1972. In fact, along with A Clockwork Orange and Straw Dogs which emerged around the same time, it must be one of the most disturbing rape scenes in cinematic history, and a point of concern for critics who have often labelled Hitchcock as a misogynist. It's mainly this scene that explains why Frenzy remains Hitchcock's only 18 rated film in the UK.After this gratuitous scene of exploitation however, Hitchcock seems content with disturbing us in other ways. The next 'event' is a masterpiece of how to show nothing but elicit everything. The murderer escorts an unassuming young woman up to his flat, and lets her in, remarking "You know, you're just my type?" As the door closes, the camera slowly backs away, creeps down the stairs, floats out the door and angles across the street as people go about their hectic daily business. It's arguably the most meaningful, disturbing, economic tracking shot ever performed, and shows Hitchcock can genuinely chill without flamboyant rape and asphyxiation scenes.Frenzy is by no means top tier Hitchcock, but it does contain enough flashes of brilliance to put it close and justify its position as 'the last great Hitchcock film'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just watched "Frenzy" from 1972 and clearly it's not one of Hitchcock's better films, in fact unless you are probably a die hard Alfred fan you may not even have heard of it. Still the film has enough suspense blended in with raw humor(especially the dead body being in potato sacks scene!) and wit to make it a watch. Plus the plot and story is interesting enough to make the viewer think a little bit. The setting was London, England for one of Hitchcock's last films the city is all of a sudden terrorized as a sadistic and crazy killer is preying on women leaving them dead. His method is to leave them them totally nude stripped of clothing and he leaves the necktie around their necks after he has strangled them! It starts off with Jon Finch as a fired bartender Richard who's down in the dumps as many think he could be the killer as he's accused falsely he must prove his innocence. Watch for the Barry Foster character a man who's shady with plenty to hide and he will have his true colors revealed. Overall nothing great the good story and suspense still makes it a watch for Hitchcock fans. So check it out if you haven't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"That man must be a sexual maniac!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As with most of Alfred Hitchcock's films, I find myself in a quandary regarding just how significant this film ought to be considered. Back in 1999, "Frenzy" was voted eighth among Hitch's best films by a panel of top directors, surpassing even "Rear Window" and "Strangers On A Train" which didn't make the Top Ten cut. I don't know, maybe it's me, but I'm generally in agreement with the majority of viewers for most of the pictures I review on the IMDb, but for some reason, I'm out there in left field when it comes to Hitchcock. And yet I don't deny his greatness among the world's top directors of all time, so maybe it's just a matter of taste, and I'll leave it at that.The first thing to turn me off here was the rather rude, actually downright vulgar description of rape attributed to a businessman in a bar scene discussing the necktie murders. With a barmaid present, the man opined that - "I suppose it's nice to know every cloud has a silver lining". I actually had to replay that scene to understand if I had it right. Now I'm sure that there are any number of Neanderthals out there who would offer a comment along those lines, but actually hearing it to describe a brutal rape and murder as presented in one of the film's early scenes seemed to be way beyond the measure of good sense and good taste for someone of Hitchcock's caliber. So what was he thinking? Then there's that murder scene when Rusk (Barry Foster) dispatches his first on screen victim, Brenda Blaney (Barbara Leigh-Hunt). I know it wasn't meant to be comical, but geez, couldn't the dead woman's expression be presented any less goofy than with her tongue lolling out the way it was shown. It seemed so amateurish and totally unconvincing, even though I've never really seen a dead strangled woman, so who am I to say.On the flip side, there are a lot of scenes that work well, particularly those that by virtue of mere seconds, manage to paint Dick Blaney (Jon Finch) into a corner while implicating him in the murder of his ex-wife. The film needed more of that kind of tension to be truly memorable to my mind, with a resolution that didn't place Blaney in even more jeopardy with the authorities. Consider, even though the girl in the final scene was already dead, Blaney began clubbing her with a rod thinking it was Rusk. Given the circumstances, didn't it seem a bit more than odd that Chief Inspector Oxford (Alec McCowen) simply hushed him to be quiet while anticipating Rusk's arrival? How does the law deal with attempted murder on an already dead person? Just wondering.Given that Hitch returned to his British roots for this film, what I probably found most interesting was the unique use of English colloquialisms in the story, and good old Mrs. Oxford's attempts at culinary mastery. The fish head in the soup was particularly appealing, while I actually wound up googling the word 'pilchard' to see what that was. Helps me understand the Beatles' 'I Am The Walrus' even better now.One last thing to consider - does it make sense that Rusk would put Babs (Anna Massey) in a sack full of potatoes before placing it on the truck? You think he had them in his apartment, or did he take the time to go all the way back to the market just to pull that one off?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chillingly humorous Hitchcock piece of work.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hadn't seen this film since about 1979 and since the GF expressed an interest in watching it I thought it a good idea to re-evaluate it post haste. As a proud Englishman it gave me great pleasure to see the Master back in England capturing the English time frame of London perfectly, for the film to work we really need to get the vibe of the place and to believe in the characters who frequent the area, I feel Hitch delivers this no problem at all.The story stands up as genuine thriller material, some crazy fruit loop is strangling women with neck ties and the police are trailing the wrong man...Sound familiar? Well yes it is, but Hitch being Hitch, he manages to bring dashes of humour to go with the tense taut terror unfolding on the screen.The cast do fine here, and I do believe that the fact that none of the actors are top draw names actually helps the film bring out an uneasy feel, here the interesting fleshing of the characters is one of Hitchcock's great strengths in this particular piece. The villain of the piece stands up as one of the best because he could easily be your best mate, someone you readily turn to in times of need, yet strip away that facade and you get the savage murdering rapist that Hitchcock takes great delight in assaulting our eyes with.Lovely...Lovely...LOVELY....LOVELY !Although its rating on IMDb hovers around 7.5 I have always been led to believe that Frenzy wasn't all that well thought of, tales of America refusing to embrace the film because of its London sensibility, and tired old arguments about the great man being past his peak etc. I have no idea if any of those statements are true? But what I personally know is that Frenzy is a very good film that has me squirming and laughing in equal measure, so with that it's just shy of being a Hitchcock classic, but still it stands up as better than what most other thriller directors could ever have hoped to have achieved back then. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Efficient if often dubious later Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock's penultimate film,and his final British-made vehicle,FRENZY was something of a step-up from his previous effort TOPAZ,but still somewhat below his highest standards.It is also without question the most explicit and graphic film the master was to direct in his long career,and although fairly innocuous by today's standards (the profanities used would usually pass muster now in PG-orientated movies),there are a few scenes which still cause disturbing frisson's,but not always for the right reasons.The plot,consisting of an aggressive,vindictive former military man,Richard Blaney (Jon Finch) who is jailed after being mistaken for a sex killer (including the murder of his estranged wife),but vows revenge on the real culprit,a former friend and market trader Bob Rusk (Barry Foster) has been done in scores of variations before and since,but despite the limited scope available with this story,Hitchcock still manages some of his distinctive touches,notably a beautifully filmed tracking shot travelling away from Rusk's flat as he is about to ensnare another victim,Barbara (Anna Massey),a blackly humorous and bizarre sequence involving Rusk's inept attempts at retrieving his tie-pin from Barbara's hand (now heavily in rigor mortis) on a moving truck;several minutes before he had disposed of the body by placing it in a potato sack and throwing it on to the said wagon, before realising where this incriminating piece of evidence was.There is plenty of decent light relief,mostly involving the case's investigative policeman Inspector Oxford (Alec McCowen),who very reluctantly has to endure his wife's awful endeavours at gourmet cooking while gradually realising that Rusk is the real murderer,not the now incarcerated Blaney.As has been noted,the most contentious sequence in FRENZY is the rape/strangulation murder,involving Rusk and Mrs.Blaney (Barbara Leigh-Hunt).Despite undeniable technical excellence and effective direction,I have always felt extremely uneasy about this scene,which is certainly the most graphic and brutal in a Hitchcock film,even compared to Janet Leigh's famous shower in PSYCHO and Paul Newman's brutal disposal of Wolfgang Kieling in a farmhouse kitchen in TORN CURTAIN.The rape and strangulation in FRENZY is properly shocking but also veers into being gratuitously nasty and voyeuristic.There was similar controversy the previous year with Sam Peckinpah's STRAW DOGS, when Susan George was raped in identical gross detail.At least she managed to survive that horrific ordeal;Hitchcock here doesn't give the character of Mrs.Blaney that privilege,and the legendary director lingers on the final act of strangulation and killing rather too much and too unpleasantly,ending with a brief and gruesome freeze frame of Barbara Leigh-Hunt's tongue sticking out in harrowing detail.The unsettling nature of the sequence is made all the more disconcerting as Mrs.Blaney had easily been the most sympathetic of the characters we had seen in the film to that point.Miss Leigh-Hunt's fine performance as a decent,gentle-minded and good-natured woman trapped by terrible circumstance,first in a doomed marriage to a boozy,abrasive,bad-tempered army type,and secondly dying in the most horrid way imaginable make us feel deeply for her character.It is also interesting to note that in a documentary interview he gave about the filming of this sequence,Barry Foster himself duly admitted to feeling decidedly uncomfortable while enacting it all.Most of the other cast come off well too,with a fine turn by Alec McCowen as the senior copper Oxford,effectively serious in his detection mode but amusingly sardonic when having to observe the inedible cuisinal non-delights concocted by his wife,also well played by Vivien Merchant.Barry Foster is chillingly convincing and plausible as the evil and depraved sex killer Rusk.Superficially he is very charming,well dressed and witty,until his sadistic and wicked nature is revealed.Hitch perhaps intentionally provides irony here,as the true villain played by Foster is in someways far more personable and likable than the innocent man accused of his killings,Jon Finch.Finch's performance as Blaney is so relentlessly unsympathetic and boorish that we never really care what fate has in store for him,even though it is clear early on that he isn't capable of such degenerate acts.As stated,this may have been intended as irony on Hitchcock's part,but the film becomes unbalanced as a result and we are confused as to who he really sees as the hero of FRENZY.Other reliable British performers such as Anna Massey,Billie Whitelaw,Clive Swift,Bernard Cribbins and Jean Marsh are adequate but again not especially sympathetic characters;the only truly personable character on show (as played by Barbara Leigh-Hunt) is as already specified,viciously slayed early on.The lack of any congenial characters in FRENZY is a considerable negative point,as is the venomously depicted rape and murder scene to a slightly lesser extent.The film's overall quality would not have suffered had Hitchcock elected to expel this sequence from the script or editing room.Because of this,FRENZY does not tend to linger pleasantly in the memory as classics like NORTH BY NORTHWEST and REAR WINDOW,or even his darker,more Gothic efforts like PSYCHO and THE BIRDS.On the other hand,we can be grateful that Hitch's genius,even when still not operating at 100%,can still produce some striking visual and aural moments,and deft handling of humorous interludes.FRENZY is still generally efficient Hitchcock in spite of it's numerous blemishes.RATING:6 and a Half out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Solid Hitchcock Tale of Murder and Sexuality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A man is going around England murdering women by strangling them with neckties. One man, Richard Blaney, is the lead suspect and his case isn't helped when both his ex-wife and current girlfriend turn up as victims of the killer. But it isn't Blaney... so how can he convince them of his innocence? I'm not a scholar of Hitchcock, nor have a seen a large number of his films. "Rear Window", "Vertigo", "Psycho" and "Lamb to the Slaughter" are the ones I've seen, I think (which now that I write it out seems pretty decent). I'd love to see "The Birds". But anyway, this one was right up there as one of the best -- a really good mystery and thriller. While the audience knows the killer from the start, we get the enjoyment of figuring out how to prove another man is not the killer. Which is a little bit backwards.I was somewhat surprised by the fake nudes. If you're paying attention, you will notice that the nude women in this film are not the same as the characters they are meant to be portraying. Less obvious is the zoom in on the breasts (which could, in theory, belong to anyone). More obvious is the woman playing Babs walking to the shower... she doesn't even have the same body structure or hair length. It's just completely strange.I'm also unclear what the purpose of the wife's dinners scenes (for the inspector) were supposed to be. Humor? Just a way for the inspector to talk to someone outside the police world? Granted, the wife's intuition came into play in a very minor way, and I did find these scenarios somewhat humorous -- at least enough to distract from the more serious nature of the film as a whole.I want someone to count how many times Rusk says the word "lovely" during the first big attack scene. It just gets creepier and creepier. Which I'm sure was the intention, but I was unsure how much he was sane or mad (and I think this is largely where the title comes into play. If this isn't a frenzy, I don't know what is).A solid effort from Hitchcock. Not nearly as famous as "The Birds", "Psycho" or "Vertigo" but still a good film just the same. If you're a Hitchcock fan, or like horror and mystery stories with less gore and blood an far more mystery and suspense, this is one you'll thoroughly enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How Alfred Got His Groove Back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Focusing on eyeballs during a nasty rape scene. Giving us an anti-hero who seems to deserve his foul luck. Throwing us into repeated confusion as to what is about to happen, then making it all-too-clear, in such a way we can fill in the blanks while the camera pulls away from the scene of an impending crime. Getting laughs from a killer's attempt to recover evidence from a dead body.Like "Frenzy's" Richard Blaney, a decorated ex-military man now scrounging for decent work, Alfred Hitchcock was on a losing streak when he made this, his darkest, toughest film, counted out by even some who loved him most. I'm not one to rank "Frenzy" as one of his classics, but it is a riveting and entertaining demonstration of his powers, as well as a nice stock-taking of the cinema scene in the bleak, sideburn-heavy early 1970s.After getting fired from his job at a Covent Garden pub, Blaney (Jon Finch) meets up with ex-wife Brenda (Barbara Leigh-Hunt) who lucky for him takes pity and sneaks some money into his coat pocket. Unluckily for both of them, London's latest serial murderer, the Necktie Killer, meets her shortly after, and her receptionist's testimony fingers Blaney as the one responsible. Blaney calls on a pair of friends, Babs (Anna Massey) and Rusk (Barry Foster), to help him out, though Blaney's bad luck has only just begun.Hitchcock's best films have a timeless quality. "Frenzy," on the other hand, feels rooted in 1972, with its angry-man, kitchen-sink ethos. The women are not beauties, the men no Cary Grants. Blaney may indeed be the least pleasant non-villain in the Hitchcock corpus. Told of the death of a woman close to him, he mutters "poor girl" and then quickly seizes on the idea he can be exonerated by her killing, not bothered at all by the obvious fact his hiding from justice allowed her to die. Blaney is the kind of guy who breaks a brandy glass with his bare hands, then wards off a helpful waitress with an upturned hand. Hitchcock thus creates some moral ambiguity at the heart of his film, ambiguity very in tune with the times. We don't like Blaney, but we pull for him anyway.Every few minutes, "Frenzy" finds ways to remind us of who is helming the film. The opening sequence draws us down the Thames, in a scene reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick's opening shot in "The Shining." The latter is a better shot, and in a better film, but you get the feeling Kubrick, like many newer directors, was taking notes. The masterful sequence between Brenda and the strangler, where he grunts while she prays, fully justifies Hitchcock's leap into a more explicit realm of film-making (he aims for tragedy, not titillation, and succeeds brutally), as well as setting up an even colder sequence later on when we see another woman ushered to her doom, a sequence that utilizes Hitchcock's dominant taste for discretion by using our memory of the earlier sequence, and our discomfort watching it, to killer effect. Have blank walls ever been so eloquent?Hitchcock's talent for misdirection is so intoxicating it may have intoxicated Hitchcock himself. The holes this time are a bit wider, and the McGuffins less workable, than in past efforts. Why can't Blaney prove his innocence of the other crimes, before the killing of his ex-wife? Aren't serial killers supposed to operate without motives, anyway? And have the wheels of justice ever spun more quickly than they do here? Finch's mannered Shakespearean intonations grate, as do the Good Witch Glinda accents of Vivien Merchant as a police inspector's wife. Fortunately the rest of the cast does better, and give this film a gritty reality that makes the suspense sequences more direct and savage. I especially like Foster (who doesn't?), Leigh-Hunt, and Alec McCowen as the proper inspector who manages to do double-duty as a voice of cold authority and needed exposition.This may be Hitchcock playing off his past glories, most notably "Strangers On A Train" and "Psycho," and not as good as either of them. I would even go against conventional wisdom and say Hitchcock's last film, "Family Plot," was better than this, though in a much different way. Yet "Frenzy," at its best, is a ripping yarn that allows Hitchcock a chance to showcase some renewed vitality, and make his faithful cringe one last time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>R-Rated Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing I saw on my DVD was a large MPAA "Rated R" card. And boy, is it. This is the most explicitly violent movie I've ever seen from Hitchcock (I believe it is his only R-Rated film), and the psychological and sexual violence that he portrays is pretty shocking, even today.We shouldn't be surprised, though; this was ten years after "Psycho", and even before that, Hitchcock had never been shy about pushing the limits of what was acceptable on screen. The limits were just a lot higher now, that's all. Also consistent with his past work were the bizarre touches of sick humor. They seem kind of awkward now, maybe because we've seen so many films in which this sort of explicit violence is played completely straight, but they make sense in terms of Hitchcock's style.It would be a mistake, though, to consider this film simply a historical curiosity or an example of "extreme Hitchcock". This is the work of a mature artist fully in command of his medium. Hitchcock is out to shock, and shock he does in a rape/murder scene that's as harrowing as anything coming out of "New Hollywood" at the time, then shows the young turks how it's done the next time the serial killer strikes, in a virtuoso sequence that doesn't allow us to see or hear a single second of the second attack but still manages to be almost as upsetting as the first.This film really underscores how much the modern "thriller/horror" genre owes to Hitchcock. His entire body of work laid the foundations for the modern thriller, and in "Frenzy", we see that he was fully capable of keeping up with modern trends, if not staying ahead of the curve: the way he reveals the killer's identity early on is reminiscent of much more recent films like "The Silence of the Lambs".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Violent, disturbing and subtly hilarious.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though much more violent and gritty than most of his work, this is certainly a Hitchcock classic, and much better than some of his supposed "masterpieces".There are no especially famous actors involved, but everyone does an outstanding job. Jon Finch is splendid as a man wrongfully accused of serial murders, and Barry Foster is just as phenomenal as the actual murderer. His character, Bob Rusk, was a very interesting villain, far from the typical movie serial killer.Hitch managed to make some scenes very, very uncomfortable. Most obviously, the infamous rape scene, but his use of the camera elsewhere in the film also served to create a lot of tension. He offset this with a good deal of black humor, witch I really enjoyed. The dinner scene was especially well done and subtly hilarious.The only real flaw that I can think of is the pacing, which is a common problem in many of Hitchcock's works. Overall however, I think this is one of the better films from the "Master of Suspense".7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Curious parallels to Hitchcock's "Notorious"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Food and humor play important roles in Hitchcock's cinema.The Chief Inspector in "Frenzy" relishes his English breakfast so much that he says he would have three breakfasts a day with coffee added. This is in contrast to his rejection of the elaborate French cuisine of his wife, served with elegance each night. I suspect the entire Vivienne Merchant's role as the Chief Inspector's wife who can cook the stylized French dishes and make margarita cocktails is the brainchild of Anthony Shaffer, the author of the play "Sleuth" who wrote the brilliant final punch line of the film "..you are not wearing your tie!"The Hitchcockian love for the generous English breakfast also comes to the fore in the 1929 Hitchcock film "Blackmail" where a Scotland Yard official watches a blackmailer relish his English breakfast. The rapist in "Frenzy" eats an apple after the rape and murder, enjoying it more than the crime itself or so it appears. The stomping of the grapes, after the lead character realizes he has lost a potential monetary windfall is yet another use of food. Finally, there are the sleeping tablets added to the guard's drink. Just as the use of food in Frenzy, Hitchcock made parallel use of beverages in "Notorious" which begins with a cocktail party, with leading lady getting drunk, several mentions of wine and a crucial scene in a wine cellar and, finally of course, the poisoned coffee. Hitchcock also seems to have loved the sequence of shots outside the court scene that starts off "Notorious" that he replicates it in "Frenzy"In "Frenzy," Shaffer and Hitchcock injected humor, which made "Frenzy" so fascinating, while "Notorious" bereft of humor was equally entertaining. "Frenzy" and "Notorious" are two of Hitchcock's most interesting films but more interestingly they have much in common as they are different. While "Notorious" broke new ground from kisses to the courtroom scene (editing), "Frenzy" at many levels seems to be an exercise to perfect several ideas that were attempted by Hitchcock earlier with less finesse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Modern Style Suspense with healthy blend of Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This picture can most definitely be classified as one of Hitchcocks late greats.The screenplay and writing is personal, set to London, up to times(for London) and never dull. All relationships are kept separate by some sort of force. Even though the characters can all interlock with one another, there is always little ways that keep them from getting entirely too intimate. What makes this picture so different from Hitchcocks other films is that it has the feel of a modern suspense story. A sexual killer on the loose. The film shows the physical aspect of the murders:nudity, anger, and overall roughness. Hithcock immediately throws his "wrong man" scenario in which fits perfectly. The graceful shots such as the famous walk down the stairs and into the city street remind us we are still in a Hitchcock film. The room fills with darkness when the killer is seen, while the innocent man is always lit. Another classic mis en scene. Another way this film gives off a modern feel is that the killer is very casual and happy to commit his crimes. Hitchcock directs Barry Foster, our killer, beautifully, along with the rest of the cast. Early pictures, specifically in Hitchcock, have the murderer nervous or fleeing the scene quickly. Our killer here waits around a bit and soaks in the atmosphere. Although not Herrmann, the score is upbeat and shocking when need be, thanks to Henry Mancini. Classic Hitchcock humor, infamous close ups, and a wrong man scenario with slow paced suspense makes up a great directors last masterpiece</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A triumphant return to London for The Master. Many fabulous Hitch touches really makes this stand out of his last few, not least the wonderful performances by actors, many of whom had not really appeared on screen at this point.The rape and murder scene is stunning in its hideous intensity. It shows how Hitch is so in control. It seems to have upset and annoyed many observers; I have seen it described as "disgusting". This is not unusual for Hitch. There is not, for him, gratuitous use of blood and outlandish violence, what that observer failed to realise is that to be raped and murdered IS disgusting, and this is Hitch showing that many "horror" films are not horrific; this is.He clearly loved to be back in London, and this film has London as an important character, whilst a stylised mix of the London he remembered as a child and early 1970's London, it is never a caricature.In short, a wholly enjoyable suspense/horror, with some lovely light touches (I particularly enjoyed the long silence of the Sergeant watching his boss enjoying breakfast), some great performances, and a fine dramatic ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another 'Alfred Hitchcock' Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film 'Frenzy' is about a normal seeming man named Robert Rusk(Barry Foster) that goes on a murderous rampage around London raping and killing women by strangling them with neckties after he violates them. A man named Richard Blaney was witnessed to be near the scene of the crimes and gets pinned as the murderer - and thereafter gets tried in court, on whether or not, he's the murderer.This film is one of my favourite films of all time. What I love about Alfred Hitchcocks style and directing in 'Frenzy' is the realism of how he shoots his scenes. The scene when Robert Rusk strangles the woman with a necktie and her tongue was sticking out of her mouth was so realistic because when a person gets killed in that way - their tongues do actually stick out of their mouth. I'v seen other films in which people have died by strangulation, but their tongues have never stuck out of their mouth. Why, because those other film directors didn't look into the reality of what happens when a person gets strangled - unlike Alfred Hitchcock. What I also love about this film is the brilliant choice of actors for Barry Foster was the perfect choice to play the role of Robert Rusk for his good looks, sophistication and superb acting helped make this film into what it is. Why I reckon his image suited the part of Robert Rusk is because a lot of British olden day serial killers from that day, usually did seem like average normal people.This film 'Frenzy' was exciting from beginning to end. I love the bit when he strangled the woman and dumped her in the potato truck and then afterwards realising that he left his tie pin with her and then having to track the potato truck down to retrieve it - so it wouldn't be used against him as forensic evidence. That was one of the funniest bits of the film. Anyway, if you haven't seen this film, I suggest you to watch it, for its a film thats way ahead of its time, as most Alfred Hitchcock films are and has a great and exciting atmosphere all the way through the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I've got to tell you - you're my kind of girl...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A month or two ago, I decided to watch as many Hitchcock films as I could. This adventure lasted a paltry two days, but, in that time, I viewed, for the first time, a handful of Hitch films I'd theretofore avoided. I hadn't avoided them because I'd heard they were bad; simply put, Hitchcock, after the brilliance of Vertigo, let me down. Vertigo introduced me to the man and it made such an impression that I promptly went out and watched his other major works. Yet, every new film I watched was a great step down from the previous film (Rear Window was a much lesser film than Vertigo, Psycho a lesser film than Window, and then the Birds and Rope sitting there at the bottom of the barrel). I couldn't believe that the man who had made a masterpiece such as Vertigo could also create the, pardon the pun, lame-duck Birds. In any event, I ignored my past and dove back into his oeuvre, watching Strangers on a Train (excellent), The Lady Vanishes (absolutely brilliant), Rebecca (fantastic), Notorious (superb) and Spellbound (decent). At the top of my list of Hitch to view, though, was Frenzy which I was unfortunately unable to locate at the local video store. Well, in the library last week, while trying to decide whether or not I should watch Fanny and Alexander for the third time this year, I saw Frenzy not too far away. I grabbed it, happy with my choice, and left. Of the several films I borrowed from the library that day, I saved Frenzy for last. I'd like to say I saved it because I knew it would be the best film of the bunch; in truth, I had no idea what to expect. Let's say I was more than pleasantly surprised. In my humble estimation, Frenzy may just be Hitchcock's second greatest film. Why? Mostly because its blend of terrifying violence and gallows humor is brilliantly inter-mingled - also because he reveals the murderer within the first 45 minutes. Your standard mystery/suspense yarn typically waits until the last fifteen minutes to un-mask the murderer/thief/saboteur. Hitchcock, and writer Anthony Shaffer (working from an Arthur La Bern novel), let us in on the secret early. That they keep our interest for the rest of the two-hour film is incredible. That, though, is prime Hitchcock for you because it's not what the man's films are about - it's how they're about them. In fact, this entire film is prime Hitchcock. It contains beautiful camera technique (the tracking shot that reveals a murder occurring in the hub bub of daily London life is gorgeously chilling) and the steady, but brutal, hand of a master in control. Case in point: the first on-screen murder represents the most uncomfortable, yet terribly engrossing moment in any film I've seen in a long time. (For an interesting counterpoint to this scene - which is absolutely taxing upon the audience - see the rapes in A Clockwork Orange, made a year earlier, which titillate rather than horrify). ( Also see the scenes with Scottie remaking Judy in Madeline's image in Vertigo for another example of this uncomfortable/engrossing quality). Oh, but did I mention that it's a riot too? Yes, that's right - Frenzy is very funny. The domestic scenes involving a police inspector and his wife's newfound affair with Continental cuisine will make anyone laugh, but the truly brilliant humor is much more subtle and much more dark. Not to give too much away, but rigor mortis has never been so amusing. I know it's atypical to call Frenzy one of Hitch's greatest works, but my belief in this fact is sincere. The master uses an R-rating to show us what, exactly, he is capable of doing. This is Hitchcock unleashed, letting all his darkness and absurdity flow forth in a sharply satirical, horrifying, and brilliant film. It takes the piss with Psycho, North by Northwest, the Birds - anything post-Vertigo. And, for me, it challenges his brilliant, early career as well. The only film it cannot touch is Vertigo, but to expect that it could is silly. It's a late masterpiece and would have been the brilliant end to a brilliant career (Family Plot is all right; but it's no Frenzy).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved the narrow settings in this movie, this always been near of the camera to the actor's faces. Some sequences are pure fun (the potato truck, the escape, the wrong guy going the wrong place just to be seen by the wrong person while going away from the murder scene). Somebody didn't appreciate the murder and rape scene, but we are in the seventies, cannot go back to the movies of the 40's, where nothing or little is revealed by the camera. In today's movie we can even see penetration scenes!and still not consider them porno movies, but "art" that shows the truth! I think what Hitch shows us is a perfect balance between the nothing and the too much. But what I loved most in this movies are the 3 sequences about our Police Inspector eagerly eating some traditional english dish and then trying to find a way to eat the eatable at home with his wife's prepared french gourmet delicatessen. I found them irresistible, maybe cause I am living in China and sometimes it happens to me to be compelled to manage the sea cucumber or the jellyfish or these "there's not so much meat,darling" dishes, and I think that people like Mr Bean owe more than a dinner to this Scotland Yard Inspector.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Frenzy" is a seamless blend of astounding visual style, gripping suspense, and well-shaded characters. The familiar, innocent-man-on-the-run storyline is told with finesse and conviction, and manages more than a few darkly comic moments as the film progresses. I think what impresses me the most about "Frenzy," though, is the way Hitchcock reveals the murderer's identity in the first 20 minutes, but maintains a high-strung suspenseful atmosphere for the rest of the film (which runs about 2 hours); there's a lesson to be learned here, especially when modern filmmakers can't lend their culprits 5 minutes of credibility without having them blather a long, tacky monologue about the nature of their evil. "Frenzy" is a classic thriller, yet shows Hitchcock adapting well to the times with the sexual and violent overtones of the plot. Well-done indeed. 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film of technique devoid of humanity.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film of technique and tricks, but without any serious human feeling. One watches almost dispassionately while these victims are brutally aware of their destruction. And, Hitchcock even makes jokes, as when one of the victims, whose bra is pulled down, discretely covers her nipple while she is being murdered, as if prudery takes precedence over her desire for life. We smirk while she dies. An essential element in any "Wrong Man" film is that there is sympathy for the man wrongly accused. On the contrary, this man is a whining, exploitating loser, whose imprisonment is no social loss. Nor is there any interest in the rapist himself. He's a smooth psychopath, but what complexities exist in his personality. Why does he do what he does? Why the same method? Why the same type of tie? This murder has none of the disgusting but fascinating deviances of Norman Bates. Except for the Anna Massey character, one feels no empathy for the victims. Hitchcock is just showing off. This is a technically brilliant film which seems primarily concerned with advertising its technique. As in his television series, with its self-referent introductions, Hitchcock is less an artist than an acclaim-seeker.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Frenzy" is a solid, if sleazy and dull slasher-thriller.**SPOILERS**Having been recently fired, Richard Blaney, (Jon Finch) searches the streets of London for work and comes across old friend Bob Rusk, (Barry Foster) and tries to offer him some help to get out of his predicament. Offering to go alone, he goes back to his ex-wife Brenda, (Barbara Leigh-Hunt) and tries to get on track again. Soon thereafter, he is fingered as the main suspect in a series of brutal crimes across London, despite being unaware of the accusation. When he is aware, he is convinced he is framed and is determined to prove to his friends Hetty Porter, (Billie Whitelaw) and John, (Clive Swift) and the police that he is innocent. As the murders continue, the case against him grows even stronger much to his distress, and becomes even more hard-up to solve the vicious crimes.The Good News: This one wasn't all that bad and did have a couple of good points. The best one is the incredible job it does in hiding the identity of the killer. This one is simply fantastic with keeping it under wraps, using plenty of different clues to switch it between the two main choices brought up quite frequently. That allows for plenty of suspense over the killings as it does a great job of keeping it ambiguous for most. It even gets a few solid suspense scenes in here, including the stand-out spectacular scene where the killer begins searching through a pile of garbage trying to remove a potentially damaging piece of evidence from a victim's grasp, while the truck is moving. The first murder is outstanding, starting off as a regular conversation with a deranged twist to it that soon turns into a full-bore rape that is quite shocking and then gives way into a brutal murder is an absolute stand-out of a scene, coming in so unexpectedly and being as brutal and shocking as it is allows for a spectacular scene that comes as a genuine shock. The types of kills in here are rather bloodless for the time but are more than made-up for with their brutality and explicitness, as the victims are all strangled with a tie, and the film goes into extreme detail in making sure that they're all completely in focus and that every ounce of their brutality is captured. The rapes aren't that common, but do pack a punch at the very inclusion of them, and are useful in making sure that there's a sleazy taste to the film. This one isn't terrible, but really could've been better.The Bad News: This one here is quite decent, and has a couple of flaws. The beginning of the film is a literal chore to get through, due mainly to the film's decision to go several different ways than before. The detailed back-story given to the characters is important to the later case made in the killings, but this is included with an inordinate amount of padding that manages to pop them in at specific moments that could very easily be overlooked. This takes the film a while to get into it's main point, and even then there's a lot more padding than there should be. This one here manages to take a simple story that could've been told in about ten-to-fifteen minutes less than this one is, as it shouldn't be about two-hours in length. The low-key nature of it all, especially once the murders have been discovered, makes the later parts of the film feel very languid and slow-going, another reason for this one to feel disappointing. It never for once shows any sense of urgency over the proceedings, keeping a distant air from almost everything that begins to rub off after awhile. There's nothing that happens which are really impressive, and in the end, forcing it to rely on other matters rather than the action, which is pretty slow. That makes the film's middle section slow, and is one of the main reasons for it being as it is.The Final Verdict: While it is pretty interesting, a rather convoluted beginning packed with needless exposition is what really harms this one. Recommended for giallo fans or Hitch's earlier works, while those who aren't that big on the European style of thriller will be more likely swayed over by the flaws.Today's Rating-R: Violence, Nudity, Language and several Rapes</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding thriller, exceptionally well-written and directed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After thirty years in Hollywood, a time which produced both Hitchcock's laziest, fluffiest films and his most personal and innovative, Hitchcock returns to the UK for "Frenzy", a grim and gruesome but ghoulishly comical thriller centered on a series of murderers by a 'necktie murderer', who rapes his victims before strangling them with, of course, his necktie. It's not much of a mystery, as we discover the identity of the assailant around a quarter of the way through the film (not before Hitchcock attempts to deceive the audience through his construction of certain scenes visually), which leaves it largely a 'wrong man' sort of thriller, but one with a lot of gruesome and suspenseful moments, and one largely devoid of the gloss present in most of Hitchcock's Hollywood output. It's grimy and gritty in a way few of Hitchcock's later films are, and is also Hitchcock's only film to contain an abundance of nudity and violence, which may to some seem unnecessary, but I found it added to the film's strength given the subject matter.One of several outstanding films scripted by Anthony Shaffer- "Sleuth", also released in 1972, "The Wicker Man", "Death on the Nile", "Murder on the Orient Express", "Frenzy" is typically well-written, with comic relief that doesn't feel even remotely misplaced (aside from one or two very slightly grating scenes featuring Inspector Oxford's wife) and an expert handling of the thriller aspects of the film, while also creating characters worth giving a damn about, so much so that when a certain death occurs one is far more affected than they would usually be by a film of this sort, where it is usually just another plot device. There are certain scenes that don't work, there are some scenes early on that recall the horrid ending to "Psycho" in their obvious and rather shallow explanatory nature, which is frankly at odds with most of this film, which quite maturely handles the time period and the changes in British culture, while very much keeping in tune with Hitchcock's own preoccupations.I was quite impressed with Hitchcock's handling of the film. In 1927's terrific silent film "The Lodger", his first film about a sexually-charged serial killer strangling women in London, he relied on one-upping the expressionistic methods of the time, and in 1972's "Frenzy", his return to the subject matter, he crafts a film that is clearly designed to be reminiscent of the countless films which focused on similar occurrences during the Victorian era and just after it, but then introduces the jarring modern culture of 1972's London, which works very much in favor of the film. Hitchcock, freed from the shackles of stars and censors, creates one of his most stylistically rich films. There are no particular scenes which match the best of his work, but the film as a whole is stylish without being too stylized, creative without losing touch of the story being told. There are numerous excellent tracking shots, some brilliantly expressive moments, and some expertly crafted scenes. Of course, "Frenzy" contains what is almost certainly the most horrifying and disturbing scene Hitchcock ever directed, an uncomfortably long and very graphic rape and murder scene, but one that is so beautifully filmed that a single shot of the victim reaching to cover her breast after he bra was ripped off is more effective than the entirety of something like Gaspar Noe's hilariously awful 10-minute long audience torture in "Irreversible", which was disturbing not for content but for how insipid and cinematically-retarded the scene was.The score by Ron Goodwin is excellent, and after hearing some of what Henry Mancini wrote for the film I have to side with Hitchcock. I would have fired him too, and I'm shocked that so many think Goodwin's score is below par. The acting is excellent as well, and improves drastically on most of the performances by the stars in most of Hitchcock's Hollywood films, providing a sense of realism and authenticity missing from many of those films. The cinematography by Gilbert Taylor is really good as well and helps achieve the sort of look Hitchcock desired for the film. "Frenzy" is outstanding. It's wickedly funny but also grim and brutal like no other Hitchcock film, and although it is not as good as some of his other films, especially not my favorite of the bunch, "Vertigo", it is one of the finest British thrillers of the 1970's, and a tremendously well-crafted and well-written film, and had it been Hitchcock's last it might be recognized by more as one of his best works, as it easily outclasses much of his Hollywood output.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not a Hitchcock masterpiece, but it is one of Hitchcock's most fun and precisely paced films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frenzy, in a way, doesn't do a whole lot different entertainment wise for an audience what Alfred Hitchcock's (British) films did in the 30s. The difference here comes in two important aspects- 1) the director himself, having created this kind of suspenseful, daring, but always with a certain degree of dark hilarity, has to go a little further with this kind of murder mystery, and as the second to last film of his career shows him reaching further into a bag of tricks not even to impress and entertain audiences but only himself. 2) this is the only true Hitchcock thriller to be made in the 1970s (Family Plot, his final film, is more of a direct comedy with light touches), and with the newly imposed R rating the Master finally utilizes well what his rating will allow for him. Indeed, next to Psycho and possibly one other this is one of Hithcock's more 'graphic' types of films. There's a rape, and of course multiple murders, some graphic nudity (tastefully) laced in, and yet never a full-on curse word. I once heard a director (can't remember the name) talk about how a film might seem in a quasi-period setting, and Frenzy recalls at times a more 'proper' London with its host of professional character-actors, but at the same time has to have the feelings and connections to the present time it was filmed. So Frenzy is, really, maybe the closest contemporary example to the Master's primary American-director descendant, Brian De Palma, in how it's very much 'of-the-time', satirical, and with an edge that is hard to match.That it might be short of greatness, or even less than how I saw the film as, will be up to the viewer and how one might see it in relation to other films in the director's catalog. But as a stand-alone work it's got a lot going for it on levels of a realistic grounding combined with lots of bracingly-subtle fun moments that bring out some really big laughs, along with the craftsmanship that heightens the suspenseful style. The whole idea of a neck-tie strangler is pretty amusing and the droll conversations about the killer made in the film add some fine touches to such a crazy, cool technique (that is, until its shown in rather brutal detail). Acting-wise, maybe early on I was a little wary of the character played by Jon Finch, who is down on his luck with money and with a minor temper-streak. I wasn't sure I could take a film entirely headed by Finch, who is good in the role, but is also partially grating as being somewhat out-of-place with his accent not looking his 'ruffian' self. Luckily there are two things that happen through the course of the film- Finch really gets further, and more believably as another 'Wrong Man' for Hitchcock, and there is the villain Robert Rusk played by Barry Foster. It's often commonplace in many of Hitchcock's films (Strangers on a Train being a good example) where the antagonist with his extra daring, danger, and half terrifying half suave demeanor make him more interesting for the audience than the protagonist. Rusk is really perfect for the role, and the first time we see him perform his act it does come as a great shock following a rape. What might be my favorite scene with him, if not in the whole movie, is when he's stuck between a potato sack and a hard place, so to speak, as he removes a piece of evidence from the literal grasp of one of his victims on a moving truck. This is a spectacular, apt take on the true absurdity that Hitchcock knows he's dealing with here, as it's the only way to deal with such horrific material in a good way. All this noted, it doesn't quite reach a mark of being an outright treasure of film like Vertigo of Psycho, as the aspirations are not really for anything very deep or amazing to ponder &amp;/or unforgettable sequences ala shower-scenes. And once or twice the line of the story, always as much of importance for Hitch as the movement of the camera, dips into little scenes that might not be needed (plus the ending all happens a little 'quick' in some ways). This being said, when Hitchcock does get the camera moving, or staying in one position, the notably standard scenes with the camera placed without much going on get into context with the bolder ones. I loved the backwards tracking shot out of the building during a murder scene, or the pause that is held in the alleyway (arrows included to where the next bystanders will come along) awaiting the reaction to another murder. Is it self-conscious of the audience, sure, but to hell if it doesn't all work. Frenzy is, with the other points I've mentioned, also a logical extension from the great, equally underrated work the Wrong Man, only this time there's more to take in with how far the director will take the similar material, like a risky stand-up comedian, and if it will stick. It does, particularly when focusing on a daffy wife of a detective serving food Bunuel might enjoy.</fullReview>

The plot is more pheasably constructed and the dialogue is more realistic than North By Northwest, for example. Some amusing British actors are given a chance to shine. Notably Vivienne Merchant and Bernard Cribbins, who contribute amusing interludes balancing out the more graphic scenes. John Finch is a slimmer dare-I-say-it more attractive version of a young Oliver Reed. His character Dick Blaney (tongue-in-cheek or what?) goes around calling everyone "B*stards!". Even women.

		<fullReview>Not even 'lesser' Hitch, but simply a bad movie. The cinematic equivalent of a dirty-old-man. Ugly in every way: unimaginative script, static point of view, putrid clothing, ghastly hair, unlikable actors, and one truly gratuitous rape-and-strangulation scene. The director's perverse sense of humor is present, but it is not applied consistently; the movie comes alive only in its cruelty. The women fare especially badly; 'Frenzy' could be used as proof the director was a misogynist, though a better explanation to me is that perhaps beginning with his TV series and 'Psycho'- which he himself described as an exercise in thrift, an experiment to see if a television crew could shoot a passable feature -Alfred Hitchcock had pretty much abandoned art and settled for commerce. In 'Frenzy' the great master seems to be bowing to convention, trying to go with the times and give audiences what he thinks they want- in the form of unappealing nudity, nudge-nudge winks, and general nastiness. I don't begrudge an old man his rest, but I don't want to remember him tired and lazy and pandering- time to watch 'Vertigo' again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitch's criminally underrated serial killer thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcock's penultimate film is just what you would expect from the master: a gripping, nail-biting thriller which manages to break a few taboos along the way. Once again Hitchcock effortlessly hooks the audience with his relatively complex storyline involving a strangler/rapist terrorising London and the man who is mistakenly believed to be the culprit. Eliciting excellent performances from his cast, Hitchcock here makes a one-off, unique film which offers a seedy, dirty view of London which is rarely seen.You get the impression that the city is a claustrophobic place, and that the streets are caked with filth. Behind closed doors there lurks hidden depravity. It's not a particularly uplifting film because of this but it's a damn good one. The photography is crisp making the film nice to look at, and there are plenty of stylistic touches (especially a tracking shot leading from a room where a murder is taking place back out onto the bustling streets where nobody is aware of what's going on only a few feet away).Jon Finch (MACBETH) heads the cast and is very good as the hunted man who becomes increasingly stressed and manic as time goes on but always retains his cool underneath. Alec McCowen makes for an amusing, pleasant policeman and the continuous comic relief regarding his wife's food is actually funny. It's easy to see that Hitchcock feels at home in his country and he rounds off the film with a cast of fine supporting actors, including Anna Massey, Billie Whitelaw, Gerald Sim, Clive Swift, and Bernard Cribbins (in a surprisingly straight role).Critics are unkind to this film because it's not up there with Hitchcock's best - it may have a few flaws, but it's still a damn good thriller. Watch out for the macabre scene where the killer struggles to receive something from his victim's hand and is forced to break her fingers due to the fact that rigor-mortis has set in. The violence and sexual aspects of the film are surprisingly explicit, and there's lots of female nudity in there too which led to accusations of misogyny. One particular moment where a woman is raped and then strangled is shown graphically and is very disturbing. Hitchcock lingers on the grotesque faces of the strangulation victim, complete with extruding tongues and bulging eyes. This is true horror and the most horrific thing he ever filmed. FRENZY isn't quite a masterpiece, but it's a well above-average thriller for movie buffs and one of my particular favourites.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock's FRENZY was released in 1972, notably later than his previous masterpieces of the 50s/60s, so it is much more graphic and sexual than all of them.The story is quite engaging, but it never does scare someone, because I did not really feel the atmosphere one supposedly feels when watching a Hitchcock thriller (such as Psycho, Rear Window, etc.). The movie does contain a rape scene (that was graphic considering this was in the 70s), where Rusk sexually assaults his friend Blaney's ex-wife in her office and then strangles her with a neck- tie. There is quite a bit of nudity in this film as well.The musical score was nothing special, but the camera work was good. The performance were good as well, and Jon Finch did an impressive job as the lead. The others were effective.However, you never really feel he is a wrong man arrested, as he is extremely casual about it; unlike Cary Grant's character in North by Northwest who tries his best to flee.Hitchcock's directing was great as usual.All in all, the film was interesting and the plot was great and engaging (and humorous at times), but I never really felt the atmosphere of a Hitchcock thriller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing this impressive masterpiece for the third time I thought Sir Alfred Hitchcock's active career took place two or three decades too early with reference to his true nature. Here he was free from the constraints of U.S. puritanism of the Forties and Fifties. He was a modern here. He showed how to direct a shockingly macabre story with brilliant flair and impact, but also with a fine balance between slashing and insinuation. Frenzy was Ealing Studio stuff transported into future, as an emancipated variant of Baronets and Good Hearts ? so British. Dear John (Carpenter), did you ever see this one?

		<shortDescription>Not Hitch at his best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From its sweeping opening shots taken from a helicopter, we are led to expect something rather stylish and certainly made with ultimate craftsmanship ? and we do actually get this occasionally, for example in the long tracking shot through bustling Covent Garden with Barry Foster and Anna Massey. But, unfortunately, there's also a sloppy, slapdash quality we don't expect from a master: Miss Leigh-Hunt's too white make-up in the club dinner scene, the obvious substitution of figure models for both Leigh-Hunt and Massey, and the fact that the movie is burdened with far too many expository passages. A movie is a movie. It needs to move, not stand still like a TV drama. And as for the plot itself? Dear me, it's a familiar old chestnut if ever there was one. True, Hitch has attempted to give it a bit of life by dressing it up with a bit of nudity and sexual sadism. But this attempt to be "modern" only emphasizes the dullness of the basic story and the one-dimensional quality of all the characters. The old-style Hitch used to go about dealing with like problems by directing at such a cracker pace that there no was time for anyone in the audience to suspend disbelief ? at least not until the movie was over! An ambivalent attitude as to whether Rusk or Blaney is the central character doesn't help. True, Foster is very competent as Rusk and tends to squeeze Finch out ? even though Finch enjoys top billing. The support cast is not great either, though Cribbins and Whitelaw do what can, despite their disappointingly small roles. Perhaps with a bit of trimming, the pace would not be so sluggish?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock's Joke</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A man who rapes women and then strangles them with a necktie is terrorizing London. Chief Inspector Oxford is in charge of the case, assisted by Sergeant Spearman. At one point during the movie, Oxford tells Spearman that when they catch up with the necktie strangler, it will probably turn out that he is impotent. Spearman expresses surprise, and rightly so, for this is a bizarre claim. A man who is impotent cannot get an erection, and therefore is incapable of having sexual intercourse. Therefore, if the necktie strangler were impotent, there would be no semen in the vaginas of his victims. Since all of his victims were murdered and thus could not give evidence, why would the police think the women were raped? Inspector Oxford does not address that question, but simply tells Sergeant Spearman that it is not sex that gratifies such rapists, but violence.Several years prior to the production of this movie, it became fashionable to say that rape was not about sex, and some people maintain that theory to this day. It is said that rape is really about power, about dominating women. Even if it is so that rape has some motive other than sex, there still has to be a rape, and that means that the rapist cannot be impotent, regardless of what his motive might be. If we bend over backwards to make sense of Oxford's claim, we might say that the rapist is able to penetrate, but cannot achieve completion, cannot ejaculate. But that would mean no semen in the vagina, which brings us right back to the question, what would make the police think the women had been raped?Oxford speaks with an authoritative voice in the movie, and so we know we are supposed to believe him. But aside from squaring impotence with rape, there is the incongruity between his words and the rape that took place in the movie thirty minutes before, when we see Rusk raping Brenda. In the history of mainstream cinema, no movie, made before or since, has depicted sex, consensual or coerced, in which anyone, male or female, experiences greater heights of sexual ecstasy than does that of the necktie strangler in "Frenzy."What is remarkable about this movie is that, in discussing it with others, I have noticed that a lot of people accept the pronouncements of the detective, notwithstanding their apparent inconsistency with the rape scene. This is in part due to the authoritative voice of the detective, and in part due to the widespread acceptance of the rape-is-not-about-sex theory at that time. I have seen people twist themselves into a pretzel trying to argue that the rapist never really got it up, let alone gratified himself sexually.I suspect that this was Hitchcock's idea of a joke. He purposely put this contradiction into the movie between the words of the pompous detective and the scene of sexual passion, as his way of making fun of that theory.</fullReview>

He is expert at dramatic irony. He welcome his audience into his world. We know who the killer is but poor Jon Finch is hung out to dry just as Cary Grant and Robert Donat were. It's what he does. He doesn't just give us death; he shows the eyes of the murdered as the life goes out of them. He has us follow a poor young woman as she marches to her death, not knowing what is at the top of those stairs. He is also comedic, with the police detective suffering through his wife's awful experimental cooking. As codes changed, Hitchcock changed with them and was able to be much more graphic. This is not Hitch's last film, but, I believe, it is the last worth seeing. The conclusion is masterful and will have you gasping for breath.</fullReview>

His portrayal of women in this film is close to pornographic.It is a very British film, with all the scenes of pub life and the understated British humor and elegance. Some of the dialogs and scenes are pretty outrageous but it is all understated. I was not all that impressed by JON FINCH. I remember seeing BARRY FOSTER in TWISTED NERVE and he plays a similar character in this film. The women are beautiful as always.It was enjoyable but not as thrilling as some of his earlier work.

		<fullReview>I've yet to see all of Hitchcock's films, but Frenzy has surely got to be his most brutal and shocking, a daring psycho-sexual thriller which, to the best of my knowledge, is the only one of his films to be released on DVD in the UK with an 18 certificate.Unlike 'vintage' Hitchcock movies such as Rear Window, Vertigo and Psycho, this film is far less focused on impressing the viewer with impeccably staged, cleverly edited, edge-of-the seat set-pieces and more concerned with bringing a sense of realism to proceedings. This means that there are no glamorous, big-name Hollywood stars?the relatively unknown British actors he uses look just like 'real' people?and the whole film is staged in the shabby, working-class surroundings of London's Covent Garden market.Hitch makes matters more gritty by pushing his film as far as possible in terms of sexual violence, with the first murder in particular proving extremely harrowing due to its explicit execution; it's a bold move from a long established director not afraid to change with the times. The director's black sense of humour is also very much in evidence and serves to make the movie an even more uncomfortable experience, the deliberately awkward juxtaposition of the horrific and the comedic making the viewer feel bad for laughing.This shift in style from Hollywood gloss to British realism might be a step too far for some fans of the director, but I found the change to be rather refreshing, and despite the occasional flaw in the plot (police procedure is particularly shoddy), I reckon that this is one of the director's more accomplished films, a delightfully twisted tale from an undisputed master of the macabre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From a filmmaking standpoint it's great. However, I wasn't a real fan.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I give this mediocre review out of my own deeply personal opinion of the film. There are some subjects I cannot handle; a story of a psycho rapist is one of them. Hitchcock's name is synonymous with edgy suspense films and until I had seen the this, I hadn't met one I did not like. From a professional standpoint the film has many, many great points. The long pan from the second murder victim's doom to the busy street outside, the scene that shows just how hard it is to deal with a dead body while bouncing around in the back of a truck, etc. Great filmmaking. However, I couldn't enjoy the film. For some reason, the subject matter struck a horrific chord with me and I couldn't stomach it. The rape scene was all too realistic and as a woman it was like watching a nightmare on screen; the line of a "good scare" had be crossed by yards. Cinematically Hitch is still at the top of his game...however, I will say that this is my least favorite film of his. Not really bad; I just could not enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lovely...lovely...lovely (Tongue-in-cheek sex murder story from Hitch!) xx Spoilers xx</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Weirdly humorous in places, for Hitchcock at the same time meant to engage a story of a serious subject about a London serial killer, dubbed naturally by the media as 'The Necktie Killer' - it says it all about the sex killing to boot! A plot involving a disgraced former RAF officer, Blaney (Jon Finch, sadly not seen enough in film)implicated for the murders. After losing his job to the 'bastard' Bernard Cribbins at the pub he'd worked at, his erstwhile pal, 'ladies' man, wide-boy, Bob Rusk (Barry Foster) tries to help him out but, too proud to accept his help for a job, cash and a tip on a horse (that comes in and he failed to back) he then goes to see his ex, played by Barbara Leigh-Hunt. They do get on a little, but Blaney's the 'angry man' who always lets that get the better of him. Helped also by 'Babs' at the pub, the late Anna Massey ... let's just say that the latter two ladies end up wearing a tie, implicating Blaney further - what is it they say, victims are always victims to someone they know!!! So... in comes Alec McCowen, as the police officer investigating, with a neat touch of a horrible wife who likes to kill too ... by serving McCowen with awful 'experimental exotic recipes'. Whilst lapping up fry-ups when he's away from her, he's hunting for Blaney. But... however it looks, with tip-off after tip-off about Blaney's whereabouts and help from his posh mate Clive Swift, this guy's just so unlucky. Right up until the police finally get somewhere other than promotion in locating ... should I say who? I 'have' got SPOILERS up, so read no further if you don't want to know... yep, it was his chum, right along, Bob Rusk ... some friend!The end is a nice piece as it looks as if Blaney has caught up with Rusk ... only for the police to finally nab him. This thriller had some good acting from 'angry' Finch as Blaney with a good supporting British cast. Some nice lines ... when a barmaid says to a 'regular' lawyer, 'He rapes them FIRST' ... 'Well, every cloud has a silver lining' replies the lawyer!!! 'We haven't had a good murderer since Christie, it's so good for the tourist trade ... they all think our streets are full of Hansom Cabs and whores with ripped throats!' he goes on! A nice little niche especially as it was Hitchcock's last, set in his own home town, with some neatly played touches of humour as I say. Foster is palatable as the murderer and people who don't like Blaney (the word 'bastard' is often used by him and others about him!) made this watchable. It's probably not lasted the test of time but still is worth your time if you like a thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>brutal Alfred Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a serial killer/rapist on the loose in London. Richard Blaney (Jon Finch) is a former RAF officer and a wandering unemployed loser. He has a loud argument with his ex-wife Brenda Blaney (Barbara Leigh-Hunt). When the real serial killer claim Brenda as his next victim, Richard Blaney becomes the mistaken target of the police's investigation.Alfred Hitchcock is evolving. He's foreshadowing a move to more graphic violence in horrors to come. He dispenses with the stylish killing of Psycho with a more brutal realistic portrayal. He's pushing the audience to its limits. The violence isn't the cartoon violence of Texas Chain Saw Massacre which would come 2 years after this or the blood gushing of the Japanese Samurai movies. The serial killer rapes and strangles this girl. The camera pushes right into her face as she dies. It's a disturbing visual.The weakness is really the directing style and the acting. It has the static feel and extended shots of an earlier era. Although the brutality of the kill is there, the speed and excitement of more modern movies is missing. He is too rooted in his old traditional moves. It would take a new breed of directors to take horror into a new golden age.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frenzy is a very watchable film. As a typical Hitchcockian film, it has all the elements of this 'genre' but that time also tied with tons of black comedy. And as a fan of both black comedy and thriller genres, i really appreciated this film. The script is good,the character development is once again phenomenal and essential for the thriller(typical Hitchcock standard,perhaps). A very convincing conflict and a very convincing resolution as well. The acting was mostly average, except by the good performance by Barry Foster. I just bothered a little with the more than often poor dialogues sequences. Maybe i got it wrong, and some of these poor dialogues are purposely there, to accentuate the weird atmosphere in the film. But if is that the case, i am sure that it don't worked. At least for me. Still, despite having sometimes bad dialogues and even very disturbing moments, 'Frenzy' is a good watch. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock directed this violent thriller set in London that stars Jon Finch as Richard Blaney, an unlucky and unpleasant man who becomes the chief suspect in a rash of brutal murders of women called the Necktie Killer. It turns out to be the work of his friend Robert Rusk(played by Barry Foster) who is more than happy to see Richard take the blame, especially when his ex-wife is the next victim, forcing Richard to go on the run to prove his innocence... Though this is a livelier film than Hitch's previous two pictures, with some style and suspense, the story and lead characters are so unpleasant and unsympathetic that it would have been better to tell the whole film from the perspective of the Chief Inspector(played by Alec McGowan), since he is the only likable character around!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Underrated Gem In The Twilight Of Alfred Hitchcock's Remarkable Career.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The penultimate feature film in the extensive yet illustrious career of Alfred Hitchcock is a highly underrated gem that paints a fascinating portrayal of a serial killer and, as a movie, employs all the director's trademarks &amp; styles which over the years have only played an influential role in shaping up the filmmaking manual for Hollywood's modern thrillers.Set in London, the plot of Frenzy centers around a serial killer who has been terrorizing the city by raping women &amp; strangling them with neck-ties. When the ex-husband of the serial killer's latest victim is suspected by the police for being the killer, he goes on the run to prove his innocence by finding &amp; exposing the neck-tie murderer.Superbly directed by Hitchcock, Frenzy marks his return to murder genre &amp; introduces the antagonist to the audience in its opening moments only which makes the following acts even more nail-bitingly tense as the killer's subsequent planning of murders &amp; its execution brings a fear of its own and keeps the whole drama quite suspenseful.The entire movie is tightly structured, deftly written &amp; employs a number of classic Hitchcock set pieces. Cinematography provides a grim atmosphere to the picture, camera movements are smoothly carried out &amp; few sequences are beautifully photographed. Editing keeps the tension alive throughout its runtime while the score manages to makes use of light or dark undertones at the right places.On an overall scale, most works by Hitchcock after the creative height he touched with Psycho are often seen by many as his journey downward but Frenzy shows that even in the twilight of his career, Hitchcock remained as competitive &amp; challenging as the best directors of the early 1970s. An intensely gripping entertainer from the first frame to the last, Alfred Hitchcock's Frenzy comes highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Case of the Sadistic Cook</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>FRENZY is about the uncontrollable urge that strikes some guys to strangle the women around them. Some such stranglers are sharp enough to realize that if they get married and throttle their spouse, they will be at the top of the police suspect list, since the husband always falls under suspicion first. If such a man hankers to experience multiple episodes of FRENZY, he'll often remain single, like the main character of this Hitchcock movie. However, the REAL focus of FRENZY is an examination of the life of a man whose wife does everything humanly possible to drive him to strangulation mode, yet does not have a care in the world since the husband has the will power NOT to resort to such an obvious solution to his torment. I'm talking about Chief Inspector Oxford and his killer cook wife, of course. Wonderfully cast in these roles are Alec McCowen and Vivien Merchant. At one point, the latter snaps a stalk of celery for emphasis, and the viewer is certain Hitchcock is showing what Inspector Oxford would like to do to her neck. Instead, he continuously finds ingenious ways to dispose of the results of Mrs. Oxford's fine cuisine cooking classes (uneaten, of course) and tolerates her string of oblivious prattle. One can only surmise that the Mrs. must be really GIB.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hitchcock's tongue wasn't in his cheek-it was in his cerebellum, laughing at the thought of a dead naked woman covered by potatoes, clutching a stick pin in its grip, while the killer breaks each finger to get it back. You can't deny it is both absurd and funny, a thriller where you know who's guilty and who's innocent and find the circumstances unbelievable and too coincidental. The first murder you see (of the innocent man's former wife) is truly horrific, the victims all likable and unfortunate victims of a British Norman Bates. Hitchcock moved into bizarre territory like his contemporary Otto Preminger, and even if his later films are not as bad as "Skidoo", they are equally perverted and not for all tastes, especially those who liked "Rebecca" and "Lifeboat".A funny gag has the inspector dealing with his wife's hideous French cooking. Why this is put into the film is beyond comprehension, but if the potatoes aren't a metaphor for Hitchcock's tremendous appetite, than the pit's feet are. The film has a great opening of the London skyline and the waterfront where the first body is discovered. This is the only Hitchcock film to include nudity, not gratuitous but rather shocking nonetheless. In the case of the accused and the killer, this is definitely the study of the difference between a man with uncontrollable anger and one with downright psychosis. Hitchcock utilizes a lot of humor here, some that might be considered in bad taste, but you may find yourself laughing at it in spite of how tacky it really all is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Alfred Hitchcok's best film since "Psycho" the nerve wrecking thriller "Frenzy" has the usual ingredients you would expect from a Huitchcock thriller. A innocent man former RAF Squadron Leader Richard "Dicko" Blaney, John Finch, is framed for a string of brutal killings,The Neckktie Murders", of young women in London that included his just divorced wife Brenda, Barbara Leigh-Hunt, and girlfriend Babs Milligan, Anna Massey. As we soon found out it was Dicko or Richard's good friend fruit and vegetable distributer Robert Rusk, who was committing the murders. Rusk who was a disgruntled client of Richard's wife's matrimonial service in her not being able to provide him with the kinds of women, those who are heavily into S&amp;M, that's he's looking for.It was Richard's big mistake in trusting Rusk to hide him from the police who in fact turned him in as soon as he left his apartment where Richard was on the lamb. Arrested convicted and sentenced to 25 to life Richard now with nothing to lose is determined to escape from prison and get even with Rusk,by killing him, for all the trouble he caused him including the murder of two women in his life Brenda &amp; Babs! It took a while but Richard did escape from prison, after faking an injury, and finally have a chance to get even with Rusk but it was Rush himself who in the end not only screwed himself up but ended up exonerating Richard! That's by him continuing on his murder spree without realizing that it would prove Rihard's, who was in prison at the time,innocence!The film "Frenzy" has a number of harrowing and gut crunching scenes in it that top anything that the most modern slasher like films can't even come close to duplicating. All that without as much as a drop of blood in them! One is the murder of Branda Blaney who's strangled by a crazed Robert Rusk in her office with his necktie and the strangulation of Babe, also with a necktie, in Rusk's apartment. ***SPOILERS*** It was Babs who grabbed onto Rusk's tie-pin and clenched it in her dead fingers that had him end up in a truck loaded with sacks of potato's, with Babs in one of them, trying to retrieve it. Watching Rusk desperately trying to get his tie-pin out of the dead Bab's cold stiff fingers was has shocking as seeing him murder any of his live victims. But by far the most shocking and over the top scenes in the film was the French gourmet food cooked up by Chief Scotland Yard Inspector Oxford's, Alec McCowen, wife played by Vivian Merchant. That made even the the most grizzly murders in the film look like child play in comparison!P.S "The Master" Alfred Hitchcock made his usual cameo appearance in the movie in the very first scene when a young women's body of the neck-tie killer washes up in the polluted and muddy River Thames. You can see him in the crowd of shocked onlookers wearing a black derby. The film so shocked Hitchcock's daughter Pat that she wouldn't allow her two teenage daughters to even see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock's most brutal film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In his penultimate film, Alfred Hitchcock makes use of the presumably more lenient censorship rules with one of his most explicitly violent and perverse films. Frenzy tracks Richard Blaney, a rugged man who finds everything going against him (e.g. losing his job, missing out on a great horse bet, and having to sleep at a homeless shelter) even before he gets falsely accused of being the 'necktie murderer', a serial killer raping and murdering young women in London.With one rape and murder scene clocking in at almost ten minutes, it is definitely the most brutal Hitchcock film I have seen, and he also includes more nudity than in all other films of his combined. He also brings some new tricks to the film in terms of camera work; all murders are for instance followed by magnificent extended shots outside the buildings where the crimes took place. The second murder in particular, where we get to follow the necktie murderer and his victim to the front door, after which the camera slowly backs out of house, is possibly my favourite Hitchcock scene ever.Other than that, a lot is familiar from his previous films. Like in Shadow of a Doubt (and probably most others), everyone in the movie is morbidly interested in murders, and the people at the local pub talk about how a "good juicy series of sex murders" is good for the tourism. And sort of like the mysterious waitress in Shadow, there is some strange comic relief in the shape of the wife of the police officer, whose gourmet cooking grows increasingly distasteful. There is also a very hitchcockian scene in the back of a potato truck. Finally, Hitchcock continues to follow the theme of "crime does not pay" slavishly, even though the final scene suggests an alternative ending that would have been much more haunting.All in all, Frenzy might not be Hitchcock's best film but it still deserves more recognition than it gets, and it is refreshing to see him being able to operate with fewer restrictions and without having to circumvent censorship through allusions, even though this does not automatically lead to a better result. It does, however, make the film feel more modern in the sense, even though the film's violent objections against sadomasochism feel a bit dated, on the other hand.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A serial killer nicknamed the 'necktie murderer' is terrorizing women in London, and Richard Blaney (Jon Finch), seen at the wrong place at the wrong time, becomes the chief suspect. How to prove his innocence?Alfred Hitchcock's next-to-last film has a very English feel to it with an all-British cast and gritty London locations. Void of scares but with grotesque and disturbing moments, the plot never arouses real 'frenzy' (especially among the audience); still, it is an entertaining, if low-budget, film. Scenes of cruelty are balanced with light-hearted marital humor, courtesy of Alec McCowan who plays the inspector on the case. Jon Finch is good as the innocent man, although he lacks a certain charisma as does Barry Foster as a fruit seller. Anna Massey gives a good performance as Richard's girlfriend, but, like the others, she seems rather ordinary.The soundtrack is unremarkable and the most dramatic scenes lack music entirely. The movie held my interest, but, all in all, was good rather than great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's few things more enjoyable than sitting down to a well told tale. Whether it be a great book, or a wonderful movie, you get comfortable knowing you're in for a treat. Such is the feeling when sitting down to Alfred Hitchcock's 'Frenzy' Released in 1972, it's a later Hitchcock film, but one that has not lost any of the master's distinguished touches or style. In fact, it even treads new ground for the director, in view of the brutal rape and strangling scene that must have shocked early 1970's sensibilities. Set, and shot in London, 'Frenzy' brings us a tale of 'The Necktie Killer' as London papers are calling him, a sadistic psychopath who rapes and strangles his victims, with his calling card neckties. Police are baffled, until Dick Blaney comes walking along. Just fired from a bar tending job, he walks the streets of London's fruit and vegetable market, depressed about his prospects, he meets of old friend Bob Rusk, a vegetable stand operator. Here's where things start going very wrong for Mr. Blaney. Hitchcock's plot device of the innocent man caught in a web of lies, deceit, and murder is again focused on here, with a knot slowly twisting around the wrong man's neck. It is a joy to watch the cast, which is uniformly excellent as the story unfolds. Throw in a superb plot, excellent score, and the trademark Hitchcockian black humor and you have a winner. 'Frenzy' is a wonderful ride through London that shouldn't be missed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"You know how morbid some people are"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock is one of a very small number of directors whose career spans the entire classic era, beginning during the silent period and ending after the abolition of the production code. Frenzy is his first, as it were, "post-code" movie, when restrictions upon violence, profanity and sexual content were lifted. Frenzy takes advantage of all three liberties.The screenplay for this one was written by the brilliant Anthony Schaffer, he of Sleuth and The Wicker Man, specifically for Hitchcock. As it's a made-to-measure job, Schaffer (who shared many of the director's sensibilities) seems to have set out to craft the archetypal Hitchcockian thriller. Adapting from a novel by Arthur La Bern with some significant changes, Schaffer has concocted a tale full of morbid sensationalism, in which people seem intrigued rather than horrified by the spate of grisly murders. Unlike the Hitchcock heroes of the previous few decades as would be played by the perfectly likable Cary Grant or Jimmy Stewart, Dick Blaney is a severely flawed hero ? short-tempered, spiteful, a drinker. And yet Schaffer quickly introduces him as likable not by what he does, but by showing him in his first scene being berated by an even more miserable looking Bernard Cribbins, and then consoled by the sweet and pretty Anna Massey. If Cribbins is his enemy and Massey his girlfriend, we think to ourselves, this guy can't be too bad.This less restricted era of filmmaking demonstrates to us the sort of thing Hitch would have normally wanted in his pictures had he the chance, with plenty of nudity and graphic brutality. And yet the Master of Suspense? is never gratuitous or completely explicit. In the first rape and murder scene, Hitch uses a series of images ? eyes, hands etc ? to give you an impression of the event, just as he did with the shower scene in Psycho a decade earlier. The only difference is that at the time of Psycho he would not have been able to display the victim's exposed breasts. The result is easily the most disturbing sequence Hitch ever created, the implied sexual element giving it that extra wave of unpleasantness. Much has been made of the second murder, which takes place offscreen and it is indeed masterly how Hitch does this with the renowned tracking shot retreating down the stairs. What is great is the way the scene begins, with another tracking shot showing killer and victim walking through the realistic bustle of Covent Garden, which leads us into this feeling that we are accompanying the victim, and may see her managing to escape. Then when the camera tracks away, there is this awful feeling of helplessness, as if we've abandoned her. The trick is complete as the noise and crowds of the street reappear, as if to smother out the crime.A somewhat different kind of cast is assembled for this Hitchcock jaunt. Hitch usually went for well-known stars with an established persona, which he could play on or subvert. The faces here are less familiar, and this now being an era where actors are expected to be versatile they come with no strings attached, as it were. At first we genuinely can't tell who is the good guy and who is the bad. Sadly Jon Finch gives a rather awkward, overwrought performance, and it occurs to me that if he isn't convincing to the audience what hope would his character have with the police? But never mind, it's a mainly decent bunch otherwise. Barry Foster is superb, portraying this believable easygoing façade, then effortlessly sliding into anger and creepiness. Next best is Barbara Leigh-Hunt, who has in many ways the most difficult role, but manages to make a real impact, and not just in the most obvious scene but before that.Of course what also makes this cast very different is that they are all English. This was Hitchcock's first British production in over forty years. The director had learnt a lot in that time, and regulations had certainly changed and yet it seems in many ways Frenzy has more in common with those earlier British films. Perhaps it's the lively London setting and the brassy Cockney accents, but it's also that gleeful grimness, such as the cheerful discussion about murderous psychopaths in the pub, or simply how businesslike everyone is about a serial killer stalking the streets. There are links here to similar scenes in The Lodger (1927) and Blackmail (1929), and really Frenzy is little more than a modern version of these pictures, with the addition of the odd naked female and a handful of four-letter words.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Raw and uncompromising, Frenzy tells the tale of a man wrongly accused of a series of murders, documenting in detail just how such a foul-up can take place, before moving on swiftly and economically to how he, and the police, go about righting the injustice.Frenzy is rightly celebrated by film buffs for its brutal but honest portrayal of rape, and a tracking shot down stairs that raises the hairs on the back of your neck by what it doesn't reveal. There are the usual Hitchcokian tropes - genre juxtaposition, gallows humour, early wrong-footing of the audience, mealtime banter. The experimental cooking by the wife of Chief Inspector Oxford (Alec McCowen), and his attempts to circumvent it, are hilarious, with the added layer that his wife has more insight on the case than he credits her with. Contrast this with the scene where the killer's psychosis kicks in and he tortures Brenda Blaney (Barbara Leigh-Hunt), hailed as one of the most unflinching and gut-wrenching episodes of screen violence.The era is lovingly captured, and Anthony Shaffer's script keeps it all buzzing along at a brisk tempo. There is the ubiquitous Hitchcock ending, where the credits seems to barge in before their time. Not a masterpiece, but masterly in places, and unmissable to appreciate the full Hitchcock canon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Hitchcock Did with Freedom of Expression</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frenzy is the last truly good film put out by Alfred Hitchcock. Filmed in 1972, it was the only film he ever made without having to deal with censorship. The result is a gripping thriller that allows Hitchcock to explore darker elements that were only implicit in his previous work.The film revolves around the plight of Richard Blaney, a London barkeep whose life collapses when a convoluted set of circumstances result in him being mistaken for the perverse "Necktie Killer" who has been terrorizing London. He is soon embroiled in a quest to escape the authorities and track down the real killer.What sets Frenzy apart from Hitchcock's earlier work is its visceral brutality. Whereas Norman Bates was an implied pervert, the Necktie Killer's warped behavior is graphically shown. The links between sexuality and violence hinted at in Psycho and Vertigo are unambiguous here. When a woman is raped and strangled in this film, it actually looks as though she has been raped and strangled.Another great element of Frenzy is the fact that it ends immediately with the climax, without wasting time on a denouement. Like Day of the Jackal and Black Sunday, it keeps the tension pumping until the brutal end.The only two things that prevent this from being one of Hitchcock's greats are the acting and the plot construction. Most of the actors, although passable, do not have the star qualities that the actors Hitchcock previously worked with did. There are no Cary Grants or Anthony Perkins to be found here, although Barry Foster is excellent in his role. Furthermore, Hitchcock makes it clear too quickly who is innocent and who is guilty. More ambiguity would have made the film much more suspenseful.Nevertheless, this is still a superior Hitchcock film, well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock goes cockney</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After decades of legendary Hollywood movie-making, Hitchcock returned to Britain having made a few less well-received efforts (such as Topaz and Torn Curtain) in the latter part of the 1960s. Being his penultimate film, expectations would not necessarily be high prior to viewing this, even for a Hitchcock fan. What the viewer gets is something truly different from anything else Hitchock has made.His early English films bring to mind refined English accents. Not so here. Virtually all the characters are proper working-class cockneys. Not only that, but the reduced censorship of the 1970s allows Hitchcock to make his most gruesome film. The old Hitchcock touches are still there (a wonderful up-the-stairs camera shot, for instance) but there is a little nudity and some disturbing sounds (not to give too much away).Most importantly, Hitchcock maintains his traditional suspense as well as ever, but this time in a grimmer context than before. The customary humour is still apparent, especially with regard to cooking (very relevant given Britain's poor reputation for cooking). In fact, Frenzy is such a triumph that it may well be in Hitchcock's top ten movies - and that is saying something.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock's penultimate work was both a critical and commercial success on its release, hailed by many as a return to form by the Master of Suspense following the comparative failure of TORN CURTAIN and TOPAZ in the 1960s. Be warned - this is not a film for the faint of heart, and you probably won't want to sit through this more than once, because in this case, once is definitely enough. FRENZY in many ways brings Hitchcock full circle, back to THE LODGER in 1926 - the setting is London and the tale concerns a man falsely accused of murder - but whose suspicious behavior makes him an excellent suspect. Unlike THE LODGER however, our protagonist, Richard Blaney (superbly played by Jon Finch) is one of Hitchcock's least sympathetic central characters. A veteran (of precisely which war is never stated) of the RAF, the down-on-his luck Blaney seems unable to reintegrate himself into civilian life (we might say today that Blaney is obviously suffering from PTSD) with any success. He is highly intelligent, but impatient, rude, aggressive, pride-filled and generally disliked by everyone around him except his current girlfriend, a barmaid called Babs (Anna Massey), and his ex-wife, Brenda (Barbara Leigh-Hunt), who still has a soft spot for him - which will lead to some very unfortunate consequences for them both. The only other friend Blaney has in the world is Bob Rusk (Barry Foster), a Covent Garden greengrocer. Rusk's apparent kindness to his friend, as we shall see, is in fact nothing of the sort...As the story opens, London is being terrorized by a serial killer nicknamed the "Necktie Murderer" for his particular choice of strangulation device. We are led to believe that Blaney is the killer, but this is quickly revealed to be a bit of Hitchcockian misdirection when Brenda Blaney is brutally raped and murdered before our very eyes - by the mild-mannered greengrocer! This particular scene is without doubt the most hideous, ugly scene in any Hitchcock film. Rather than "glamorize" the assault through a fetishized presentation of a beautiful actress in peril (see DIAL M FOR MURDER or PSYCHO), Brenda Blaney's death is presented under flat office lighting and we are forced to endure it in "real time." Afterwards, due to an unfortunate sequence of events, Blaney finds himself arrested and convicted as the "Necktie Murderer," while we of course know him to be innocent. Blaney knows that Rusk is the real murderer, and he breaks out of prison to catch and kill the man who framed him. He is prevented from doing so only by Inspector Oxford (Alec McCowen) of Scotland Yard, who, unbeknownst to Blaney, has been on Rusk's trail for some time. FRENZY disturbs because the "wrongly accused man," is a far from sympathetic character. Blaney is crude, violent and selfish, is certainly capable of murder, and indeed, we see him sink to Rusk's level by the end of the film. On the other hand, the actual killer, like PSYCHO's Norman Bates, seems like a calm, generous man who "loves flowers and fruit," and "has things to give," but is actually a volcano of rage and hate. These complex characterizations leave the viewer in an uneasy frame of mind, as we are forced out of our usual Hollywood good guys-bad guys conditioning to identify with characters who are morally ambiguous, to say the least! The film's treatment of women is also horrifying. The rape-murder of Brenda Blaney is indeed drawn out to a near-excruciating length. The camera dwells on the sight of Brenda's violation and strangling with an unbearable explicitness. Brenda wears a pale green sheath similar to Melanie's dress in THE BIRDS, and it seems that Hitchcock symbolically extinguished the figure of the chilly blonde who preoccupied him for so long. Also, FRENZY makes a constant connection between women, food, sex, filth and pollution that is as repugnant as it is thought-provoking. Look for the perfect comic relief provided by Inspector Oxford's ditzy wife, who serves her husband "gourmet French" meals which are totally inedible! FRENZY fascinates because it is so well-made, so elegantly directed, and so humorous. Our emotions are quite spectacularly manipulated by this film - you will find yourself cringing in revulsion one moment and laughing out loud the next, and this strange dichotomy makes for a - to say the least - unique viewing experience. Special kudos must go to Jean Marsh as Brenda Blaney's secretary - look out for a scene where her powers of recall stun the police, to which she replies, "In my work, I've learnt to keep a sharp eye on men." Hitchcock's eyes were never sharper &amp; at 70-plus, he gave us a film whose dark perspective will haunt your mind and make you wonder whether or not everything we like to tell ourselves about "humanity" is nothing but a bad joke. Watch FRENZY if you can - I dare you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very British Hitchcock film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock had a long and stellar career as director and is one of the most loved and popular directors ever. But they end of the sixties his films were not receiving the same critical and commercial success and his 1969 thriller Topaz was considered one of his weakest films. Hitchcock changed course for his follow-up, making a murder-thriller in London, his British film since Stage Fright in 1950.The city of London is suffering from the terror of a serial killer known as the neck-tie killer, a man who rapes women before strangling them with a neck-tie. Richard Blancy (Jon Finch) is a barman and a former RAF man who enjoys a drink and suffers a violence temper. When his ex-wife Brenda (Barbara Leigh-Hunt) the police suspect Richard is the killer; but the police is after the wrong man.Frenzy is a bold film for time with Hitchcock being more graphic with violence and nudity without the need to overuse the then new techniques and less strict limits. There is a tense, graphic rape scene in the first 30 minutes with Barry Foster giving a really creepy and terrifying performance. Hitchcock was able to much darker and more brutal film to much of his previous work, including a sequence where the killer tries to receive evidence from a body in the back of a truck which contents a lot of Hitchcock's trademark tension.Hitchcock does get you to feel the hustle and bustle of London with its crowded streets, roads, pubs and markets and much more focused on the worker and low middle classes compared to many of Hitchcock's films focusing on upper class and wealthier people. Frenzy felt very British and that London was a character and provided an atmosphere and it felt little a dirtier a place. The Covent Garden has changed a lot from the area it was to the affluence it has now.Frenzy does have an excellent cast with the likes of Finch and Foster giving instance performances. When I first saw Foster I originally thought it was Michael Caine and guess who was offered the role first? Finch was convincing as a man who is quick to anger and not exactly a sympathetic character; but he is still an innocent man and some of moments of anger are understandable. This film also features Clive Swift which is a pleasant site.There are some criticism to be had. The first is there are moments of comedy which are hit and miss. Sometimes the humour breaks the tension and works because of personality of the actors, but other bits like the Police Detective having to eat his wife's ghastly food which was old fashioned and out of place. The other problem is not so much how the film but more how it aged since we now know more about how the police function and how serial killers really act. There were times I was thinking that the police should be checking for fingerprints on the ties and should be wearing gloves.Frenzy is a fine entrance in Hitchcock's filmography as a murder film where the story revolves around whether the people with catch the right man then a whodunit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Master of Suspense's penultimate film, and the best of his post-Birds output</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frenzy may not be among my favourite Hitchcocks like Psycho, Vertigo, Rear Window, Rebecca, Notorious and North By Northwest, but unlike Jamaica Inn, Under Capricorn and Topaz it's nowhere near among his weakest either. In fact I do consider Frenzy the best of his films post-The Birds. Maybe the ending is a little rushed, but although it is not going to be everybody's cup of tea it is one truly impressive film. It is wonderfully shot, everything about the photography is highly atmospheric and succeeds in making the viewer purposefully unsettled. Hitchcock's direction is similarly wonderful, like with the restless camera, shots of fleeing footsteps and the sight of a body when you least expect there is a lot of his distinctive directorial flavour. Ron Goodwin's score doesn't intrude the atmosphere or story in any way, and there is a compellingly haunting edge that was a nicely surprising contrast to the jauntiness heard in for example the Margaret Rutherford Miss Marple film adaptations. The dialogue is intelligent but there is lots of black humour that manages to be hilarious without it detracting too much(the final line is a riot), and while the film is one of Hitchcock's grimmest with everyone and everything unattractive and genuinely terrifying rapes/murders it is still edge of your seat stuff as can be evident in the potato truck sequence. Jon Finch does what he can with the man-at-the-wrong-place-at-the-wrong-time sort of character he has, and the performance is good enough without being one of the all-time greats for a Hitchcock film. The supporting cast are better though, Barry Foster's calculating suavity is really chilling especially, and Alez McCowen, Anna Massey, Vivien Merchant, Bernard Cribbens and Billie Whitelaw are also very good indeed. To conclude, a really good film, not the Master of suspense's very best but of his late-period output it really stands out in a positive way. 9/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do I look like a sex murderer to you?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock once intended for his 1960 film, "Psycho", to open with an elaborate helicopter shot which "pulls in" to a distant apartment window. Those plans fell apart, but he does something similar with the intro to his 1972 film "Frenzy", though here we "pull in" to the welcoming, all-embracing arms of London Bridge. It's a comical gesture. London's changed since Hitchcock's last visit, the dirty waters of the River Thames swirling noxiously below him, dead bodies buffeted by its lazy tide. The point of the grandiose shot is clear: the closer you look, the dirtier reality becomes. The Thames is polluted. Maybe all of London is as well.Based on a novel by Arthur La Bern, "Frenzy" stars Jon Finch as Dick Blaney, a working class guy who's struggling to make ends meet. To make matters worse, he finds himself stuck in yet another one of Hitchcock's "wrong man" plots; a serial killer has been murdering women and Blaney becomes Scotland Yard's chief suspect. Cue much commotion.Aesthetically, it's one of Hitchcock's better pictures. Hitch's camera work is sublime, his set-pieces unconventionally exciting, his rendering of London's bustling marketplaces exhilarating and his shot selection, tracking shots, framing/editing all machine precise. The film looks and moves like the work of a master craftsman. And as is typical of Hitchcock, "Frenzy's" packed with dark humour: broken bread-sticks conjure up the plights of rigor mortis inflicted victims, neckties on murdered corpses morph into Blaney's own hangman's noose, and then there's the film's opening scene, in which government types explain to a gathered crowd that industrial discharge is the cause of a river's pollution. How wrong they are. Another murder victim immediately pops up in the river behind them, swiftly calling into question the competence of Britain's myopic lawmen. Like Chief Inspector Oxford (his very name suggestive of the British establishment), who blames Blaney for the murders, everyone's too ready to displace blame. They finger blue collar boozer Blaney whilst ignoring the real murderer, Uncle Bob, a wealthy businessman who gets his kicks killing women. "Blaney's guilt is uncomplicated by the existence of any other suspects," Oxford says. Clearly he twists evidence to fit his preconceptions.The existential absurdity of Hitchcock's "The Trouble With Harry" leaks into "Frenzy". Characters are conspired against by both sheer chance and human buffoonery. Elsewhere the indeterministic chaos of London's busy marketplaces becomes Hitch's metaphor for the amusingly random nature of Blaney's own predicament. Later, being labelled a killer is precisely that which pushes Blaney into seeking to become a vengeful killer. The film delights in its absurd, macabre twists.This "delight" has led to much criticism, particularly from other British directors (Leigh, Loach, Boorman) who contend that, more so than most Hitchcock films, "Frenzy" tastelessly uses murder and rape for kicks. It's all just a game, a ride, a joke, Hitch's characters poked and prodded for our amusement. This is true to a point. Hitchcock does whip us up into a delirious frenzy for sweet transgression. From Hitch, you can then draw a line directly to folk like Spielberg and the Coens, whose films resort to the same tactics but are increasingly thinner. Indeed, much of the Coens' filmography is a remake of both "The Trouble With Harry" and "Frenzy", comical follies which mock silly characters and wallow in a certain postmodern nihilism; nothing matters, chaos reins, look at these idiots. "Frenzy" is itself a more pessimistic take on Hitchcock's own "The Wrong Man", replacing the spirituality and faith of the earlier film with sheer, capricious chaos. The film has a deep abhorrence for human beings, whom Hitchcock continuously likens to rotten vegetables and discarded waste.But there is some soul in "Frenzy". It's significant that only two characters cry, one the victim of an actual rape, the other the bullied wife of Inspector Oxford. Though labelled misogynistic ? and it is at times - the film is also clumsily about misogyny. Mrs Oxford is her goofy husband's intellectual superior, and though he constantly belittles her, it's clear to us that justice is in the wrong hands. The tears thus link different types of victimhood, murder/rape akin to the wife's own misery. Elsewhere male characters are given tasteless rape jokes ("Rape has a silver lining", "Some women ask for it", "time for a decent string of sex murders!" etc), all designed to highlight a deeply sexist culture, but also a result of Hitchcock's own dark immaturity. Whilst some feminist critics (Tania Modileski) defend these light hearted rape/sexist jokes ? these jokes are meant to be undermined by the rape we later, finally see, they argue - most take offence. Regardless of where you stand, the best of these insulting remarks is given to Oxford himself. When his wife says "It stands to reason...", he immediately interjects: "You mean intuition, don't you?" Ironic coming from a man who routinely rejects reason in favour for class-based stereotyping.Unlike Henry Fonda's saintly, wrongfully accused character in "The Wrong Man", Blaney is slimy, unsympathetic and nasty. This enriches the film. The "niceness" of the wrongfully persecuted is and should be irrelevant. Meanwile the film's villain is impotent and requires escalating feats of violence to "get high", a trait which Hitch's desensitised audience itself seeks. Unsurprisingly, one character's abhorrence of meat (his soup=Thames?) is ironically juxtaposed to we the audience's baser drives for blood. Hitchcock can't fight these contradictions; blood-lust's his bread and butter.Still, ignoring their somewhat salacious qualities, the film's murders do have some weight. One famous shot backs away from a murder scene, down a flight of steps, out a building and into the streets of London. Hitchcock's camera is timid, petrified, bathed in a hushed silence, an almost religious revere which is swiftly interrupted by the commotion of a surrounding marketplace; the arena of life turns a blind eye to the girl's murder. Later the film ends with a joke: "you're not wearing your tie?"8/10 - Worth two viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcocks Limp Farewell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By the year of 1972, Alfred Hitchcock had become "past his used by date" He was 72 years old, and his style had become somewhat irrelevant. Frenzy is not a bad movie...its just that other Directors had come up with new ideas. George Roy Hill, Francis Ford Coppola and Sam Peckinpah (to name only three) had taken the motion picture to new heights. Hitchcocks Frenzy does have those "Hitchcock moments", but it was clear after making this average piece of work...the game was over for Alfred. He left a body of work that is extremely impressive...and is part of the fabric of the Hollywood Story. (Also the history of the motion picture.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mr Rusk - You're Not Wearing Your Tie ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A murderer who rapes and then strangles women with neckties is at large in London. Dick Blaney is a former RAF officer down on his luck whose ex-wife is the latest victim. Can he prove his innocence and unmask the real killer ?Frenzy is the great Alfred Hitchcock's last hurrah. Although he made one more film (the enjoyable but light-hearted Family Plot), this is a great nail-biting thriller of the kind he did so well, with crafty twists galore, stunning sequences, mischievous black humour and incredible suspense throughout. It's also in many ways a return to his roots; although he became a naturalised American and made all his most famous movies there, he never lost the Britishness of his manner, sense of comedy and cinematic style. Frenzy is really his only out-and-out all-British film since the thirties, and the Covent Garden setting is literally where he grew up (his father was a grocer there, just like Rusk). His amusing cameo near the start in a city gent bowler hat is a lovely touch which epitomises this, almost as if he had come full circle from his great early films like The Lodger. It's also chock-full of his favourite themes; the crazed killer, the wrong man, the police fumbling circumstantial evidence, the contrast of humour and horror. And perhaps it's his most controversial film for the Dial M For Misogyny detractors who (wrongly) feel he hated women. But this is to misunderstand it - the scene where Rusk rapes and kills Brenda is astonishingly powerful and disturbing; it takes ten minutes, as she gradually realises what's going to happen and uses all of her intelligence to try to avoid it, unaware of the final horror of who Rusk really is. The subsequent death of Babs is perhaps even worse as we know what he is capable of and the camera discreetly retreats down the stairs and out into the busy street leaving the depravity to our imaginations. Almost every scene is filled with visual invention - the lengthy sequence on the back of the potato truck is both horrifying and hilarious in its squalor, the dinner table scenes between Chief Inspector Oxford and his wife as he deftly tries to avoid eating anything she's cooked are among the funniest Hitch ever shot, and there are oodles of clever touches, like the moment all the sound disappears just as Rusk appears behind Babs, or the scene where we can't hear what the judge at Blaney's trial is saying because the door is closed. Despite his age, Hitchcock is in full flow, employing all of his cinematic skill to extract the maximum impact from the material. It's stunningly well directed. The cast of character actors are all excellent, a real underground movie fan's dream - Finch (Roman Polanski's Macbeth) is bitter and dogmatic, Massey (Peeping Tom) and Leigh-Hunt are both terrific, McCowen is a thoughtful no-nonsense peeler with Bates (A Clockwork Orange) an amusing foil of a sergeant, and Cribbins has a great bit as a tight-fisted unctuous publican. Best of all is the hawk-like, redheaded Foster as the thoroughly loathsome Bob Rusk, the last and most vicious descendant of Norman Bates, Bruno Antony, Brandon Shaw and Uncle Charlie. Like all Hitch's villains, Bob is affable and disarming, with witty quips ("Home is the place where when you have to go there they have to take you in."), but is really a monster in human guise. Expertly shot almost entirely on location - very unusual for Hitch, who much preferred the comforts of a studio - by Gilbert Taylor (Dr Strangelove, Star Wars) with fantastic photography in and around central London, and featuring a great score by Ron Goodwin with an irresistibly bombastic opening theme accompanying a famous helicopter shot over the Thames. Brilliantly written by Anthony Shaffer (Sleuth, The Wicker Man), based on the book Goodbye Piccadilly Farewell Leicester Square by Arthur La Bern (the title of which comes from the old Cockney music hall song It's A Long Way To Tipperary). I think most people agree Hitchcock's body of work is probably the most impressive of any filmmaker, and for me this is the final masterpiece in his broad gallery of incredible movies. It might be disturbing and unwholesome, but it keeps us riveted from start to finish and that's what he did better than anybody else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hitchcock is one of the most visual directors ever. His imagination was absolutely rooted on visual development. Like him, as attached to the visual understanding and interpretation of the world, we only have a few handful of other directors. By visual i mean that he envisions worlds where the visual, the framing, the mood, everything depends on what we see, and how we see it. That's the basis. The story, plot, etc only comes later, in the exact measure that is needed to fit the visual concept.So, when watching any Hitchcock film, it is important and indeed fascinating to reflect and guess what was he thinking exactly. Better put, Why did he want to make each film? Here in Frenzy, i can think of a few reasons:-maybe the most important one to Hitch: the sense of (real) location. This is his first film where the majority of the scenes were shot in real locations, all in London, mainly around Covent Garden. This the film where he went back to London. He wanted to soak the film with London, so we relatively few plot points that take place on inner locations, quite the opposite of the usual Hitchcock, to whom exteriors were fake cardboards which worked merely as establishing shots. Here we have for the first (and only?) time in Hitch's career a real city pulsing. Indeed it was a relatively new concept, that of capturing real cities, real people, and put them into fiction. I do think Hitch made a competent work and above all, an honest one. He chooses the Garden, related to his childhood, before it became what it is today. We have a genuine feel to it. Apart from the multiple shots in the market, i enjoyed the initial scene, it feels like going back home. The aerial absolutely establishing helicopter shot, where we start distant and go down to the city, until a closeup of a crowd, where Hitch makes his usual cameo. This one sounds tender, it is a homage to London, i'm sure hitch thought about that. The music here helps. Generally it is competent, but i missed Herrmann;-the two more celebrated sequences are as well the more visually pure Hitchcock conceived for this film. The "goodbye Babs" shot is brilliant, a pure piece of the visual cinema hitch makes. He knew he wanted to have a camera going down the stairs and backwards, after having gone up. He knew that would tell us more than any explicit scene he could make. So that's brilliant, how the sequence starts with the closeup of Babs eyes, the door of the killer's house, we know we see Babs alive for the last time, we come down, we get to the street (through the "rope editing device"), and we feel devastated. And it's all visual. See? The potato truck sequence is less effective and pure to me, but still a sweet humorous exercise of the Mcguffin, black humor, and that beautiful suspense, that will not allow you to think beyond vision.This film is, however, less focused than others. The visual imagination no longer falls upon the whole film, only intermittent bits. It's nice Hitch opened the possibilities of exploration of a city, of a mood through real locations, these last films of his are sweet, but no longer perfectly conceived like his most deep experiences.My opinion: 4/5http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hitchcock returned to Britain after almost twenty years and made this, one of his last films. Using the grim, yet bustling background of London we watch the story of a serial killer who uses his neck tie to strangle his victims after raping them. For the first part of the film we assume that the killer is Richard Blaney, a man with a suspicious looking tie who has just been fired from his job at a pub. An war veteran of some note, he has failed to make an impact on the post-war world, and is known for his fiery temper. His ex-boss seems like a prejudiced fool, Blaney is sleeping with co-worker Babs, is friends with successful comrade Robert Rusk, and decides to meet his ex-wife to get the money she owes him. They divorced a while back, and during a heated discussion her secretary Monica hears a loud bang before going to lunch. Blaney leaves with the money, but annoyed about his bad day. We then see Rusk going to see Brenda, Blaney's ex-wife in her office. She runs a lonely hearts bureau, setting people up, and Rusk is a frequent customer. However, he wants women who have strange habits. When Brenda refuses him, Rusk rapes and kills her and we see that he is the neck tie killer. The police believe it is Blaney, the secretary says she saw him go in to the office and believed the bang she heard was him hitting her. As the evidence piles up, Robert goes on the run with Babs who believes he is innocent, and they try to find a way to prove his innocence. There seems to be no way out though.This is another intricate film by Hitchcock, skilfully built up then taken apart just when we thought there was going to be no justice. This is notable as it was Hitchcock's first '18' rated film, and features some full frontal nudity, swearing and graphic violence. There is still a heavy amount of tension though, and the scenes of murder are shocking. There are good performances from all here, including those in smaller roles- Jean Marsh as the secretary, and Clive Swift of Keeping Up Appearances fame. There is much humour also, the scenes between Inspector Oxford and his wife are the obvious funny parts, but there is also the more subtle, darker humour- the death grip, the body falling off the van, the ending. Another thoroughly watchable, clever, and interesting film from the Master.7.5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just your typical stalker/murderer movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a huge fan of Hitchcock (aside from really enjoying Psycho). I do agree however with his being regarded as a "master of suspense", but this movie does not really live up to that designation. Part of this could be from the perspective of today, in which the stalker premise has been overdone. In the end, there were only two scenes that really stood out to me.I like how the movie begins. It immediately establishes that there is a murderer on the loose, and has a great scene in which the behavior of such a person is being discussed at a bar. Standing next to these gossipers is supposedly the murderer himself, since everything that the two people are discussing seem to describe this person that the audience has observed in previous scenes.In this way the movie creates a decoy to the real murderer. The deception for the audience could have been used to create a bit of mystery, but the real murderer is revealed early on. The audience could have been suspicious right with the people who accuse this guy later. Instead the only question is when will the real murderer slip up.The second scene that stood out was one showing the helplessness of the victims. Instead of showing a murder, the camera backs out of a house into the bustling street, where the scream could not possibly be heard. This proves much more effective than the one that shows a murder in all of its gruesome detail, but perhaps the effect would not have been the same without seeing one earlier.Too bad the movie does not have more moments like these, otherwise it could have distinguished itself from many such films that followed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Hitchcock Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Hitchcock movie was great! I first started watching Alfred Hitchcock movies in college. I took Early Film and Modern Film. Modern Film was devoted to Alfred Hitchcock movies. But, we did not see Frenzy in class. I went to the local library and rented Frenzy myself. I went on imbd.com for a quick summary and to see what others thought about it, then watched it myself. The setting is in England, and there is a killer on the loose. The killer is raping and strangling women with a necktie. The prime suspect is Richard Blaney who just quit his job. A few women close to him are found killed. The police go after Dick, and he has to hide out for a while. The acting is superb, and Alfred Hitch keeps you guessing during the movie. One of the best scenes is when a woman is dead and in the back of a truck filled with potatoes. The ending of the movie is great as well. The last line certainly stands out. I think that everyone who is a fan of Hitch or a fan of suspense and crime should def. watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I'm not terribly impressed with this movie, though it wasn't bad. The basic Hitchcock elements are there and the actors are quite good, making it a fun enough experience if you don't want to think too hard about your movie. Warning: spoilers ahead.I managed to feel sympathy for our hero, who seems to be plagued with one of the most dire cases of bad luck ever to be visited on mankind. He does tell his wife at the beginning how dratted unlucky his life has been, and at first it just sounds like whining, but by the end I truly believed him. Events just pile up at an alarming rate as evidence against him, and this is made the more unbelievable by the fact that the man setting him up does an awfully sloppy job of doing it. So much seems to be sheer coincidence that I actually wonder if Rusk was trying to set up Blaney in the first place. Yeah, he murders Blaney's ex the day after Blaney has been to see her (and about ten minutes before Blaney arrives at the office, so he can be seen leaving it right before the dead body is found) but Rusk doesn't know that good ol' Dicko has been there at all, or that he'll come back to the office so he can be implicated. If it wasn't for Blaney's visit, there really wouldn't be any link at all since he hadn't seen her in over a year. I suppose Rusk could assume that he'd been to see her, but as I said, he doesn't know and doesn't take any effort to find out.Luckily for Blaney, random coincidence ends up working in his favor by the end, since the investigating officer on the case magically decides that Rusk is the murderer, apparently changing his mind because of the rock-solid evidence that 1) Blaney named Rusk and 2) the officer's wife said that it didn't make much sense for a man to kill a woman he'd been married to for ten years. Even though Rusk and Blaney are intelligent men, they suffer from a fatal lack of common sense -- Rusk has evidently set up Blaney to take the fall, but continues to murder after Blaney's been sent to jail (since he's a serial killer with a signature way of killing, we'd think that the continuation of murders after the murderer has been locked up would prove that the actual murderer was still out there) and it never occurs to Blaney, even after someone has killed his ex-wife and his girlfriend in the course of two days, that it seems like someone is trying to set him up. Blaney manages to break out of prison by falling down twelve stairs and getting a nasty looking cut (it's probably, i don't know, deeper than a paper cut, at least!) on his head even though he didn't hit his head on the way down, and is rushed to the minimum-security hospital which is inhabited by very stupid guards and very helpful inmates who are about as injured or ill as Blaney (not at all). And then to make the audience feel really stupid, the investigating officer tells his partner just exactly why Blaney threw himself down the stairs, as if we couldn't figure it out that he did it to escape, since 1) we knew he wanted revenge and 2) he wound up escaping.Some of the movie is quite good, though; there are several scenes that work, even though the movie as a whole doesn't. In fact, most of the scenes alone are just fine, but when you string them together, you get some sad, gaping holes. It's pretty funny in some parts ("I can't be the necktie strangler. For a start, I only own two" and "Not in the cupid room!") and tries to be in others. The potato sack scene would have been funnier if I didn't keep thinking about exactly who that was in the sack. Poor Babs isn't mourned for after she dies (except for a "poor kid") and then is used as a morbid joke. It would have worked much better if the body in the sack had been an anonymous woman, I think. It might just be me, I know a lot of people thought this was pretty funny. I don't really think that a serial killer is a very light topic, and this film took it rather lightly, displaying some ridiculously unsound psychology about the nature of serial killers (by this, I mean a conversation two men have in a pub at the beginning...it hurts to listen to it) and completely forgetting or not caring about the women that he's killed. The two that relate directly to Blaney are the only ones really mentioned; when Blaney is arrested, he is accused of the murders of Barbara, Brenda, "and others." I'd like to know more about the others, and how exactly Blaney can be blamed for them, it's quite possible that he would have an alibi for some. But the murders end up being the Macguffin, which in my opinion, just doesn't work. If the murders and Blaney's apparent involvement in them isn't the point of the movie, then what is?In spite of it all, it was a decent movie. Just don't *think* too hard about it once it's done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Hitchcock's finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a string of sub-par films, and immediately preceding his final and endlessly flawed comic mystery, "Family Plot," Hitchcock returned briefly to full form with "Frenzy." This film is the shining jewel of Hitchcock's latter years, rating in my estimation among his top five cinematic achievements...alongside "Rope," "Rear Window," "North By Northwest," and "Psycho.""Frenzy" is perhaps Hitchcock's fullest exploration into the theme which has fueled his best work, dating all the way back to the 1926 silent, "The Lodger." Hitchcock's "wrong man" theme was used very successfully in such films as "North By Northwest," "I Confess," and, aptly enough, "The Wrong Man." But nowhere is it as fully illustrated as in "Frenzy."In addition to being Hitch's ultimate exploration into this familiar subject, "Frenzy" is also Hitchcock's most chilling film, with numbing scenes of suspense and his most appalling, frightening screen villain since Norman Bates.All in all, and especially considering the overall lacking quality of Hitchcock's later films, "Frenzy" is a brilliant achievement, and truly amongst his finest work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great Hitchcock piece about an illusive murderer which stalks London's women with his old school necktie. Hitchcock directs in his second to last film, Frenzy is great, but I did prefer Family Plot. Frenzy is no Psycho, but it is a higher than standard murder film. Some of the elements in the movie are much more "adult" than is usual for Hitch's films, but it doesn't spoil the picture. Great performances from Jon Finch, Alec McCowen, Barry Foster and Bernard Cribbins (who now stars in Coronation Street). Well worth a watch for any Hitchcock/Crime buff!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was my first Hitchcock. I figured I'd watch it to take a taste of what he does, and I immediately loved it. I like the British setting and the characterizations of this film, plus the other usual elements he's good for: the sometimes sharp and witful dialogue, the slight touch of comedy, the innovative use of the camera- not just with angles and visuals but with the camera itself, and the timing. I love the way he sneaks himself into his films too. This is my personal favorite of the Hitchcock trademark movies of 'the wrong guy'. The plot is simple but the scenes are made so you still want to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tongue-in-cheek murder comedy from a retiring master</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>- No spoilers contained -It was great to see Hitchcock return back to England to film, this movie could not but reflect his love for his work and his country.The first and foremost actor in the movie is London. Covent Garden, far from being the tourist magnet that is today, is jostling with 70s exuberance and people going on about their business, buying and selling. If not for anything else, then for the exceptional London shots this film is very pleasurable viewing.Hitchcock designed Frenzy to be a swing between black comedy and suspense story, not unlike previous films. The end result can appear from chilling to lukewarm, depending on the viewer's disposition at the time. The masterful opening shot with the actor tying his necktie introduces the basic theme and the starring pair. Dick and Bob, in true doppelgänger fashion represent the duality inherent in every man, they are sides of the same coin. Who is real and who is not? Who is the killer and who the innocent? Even at the end we're not sure, it might have just been just a matter of circumstances.See this movie, watch the exquisite cinematography right from the credit sequence and up to the last frame. And trust that what really matters is not the plot in itself, but what surrounds it, characters and places, situations and colours.A masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frenzy is a choice title for a true thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>************ Note : Included are specific references to plot and detailed analysis of film. I would call this an informative review. 1st submission~ ************Fren-zy n.-A state of violent mental agitation or wild excitement.-Temporary madness or delirium. -A mania; a craze.Frenzy is a choice title for a true thriller. What's come to be expected of the uncontested, `Master of Suspense', rings true once more. Hitchcock returns to a familiar plot of an innocent man being wrongfully accused, (North by Northwest, The 39 Steps) interwoven with the macabre and perversity audiences crave. Hitchcock marks a second return to England to direct this modern Hitchcockian masterpiece. The storyline is true suspense as the identity of the villain is established early in the film. The viewer will focus on Richard Blaney, a man who is presumed guilty, and his ability to circumvent undeserved punishment. They will also follow the movements of a demented killer. Alfred Hitchock presents, "a world made up of coincidences so systematically organized that they crosscut each other vertically and horizontally. Frenzy is the image of a crossword puzzle on the leitmotif of murder." (Truffaut, p. 333) Hitchcock's precision in the casting department is also evident throughout the film. His intricate web of movie design is comprised of many elements. One major factor is the appearance of the cast. Alfred intuitively understood that his cast must not be Hollywood-type stars. If they were they would lose credibility because the audience had known them before as someone else. Hitchcock casts a plain and strikingly realistic crew to become Frenzy. With increasing liberties and depictions of violence in filmmaking of this time period, Hitchcock's dark genius becomes capable of being more revealed. Some may disagree that this is a positive quality, arguing that the essence of a Hitchcock film is the unseen. Certain scenes included in Frenzy would never have passed the censorship restrictions early in Hitchcock's career. I believe those restrictions actually formed the quintessential element of Hitchcock's fame. The seen and especially the unseen have always proved major components of a Hitchcockian work. The idea that the audience has to fill in the blanks which, were intentionally left by the director, highlights the true genius of his directing. However, Frenzy offers the audiences an original and innovative approach at the previously omitted cinematic depictions of fear and perversity. The film initiates focusing on a dead body in the Thames River. Simultaneously, a government official promises his supporters pollution issues have been solved. The body is the work of a serial killer, coined the `Necktie Killer' by fearing citizens because of his choice of murder weapon. Hitchcock adds to the complexity and body of the plot by including a hardly amiable character, Richard Blaney (Jon Finch), who has been wrongfully accused of these crimes as the main character. A good move because it leaves the viewer in a gray area about good and evil portrayals. In other words, Hitchcock procures less sympathy from a less charismatic character and the audience doesn't support the hero as much as they would had it been played by Cary Grant. The suspense builds as anticipated especially in a tension filled disturbing depiction of desperation. Hitchcock films a scene in the rear of a potato truck where the `Necktie Killer' is attempting to wrench incriminating evidence from the hand of one of his stiffened victims. A provincial setting and film style being in the confinement of the truck complement the uneasiness of the viewer. The climax of suspense comes in at the vivid scene of the desperate killer snapping off the corpse fingers to free the evidence from its dead hands. People may initially be horrified by the candid display of violence in Frenzy, especially the one murder scene, which plays on themes of rape and murder, by strangulation. Hitchcock captures the lurid violence; focusing camera and audience attention to the dreadful and explicit acts being committed. Frenzy possesses an extremely explicit and striking rape scene, which might be considered offensive by some viewers. However, it is a twisted world that Alfred is attempting to allude to and despite the uncomfortable nature of the scene, it fits. Also a prolonged, demented peer at a naked corpse adds an eerie element. Opinions may exist that Hitchcock's Frenzy lacks more because it includes more cinematic description. That which used to be left to imagination is depicted. It serves as a developmental point toward the end of this lauded director's career. It shows that Hitchcock would not be suffocated by a modern and open-minded movie industry. This critic believes the cinematography augmentations better serve Hitchcock's audiences in seeing a strikingly more explicit and authentic depiction of Hitchcock's portrayal of Frenzy. Although in the twilight of his directorial career, Hitchcock reemerges to prove his capabilities once more, in a progressively revamped and liberal world of film and suspense. Combined with a return to his directorial roots in England, more than fifty full-length movies and at seventy-two years of age; to see these interpretations from his own diabolic mind is an absolute pleasure.THX ~~EDFED~~</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great British Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the day that I watched this film, I was in the perfect frame of mind to understand Richard Blaney. Blaney has been fired from his job as a bartender after his boss accuses him of stealing drinks. I had just been fired by my boss over something small which made me pretty angry. This film actually cheered me up as it made my day look like a holiday compared to Blaney's. Soon, Blaney's ex-wife falls victim to the necktie murderer and Blaney finds himself the prime suspect.SOME MINOR SPOILERS AHEADThis film is easily Hitchcock's most violent and disturbing film. It's also one of his best. Hitchcock gets a good feel for the London locations with its pubs and fruit stands and the strong British accents. There are some stunning shots (the opening shot of London, the scene where the camera pulls back silently out of an apartment building, the scene where the camera points just outside a courtroom), exciting moments, and hilarious scenes (the police inspector having to put up with his wife's hideous gourmet meals).Most intriguing is the way both the killer and the innocent hero are portrayed. Compare them when they're shown standing side-by-side. Blaney is a disheveled looking hot tempered man with a fading jacket, messy oily dark hair, and a scowl on his face. He drinks too much and has a history of violent outbursts. Blaney is perhaps Hitchcock's least likable hero. In contrast the killer is a well dressed, well groomed, fair-haired man. He is charming towards customers, tries to help Blaney when he can, and likes to eat fruit. You would think you could guess which one the killer would be, but you would be wrong. As it turns out, the killer likes more than just fruit...Like in Strangers on a Train, the innocent and killer are connected in some way. The killer ends up acting out the innocent's aggressions. It is perhaps not an accident that Blaney is friends with the killer even though he doesn't know who he is. But while in Strangers on a Train the innocent ultimately proves to be incapable of murder, the innocent in this film proves to us that he is indeed capable.This film is certainly not for the faint of heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WOW....this film returned Hitchcock to his prior glory after losers like "Torn Curtain" and "Topaz". It also returned him to England, where he hadn't filmed for many years. The story is full of ugliness and violent murder and terrific characters. It's odd to note that his main character, played by Jon Finch, is unpleasant, unattractive and unlikeable. You are quickly convinced that he is certainly capable of the murders in this film whether he is actually guilty or not (and we won't spoil that for you.) Barry Foster is top notch as the grocer with the diamond stick pin who tries to help Finch when he can and Anna Massey (daughter of Raymond Massey), although not a pretty woman, is appealing as the girlfriend. Alec McGowan does a nice job as the police inspector but Vivian Merchant as his wife is a bit much. The famous tracking shot down the steps of the apartment building is reminiscent of the long takes that Hitchcock used in "Rope" but to better advantage here. The scene in the back of the truck, involving the clenched fist, will make you squirm a little. The atmosphere of "Frenzy" is dark and the characters seem caught up in a sense of hopelessness. It's not a pretty picture but it will keep you enthralled as Hitchcock weaves his magic for the next to the last time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yet another suspenseful, darkly humorous Hitchcock film, well worth a look and NOT a misogynistic film as suggested by those that seem to believe every scandal spreading biography that they read. Yes, women haters appear in Hitchcock films but there have been equally unpleasant characters in films by Spielberg, Kubrick, Wilder, Ford etc - it doesn't mean the director is like them.I do concede that there is a horrible murder scene in Frenzy but it is only shocking for its time and is no worse than the many violent scenes we are exposed to on T.V and films nowadays. The average cinema goer will probably be accustomed to such unpleasantness but if you are disturbed by violence in films do not watch Frenzy.Strangely the acting in this film is both the best and the worst thing about it. It is mostly below average, except for Jon Finch who is worse than useless. But watch the film for the charming Barry Foster, who gives a most exceptional performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Hitchcock's Greatest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I agree with Mumtaz A. Shamsee, that the bashers of this film are way off base. I rank "Frenzy" with "Foreign Correspondent" and "Dial M for Murder" as among Hitchcock's best. Frenzy is one of the few Hitchcock films that scared me without resorting to lurid or grizzly gimmicks as in "Psycho" and the unaccountably well-received "The Birds".The juxtaposition of the murderous with the mundane and the horrid with the comic has never been more sharply presented as in "Frenzy". Please read Shamsee's excellent review for the details.One issue I must take with Mumtaz is his finding fault with Hitchcock's treatment of the villain, whose use of a necktie as his instrument continued after a suspect was apprehended. He continued, not because he was too stupid to change his modus operandi but because he was a compulsive serial killer for whom the tie was integral to the compulsion. Moreover, many real-word cases suggest that serial killers want to be caught and "accidently on purpose" expose their identity. I'm not sure if Hitchcock was aware of this, but it certainly makes the behavior to which Mumtaz objects more plausible.Another issue I take with Mumtaz is his claim that "Frenzy" is a new direction for Hitchcock. I believe, that "Frenzy" is a return to an earlier, purer, less sensationalistic Hitchcock, who mixes the humorous with the horrid, as he did in "Foreign Correspondent" and the mundane with the murderous, as in "The Thirty-Nine Steps".I wish people would stop confusing horror or shock with suspense. Although "Frenzy" is not as highly rated as the "The Birds" or "Psycho" (which gets an 8.6 ???), it is superior to them both.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a film, sandwiched between two of Hitchcocks worst films came this dark often funny Masterpiece. This is the only film Hitchcock made after Psycho that is worthy of his name. Its as good as any Hitchcock film probably my 5th favourite Hitch film. It's a shame that Hitch went on to make the turkey Family Plot because this would have been a great film to end his career with. The Humour in this film is great, with the scene where the killer has to retrieve his tiepin in the potato trunk being the film Highlight, its quiet shocking, sick and funny. The only complaint I have about this film is that the scenes with the detective's wife doing her strange cooking goes on to long and slows the film down too much. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Master's most unique and brilliant film - CONTAINS SPOILER AT THE END</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am grateful that I ignored the totally baseless attacks on this brilliant film by some posters on IMDB. The fact of the matter is that this film is the living proof of Alfred Hitchcock's greatness and creativity. The man knew NO boundaries and his courage is legendary.This film was made at the stage of his career when he had a string of flops and when the critics were getting ready to write the eulogy for his career. He was an old man with health concerns and lately he had faced failures like he had never faced before. What does he do? Venture into a COMPLETELY NEW TERRITORY, that he has never ventured into before, and come out with flying colors. He comes up with not only a box-office hit but a critically acclaimed movie, proving once again, why he is in a class by himself.I can understand why some people would give such bad reviews, because they are used to Master's usual story line. The characters in typical Hitchcock Movie belong to middle to elite segment of the society. There are beautiful locations, romances, high drama, suspense, and even high flying action at times. However, in this feature, the characters belong to the working class, the location is a fruit market, the romance is absent, the characters are completely unsympathetic, and the whole feeling of the movie is more realistic, than any other of Master's creations. Audience is NOT expected to care about the characters, or to relate with them or even care what happens to them. However, audience is kept at the edge of their seat in caring about how the facts of the case are resolved. Another aspect that truly shows Master's genius in its full glory is the comments and reviews on IMDB that bemoan the fact that too many scenes were gruesome and scary and the Master relied on shock value. Nothing could be further from the truth. Because of the reviews I kept waiting for violent scenes, and I kept waiting and waiting and they never showed up. The fact of the matter is that by mere suggestion, and by relying on FACIAL EXPRESSIONS alone the master was able to convey the horror and the gruesome nature of the crime, without even showing a single drop of blood. The actual moment when death or rape occurs, is NOT EVEN SHOWN. This is why Hitchcock is the greatest because when Ridley Scott serves Human-Brain Sushi, people find it disgusting and amusing and no outrage for that disgusting gruesome display is heard. However, even though people see a man being served his own brain, not a single soul is terrified. Yet, when the Master only shows facial expression of the victim and the killer for only FEW SECONDS, and NOTHING ELSE, every body complains how gruesome the scene was. That my friends is DIRECTING, and proof of Hitchcock's genius. Another major complain that people have is about the Master's use of sense of humor in this movie. They say that this shows he is insensitive to human tragedy. What a joke! Even though there are humorous moments throughout the movie, at no point did I stop feeling sorry for the horror and tragedy faced by the victims. As a matter of fact, the sincerity and realism that Hitchcock uses is what makes you care about the resolution of facts in the movie. You may not relate with the characters or care about their fate, but the anger you feel towards the killer makes you want to care about how he gets what is coming to him. Also, the character that makes the most offensive and yet the funniest jokes is the Killer himself. What was Master supposed to do? Show that when the killer is not committing murders, he is feeling bad and attending Church? How does a killer who doesn't care about the victims, reflect badly on Hitchcock? Only few days ago me and my office mates were discussing Jaffery Dahmer murders with respect to 'Hannibal' and the fact came up that one of the victims got away but idiot police made him go back because the victim was some Asian man and didn't speak English very well and couldn't explain his tragedy. It drew some laughs, so I guess we must be all evil people. Similarly, some idiots are shown in the movie discussing murders as if they were some source of humor and it only shows Master's genius in understanding how people who are not affected by the tragedy, relate with the situation.This is one of the most amazing movies and it is a timeless classic, and should indeed by counted as one of Hitchcock's best. It is so good that one has to ignore the blunder at the very end. ****SPOILER ALERT******I can not believe how the Master made that mistake, but he did. The killer sets up the innocent man for his crime and that man is convicted. Just like all serial killers, he has a habit of leaving particular clues that are consistent with the ammo he uses, and thus point finger towards one killer. In this case he kills them by strangling them with his tie. Yet after he sets up the innocent man, I would expect him to be smart enough to change his murder style, so that police do not conclude that their 'Necktie Strangler' is still loose and they may have convicted an innocent man, who has been screaming all along that he is innocent, and not only that, he has been actually yelling out the name of the man he thinks is the killer. Yet in the final scene, Master shows the Necktie wrapped around the victim's neck. Maybe he wanted to show the killer was stupid, but I think he simply blundered.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of Hitchcock's films which you either love or you hate. Some people have called it misogynistic, sleazy, exploitational trash. Others have called it a cynical, darkly comic study of a serial killer. Calling it a portrait of a serial killer is going too far, because it does not offer much depth into the mind of the 'Necktie Murderer'. It is much more concerned with style and irony. The film, which fits right in with all of Hitchcock's "wrong man" style of films, is a dark, deadpan comedy, filled with the type of macabre humor that has punctuated all of Hitchcock's films. Here, it takes center stage, and what makes it such a different Hitchcock film (for the territory it covers has been done better in earlier Hitchcock) is that it was made in the '70s, when things which might have been taboo years earlier where now fair game. It is a bleak, pessimistic, dark comedy, which shows little faith in "the system." It believes more in the power of food than in the power of justice. It is his most modern film, though not to say his best, and still plays extremely well, full of cruel irony, sly wit, and black comedy. A disturbing, but completely entertaining, experience. Quintessential Hitchcock.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterwork. Hitch's answer to his numerous imitators.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this film appeared in 1972, the term "Hitchcock" had become a sales tool loosely employed to advertise all sorts of grisly and shocking films. "Out Hitchcock's Hitchcock" appeared in the movie pages of the papers regularly every 6 months of so.Hitchcock was also being widely studied as a great film artist at this time. The extensive interview-book, "Truffaut-Hitchcock" had laid bare most of Hitch's thoughts and patented interview-pronouncements on the art of suspense filmmaking.Along comes Hitchcock and deliberately breaks almost every one of his major rules, and still manages to make a film three times as suspenseful as anything his imitators did. There is violence in the film, but almost no blood. None of the murder victims are ever bloodied. I believe the only red stuff seen is on the hero, when he falls down a staircase. Contrast this with the bloodbaths then beginning to flood the screen (almost literally.)The film is a black comedy of the highest order. In it, Hitchcock carries his much-noted doctrine of implicating the audience in the guilt to its greatest height. First, he commits one murder before your eyes in great detail, then takes you out into the street while the body is being discovered and you breathlessly, gleefully await the scream. And it does, finally arrive. Then, he allows you to follow the murderer and his next victim up a staircase, and while they disappear from view into a room, you back out of the building (in a great "how-did-they-shoot-this shot that's still debated among film students) waiting for the scream, and committing the murder in your own head. Hitch's mission is complete: you've done the crime for him.Despite some extensive comic relief scenes involving the Police Inspector and his wife, the film is terrifically suspenseful and horribly funny at the same time.Only a master could break all the rules and still come out on top.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frenzy is an astute, witty and hugely enjoyable piece of audience manipulation by a film maker who is clearly having the time of his life. Many of the themes of earlier Hitchcock - the wrong man, the double life, marriage, graveyard humour - are restored with an edge of malice and unpleasantness that is new to his films. There is nothing charming or touching about this film - even the scenes between the detective and his wife are all about the aridity of marriage. Yet, in construction and realisation, it is one of Hitch's best films.There are three genuinely great sequences, each showing a different side to the director. Firstly, the much discussed rape sequence, culminating in murder. This scene is incredibly difficult to watch, as it should be and there is nothing even vaguely eroticised about it. The image that remains with me is the close up of Brenda Blaney saying the Lord's prayer to an uncaring, unlistening God. Secondly, the deeply moving backwards tracking shot down the staircase, as the camera recoils in horror at the events taking place in the room. We don't need to see what the murderer is doing - Hitch's camera is eloquent enough. Finally, the jet black humour of the corpse disposal in the potato truck. This is Hitch at his best, completely blowing away the coyness of "Trouble With Harry" in an explosion of bad taste.Frenzy was the last great film made by Hitchcock, who had managed a masterpiece every decade since the thirties. Yes, it is violent and disturbing, but there is nothing gratuitous about the film. It fits into the increasingly pessimistic world view that Hitchcock had been developing throughout his career.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Have you ever wondered about what a famous artist's work would be like if they were living in the present age? Imagine Van Gogh living in Los Angeles, or Dante writing of the military debacle in Iraq. Well, imagine what Alfred Hitchcock- either of the early British thrillers or 1950s vintage era Hollywood classics, would be like if he were given a free hand in the 21st Century. Fortunately, cineastes need not strain their imaginations too much, for his penultimate film, 1972's Frenzy- his first film made in England in over twenty years, gives hints as to what a 21st Century Hitchcock would provide; and it's assuredly good. In fact, save for a too rushed last fifteen or twenty minutes, it would be the equal of his three or four greatest films. As it is, however, it's still a near-great thriller, and thoroughly modern in its usage of sex, nudity, violence, and profanity; so much so that it was the only film of Hitchcock's to earn an R rating, and likely owes that to its being filmed outside the U.S. What sets the film apart from lesser films that exploit such seamier aspects of the human condition is that Hitchcock knows where and when to place such scenes, how to film them, and when to show restraint and not.The plot of the film is standard Hitchcock fare. In a sense, the old canard that Hitchcock only made one film and made it over and over again has some merit. Similar things have been said about Japanese film director Yasujiro Ozu, and the fact that he made mostly films that depicted Japanese family life, but it's a testament to Hitchcock's craftsmanship that all of his crime pictures and thrillers approach such similar subject matter in disparate ways; much as Ozu's families, while similar in many surface details, were different under the familial flesh.Frenzy is about serial murder (The Lodger, Psycho), sexual deviance (Psycho, Strangers On A Train, or Rope), it is about a wrongly accused man (Strangers On A Train, The Wrong Man), as well as being about betrayal, and oneupsmanship. The film has often been lumped in with Hitchcock's other post-The Birds films as somewhat of a failure, but, in reality, it was critically hailed, a box office hit that was lacking in star power and filmed on a low budget, and represented somewhat of a comeback film for Hitchcock, whose three box office failures in the mid to late 1960s- Marnie, Torn Curtain, and Topaz- had made him become perceived as 'outdated' in Hollywood. Thus, the return to England, and London specifically, was viewed as a homecoming and a needed artistic rejuvenation. It worked. In spades. Frenzy opens with Hitchcock's cameo, as he and a crowd watch a local politician demagoguing about pollution in the Thames River. Suddenly, a naked corpse floats by, and people see it's another woman killed by The Necktie Murderer, as the latest serial killer has been dubbed?. While many of Hitchcock's earlier films on murderers are outdated, due to psychological and forensic advancements- even Psycho seems somewhat quaint, Frenzy is fully modern. Rusk keeps trophies of his victims, and even revels in the framing of his friend, to prove his 'superiority', especially to Blaney. There are also very subtle clues to Rusk's deviance early on- such as a glimpse of his wacky mother (ala Psycho and Strangers On A Train), and the plot does unfold believably, not at a Hollywood modern computer game pace, which only points out the flaws toward the end. Hitchcock also revels in real locations like never before. 1970s London looks and feels the way Charles Dickens may have viewed it had he lived a century later. The city is, perhaps, the central character of the film, and lends a realism to Frenzy that many earlier Hitchcock films lack. The only backscreens used are in a few shots from moving vehicles.Yes, there are a few other flaws, such as Brenda's odd impassivity as she is being raped and killed, and a few logical problems, mostly plot holes that are 'resolved' by the lowest common denominator law of 'the dumbest possible action'; but compared to standard Hollywood fare, Frenzy is a near-masterpiece, not only as a genre film, but it is the rare Hitchcock film that probes its characters' psychological depths with a modern realism. That such a formulaic (in the best sense) director was still evolving and adding things like forensic psychology and new camera tricks to his repertoire so late in his career only makes one wonder just how far his oeuvre would have come were he still alive and making films today. Now there's a really scary thought!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dryly smooth, somewhat stodgy thriller rather than a frenzied one...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adaptation of Arthur La Bern's novel "Goodbye Piccadilly, Farewell Leicester Square" becomes not-bad Alfred Hitchcock thriller filmed in London, with strangulations, nude bodies, and some lightly acerbic asides customary of the Master of Suspense. Unemployed bartender finds himself a wanted man after his ex-wife and girlfriend both fall victim to the "Necktie Strangler", a modern-day serial killer stalking England. Hitchcock takes full advantage of the new permissiveness in '70s cinema (lots of bums and bosoms), but one questions his apparent lack of taste in these killings (the victims are humiliated by the camera). Worse, Gil Taylor's cinematography makes London look chilly and ugly (and small), focusing on a just a few streets in a working-class area. Ron Goodwin carpets the first reel with pompous music which fails to set the appropriate tone--though this may be what Hitchcock wanted--and there's an obtuse subplot midway through involving an upscale couple who harbor the might-be criminal (a thread which is picked up and then dropped, seemingly just to bide time). Still, the dry comedy in the marriage between Scotland Yard Inspector Alec McCowen and his dotty wife, a would-be gourmet cook, is cheeky; Anna Massey has some frisky moments as a barmaid; and Barry Foster does a fine job in the flashy role of a sex pervert. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Hitchcock Showed When He Could: His Singular R-rated Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely!" This is one of the master's most underrated-films ever, and his only "R-rated" one. Is it good? It is incredible. For those who would argue that "Hitchcock didn't show everything because he didn't want to" are proved-wrong by this film and Psycho (where he pushed-the-envelope, changing movies forever). There is a simple reason for why Alfred Hitchcock didn't "show everything" in his earlier depictions of violence and murder: he wasn't allowed-to. By 1972, the changes wrought by Psycho and the imitators were being-felt (as well as major cultural-changes throughout the West), and he could get-away with showing some pretty graphic-violence. Does he? Oh yeah, you bet. There isn't much blood, but you see some pretty horrific-depictions of murder that the camera dwells-on for a long-long time. He showed as much as he could in all of his films, and said so for decades. His usual sexual-subtext is out-in-the-open, and gloriously so.Ostensibly, this was to be Hitchcock's triumphant return to the UK, and it put him squarely back-at-the-top again. London in the early-1970s still looked Victorian, there were still scars from the Blitz, and it held an interesting-charm that this film captures so well. Frenzy is very-much like the film of a young man, and yet Hitch was in his 70s! The fact is, he was willing to take-chances and experimented with sound and image-techniques. He was often well-ahead of his time. There is a great cinematic moment in the story where "Babs" the barmaid is walking-out of a flat, when the entire soundtrack goes-silent--the necktie-murderer, Bob Rusk ("Bob's your uncle!"), suddenly appearing- from-behind her smirking. It is riveting and startling. Why? Because in classic Hitchcockian-fashion, he has already told us that Rusk is the serial-killer. Yes, this is possibly one of the very-first films to clearly illustrate this kind of killer, even before Uli Lommel's "Tenderness of Wolves" (1973). In 1972, the concept of the "serial-killer" was very new, and almost unknown. Fritz Lang's "M" (1931) has the distinction of being first.The "wrong man" in this story was originally called "Blamey" (or, "blame ME'!), but Hitch wisely changed it, it would have been too-obvious. BUT, he does play the audience, sending mixed-messages about Mr. Blaney's possible guilt, until a key-scene that comes very-early in the film with Mr. Rusk. You won't miss-it, and it includes the most nudity in any Hitchcock film we will ever see (a first for Hitch). Hey, Hitchcock rarely did "mysteries", he did thrillers. In a suspense-thriller, you show-everything to the audience that you can. There are so many aspects of technique in this film that work, and the cinematography is really solid and eye-catching. Hitch had a great eye for composition too, and it often surprises viewers that he rarely ever looked-through the lens--ever.Again, this is familiar-territory for Hitchcock-fans. The premise of the "wrongly-accused" protagonist is a running-theme in his films, and a very personal one. You see, Hitch disliked and feared the Police, and was fearful of their incompetence in apprehending the guilty. It is said that he avoided the presence of Policemen, and became extremely-nervous when they were around him in public. This is what makes a great suspense/thriller/horror director--a man with many-many fears and complexes! As-usual, we also get the patented gallows-humor, best-expressed by the poor Police Chief's meals at-the-hands of his wife! A real hoot.It's safe-to-say that Alfred Hitchcock invented the suspense-thriller,and innovated horror into the modern-age in movies.Certainly, there were others like George Romero with his "Night of the Living Dead", and even the teleplays and screenplays of Richard Matheson, but it was Hitchcock who made it all possible. We could use another director like him, but they only come-along so often. They have to be cultivated, and this isn't happening in this period of film history very often. With-luck, Hollywood will stop making films and simply distribute them again. If the career of Alfred Hitchcock illustrates anything, it is that you have to allow the artist to get on with what they do best. "Frenzy" was a hit, after-all, and literally suffered ONE cut, a close-up of a victim's tongue sticking out of her mouth! You couldn't make this film today, not with the topless strangling-scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Filming a movie in his native England for the first time in 18 years, Alfred Hitchcock - watch for him as the man in the crowd at the beginning - tells the story of several bizarre murders in London. I think that my favorite part was the scene in the potato truck. I will admit that "Frenzy" doesn't hold the viewer's attention in quite the same way as "Psycho", but Hitch puts his usual spins on everything. Some people might ask how many murder mysteries there can be, but that misses the point here. The point is to get enthralled with the camera angles and everything. And I'm sure that you will.

		<fullReview>I watched FRENZY many years ago and I recently bought the DVD. I'm glad I did as it is truly one of the greatest of Hitch's films. The screenplay by Anthony Shaffer is very well written and the characters are totally believable. Jon Finch has an edge to him which gives an overall greater depth to this film than some of it's contemporaries.From the beginning it has your attention and the action never stops. The musical score by Ron Goodwin is excellent and sets the mood of the film. Rusk (Barry Foster)is brilliant and the rather black comedy with Vivien Merchant is second-to-none. British cinema at it's best, if you haven't seen this Hitchcock thriller SHAME on you! Go and buy it, it will be YOUR type of film!! Meryl Heasman CATFLAP MUSIC</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say....this movie is one of my all time favorite's. For me this film is very much about psychology. We see characters (talking about male roles) that have different dynamics in showing and controlling emotions. As there is the main-role of Blaney who gets fired and is frustrated about things that happened in the past, constantly being in anger. The over self-controlled character of the inspector, staying polite in every situation. And of course the controlled character of Rusk (in his job at the market) opposed by his uncontrolled self (mentally ill). In a way there is a big eye on the DARK side of mankind in this film. This hard to digest dish is served with a sauce of ironic humor to make it tolerable. Greatest line....Christ Bloody All Mighty!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock's last great triumph</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is Alfred Hitchcock's penultimate film, and it ranks among his best, which is almost oxymoronic when speaking of the Master. However, after The Birds, all of his films were pretty much bombs, at least box office wise, except Frenzy. I've seen his final film, Family Plot, which is decent but thoroughly inconsequential as far as its being a Hitchcock film, but I haven't yet seen Topaz or Torn Curtain. I have seen Marnie, which is good, though sloppy (Frenzy's quite a bit better). Frenzy has all the trademarks. It's suspenseful, exciting, excellently acted, impeccably directed (duh!), and, maybe here even more than in most of his other films, it is funny. Perhaps only Mr. and Mrs. Smith and North by Northwest are funnier of those that I've seen.SLIGHT SPOILERSLike a lot of other Hitchcock films, there are times where the characters act so illogically that the audience just has to slap their foreheads in unison. I can understand it when the suspected but innocent man hides from the police the first time around, but the second time, when he has a solid alibi, he still tries to hide. This is the situation: a husband and wife, the husband very sympathetic to the suspect and trusting him, the wife fearful and sure of his guilt, shelter him for the night. Another woman is murdered and the husband, at least, is 100% sure that the alibi is as tight as can be (the wife's stubborn disbelief is unbelievable and contrived at this point). However, the wife reminds her husband that, if he were to reveal that he has been harboring the suspect, he himself will be arrested for harboring a criminal. Also, he won't be able to make his business appointment in Paris. The suspect objects, telling his friend that his priorities aren't quite straight: he'd gladly let his friend rot in jail when to save him would be so easy. And, although I'm not an expert on the British legal system, I can't imagine that it's that much different than our own system: why not just tell the police that they had not heard that their friend was a suspect? Besides, the man was, at this point, only a suspect, not a fugitive. Also, when you can prove that the man is innocent, is there really a legitimate fear of being convicted of harboring a fugitive after he is exonerated? And take this: if I were the suspect, I would have picked up the phone when that couple was standing behind me and dialed the police. "Hello, police. I am suspected of being the Necktie Murderer. I did not do it, and I have an alibi." There. The couple could not have gotten out of it no matter what, unless they themselves were willing to resort to murder. If they should try to go to Paris now, they'd be breaking a subpoena and eventually they'd be arrested! Not only would the suspect have been exonerated, he would also have the pleasure of destroying his traitorous and petty friend's career and, hopefully and to his benefit, his marriage.Anyhow, that's just a small piece of the plot that's kind of silly. It doesn't ruin the film (although, if it had been more ironed out, the film might have been a masterpiece). Make sure to see this film. You owe it to Hitchcock! 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intense, exciting, but a few levels below "Psycho" and "Vertigo"...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>FRENZY is Hitchcock back in his British origins with another tale about a serial killer, the kind he made films about when he began his career in the U.K. This time, it's in color, beautifully photographed, but just as grim (although laced with dark humor) as some of his B&amp;W classics.And as usual, there are some marvelous set pieces...the famous tracking shot from the killer's apartment, down a hallway and then out to the street, all in one sweeping camera pan. And, of course, the moment when the killer has to retrieve a tie clasp from a corpse he's placed on a potato wagon and can only open the hand by breaking the fingers. These are the sort of scenes any Hitch film has to have to qualify as one of his best.The other familiar ingredient has JON FINCH, an innocent man, who must prove his innocence when the police wrongly suspect him of the series of crimes. BARRY FOSTER, as the real culprit, does an excellent job as "the necktie murderer" who stalks London doing his foul deeds.And finally, the humor is intact as long as there are scenes of ALEC McCOWEN dining with his wife who is always preparing the worst sort of meals for him while they discuss the case. Here, Hitch's wicked sense of humor prevails.Well worth seeing, although don't expect it to rival his very best work. However, it does stand alone as sufficiently chilling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Virtue is its own reward, as me Mum used to say.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not a bad movie. If it had been made by a 21-year-old whom no one had ever heard of, the verdict would be something along the lines of, "Promising young director, obviously influenced by Hitchcock. May go on to distinguished career." However it was not made by a nobody. It was made by Hitchcock and it will be judged in the context of his entire ouevre.The old chap seems to have shaken off whatever religious sense of guilt had been haunting him all those years. What Hitchcock's freedom finally let loose may or may not have been good for him but it was sure bad for the characters in his movies, particularly the women.Basically and briefly, two men are friends -- Rusk (Foster) who runs a fruit and vegetable business in the now-defunct Covent Garden and who is a sadistic rapist and murderer when he's not fondling his grapes, and Blainey (Finch), an ex-RAF officer of reduced circumstances, broke, suspected of the murderers, and rapidly running out of friends one way or another.Blainey has a sympathetic ex-wife (Leigh-Hunt) and a current squeeze (Anna Massey). The former is obviously middle-class and the latter is a sensible and devoted working-class barmaid. The two women are the most admirable characters in the film. The differences don't matter. Rusk does his abominable number on both of them.Well -- that's one thing. But Hitchcock's treatment of the murders is anything but delicate and purposive. Leigh-Hunt's rape and murder is pretty explicit. She squeezes her crucifix and prays during the ordeal but her pleas are unanswered and the director gives us a shot of her dead body, her legs spread, a necktie twisted around her neck, and her tongue protruding in which some docs call "the Q sign." Hitchcock doesn't even give her the dignified distance of the death of Miriam, Farley Granger's whorish wife, in "Strangers on a Train." We don't get to see Anna Massey violated, but in some ways her death is even more distasteful. Late at night, Rusk stuffs her stiffened body into a burlap bag of potatoes and dumps it in the back of one of the trucks parked near his business. Later, when he realizes that the corpse has a personal item of his in her fist, he climbs into the back of the truck and extracts the stickpin, while the truck rumbles and bounces along the highway. Here it's as if the shower murder in "Psycho" had been played for laughs. Rusk fumbles and bumbles around, trying to untie the bag's drawstring, scrabbling around in the potatoes and the cold flesh, with Massey's stiff foot poking him repeatedly in the face. His head gets caught inside the bag while he curses. He must break her fingers to release the item. And finally the potatoes begin bouncing out of the open rear, all over the highway, to be followed by the nude body with its green face and agonized expression.His attempts at humor do succeed, but not enough to overcome the general sense of unpleasantness. The humor has to do with the Detective's wife serving him inedible French delicacies such as pig's feet and a soup that seems to have been made out of the innards of the creature from "Alien." It's impossible not to watch the detective, poor Alec MaCowan, trying to be polite to his wife while sawing desperately at a sliver of meat from a roasted shrunken bird carcass the size of a canary. And I crack up every time I watch the detective's last attempt at a meal of pig's feet, carrying on a muffled conversation with some inedible piece of hoof tucked away in his cheek. This goes on for some minutes until at the first chance he manages to spit this malignancy out onto the plate, gets up and leaves at once.The two women and the detective are okay. The detective's wife is harmless but dumb. Everyone else is, to say the least, unpleasant. They bark and snap at each other. The hero is especially obnoxious, smashing a wine glass in his hand at a fancy restaurant while shouting at his innocent partner. Rusk, Blainey's phony friend, played with slithering accuracy by Barry Foster, is unspeakable of course. Even the art that adorns his walls is unspeakable. There are two "portraits" of exotic women, the sort usually found on black velvet. There's a lurid and inept painting of what might have been a scene deleted from "The Rake's Progress" because it was so lousy. And then, capping it all, there's a photo of Rusk's Mum, who once told him that home is when you go there, they have to take you in. There ought to be a photo of Robert Frost rolling around in his grave.There are two or three of Hitchcock's set pieces. One involves the camera movements while Anna Massey is being done in. The other is the potato sack scene in the back of the truck. Both are effective in their different ways.But it's not any given scene that's disturbing. It's the tenor of the entire film. Cripes, what a view of humanity it embraces! Hitch may be right. People may in general be pretty lousy. It doesn't make the film less sad.Well, I've kind of bombed the movie, I see, but taken as a thing in itself, it's not bad. It suffers mainly in comparison to Hitchcock's earlier work. If it's sad -- and it is -- it's sad in a way that life can sometimes be sad. Not all of our protagonists are heroic -- or even likable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually delightful hair and skin flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I think about Frenzy, what first comes to mind is Barry Foster's hair. It is thick and wavy and red and looks very ... English. I suppose Hitchcock had some fixation on hair, somehow they seem to represent order and disorder ? and possibly what's lying underneath. At the time Frenzy was made people did dreadful things to their hair, and Hitchcock plays adroitly with British mainstream fashion of the early 1970s here. Skin is also am important feature of Frenzy, most of it looks sweaty or pasty and generally not very clean. This fits in perfectly with the very carefully filmed locations around Covent Garden in London. It all is a little dirty and unkempt. (Watch the title sequence, blue skies, famous bridge ... and in the foreground a small trawler trailing the sootiest smoke imaginable right across the screen!) So Frenzy couldn't be more distant from the spick and span Hollywood Technicolor affairs of the 1950ies or the aseptic black and white of Psycho. I greatly admire Hitchcocks talent for bringing the feel of a period and a specific place to the screen in this movie. Indicentially: Show me a big budget movie of the last few years in which a women gets out of bed completely naked, does not put on panties but stockings and walks to the bathroom (it is so ... logical).The use of food is also great, English breakfast, grapes, a half eaten apple, potatoes, French cuisine (probably badly misinterpreted) being chewed, gorged, trampled on, bitten into, spat out ? and all with perfect timing, taking part in the story or accentuating a point. Every aspiring director should know it: watching people handle food is always a great treat.As far as the script is concerned, it has to be said that the story requires an occasional suspension of disbelief. But for Hitchcock that really wasn't ever a problem, and Anthony Shaffer sure was an excellent choice for writing the script. Robert Rusk is a truly frightening character, a greengrocer version of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. It is simply wonderful how habits are inserted into the action. Only thanks to his tooth picking ritual, the mass murderer realizes that he made a serious mistake. This scene is wonderfully prepared and directed an acted. The final scene is equally brilliant.For me there is no doubt: Hitchcock was a true master and a great craftsman throughout his long career.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's some fairly good acting - Barry Foster's Bob Rusk is classic 70s wannabe spiv - and some of the usual sidetracked humour (there's a great running gag whereby the chief detective's wife is a dreadful cook but is one step ahead of her husband in the case).It's the feel of the film that rankles though. It seems to be playing catchup with the contemporaneous social furore; the characters seem like grumpy old men and the women stuck at the threshold of the previous decade (baring all for the camera is not the same as characterising the zeitgeist). The editing is either laboured or indiscriminate (a pointless idea concerning what can be heard from outside the courtroom) and with one or two clumsily effected plot developments to try and up or at least retain the tension.There's one real gem in this period London-location film though. During the titles, a single, swooping shot approaching Tower Bridge from the East, you can see the Bankside power station - now the wonderful Tate Modern Art Museum - smoking away in all its former glory. 3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frenzy is one of the better Hitchcock movies out there (I've seen most of them), largely due to stunning cinematography, well-written dialogue, and a suspenseful story. Some sections of the movie may seem a bit slow to modern viewers, but many of these scenes are saved by the dialogue and acting. The movie hasn't aged terrifically, but that shouldn't come as much of a surprise considering how old it is. Frenzy isn't perfect; parts of it, such as the rape scene and the dinner scenes, are pretty over-the-top, but, overall, the movie's strengths compensate for its shortcomings. Frenzy may not rank among Hitchcock's very best work, but I'd still say it's a must-watch for fans of the genre. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not nearly his best work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many others on this site have provided nice reviews that give a detailed description of the plot. My attempt here is to give my thoughts on some of Alfred Hitchcock's decisions in making this early 1970s film, and why they were good or not.The innocent-man-on-the-run is a good concept, as proved by earlier Hitchcock films. The mistake in Frenzy is the protagonist is not shown to be a likable man in any way. Right after an opening scene where a naked body is found in the Thames River in London, we see Richard being fired from his job as a bartender when he is spotted drinking some of the boss's product. He insisted he was going to pay for it, that he always does. The boss explains, "Whether stealing or drinking (on the job), I can't use him." (paraphrasing).Then we see Richard visiting a lonely hearts club office, which his ex-wife operates. He is somewhat rude to the receptionist, and then is rather nasty to the ex-wife, for no reason we can see. She invites him to supper and secretly slips some money into his pocket.I think the film is somewhat sloppy in that it appears that Richard has to spend the first night after he is fired in a Salvation Army center. I think very few men who hold jobs are put out of their living quarters the very day they are fired from their jobs. There was no mention of him being about to be evicted without being fired, so his immediate "homeless" condition seemed wrong.He finds the money, about $50, and immediately decides to live it up at a fancy hotel, taking his girlfriend barmaid to spend the night with him. I again had trouble understanding this suddenly homeless fellow who just lost his job, showing no interest in even looking for other work or a cheap place to stay, but throwing away the few pounds he has on a fancy hotel.(Spoiler alert) Meanwhile, that fruit-market friend of Richard's, named Robert, shows up at the lonely hearts club the next day while the receptionist is out to lunch. His talk soon turns a bit scary for her. She tries to humor him, saying she will meet him somewhere later, but he grabs her and we see a prolonged, uncomfortable rape scene, climaxed by him killing her with his necktie.I have read that Hitchcock followed the scene depicted in the book upon which this movie was based, only that the book was more graphic and disturbing.I believe movie directors in general are always figuring that their film needs to go farther than earlier films. This applies to any kind of violent scene, love scene, whatever. They figure "this" scene won't seem intense if the viewers can remember a film from a couple of years ago that was similar but was more intense. Hitchcock figured Frenzy had to have us see a more disturbing murder than the first one in Psycho. The reasoning is similar to why amusement parks keep building roller coasters higher and faster.In a similar way, movies through the decades have delighted in showing more and more of the female anatomy, to attract the interest of male viewers. By the time this film was made, you could actually show things in films that were totally not allowed in regular films a few years before. The titillating, voyeurism is the only reason I can find to explain why Hitchcock let us see Richard's girlfriend get up from the bed and head for the other room while totally naked. It would have been simple to have her grab a robe or towel or just have the camera not show all that it did, and have the same scene.Later, at the second killing, we see nothing of the killing, we just figure it happens while the camera backs away from the place, down the stairs and out the door. Here Hitchcock shrewdly knows that scenes left to the viewers' imagination can be highly dramatic and gripping.Richard is betrayed by Robert and arrested, immediately figuring out that Robert must be the killer. Here is where I had the biggest trouble with the film. We never see any scenes of Richard explaining his innocence to the police. He immediately figures it has to be Robert, but we don't know what he told the police. You would think that some of these murders would have been committed while Richard was bar-tending and that would make the detective quite doubtful of Richard being the guy. Just the fact that the one murder they figured they could pin on him was his ex-wife in her office, one day after he was seen there, would seem to be obvious that he wouldn't have killed her there, if anywhere. He would be a logical suspect to begin with. Too easy.Instead we hear he is convicted and the climax comes right as he is about to get revenge on Robert.What we needed to make this a better movie was some reason to like Richard. We needed to see him going about trying to get proof that Robert was the killer, like in Hitchcock's better films about the innocent man on the run. Instead, he has no chance of doing this, and only tries to kill him in revenge.I think Hitchcock missed the essential elements that made Young and Innocent, Saboteur, The Wrong Man and North by Northwest such great films. There were some neat camera shots and I liked the poor detective with his "gourmet" wife, but the story missed the key scenes and the character we were supposed to care about, was not a nice guy at all.We see Babs getting into a big argument with her boss at the pub. Here I thought she seemed too dumb to realize</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than a couple of plot holes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this old movie on TV last night and did enjoy it. However, I noticed a couple of what I think are plot holes. After the woman who runs the dating agency is murdered, the police go there to question the receptionist/secretary. One wonders why she is still working there when the owner who is divorced from the suspect, is dead. Why would she still be working there, who would be paying her? Also in giving a description of the suspect, she lists his estimated weight in pounds which would never happen in England. It should have been given in stones.I don't believe the murderer would be killing women in his own residence. Someone would surely at some time see him disposing of the bodies.The ease which which the wrongly convicted man escapes from the prison hospital is laughable. Surely he would have been handcuffed to the bed at the very least. Also laughable was the teacup shown with all the undissolved capsules in the bottom. Would they not have floated or been felt with the teaspoon whilst stirring?When the convicted man goes to the killer's place and bashes the blonde head with the tyre iron without checking the identity of the sleeping person, wouldn't that be attempted murder because he didn't know the woman was already dead? Also why would he go directly there which is the first place the police would look for him after the threats he made in the courtroom?When the real killer threw the body in a sack into the back of the potato truck, the sack was tied. After he entered the back of the truck looking to retrieve his tiepin, how come the body was all mixed up with the potatoes?The film held my interest but the above situations seemed a bit unbelievable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock is Back to the Roots !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>« Frenzy » ? God, I love this film. Hitchcock, after a career that spanned five decades, only 8 years before he would say goodbye to us, he made what I consider his masterpiece. Yes, yes, I see, where you're coming from, where do you put "Psycho", "North by Northwest", "Vertigo", where are the 50's, the 40's, how could this movie possibly be his masterpiece? Well, first I had the chance to watch all the classic Hitch films, you know the big ones, that enriched the list of the American Film Institute, IMDb Top 250 and all prestigious cinematic websites, and the night I discovered "Frenzy", I was thrilled, shocked, amused, captivated, transported, I had the whole Hitch formula in one film, one single film, one single word ? that couldn't have encapsulated the Hitchcockian style any better. It's quite simple, if I had to pick one movie to show the Hitchcock style, it would be "Frenzy". In the post-Birds period that could have lead to think that Hitchcock was losing his touch, the Master of Shock and Suspense gets back to his roots. Literally, since it's set in London, which almost concludes the fascinating arc of his glorious filmography. Even the score of the film has a little something cheerful when the movie starts, as if Britain was welcoming back Hitch in 1972. 1972 indeed, Grace Kelly was Princess Grace of Monaco, Jimmy Stewart and Cary Grant were on their 60's, and Hitchcock was 73 and had nothing to prove, as I like to say, yet, he brought to us one of his greatest thrillers, centered around one sordid serial killer story, the man with the necktie. The novel was adapted by Anthony Schafner, "Sleuth"'s screenwriter, who made the perfect ingredient so the Master could cook us a delicious plate, nothing to do with the kind of uneatable disasters Mrs Oxford was serving to her poor husband. Some would say "Hitchcock always tells the same story": a man wrongfully accused of a murder, or to be another one, but whatever you expect, this film will surprise you. It contains all the elements used in Hitchcock films, memorable murders' sequences, suspicion and wrong identity, a creepy but charismatic villain, Robert Rusk, played by the admirable Barry Foster, and a surprising twist, but the same story handled by another director could have failed. Take, the first murder sequence, rarely has a Hitch moment been so graphic and violent, and I mean it, Hitchchock despite his age, knew that the era allowed him to be more audacious. And the moment where the victim realizes that it's not just a rape, as if her lack of resistance was only meant not to worsen the situation, we can feel her absolute fear, and I literally suffocated when she was being strangled. And I literally jumped with the vision of the twisted tongue, and then I said to myself : "Why you, Hitch, you ? Total respect!" Hitch still got it. All you need to remember a crime is one shot ... and what a shot!But the scene is so shocking and unforgettable that the second crime must 'must keep it up'. Again Hitch finds the parade helped by a clever trick in the script. As we follow Rusk with his next victim walking from the street to his apartment, all he says is : "You're my type of woman" then the door is closed and we say good-bye to Babs, while the camera slowly goes downstairs and get off the house and we find ourselves back in a busy street. The impact is powerful and leaves us with shudders, but still the murder wouldn't have been memorable without the little extra pinch of pure Hitchcockian Black Humor. Rusk realizing that his diamond brooch probably stayed in the hand of his victim gets back to the truck where he previously put her in a potatoes bag. The whole 'truck' sequence where he tries to gets the pin back is thrilling as we put ourselves in the evil man's shoes and funny because it's satisfying to see him enduring this posthumous revenge, especially the foot of the corpse hitting him in the face. And we get to see the face of the victim, which is one of "Frenzy"'s trademarks, they're creepy and funny in a sort of unconventional way.But besides the murders, the crimes, the power of the film relies on the shoulders of the tragically unlucky Dick Blaney whom everything accuse, but the handsome Jon Finch puts so much energy in his role, we immediately root for him. And there is the investigation of the sympathetic Chief Oxford punctuated with so many indigestible marital dinners. It works as a running gag until a crucial scene where the Chief admits that there's something fishy in this affair. This is an important element as it helps to show how the Chief started to have suspicion in this open-and-shut case. The film quickly concludes when after having escaped, Blaney comes to kill Rusk and find himself between another corpse and Oxford, as to condemn himself when he could have been acquitted. Blaney is quite an unlucky character. But one irony is replaced by another, when Rusk enters his house with the trunk to hide his victim in. What's the meaning of all that? That you can't escape your nature, one is a killer, one is unlucky ? but ultimately, the one who has the last word is Hitch: justice is done.It quite ends abruptly but the ending is perfect with the four major protagonists of the film, the policeman, the wrongfully accused man, the killer, and the victim ? an anonymous victim this time, but who can forget this tongue coming out of her mouth, as if she way telling Dick "Gotcha!". But don't get it wrong, this "Gotcha!" is from the Master ?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT: I've noticed that in a few of the reviews, people seem to be combining certain aspects of the two murders.When Richard Blaney's wife, Brenda, is being murdered in her office early on in the film, two passersby are walking along the street below. When Brenda's receptionist finds the body and screams, the two women down below hear that but keep on walking.Later on in the film, as the second murder (Babs, the barmaid) is occurring, we see the camera slowly descending the stairway out onto the street, where people are walking by, oblivious to what's happening inside. That's the image we're left with for that particular murder (until we see a brief flashback later on).Some folks seem to be linking the murder of Brenda and the descending shot down the stairway, out onto the street, into one scene, but they're completely separate (and chilling) scenes. Just saw the film again this past weekend on TV Ontario, so that's why the chronology is fresh in my mind.And, for what it's worth, this is Hitchcock in fine form. The way in which he was able to combine horror and humor remains classic. Another strength is that Hitchcock sustained tension and suspense throughout this film, but did so with a deft, minimalist hand. Filmmakers of today could take a page from his book. (Many seem to think they have, but it was the unauthorized version.)Some have commented on how unlikable these characters are. I think Hitch's point was that they be that way precisely because, even though they're unlikable and not nearly as attractive or charismatic as the characters in his previous films, they still don't deserve the bad things that happen to them (Richard Blaney didn't deserve to be wrongly accused of Bob Rusk's murders, neither Brenda nor Babs deserved to die the way they did, etc.).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It would not be easy to fall asleep during this film. I'm becoming more and more of a Hitchcock fan as I see more of his work. For the last few years I have been a huge horror movie fan, with most of my interest being in Italian giallo and zombie movies. I can see where the giallo genre comes from when I saw this film.The plot is so intense, I couldn't stop watching. It twists and builds up to an insane climax, then it ends abruptly but it leaves a great taste in your mouth.I'd recommend this one to those of you who enjoy a well-acted, well-written, well-directed murder mystery/slasher. It's a great early example of a slasher. And so classy...9 out of 10, kids.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hitchcock was a brilliant visualizer who captured the city of London, its scenery and debauchery, and presented it in real life fashion.In some ways, it is reminiscent of directors who attempt to film the edginess and transience of New York City. Not an easy task.The scene at first, with Rusk and his aged mother, the fruit stands, the bystanders picking up street cabbage to survive.Many social and human commentaries are conveyed, and the brilliance is that Hitchcock manifests reality without excessive dialog and histrionic drama. It is like real life. A murder is committed at a city flat, yet women passersby shriek and run for cover. So accurate.This is a brilliant social commentary worth many viewings. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Hitchcock Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film starts out with great photography of London, England and going under the famous London Bridge which is drawn up so the camera and boat can pass under the bridge. Barry Foster, (Robert Rusk) gave an outstanding performance through out the entire film playing the role of a manager in charge of a large fruit and vegetable market and a good friend of Richard Ian Blaney,( Jon Finch) who was a retired Royal Air Force pilot from WW II, who is working as a bartender and is caught stealing a drink and gets fired. Richard seeks the help of Barry Foster who offers him money and a place to stay until he can find another job. In the meantime, Richard Blaney visits his ex-wife, Margaret Blaney, (Bartbara Leigh-Hunt) who is running a Lonely Hearts Business for couples who want to try and meet their soul mates. There is a murderer who rapes and strangles women and then kills them with his necktie and unfortunately, Richard Blaney's wife Barbara becomes one of the killer's victims. It is from this point in the story when it becomes a great mystery and there is plenty of comedy and of course, Alfred Hitchcock appears different times in his own production. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frenzy (1972) is not Hitchcock's first film about a cereal killer (to quote Green Jelly's joke and pun). It certainly ranks with his finest gallows amusement movies (others are Rope, The Trouble with Harry, Psycho ?) .Was the dear Alfred Hitchcock the best director ever?In any case,he was unmatched?and matchless.His movies don't resemble each other--I Confess (1953) and Vertigo (1958) and Psycho (1960) and Marnie (1964) and Frenzy (1972) do not seem made by the same man.This was AH's huge aptitude to renew himself.Yet there are some obvious directions along his creation,and in this sense Frenzy (1972) belongs to the class of Rope (1948), The Trouble with Harry (1955) and Frenzy (1972).It contains an unexpected violence and brutality.The intense cruelty in AH's movies is not conventional;it is extremely real and graphic.AH knew how to film a victim.The Barbara Leigh-Hunt scene is,I guess, famous.It should be,as the sense of insanity,of boundless insanity is there.That's what I remembered from my first viewing:Brenda Blaney covering her nipple and praying?the very distinct sound of her cold voice.This sense of evil and insanity is not to be found in horror or 'giallo movies?but it is to be found in other AH movies?even in those scenes where no one is physically brutalized (Rope, The Trouble with Harry, Vertigo).I see Alfred Hitchcock's force and insight in these graphic sense of evilness. From '58 till '72,Hitchcock practiced these sharp succinct titles (Vertigo ,Psycho ,The Birds ,Marnie ,Topaz ,Frenzy).Frenzy (1972) showcases its bet in several terms the characters use:cruelty,sadism.They describe the intended content.An exercise in cruelty and sadism.The interest of the killer in this film comes from his prosaic, ordinary persona.On the other hand,Blaney is only a 'galliard,and AH was not very interested in him?Blaney was only a narrative device.As characters,his wife Brenda and his girlfriend are more interesting.Brenda is at least partially an attempt at a Hitchcockian femme 'fatale.Anyway, she is not so far from AH's idea of a sexy actress.See how well-paced is Frenzy (1972),how finely is narrated! Technically, it is a "howcatchem", an inverted detective story.Like all his movies,or like the best of them, Frenzy (1972) is a vision, it has this visionary look that amounts to showcasing the viscera of the violence.All his characters are more or less tough, prosaic, gritty, egoistical, proud and unbalanced; they may be frail or ill, they are nonetheless and simultaneously tough and tenacious; their psychic structure is often altered, debilitated and corrupted, degraded?yet they are very determined .Between AH and Greene it was a mutual dislike;in fact, their characters are as opposite as possible.Hitchcock's characters are quite elemental even when they are chic and urban.They are not memorable;the actors,the roles?yes, those are memorable.But the characters, as written, are as elemental as puppets?yet ulcerated by insanity and loneliness.They have mostly prosaic aspirations?and a huge need of happiness.Sometimes,they are very moving?like those in Shadow of a Doubt, The Trouble with Harry, Vertigo and Marnie.It must be added that they are elemental the way real average people are elemental.Hence,the scope of AH's approach.With the violence and brutality,in Frenzy (1972) Alfred Hitchcock went up to the hilt?in a macabre graphic funny way."Everything's perverted in a different way",he said once.As in his other movies,here as well AH is not interested in atmosphere, suspense or mystery, according to their regular format.Frenzy (1972) is not atmospheric,suspenseful or mysterious.As usually,Hitchcock amazes and startles with the refined simplicity of his means?very straightforward, very obvious,very earthly means;I can see why a man like Averty (with his Fellini/Welles-based aesthetics) put him down.From the Expressionism and Surrealism and the vaudeville-esquire cinema of his youth (more over, as a young man,he admired an Expressionist director;as an old one,he expressed his admiration for a Surrealist one ?),he retained this simplicity,this very useful tool.He is not concerned with mystery, atmosphere or suspense,but with evil, insanity and fun.He was brutal and graphic and sardonic, not atmospheric. See how carefully he avoids all Jack the Ripper devices.He focuses on anxiety,fear,panic and macabre comic.Wise (in the '60s: The Haunting ,1963),Delannoy (MAIGRET TEND UN PIEGE and MAIGRET ET L'AFFAIRE SAINT-FIACRE),Coppola (in the '60s: Dementia 13),Siegel (The Verdict), Henri-Georges Clouzot,many others,made movies that were much more suspenseful and atmospheric than any of AH's films.But he intended something else.I already indicated the visionary look of Frenzy;it is macabre, sardonic and grim, shocking and graphic ,full of cruelty and sadism, striking and lucid and simple and focused, brutal and humorist.The whole film telescopes in scenes and words (sadism,etc.).To show something amazing, shocking, sensational, brutal?this was his intention.The comic proves that he wanted more than a succession of lugubrious facts?he wanted a movie.He intended to tell a story?and his Expressionist and Surrealist education taught him not to price the mere story more than it deserves.(The twists in his movies are of a literary nature ,they are borrowed, taken over).He knew the real content of his movies is not the story,but the touches,the cinematographic values,the nude aesthetic reality of his movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the opening titles with a long uninterrupted aerial shot where you zoom from three thousand feet over the River Thames and end up flying under Tower Bridge just as the drawbridge opens he used everything in his considerable 'book' here. That incredible aftermath rape scene (described by 'Spleen" above) where the camera floats backwards out of the room, back through the house and into the crowded street will leave you stunned, as does the scene where Jean Marsh returns to her office after lunch and finds her boss dead. You know she's going to find her dead but in true Hitchcock form, you don't see her stumble onto the body. You have a shot of her walking down a lane, entering her office from the outside then, as the camera backs off after a few moments all you hear is her screaming. In this movie we see every trick Hitch ever did only in full color with modern camera techniques.The casting of not internationally known actors was clever too although most of them were well known TV drama stars. Barry Foster (previously famous as a TV cop) is wonderfully evil! Today, watching the movie in 2007, when I see Clive Swift (now well known as the hapless husband in the TV series 'Keeping Up Appearances') I have to chuckle. I almost expect to see 'Hyacinth' come up behind Barry Foster with a Ming vase and bash him over the head! Hitch never reached these heights again. This was his last but one movie. His last one "Family Plot' was a terribly lame effort wasting the talents of brilliant actor Bruce Dern, almost hard to believe Hitchcock had anything to do with it.</fullReview>

I still thought it was really well made and very interesting. It was interesting to see in comparison to Strangers on a Train, how Hitchcock's style developed over the years. I found Frenzy to be very grotesque compared to his other films, which seem to have this elegance and romanticism about them, that to me made Frenzy more complex and interesting. I was also very surprised by all the nudity in this film. I loved the dark humor, like the scene where the murderer is in the truck bed with all the potato sacks trying to get back his pin, It was like Babs final F.U. to her killer. I also thought the relationship between the detective and his wife very funny. I thought the scene were the camera goes backwards down the stairs and out into the street was beautifully shot but also left you with this sense of hopelessness. I absolutely loved the very ending, when the last line is said and the trunk drops to the ground. All and all a great and interesting film that I highly recommend.</fullReview>

Jon Finch as the troubled Bob Blanley, Barbara Leigh as his beautiful wife, and of course the best performance from Barry Foster. From the start of the movie, we know who the killer is, but you got to see how Hitchcock enjoys himself in showing how the killer manages to escape and put the blame one someone else. Not a Hitchcock classic, but definitely a good movie to watch. If you like suspense/thrillers with a good storyline then you'll like this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not one of the Master Hitchcock's Best but not the worst either!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching Frenzy from Sir Alfred Hitchcock is quite fascinating. The cast features the great Billie Whitelaw C.B.E., Clive Swift (Keeping Up Appearances), Jean Marsh (who should be awarded Damehood by now), the unforgettable Vivian Merchant in a great small role as the cop's wife who likes to cook French cuisine. Of course, Anna Massey who plays one of the victims. In the murder sequence featuring Barbara Leigh Hunt (another British actress worthy of a British honor and is one of Dame Judi Dench's very best friends and the godmother to her only child) was difficult but yet unbelievable to watch. Just when you think he might let her live, you are wrong. She is the first murder victim and the whole rape and murder is shown explicitly. We know who the killer is all along but we don't know how they are going to catch in the act. The murder of Anna Massey was done differently because once they entered his character's apartment. The door becomes closed to us as the spectator. We don't know how bad it is until later. So watching how the murderer escapes from this one is quite unforgettable. You think he'll get caught and the movie is worth watching because of the London locations alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock's glory days were probably over but nevertheless this one is great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think Alfred Hitchcock's glory days were unfortunately pretty much over after the spectacular "Marnie". It is the last serious larger-than-life masterpiece he directed and the last Hitch-film that could easily get five (out of five) stars from me. After "Marnie" he still directed four movies. I've never really cared about "Torn curtain" and "Topaz" (maybe I should just watch them again, it usually tends to help) but his last two films "Frenzy" and "Family plot" weren't too bad even though (like I said) I can't even compare them to his biggest and most beloved classics. First thing that catches the eye in "Frenzy" is the fact that the actors are all more or less unknown and the movie had to manage without the star power.Secondly it doesn't look like a traditional Alfred Hitchcock movie. Certainly after a while you'll find lots of familiar elements and this whole wrongly accused man plot is of course pure Hitch right from the beginning. Other thing is the violence and the rape scene. Mr. Hitchcock was a master of suspense and one of his qualities was that he could built the viewer's excitement without ever actually showing anything. So this is not exactly what you would expect from Alfred. Is "Frenzy" a bad movie? Hell no! It's a wonderful thriller and works on numerous different levels. Definitely a must-see for any Hitchcock fan who haven't got a chance to enjoy it yet. I'll give "Frenzy" four stars out of five.</fullReview>

Hitch settles lovingly on her limbs, like a dying swan, as she meets her end. The killer is deliciously played, and the inspector's wife's cuisine is the send up which completes this films variety of delights. In the center is our hero, who does a fine job.

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock's last masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcock's best film since The Birds, this brilliant psycho-thriller about a serial killer on the loose in London marked a definite return to form for the great director after the disappointment of his previous three films, Marnie, Torn Curtain and Topaz. Barry Foster gives a chilling performance the charming but deadly psychopath Rusk, while Jon Finch is excellent as the innocent man framed by Rusk for the murders. Anna Massey and Barbara Leigh Hunt make their mark as two of the killer's victims (the scene where Leigh-Hunt's character is raped and strangled is especially disturbing, but is not perhaps gratuitous). Alec McCowen's comic portrayal of the police inspector on the strangler's trail is very reminiscent of Alastair Sim's role in Stagefright (ironically, the last Hitchcock film to be made in the UK before Frenzy). Full of the Master's trademark black humour (eg. the scene with a dead body hidden inside a lorry-load of potatoes) this underrated film deserves recognition as one of Hitchcock's finest and most thought-provoking works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film of contrasts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>FRENZY is a film of contrasts. Alfred Hitchcock, although not at his pinnacle, does show off what an excellent film maker that he is.This movie has three sides. When Bob Rusk (BARRY FOSTER) murders Brenda Blaney (ANNA MASSEY), Hitchcock shows his violent, graphic side. When the camera tracks up the stairs with Rusk and Babs Milligan (BARBARA LEIGH-HUNT), and tracks back down before Rusk murders her, that shows Hitchcock's fearful side. When Rusk tries to get his tie pin back from Babs's corpse, that shows Hitchcock's comedic side.This movie is a must see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So late in Hitch's career... yet stands up as one of his very best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow! A total surprise here! I have to be honest that I didn't expect another classic from Hitch this late in the game. It seems that after THE BIRDS he lost his touch and gave us some mediocre films. But I totally loved this one!! I place it at #2 - yes, above THE GODFATHER for 1972. Only THE MECHANIC (with Charlie Bronson) is better that year. And as for Hitch's films this one actually knocks REAR WINDOW into the #6 spot and enters my coveted TOP 5 HITCH pantheon. Barry Foster was brilliant as the Necktie Murderer and we get to see Alec McCowen (the unofficial 'Q' in the rogue 007 adventure NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN) as the police inspector. And Vivien Merchant who plays the inspector's "fancy cook" wife is an absolute riot!! Anyway, great film - funny and creepy at the same time. So there you go. And Bob's your uncle! Plus it has a hilarious trailer - with Hitch randomly floating on the Thames! Haha!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock past his prime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcock was way past his prime on Frenzy. Mind you - he's still one of the most competent directors around, creating suspense like nobody else could and crafting shot after brilliant shot, and he still entertains, but in fact he reuses tricks of editing and pacing that he did many times before, to lesser effect. True fans who've seen his classic 50's output several times will recognize some scenes lifted almost directly for Frenzy.The script is partly to blame, yes, but Hitchcock worked in the past with messy scripts, and made classics out of them with styling and atmosphere - not so here. The mediocre actors don't help either. Worth a watch for completists, but definitely not a classic in my book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alfred Hitchcock's Tongue in Cheek</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While a crowd gathers to support ridding the river of pollution, director Alfred Hitchcock creates a London "Frenzy" when a nude woman's corpse surfaces in the Thames. She's the latest victim of the gruesome serial rapist known as the "Necktie" killer. Circumstances lead police to quickly suspect mustached bartender Jon Finch (as Richard "Dick" Blaney); but, you may figure it's fairer-haired Barry Foster (as Robert "Bob" Rusk). Alec McCowen (as Chief Inspector Oxford) has to decide just who is the wrong man.It may not please everyone, but "Frenzy" catches Hitchcock quite comfortably reveling in the relatively more "permissive" 1970s cinema. Consequently, you have sex and violence more overtly shown than in any other Hitchcock film. It reveals/confirms more about the director's fascination with the lurid than you may want to know. Still, it's an undeniably well-directed, often riveting, film. The killer's ride in a potato truck is thrilling. The performances of the leads never falter; and, they receive great support from Anna Massey, Alec McCowen, Vivien Merchant, and Billie Whitelaw."Frenzy" is the last classic Hitchcock film. Just remember "Bob's your uncle"; and, keep your tongue firmly in cheek. ******** Frenzy (5/25/72) Alfred Hitchcock ~ Jon Finch, Barry Foster, Alec McCowen, Vivien Merchant</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Textbook Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frenzy, as even its title suggests, is something like a late Psycho. Not only does it follow a sexual abuser killing young women and his attempts at keeping up the facade of normalcy, but the parallels extend to the formal level as well. For one, the plot is so constructed that (for the viewer) doubts as to who the killer is hardly arise, shifting the tension on the actual murder sequences and, partly, on the final resolve brought about by the second, weaker, male character. In both films, the accent is furthermore on graphic violence, only slightly diffused by artful camera direction, enabling Hitchcock to shock audiences and induce a lurid sense of "it could happen to you", so typical of pulp fiction ? but equally of Hitchcock. This becomes most evident in the much talked-about receding shot where the apartment in which a crime is committed becomes just another anonymous spot in the big city maze, the "place near you", and is furthermore emphasised in the dexterous connecting scenes where, quite literally, pub talk is left to speculate on the killer's motives, with either the real or the presumed perpetrator standing by. In hindsight, Hitchcock's decision to use a cast of nobodies proves a wise one, as it greatly contributes to paint a near realist picture of life in a popular London district, notwithstanding delusive claims that the city was, by that time, all colours and swing. Admittedly, this is Hitchcock's London, but then Antonioni's, for instance, the film epigone of 60s London, is by no means exclusive of other, grayer realities, here used to the right effect. And while Frenzy has evident flaws, which prevent it from keeping you riveted to your seat, it has enough classic moments to draw from. In this line of thought, the famous strangulation episode must rank high in Polanski's list of all-time favourite rape/murder scenes, while the black humour of the potato/corpse t?te-?-t?te, from today's viewpoint, has a distinct whiff of Tarantino comedy. More conventional, and by all accounts more facetious than Psycho, Frenzy is an all-too-savvy compendium of all the ropes used in Hitchcock's previous films, a synthetic chart of the language he created and left up for grabs for generations of filmmakers to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock is brilliant, but this is a nasty film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's brilliant -- but it's really nasty with lots of graphic violence and corpses -- and it isn't really that funny. Might I suggest "Something About Harry" if you want a laugh?Since IMDb doesn't allow pithy, short reviews, I'll add that the film should give an excellent view of London around 1970, a pivotal time and place in the art and music world, but it does not. There's a little horn-based pop music but the whole riot of colour and sound that was London at that time, at least I as I remember it, just isn't there -- instead we get a lot of shots of nice old buildings.If I found this movie disturbing in 2005, I can imagine that people were shocked in 1972 when this film came out. For Hitchcock completists or people who enjoy violence, yes, otherwise consider Lifeboat, or even Marnie (which, while it is very intense, does have a theme of redemption through strength).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock Goes For The Juggular...Literally</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since having struck gold with PSYCHO in 1960 and THE BIRDS in 1963, Alfred Hitchcock had not had a reasonably big hit film, either with critics or audiences. MARNIE, TORN CURTAIN, and TOPAZ, while all had their moments, were regarded by most as sub-par Hitchcock. But in 1972, the Master went back to his native England for the first time in two decades to make what turned out to be his final psychological thriller in FRENZY. And while it was a fairly controversial item because of its unusually explicit nature (owing to the relaxation of movie censorship standards), it nevertheless showed that the Master still had something going for him.London finds itself in the grasp of a wave of strangulation murders, murders where the weapon happens to be a necktie. The police have few clues to guide them, only theories. Jon Finch plays a disgraced ex-barman and former R.A.F. officer who has a tendency to get too drunk too early in the day, and sometimes too violent with people, even his former wife (Barbara Leigh-Hunt). Barry Foster portrays a fruits-and-vegetables vendor working out of Covent Garden who appears very congenial and is his best friend. But he also comes on very strange to women as well, especially Leigh-Hunt--whom he proceeds to strangle to death with a necktie in her matrimonial agency office. When Leigh-Hunt's secretary (Jean Marsh) sees Finch leave her office, she looks on with suspicion...and moments later, she screams in horror when she goes upstairs. As a result, because of circumstantial evidence, Finch is presumed to be the necktie murderer; and, in a typically Hitchcockian conceit, he becomes a man on the run for a crime that he didn't commit. And when another good friend of his (Anna Massey) falls victim, he must stay ahead of the cops to find the truth.Even by today's graphically sexual and violent standards, FRENZY is incredibly robust in its approach. This was the first and only film of Hitchcock's to be given an 'R' rating by the Motion Picture Association of America during the director's lifetime, and it's rather easy to see why. The sequence in which Foster strangles Leigh-Hunt is so shocking and prolonged that it would even give the shower scene in PSYCHO a run for its money; it also drew a significant amount of criticism from American film reviewers for its explicitness. The language is also a lot rougher than before, owing again to the relaxing of censorship standards.All the same, however, FRENZY is an important work in the Hitchcock canon because it contains a great deal of droll British dialogue, courtesy of playwright Anthony Shaffer's screenplay, and significant amounts of the director's patented suspense and black humor. Of particular note are those moments when the chief inspector (Alec McCowen) on the case, a meat-and-potatoes man, is served "gourmet" dishes by his dotty but well-meaning wife (Vivien Merchant). And there's also a scene in which Foster tries to retrieve an incriminating piece of evidence from the body of one of his victims by breaking that victim's fingers, this happening inside a truck full of potatoes. Hitchcock remarked later on that the most remarkable aspect of this moment was "how it improved the taste of the potatoes." The cast, all of them highly respected British actors, does a superb job under Hitchcock's direction, making FRENZY one of the most significant (though still somewhat under-appreciated) thrillers of its type. While it may not be as heralded a film as PSYCHO was, it is nevertheless a film of sheer audacity in its approach, something that is missing from too many Hollywood horror/suspense films these days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intense comeback movie for Hitch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rating: 7 out of 10. Directed by Alfred Hitchcock. This is Hitch's second last movie and a comeback for him since his two movies right before this one, "Topaz" and "Torn Curtain" were somewhat lackluster and not well received by fans.Like most Hitchcock movies, the 'wrong man' and 'manhunt' themes are used. Hitch was going with what he knew best instead of experimenting with something different.Unlike most Hitchcock movies, "Frenzy" does not have a famous lead actor. Previous Hitchcock 'wrong man' movies had Cary Grant or James Stewart. The other thing that was a departure for a Hitchcock movie was the abundant use of nudity.The story takes place in London, England. A bartender, Richard Blaney, played by Jon Finch, is fired from his job by his unbearable boss. Now unemployed, he has to rely on the charity of his ex-wife to get by.While this is happening, a flood of serial killings has been happening in London. Things get worse for Blaney when he becomes the prime suspect of these murders.If you like Hitchcock's work then you should see this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>so-so at best....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frenzy is an okay movie. It is really mediocre for the majority however, with a few strokes of genius and interest here and there. The genius refers mostly to a tracking shot(which was absolutely fantastic) from the killers steps and back across the street as he is committing his crime. The other is a scene in the back of a potato truck that was very interesting. There are also a few scenes between the main detective and his wife that were quite amusing. These are really the only decent parts of the movie however, and it really lags and is not all that interesting during the moments between these. Great potential, but fails to create the Hitchcock suspense and intrigue that I enjoy. Unless you're a fan, don't bother. 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of his best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Looks like I'm in the minority here, but I honestly feel this is one of Hitch's best.One comment I can't resist making to Lee8301: "We smirk when (his victim) dies". ???? I've seen this movie at least five times, and I assure you, I have never smirked during that scene. Rather, I have complete empathy with his victim. She bleakly recites a prayer while she is being assaulted, and then - just as she thinks the horror can become no worse - she sees her attacker take off his tie, and she realizes who (and what) he is. The look of stark terror on her face has never left me. No, no smirking here, thank you.Hitchcock is known, of course, for the clever "bits" he puts in his films. One of my favorites occurs during Blaney's trial. The door to the courtroom is closed at first, and you hear nothing, because the room is almost soundproof. Then one of the courtroom personnel opens it for a moment, and you hear the judge about to pronounce sentence. The door swings shut. Then... despite the soundproofing, you hear Blaney's anguished roar. "It's RUSK! I keep telling you, it's RUSK! RUSK, WHERE ARE YOU?".Shivers down my spine, even now. This is a powerful film, make no mistake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of Hitch's final films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frenzy is one of Hitchcock's final films, and a collector's item for this very reason. But it is a rather unsatisfying suspense thriller coming from the man who brought us Psycho, the Birds and others. But we cannot blame Hitchcock, whose desire for his features to become more 'dangerous' would force him to leave the glamour of Hollywood to make Frenzy on a low budget in Britain. He originally scripted a film called 'Kaliedoscope Frenzy' to be shot in America, but the studios refused to finance undeniably due to the film's preposed high nudity and violence quota. To be quite honest, the high (not especially by today's standards) levels of violence and sex (rape) don't really add to the film, and such areas had been explored far more subtly and more powerfully in Psycho. The acting varies from satisfactory to inept, and Hitch's cameo is far too easy to spot. ok, perhaps that last bit was nit-picking slightly. Anyone looking for a stylish, violent thriller should check out Dario Argento's 'Deep Red', a film that Hitchcock is known to have admired.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock finally fades</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frenzy is the kind of film made by a director who outlasted his times. This not of course reserved to Hitchcock only, the one director of Hollywood's Golden Age who was still relevant, hell more relevant thanever, by the time the 70's rolled into town with their deviant takes on morals and aesthetics, was the indomitable John Huston. In a time when Hitchcock disciples were not just impressionable teens admiring him on the big screen but old enough to make films of their own, in a time of Argentos and DePalmas, Hitchcock matches them for sexual deviancy in Frenzy's notorious rape strangulation scene but on a cinematic level, and with the exception of a marvelous long shot that takes us down a staircase and out of a building in one sweep, it's dull as dishwater. This is still Hitchcock enacting his studio formula for everyman thrillers, where the protagonist must stop what he's doing for the camera to observe a bit of comic relief happening in the same staircase, a new couple leaving a marriage agency, the wife berating her soon-to-be husband, where characters explain for our benefit the behaviour of the sexual psychopath like there's a textbook somewhere that explains these things, and finally where the wrong man is again accused for a crime he didn't commit and must prove his innocence. I like the small touch of the police inspector's wife solving the case inside her kitchen inbetween serving her husband horrible gourmet dishes he can't stand. Other than that, this is extremely boring to me, like watching an old man try to show the youngsters how they played football in his day. In his time, even if I don't like him, he could pull it off to a degree. Here, he's pretty much sliding into cinematic irrelevance. When the people who learned from you can do it better, it's best you hang your shoes, the job is done. Between this and Profondo Rosso or Dressed to Kill, who would pick the Hitchcock film?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nasty,exploitative,unworthy - the revenge of a woman - hater.......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Short,jowly,lugubrious and careful of speech,Mr Hitchcock - surely a model for "Droopy" - took his revenge on womankind throughout his career. Power was his only weapon in the war of the sexes;power as invested in him by virtue of his position as one of Hollywood's most famous directors. In many of his best - known films women were treated abominably (and as abominations).Mr Hitchcock leered from behind the camera,his aficionados from their cinema seats.This continuation of hatred by other means climaxed(if I may use the expression) in "Frenzy",his love song to a rapist/killer on the loose in London. His usual prejudices are on display ;the police are slow and incompetent,the senior officer a comic figure,the women cold - hearted or devious,the murderer a man whose terrible deeds are almost offset by Mr Hitchcock's efforts to present him as a man with an unfortunate but not irredeemable fault. "Frenzy" plays like a bad pastiche of his earlier,better movies. Freed from some of his inhibitions by the sexual and moral revolution of the 1960s,Mr H.vents his spleen in a more "permissive" atmosphere with some distressingly explicit scenes. If actors are indeed like cattle,Mr Barry Foster is like a sexually - frustrated bull suddenly finding he is not up to the job.Restraint and subtlety are not in his lexicon.One can imagine Mr Hitchcock urging in his refined cockney "Come on my son!" as Mr Foster's misogyny takes horrifying form. For the life of me I cannot see that the exploits of a sexual psychopath are even remotely amusing or entertaining.One could almost believe that Mr.Hitchcock was an adherent of the "Well,they asked for it"school of belief,but,of course,that would be unthinkable. Idolised by the European intellectuals who could read something significant in a slice of bread he might have been;loved by moviegoers who "Re - discovered" him after "Psycho" he certainly was:but arguably he never made a great movie after "Vertigo". When he found,in the later part of his career,that he could actually depict more or less whatever he wanted,his work lost that enigmatic quality it was so renowned for. "Frenzy" is perhaps the ultimate example of a great film - maker who has shot his bolt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, though it is a relatively minor concern, I hated the cinematography in this film. It's absolutely awful and it bothered me throughout the film.As for the rest, I did not particularly enjoy the plot, although the direction was pretty good. So as far as Hitch is concerned, it was solid work, with the exception of some scenes. The acting was very good.But as I said, the plot was rather dull and I could not bring myself to care about anything. I just wanted to see how the bloody thing would end and get it over with. And it ends with an anti-climax. A predictable, not particularly engaging ending. I have to say the thing I enjoyed the most was the humour involving the detective in charge and his wife's cooking.The strangling scene was probably the most boring rape scene in film history and that's one of the scenes I wasn't happy about. Maybe that scene worked in 1972, but I almost fell asleep during the ordeal.On the whole, Frenzy is one of my least favourite Hitchcock films. It's strange that the master of suspense could not make a film about a strangler more suspenseful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At last, a Hitchcock film that can be recommended wholeheartedly, without any qualifications. For me, too many of them are great up to a point, but then have major plot or character issues. (Such as "Man who Knew too Much"...would any parent really stay cool knowing their kidnapped child was on the floor above them?) But this one is crackerjack suspense from beginning to end, with no plot holes or characters acting completely unrealistically.A lot has been written about the "graphic" rape scene, and while that may have been true when the movie was made, it's not anymore, although it still is very intense &amp; disturbing.I do wish the movie didn't end so abruptly, and I'm surprised the last line (which I won't repeat here for fear of a spoiler), hasn't become more famous in popular lexicon.But by all means, and without any qualifications, see this film.

		<shortDescription>Great Hitchcock Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frenzy deals with a sexual sadist who is terrorizing London and the man the police mistake for him. Jon Finch as Richard Blaney, a former pilot, has had trouble making the transition to civilian life. He seems to put himself in some avoidable predicaments with his careless behaviour, his temper and his drinking. Unfortunate for him is his knack for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Yet, he has the sympathy of the viewer and his ex-wife, played by Barbara Leigh-Hunt, still cares for him. His current girlfriend, Anna Massey as Babs Miligan, is highly trusted ally. Barry Foster is Blaney's friend Bob Rusk, who works in the market at Covent Garden, buying and selling fresh produce. I liked the supporting cast of Jean Marsh, Alec McCowen and Vivian Merchant. All are excellent, with notes of comic relief, to balance the dark elements of the story. &nbsp;&nbsp; Frenzy, made in 1972, has the look and feel of London in the hands of director Alfred Hitchcock. Its emphasis on street life and crowd scenes remind me of Sabotage or The 39 Steps. It is Hitchcock's first British movie since Stage Fright in 1950.&nbsp;The sets are very convincing, as if it is shot on location with the action flowing effortlessly through the city's pubs, markets, waterfronts, and back alleys. Indeed, some of the scenes are actually shot on location and we can feel the pulse of the city. The opening credits are a visual treat as the camera moves along the River Thames toward London Bridge, passing through the drawbridge as the final credits appear. Symphony music enhances the pleasure.Hitchcock again uses muted sound tracks at pivotal points in the movie, increasing the suspense. There are comic scenes: at the chief detective's home where his wife imagines herself as a gourmet chef; at the matchmaking agency run by Blaney's ex-wife; and at the hotel where Blaney registers himself and girlfriend as Mr. and Mrs. Oscar Wilde. Frenzy is Alfred Hitchcock's second-last movie and excellent entertainment with great suspense, humour, acting and characters. Recommend.As an aside, when I checked out this movie on IMDb, I noticed Anna Massey's obituary. She was excellent in this movie and has had a full career, mainly on stage, in the years following the release of Frenzy almost 40 years ago.&nbsp;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitch's last masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the director's last great film after a period of much less successful works during the Sixties. I have seen it many times, recently acquired it in DVD and it stands among my Hitchcock's favourite films of all time: The 39 Steps, Sabotage, Rope, Dial M for Murder, Rear Window, The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956), Vertigo and North by Northwest. I first saw Frenzy when I was six or seven years old and I didn't know who Hitchcock was, and the movie surely scared the hell out of me and gave me nightmares. Then I saw it again, ten years later, during a Hitchcock retrospective in 1990, and I liked it very much once I was able to understand it within the context of Hitchcok's themes and visual style: the wrong man, the virginal victim, the charming villain, the inept police and the final twist, the close-ups to create tension, low angle shots and high angle shots, tracking shots and so on. Of course, this movie has nothing to do with the nice-looking Hollywood works he made before. Grim-faced Jon Finch isn't suave Cary Grant or lovable James Stewart, cockney Barry Foster isn't posh Robert Walker or Joseph Cotten either, and the women are also far from resembling the sophisticated and virginal heroins played by Ingrid Bergman and Grace Kelly. We are now in the streets of London and Hitch had to move with the times. We see the common London with its Coven Garden market, the pubs, narrow alleys and all working-class characters. The "hero" of the story, although he is ill-tempered and with violent outbursts he is able to gain our sympathy because he is innocent, while the real murderer manages to remain likable as well because he knows how to be charming and sometimes he is even humorous. Very clever Hitchcockian touches. Also very good is Bernard Cribbins as the bossy pub landlord. Hitch hired a handful of supporting actors, virtually unknown abroad, and that gives the movie its great working-class British character. Reading certain review filled with prudishness and the author's outrage at what he calls Hitchcock's bad taste, pornography and film decadence, it is obvious to me that this Mr. Mary Whitehouse hasn't seen many Hitchcock films: violence, repressed sexuality, the dark aspects of humanity and all the morbid things we see in "Frenzy" we have seen them before in any film going from "Notorious" to "Marnie", reaching its peak with "Psycho". But by 1972 censorship had loosened its grip a bit and it was allowing filmmakers to have a more free hand with their work. "Frenzy", after almost forty years, still looks fresh, and it remains a much better movie both in content and style than dozens of modern psycho-thrillers that have been made ever since.</fullReview>

The ride in the potato truck is both suspenseful and funny. The movie is enjoyable, but marred by nudity and a terrifying rape scene. There are lots of catch-the-serial-rapist/murderer movies that tell their story without being so graphic.

		<shortDescription>Quite a weak movie at times really.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know what it is with Hitchcock movies. As a movie watcher I of course really appreciate his movies and what his talent as a film-maker has done for movies in general. He has made some of the very movies within its genre and also some of the most influential ones. However still some of his movies are ones I just hate watching, even though in style and story they seem like the same ones as basically every other Hitchcock production.Well, even though I didn't fully hated watching "Frenzy" it also was a movie that made me cringe at times. For this movie Hitchcock returned to England and London again, after successful persuading an Hollywood career. The already aging Hitchcock made his last movies there, of which this one was the first shot movie in Britian since 1956's "The Man Who Knew Too Much" for him.We basically have all of the usual Hitchcock ingredients present in this movie, such as a story about a man on the run, some suspenseful sequences and some still experimental shots and build up sequences, for which Hitchcock became also so well known and praised in the movie making world. So basically this movie is the same as any other Hitchcock genre movie, then were did it go wrong? Well, perhaps the movie does feel a bit like it got made 2 decades too late, due to its overall style. As a black &amp; white movie, set in the '40's of '50's London this movie would had perhaps worked out as a better one.But the movie seems also to be lacking with its story. It felt as if the entire script got only finished for two-thirds and it lacked a finalizing treatment. The movie really loses its focus on its main story at times, also because the main character would often just simply disappear out of the movie for a too long time.Also the casting seems like a problem. Jon Finch just wasn't the best leading man thinkable and he lacked the right charisma for his role to make his character a likable enough one you could also cheer for. Barry Foster was still good though however and he spiced things up a bit. But still basically every actor that appears within this movie didn't really seemed like the most talented ones.What still slightly raises this movie above average is because it has some original and well executed moments in it. The movie isn't really an average thriller about a serial-killer and a man that gets wrongfully accused of those murders. The movie still has more style and class to it than any other similar genre movie. Still the movie is not without its weak parts and moments. Just not really up to par with Hitchcock's usual and earlier work.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At this time Hitchcock was aging and past his career prime. After a couple of bombs, he got back into his groove with this one. Hitchcock returned to his native London to shoot this one. He wanted the shot of the market street scene before it was gone. Hitchcock's first and only rated R movie. And he certainly takes advantage of the rating system with a controversial rape scene and some nudity. Frenzy is indeed very British with terms and slang that Americans don't hear on an everyday basis. The actors aren't Hitchcock recognizable, but they get the job done. I do wish that Rusk was developed a bit further. We really do not know his real relations to Blaney. The dialog was done well with touches of wit and British humor. I especially liked the dinner scenes. Frenzy does drag in many places. And unlike other Hitchcock films, the killer is known in this one, with the innocent in defense. For the longest time, you're skeptical on whether Hitchcock will pull this one off. But just when you thought you've seen another mediocre film, out comes an ending done brilliantly. Rusk finally got his due.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally frenzied</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally I've seen Frenzy! My 29th Hitchcock film - yes i'm a fan.In the past I've mentioned that whilst Hitchcock was often innovative he could also be clumsy. I believe Frenzy (along with Rebecca &amp; Shadow of a doubt) is probably his most assured film; though I prefer The Birds and Rear Window, this is close by.Finch &amp; Foster are excellent but it's the female roles (much like it was in The Birds) that steal the show: Barbara Leigh-Hunt, Anna Massey, Viven Merchant, Billie Whitelaw &amp; Jean Marsh are all very strong (with great support from Alec McCowen, Bernard Cribbins &amp; Clive Swift).There is much humour in the film to compensate the horror that is taking place. There are some wonderful cinematic pieces that show Hitch hadn't lost the eye, he still knew exactly what he wanted. It's a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fairly Average Throughout, But Really Comes Together In The End.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I wrote in the summary, 'Frenzy' felt fairly average throughout it for the most part. I didn't feel the suspense, the panic of a man on the run from the law, after being wrongfully accused of a series of murders to the level that you'd expect from a Hitchcock film. But in the final sequence when Finch is walking up the stairs with the tire iron, it's exciting as you don't know if he's actually going to commit a murder and go to jail when he was eventually going to be found not guilty and set free.I usually look forward to beautiful women in Hitchcocks work, and there were none in 'Frenzy'. But that's really just a minor qualm.The scenes with the detective and his wife, who cooked daring and exotic dishes, didn't quite make sense to me. I couldn't tell if Hitchcock was poking fun at the English (Yes I realise he was English). I say this because for the most part the English people that I know feel that food is better, the blander it is. Even though the dishes she had made didn't necessarily make my mouth water (although I'd definitely be willing to give them a try) the fact that he scoffed at the 'Roast Duck in a Rich Port Sauce' made him seem like a simpleton. (Or perhaps I'm just a bit of a food snob).All round 'Frenzy' doesn't compare to some of Hitchcocks other works, but all the same it has some brilliant shots, and over all works very well.8/10 (Reviewed after first viewing)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Frenzy" is a good film despite its unpleasant rape/murder scene (What was Hitchcock thinking?). It has a well-developed plot, a fair amount of suspense, some memorable set pieces, a healthy dash of humor - all the Hitchcock hallmarks. What it lacks is star power, a key element in all of Hitchcock's masterworks. I have long felt that the ensemble cast of Ken Russell's 1969 film "Women In Love" would have been perfect for 1972's "Frenzy." Consider this: Alan Bates as Richard Blaney, Oliver Reed as Robert Rusk, Glenda Jackson as Brenda Blaney and Jennie Linden as Babs. Would have been a great film, one of Hitchcock's best. Also would have been better had Henry Mancini not been fired. He scored some terrific suspense films ("Experiment In Terror," " The Night Visitor"). Oh well...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Movie, But In The End It's Just Too Simple</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Up until the last 15 minutes or so I was prepared to rate this as being near brilliant. It had been a great story. A serial killer was loose on the streets of London; one who rapes and then strangles women with his necktie - thus, he's nicknamed "The Necktie Murderer." Richard Blaney (Jon Finch) becomes the prime suspect on the basis of very strong circumstantial evidence. The only problem is that despite all this evidence he's innocent.This isn't a suspense story in the sense that it holds any secrets for us. The viewer knows full well from the start that he's not the murderer. We also find out a long way before the movie ends who the real murderer is. Blaney doesn't even really set out to find the real murderer - he just wants to stay away from the police. Even for all the lack of real suspense, though, this is a movie you keep watching to see if this innocent man is going to be railroaded for this crime. Finch was excellent in this role, as were Barry Foster as Robert Rusk and Alec McCowen as Inspector Oxford. Anna Massey as Barbara Milligan and Barbara Leigh-Hunt as Blaney's ex-wife Brenda (the last two murder victims, both of whom have clear connections with Blaney which lead to him being suspected) are also great.Alfred Hitchcock did a great job of creating a movie that holds you without being - as I said - particularly "suspenseful." There's some great use of humour - particularly the scenes in which Oxford sits down to some particularly unappetizing dinners from his wife (Vivien Merchant) and the murders of Brenda and Barbara are portrayed very differently but very effectively by Hitchcock. So, what happened in the last 15 minutes that knocked this down a couple of notches for me? Simply put, the ending was far too simple. Blaney gets convicted of the murders (as we all suspect he will be.) He's sentenced to life in prison. But then, in the space of that 15 minutes or so, he contrives to get himself hurt in prison and transferred to a hospital. The hospital looks to be pretty well guarded, but he contrives to escape pretty easily. Oxford, who has been convinced of Blaney's guilt, has a sudden epiphany moment and realizes who has really committed the murders and goes out to get him. The ending just didn't satisfy me. I would have cut that last 15 minutes out entirely and had the movie end with Blaney sitting in his prison cell, wrongly convicted. That would have been a far more appropriate ending to this story, which - after all - wasn't really about the murders, but was about the case of mistaken identity. As it was, it seemed almost as if, having built this movie brilliantly, Hitchcock suddenly decided "let's just get it over with as fast as we can." It's still a great movie for the most part, but a movie that leaves me unsatisfied can't meet the level required for brilliance. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exceptional, but be forewarned--this is NOT like the Hitchcock of old!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before watching this film, you really need to understand that this film is practically nothing like the classy and sophisticated Hitchcock films of the 40s and 50s. There is no debonair Cary Grant-like actor and the film is ultra-realistic. Because of this, the murders are among the most graphic ever filmed and the rape sequence will undoubtedly be very upsetting to many who view this film. Despite your possible preconceptions, this is NOT a Hitchcock film for the entire family and the film deservedly earned an R rating for nudity and extremely realistic violence. Do not let your kids watch this film (unless you are trying to make them into serial rapists/murderers).As mentioned above, the film is high on realism--starring actors who the average American would not recognize. I doubt they would even be recognized by most Brits, but considering I live here in sunny Florida, this is only a guess. This is one of the strengths of the film. You could not accept Cary Grant or Jimmy Stewart as the accused or especially the murderer, but the ordinary looking guys cast in the film were just fine. Also, I appreciated how the film did a pretty good job of portraying the murderer/rapist. He was NOT seen as angry or insane during much of the film, but seemed pretty normal--and with my experience working with such people (yes, unfortunately, I used to do therapy with people from the prison population), this is an excellent nod to realism. Rarely does evil appear evil to those around the victimizer--this is why these sort of people are so dangerous.The movie excels not only on realism, but also on suspense. And in some scenes, like the very grisly potato sack in the truck scene, you have both in very large doses. This is definitely NOT a film for the squeamish! Truly a modern film that shows that Hitchcock could change with the times. Too bad this was not his last film--it would have been a great way to end his long and distinguished career.By the way, if you watch this on DVD, please watch the trailer for the film. Like the one for PSYCHO and several of his other films, it's very sick and funny--with Alfred interposing himself into some of the scenes to make it look like HE might be the necktie murderer!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the first time that Hitchcock had come back to film in England since the forties - and it would be the last. Hitch's second to last film is certainly interesting, and it does show a return to form that dropped with Topaz and Torn Curtain, but it is by no means classic Hitchcock.Check out the lovely shot that follows the killer into a house, up a flight of stairs and into a room, it then tracks back down and out across the street as the killer commits his dreadful deed. Brilliant!The violence level is on a level that he had not touched since Psycho and the film is uneven at best.

		<fullReview>Frenzy was the first Hitchcock film to receive an R rating. Not to mention this is another movie recommended in "1001 movies you must see before you die", so I figured I would give it a chance. I have to admit that this movie did keep me interested and kept me going with what scene was to come next. It's about a serial "neck tie" killer who has just murdered almost a dozen women in London. When he murders a man's ex-wife, he is now the new suspect. Not only does this poor man have to convince everyone he's not the killer, he's has file's of evidence that could prove him to be the man the police are looking for.With some creative editing, you really get the feel of the film. Hitchcock is always amazing in seeing the film through an audience's eye. He kept us going and wanting to know what came next. While, this is not my favorite Hitchcock film, it's still an awesome one I would highly recommend to the Alfred Hitchcock fans! 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Through a combination of coincidence and total police incompetence an innocent man is suspected of being London's infamous "neck tie" murderer: A modern day Jack the Ripper figure.While I don't want to trot out my full school essay on Hitchcock there can't be any director more famous or responsible for more excellent films than he. Achieving the near impossible in pleasing both the public and the critics.After a series of amazing box office smash hits in the 1950's - which ended with his greatest box office success in Psycho in 1960 - he went in to decline.Mini skirts, pop music and open (rather than implied) sexuality were not his thing. The best director in the history of cinema simply stopped learning, experimenting or even observing real everyday life. Cold War potboiler Torn Curtain was a well made failure because they tried to make modern open-necked-shirt film stars play in collars and ties. Paul Newman looked like he was acting in a suit of armour! A totally miscast Julie Andrews gave off only her usual frost in a supposed love interest role!He followed it up with another Cold War film, Topaz - which had the look and feel of a career ender. By far the worst film he was ever associated with. No stars on show and plain boring. Television does him the best favour he ever had by never showing it! Here he is in the last-chance-saloon - so he plays safe and goes for the kind of product that seems a medley of all the things that made him famous in the first place. A greatest hits collection, in other words. The only problem is that he is a tired old man totally out of touch with modern England having been away so long.The London that he remembers is not the London on the 1970's. Long gone are the lone crusty pipe-smoking detective and his crew of Scotland Yard duffers. Long gone were those bustling street markets - something new has come in. They are called supermarkets!(The film also does British justice no favours at all. While miscarriages of justice have happened - what goes on here is beyond all reason and rational. The Court of Appeal would have field day with what we see here!)While it keeps you on-board throughout its 116 minutes its a sad to see Hitchcock trying to film a script that looks like it was stolen from a dustbin behind a disreputable London book publisher.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Beige Age</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I Finally got round to seeing Hitchcock's penultimate film, Frenzy (1972) last night. It happened to be on Sky when I ended the night on my brother's sofa after a curry. It's one of those films I've always had half an interest in checking out (if only to see how Hitchcock got his only 18 certificate) but had just never been motivated enough to bother.Strangely, although I wasn't that impressed, it did keep me watching til the end (which I had no intention of getting to) and I had one of those bizarre epiphanies one only gets whilst belching p_issed on a sofa at 3am. I realised the early 70's looked like another world. I can watch an early 80's film (The Long Good Friday, set in the same city a decade later, is one of my favourite films) and it will still look like a world I recognise and remember- but in 1972 everything was either brown or orange.Seriously- sofas, lampshades, carpets, cars, jackets, beards. The lot. It was like the Beige Age. And it was this rather than the grim subject matter (suspiciously sideburned Jack The Ripper type rapes and strangles his way round Covent Garden) that gave Frenzy a pretty stale kind of atmosphere. You could almost smell the relentless fags and shots of whiskey almost every character had in almost every scene! Maybe it was the performances that dated it too though- most of the parts were played by British BBC sitcom actors (Hitch really did end things a long way from Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly in that New York apartment block he built) and the almost Sun- style way the characters seemed thrilled by the excitingly racy nature of the killings was very of it's time.Sex scandals and swearing (which every actor seems to be relishing being allowed to do) were obviously popular pastimes in 70's Britain. At times, it was like watching a hyper- violent episode of Eastenders , had the occasional technical innovation (a camera pulls out of a flat, down the stairs and out into the street somehow instead of showing the second murder the audience know is going to occur inside) reminded me why I was watching it, I can't say it was anything special.Being born in '82, The only things I did recognise from my own early memories were the blue Chinese plates the detective's wife served him the dodgy French gourmet dinners on and the ubiquitous Suzie Wong "Green Woman" paintings- which a friend of my Grandmother's (she had one) once remarked they "Churn out like copies of the b_loody Daily Mirror".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock's next to last film, Frenzy, was not one of his best efforts. He went over a whole lot of ground he'd covered before and better.Jon Finch truly needed a keeper in Frenzy. He's a former Royal Air Force Pilot who's had a run of bad luck and he's walking around with one enormous chip on his shoulder. He says and does certain things and again has the rotten misfortune of being seen near the sight of one of the homicides of a serial killer. What Finch manages to do his very nicely implicate himself as the serial killer.Frenzy is a combination of a whole lot of Alfred Hitchcock chase movies like North By Northwest, Saboteur, The 39 Steps all involving wrongly accused men. None of them were ever quite as obtuse though as Jon Finch in Frenzy. Frenzy also draws from Dial M for Murder and To Catch a Thief where a sharp police official prevents a miscarriage of justice.The sharp police official is Alec McCowen who has some very nice scenes with wife Vivien Merchant who is taking a gourmet cooking class and is using hubby for a guinea pig when he's away from trying to solve the necktie murders. She may be ditzy, but her observations are quite sound.As it turns out the real murderer is quite close to home for Finch, but in the end he almost blows it for McCowen and Scotland Yard.The problem is that the real killer is in fact a serial killer who's killed quite a few women before the two that Finch was involved with. A good attorney should definitely have gotten Finch off on reasonable doubt. Best scene in Frenzy, the real killer trying to get a piece of evidence off the body of his latest victim who he's put in a potato sack and shipped with bags of other potatoes to a produce market. Hitchcock is playing with his audience, he's unmasked the killer, but you're not quite sure whether to hope he's caught or root for him to get away with it.Not the best of Hitch's later films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty sick stuff, Mr. Master of Suspense!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 70's are unhesitatingly my absolute favorite decade when it comes to horror, cult and thriller cinema. It seems that, like right from the beginning of the decade, the genre stated clear that all the love, peace and flower-power influences from the golden sixties were dead and buried forever. Suddenly all horror and thriller films became ten times grittier, raunchier, more exploitative and more violent. Heck, this sudden and massive "revolution" is even noticeable in the works of veteran and highly acclaimed directors such as Alfred Hitchcock. "Frenzy" literally bathes in a bona fide 70's ambiance, with tons of gratuitous nudity and shockingly perverse violence. The overall tone of the film is genuinely disturbing, the male characters are generally twisted and misogynic and the London filming locations are ugly and depressing. Given the vicious serial killer plot and the extreme brutality, "Frenzy" could easily be categorized as exploitation, but still Hitchcock manages to add in numerous moments of unequaled suspense and style through masterful camera angles that other directors could only dream of ever accomplishing. So, actually, "Frenzy" is one of the greatest genre outings of the entire 70's: a sick and disturbing thriller with the style and vision of a widely acknowledged cinema genius."Frenzy" also was Hitch's return to good ol' England and more particularly his birthplace London. I like to think he was very enthusiast about this, as illustrated through the beautiful opening shot - seemingly from a bird's point of view ? with the camera descending over the city and heading towards the Tower Bridge over the Thames. In the river floats the naked corpse of a strangled woman; another victim of the infamous necktie killer who's been terrorizing London for quite some time now. Subsequently the story introduces Richard Blaney, an ex-mariner with a slight drinking problem and a reputedly aggressive temper. Richard just got fired from his bar tending job and seeks contact with his ex-wife with whom he has an argument at her marriage agency office and at a public restaurant. When she's found in her office the next day, brutally raped and strangled with a necktie, Blaney is obviously wanted by the police, especially because the secretary saw him leave the office moments before the discovery of the body. Blaney hides in the apartment of a former mariner buddy and thinks of a way to prove his innocence. Meanwhile, the real necktie killer ? who's actually a friend of Richard's ? has his mind set on killing Richard's new girlfriend and let him take the blame for it. The identity of the killer is revealed rather quickly, namely at the moment of the first on screen murder. Initially this feels like an awkward choice for a whodunit thriller, but the level of suspense nevertheless remains incredibly high, for example thanks to the downright stupendous sequence where the killer realizes he left vital evidence on his last victim's body and faces severe problems to recover it. Practically every single review ever written on "Frenzy" also mentions three or four truly unique moments of cinematography that contribute a great deal to the impact of the film, so I will do the same. Contrary to the first murder, which is shown in all its uncomfortable glory, the second murder is only suggestive. But how! As soon as the apartment door closes, Hitch's camera backs off from the stairs and across the street in one extended shot. You know about the horrors happening inside the apartment, but you only see and hear unsuspecting people in the streets of London.I nearly haven't seen all of Hitchcock's films but I can already safely refer to "Frenzy" as one of his best achievements. I even rate it higher as some of his highly acclaimed 50's masterpieces like "Strangers on a Train" and "Dial M for Murder" although admittedly that might have to do with my own personal obsession with gritty and disturbing cinema. This doesn't mean, however, that the film is entirely without flaws. There are a couple of holes in the otherwise solid screenplay (courtesy of Anthony Shaffer who also penned down the magnificent "The Wicker Man") that perhaps could have been avoided if it wasn't for the fact they are typical Hitchcock trademarks (additional spoiler warning). The manhunt for the wrong culprit, for example, is such a typical Hitchcock favorite but it certainly isn't a waterproof sub plot in this case. The discovery of the body at the beginning of the film leads us to believe that the necktie killer has been active for quite while already. The police investigation, however, only seems to start after Blaney's ex-wife has been murdered and none of the previous murders is ever mentioned again. If Chief Inspector Oxford had looked for connections between Blaney and the previous victims, he undoubtedly would have come to the conclusion that there aren't any. This is also the main reason why Richard Blaney himself shouldn't have fled. I'm not sure how many murders took place before, but surely he had a closing alibi for at least a couple of them? Even defending his innocence in the case of his wife's murder would have been fairly easy, for that matter. The killer's behavior isn't exactly logical either, since he first frames Richard but nevertheless continues his murder spree when he's behind bars. Surely he realizes Richard will be released if they found another body and that would mean he could point him out as the real murderer? I don't necessarily consider these to be fundamental obstacles in the overall brilliance of "Frenzy" but they're nevertheless worth mentioning. Otherwise, great film, awesome thrills, high sleaze-factor and adequate performances from a generally unfamiliar cast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't understand how most of the comments on this film are positive. I enjoy most of Hitchcock's films, few indeed, and Frenzy is not one of them. Hitchcock throws, yet again, another one of his "man-caught- in-the -middle-of=something-he-can't-control" themes such as "North by Northwest" (which I did not enjoy) and "The 39 Steps." Frenzy has no memorable lines, and only the hallway shot is worthy of recall. Besides that, there was nothing compelling about any of the characters. It seemed to me that the detectives' wife was the only interesting person in this whole film. It could have been better, and according to the title awarded to Hitchcock as being "the master of suspense" it should have been better. Alas, it was disappointing. I recommend The Birds, Psycho, and Rope</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frenzy, which was Hitchcock's next to last picture, was one in which the critics said was better than anything he did since The Birds. Well, I say that the critics need to re-evaluate those films. I haven't seen Topaz, but Marnie and Torn Curtain IMHO are superior to Frenzy. That is not saying that Frenzy is a bad film. It is still a good film but it may be overrated when it comes to the critics. The all unknown British cast, with the exception of the villain, Barry Foster, was for the most part forgettable and unmemorable. Still a movie worth checking out, but don't be surprised if you are disappointed that it wasn't as good as you thought it would be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tired effort from Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock was years ahead of his time. His willingness to experiment with new techniques and his ability to use them successfully made him one of the greatest and most innovative directors of all time. For a filmmaker with these qualities, it is amazing to see his name in the credits for this film.`Frenzy', Hitchcock's penultimate film, is astonishingly naive in both its style and its delivery. It shows London and its citizens in the most stereotypical way imaginable and it therefore bears a strong resemblance to some of the lesser British thrillers of the forties and fifties. As a result, Hitchcock has made a film that it is years BEHIND it's time, it's style being very similar to that of `Blackmail' which he made over forty years earlier. Perhaps the primary fault with this film is that it is clearly full of itself purely because of who it's director is. This is made obvious by the opening credits where Hitchcock's name seems to be up on the screen for an eternity.After the disappointments of `Torn Curtain' and `Topaz', `Frenzy' was hailed as a spectacular return to form for Hitchcock. What would be closer to the truth would be to say that this film is a sad relapse to the style of his earliest films and looks totally out of place when set in the early seventies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>...that's a shame</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know, it's really too bad that the Hitch made this film, because otherwise he would have had a spotless filmography, when he passed on. I find that Frenzy is just a little too violent and sick for me. Although, as a teen, I am raised in a society full of violence and mayhem, this film is over the top. The scenes which contain the murders are really harsh and very strangely filmed. It's not Hitchcock made a terrible film, it's just that it's not as brilliant as the rest. To me, It's like a letdown. I felt the same way when Quentin Tarantino made Jackie Brown. It wasn't awful or even unwatchable, but Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs are so smart and well-written.Frenzy isn't the worst film of all time, but It's the only film that Hitch made that I didn't more than once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, but not a classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thought I had after watching the movie was how dated it seemed. I could have almost believed this move was made in the '50's rather than the early '70's. Some of the humor was good as it popped up sometimes in unexpected places. I found some of the plot points to kind of stretch credibility. Could a convicted murderer walk out of a prision hospital, hop in a car, and drive away. I don't think so. The main plot of the movie was compelling, a somewhat unlikeable man's ex-wife is killed, and he was seen leaving the scene, as he tries to figure out the crime, he continues to make himself look more guilty. There is suspense, and I think everyone will cringe a little as Blaney becomes more deeply tangled in the murders, that as we the viewer know, he has nothing to do with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frenzy (1972) *** (out of 4) Alfred Hitchcock's thriller about a serial killer strangling women but the police are after the wrong guy (Jon Finch). This was my second time seeing this film and I didn't care for it as much this time but it was still a solid thriller with a few magic touches from the director. I've said it before but I feel Hitchcock lost a lot after Psycho but this film, while flawed, manages to have a few classic moments including the infamous potato sack scene and the first rape/murder sequence, which manages to be quite suspenseful. Finch is terrific in his role as is Alec McCowen as the inspector who keeps getting junk to eat. Barry Foster steals the show as the psychopath. Overall, the film manages to worth well but it's a little too choppy for its own good and coming from Hitchcock a good thriller just isn't good enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hitchcock returns to his roots of the wrongly accused man and the "jack the Riper" element. Back on the streets of London, a wrongly accused man is framed for a murder. A dark and somewhat hard to swallow movie, even for a 1972 audience, there are some moments that are hard to watch.Still, Hitchcock remains loyal toward the close of his life to return to the country where he began with silent pictures.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An innocent Londoner (Finch) is wrongly accused of being the infamous neck tie murderer. Intriguing and stylish from beginning to end. This was Hitchcock's second to last film, and is definitely one of his stronger points towards the end of his career, but probably one of his lesser known ones.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Half-Hitch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not for the first time and certainly far from the last it appears that I've been watching a different film than the one watched by the majority of those people who have chosen to comment here. I'm not at all sure that mass hypnosis is entirely innocent and I'd certainly want to take a long, hard look at any alibis offered, after all when susceptible film-goers are told time and time again that Hitchcock is the greatest thing since perfs on the side of the celluloid then eventually they get to think there may be something in it. Frenzy is nothing more - and certainly less - than a down-market version of North By North West with a half-hearted attempt at a variation. In NBNT there was never a hint that Cary Grant was anything other than a good guy in the wrong place at the wrong time whilst Frenzy squanders around two reels painting Jon Finch as the serial killer on a streak. We're shown the latest victim, told it's one of several in which the female victims are strangled with a necktie, and then treated to what amounts to a profile of the killer. This having been done in the first minutes we're then introduced to Finch and see with our own eyes how he fits the profile so well that it can't possibly be him. If we then had to wait for around seven or eight reels before the real killer stood up this might have been a passable time-waster but no, almost at once Barry Foster is revealed as the heavy so now we have an innocent man on the run and, alas, running out of steam. The source material was a novel by Anthony La Bern who also wrote It Always Rains On Sunday and Anthony Schaffer's screenplay fails to bring it to life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not up to par</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like many, I love a good Hitchcock flick. Unfortunately, I've not seen all his works, namely the less popular and earliest works. My favorite is Rope, however which tends to fall into the former category.Frenzy was a disappointment. It's as though the story wasn't strong enough and Hitchcock used it as an opportunity to play with the camera (such as that famous long backwards camera shot - the one that that 'imperceptible' cut appears in; I guess that's why by barely glancing at the screen while doing a crossword puzzle I saw it easily, not knowing about it previously).I digress, however. The long silences that I've come to love Hitchcock for were just a bit too long this time around. The plot took far too long to establish. Finally, though I've never seen a strangled corpse, the effect was too corny for even the silliest of movies.The ending came somewhat suddenly considering how long it took to get the story running. Thus, I was a bit perturbed that I watched the entire thing expecting a bit more for my time.As poor as my comments are, I still think that a true fan should watch it as a balance to the famous director's career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Second-rate Hitchcock.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcock's three last films share a common flaw: the ending is anticlimactic and the film is wrapped up too quickly. But "Frenzy" has other weaknesses, too: the performances are very mediocre (you can barely identify with the innocent hero) and the script is pretty ordinary, with no real surprises. At least the movie is flawlessly directed by Hitchcock and contains a few amazing scenes - the much-talked-about sequence where the camera backs away from the scene of a murder is the most impressive. Unfortunately, the weak script and acting make this Hitchcock film a second-rate one.</fullReview>

Even though this was a dark film, I found it to be highly comical on Mr. Barry's part. And I loved the at home meal scenes with the wife.

		<shortDescription>Oranges and Lemons and Potatoes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This narrative concerns a former Royal Airforce Officer who, with the assistance of his wife, is planning to establish an English-themed pub in Paris. On the eve of their departure he bumps into a former officer colleague and the latter's girlfriend and offers them a job running the venture. However the man in question is currently suspected of being the perpetrator of a series of strangulations of women. Since the ports are being watched, the entrepreneur rescinds his offer and the man and his girlfriend melt back into the Central London crowd.The representative of the Metropolitan Police who is directing this search is portrayed largely in a cognate gastronomic scenario of the French-themed kitchen in a domestic London setting. After submitting to a croissant and coffee at home, he blatantly propels his knife and fork through multiple eggs and bacon at his desk, suggesting that his efficiency as an officer of law depends more on his reliance on the cultural traditions of his country than on the arbitrary culinary whims of his wife. Inspector Oxford, as he is called, is not so self-infatuated to think that after a man has accused himself of compromise, there is nothing left to go on with.Whereas the RAF officer was a true friend to the man, offering him a new start, the Villain, to whom he now applies, is the false friend. The Villain's offer of asylum is but the preliminary to the dock and a life sentence. The Villain, in a third gastronomic setting, is portrayed as a wholesaler of fruit and vegetables during the last days of Covent Garden's dedicated use as such. The Villain reflects in his character the contradictions of the market itself. The space is limited, the refrigeration inadequate, unpropitious conditions not only for a vegetable market but also for the disposal of corpses, the consequence of the Villain's idiosyncratic ideas of associating with women. Whereas the Inspector's wife is a minor polluter, envenoming her marriage with cackhanded renderings of French cuisine, the Villain is an environmental pest compromising the regeneration of the Thames itself with a jettisoned corpse.The Villain reaches a climactic point in the history of his criminality when, in the back of a lorry, he wrestles both with his stock in trade, potatoes, and an object connected with his subterranean life, the body of his victim. We can speculate that the reason the potatoes are returning to the farm is that chemical fertilisers and pesticides have produced a glut that the market cannot sustain, or that the taste of London consumers is beginning to move through the spectrum of 'meat and two veg' towards alternatives. As the potatoes and then the corpse spill onto the road, both the produce and the market seem compromised. The Villain still has his persona intact. However when quasi-mystical 'potato-dust' is detected on his person he is revealed a something other than the plausible wholesaler he portrays.The association of criminality with old-fashioned trade practices is an easy one to make, especially at a time when economic irrationalism is treated as a moral crime. Yet it is a fault either of the book or the film that sticks in the craw and I would prefer to decline it, or even, like Inspector Oxford, surreptitiously return it to the soup tureen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That Girl in the Sack</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.I find most of Hitchcock's films badly dated. The acting is generally poor, and the notions of suspense unengaging. Hitchcock's importance to me is 1) that he successfully conveys a coherent vision, 2) (as with Kubric) the narrative isn't very important, merely an excuse for visual communication 3) in creating those visions, he has a clever eye.That last one makes some of his work pretty exhilarating. That's even though all his effects are part of the common vocabulary now, and have been vastly exceeded because of further experimentation. More importantly, current camera technology makes his camera seem tired, generally unaminated. However, `Rear Window' is still great because of how he created his world to accommodate the camera.And this film is okay because it has some impressive sequences. The `goodbye Babs' and potato truck scenes show superb timing and vision, and working as they did in those days they could have only been imaged thus beforehand.I wonder why IMDB doesn't make an effort to include the body doubles in the cast list. In this case, they did as much acting as the stars. (The DVD's documentary has a brief shot of Bab's double.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frenzy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the penultimate film from the master of suspense, Golden Globe nominated director Sir Alfred Hitchcock, and it was a good return to his roots as he directed this film in Britain. Basically London has a raping and strangling serial killer on the loose, and the police have no clues to find a prime suspect, only that the murderer uses a neck tie each time. Bartender Richard Ian Blaney (Jon Finch) is fired from the Global Public House by manager Felix Forsythe (Bernard Cribbins), and in his bad mood he goes to see ex-wife Brenda Margaret Blaney (Barbara Leigh-Hunt) who owns a successful marriage agency. After an argument, overheard by secretary Monica Barling (Jean Marsh), she invites him to dinner in a fancy restaurant, but soon after this plan is changed when Richard's friend Robert 'Bob' Rusk (Barry Foster) visits Brenda himself, rapes her and strangles her with his neck tie. Richard is seen leaving the Brenda's agency by Miss Barling, and she obviously finds her boss's corpse and calls New Scotland Yard to search for Richard, who is with his girlfriend Babs Milligan (Anna Massey) unaware he is now prime suspect. Bob kills Babs, framing Richard, who is arrested and sentenced to life imprisonment, but Chief Inspector Oxford (Alec McCowen) in charge of he investigation is not completely sure Richard is the right man. Bob meanwhile is getting away with another murder, but in a both black and funny moment he has to return to the body when he realises she grabbed his coat pin, incriminating evidence, and he gets in the back of the potato van with a foot going in his face, dust going all over his suit, and the body falling onto the road. Richard meanwhile has planned his escape, by throwing himself down the stairs to end up in hospital, and he and one or two other convicts drug the guard, he dresses up as a doctor and walks out a free man, and he is off to kill the true killer. After suffering another dreadful meal by Mrs. Oxford (Vivien Merchant), the Inspector concludes with Sergeant Spearman (A Clockwork Orange's Michael Bates) that Bob is the real serial killer, and after witnessing Richard beating to death an already dead victim, Bob does show his face and his tie being missing closes the case. Also starring Billie Whitelaw as Hetty Porter, Jimmy Gardner as Hotel Porter, Rita Webb as Mrs. Rusk, Keeping Up Appearances' Clive Swift as Johnny Porter, and Hitchcock's cameo is the Spectator with Bowler Hat at Opening Rally. With the usual mix of knowing the killer and seeing how he/she is going to be caught, bodies popping up where you may not expect them, slow tracking shots, and some extra added dark humour in places, this is a really likable thriller. It was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama, Best Original Score for Ron Goodwin and Best Screenplay for Anthony Shaffer (Sleuth). Sir Alfred Hitchcock was number 75 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Very good!</fullReview>
