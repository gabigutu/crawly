		<shortDescription>Blow Up in the Key of Sound.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>He's supposed to be the leading authority in freelance surveillance, but from the start there are hints that while he's good, he's also careless. While his apartment is locked, his landlord leaves him a Happy Birthday present. His mistress, Amy (Teri Garr in a small role) tells him she saw him standing in the staircase for an entire hour. He invites a rival co-worker to his office (which seems to be a warehouse) with several other people and carelessly allows the man to record his own conversation by means of what looks to be an innocuous pen which wouldn't be out of place in any James Bond movie. And his liaison with a call girl he meets at that party results in her stealing the tapes of a conversation he has recorded and that has lately been the focus of his obsession.This is Harry Caul, a loner who is a little too glum to be good company and takes his work seriously. Maybe too seriously -- which eventually proves to be his downfall. The fact that his own co-worker Stan (John Cazale) leaves him to go work for a rival agency, Moran, only serves to prove Harry is really someone who is so much a loner he drives anyone away from him. He can't seem to have any form of relationship -- it's only time when Amy will also leave him as she seems somewhat frustrated by this wall of privacy he's built around himself. His entire life revolves around secrecy, and he only is able to live vicariously throughout others, even if he himself feels guilty about it and would deny it because to top it all, he has a strong religious streak, and discloses under confession that he was witness of a surveillance gone wrong and which resulted in the deaths of three people. Now this assignment has him worried: he's listened to a conversation between a man and a woman and is afraid the woman's husband may try to kill them both.But is this what he's heard, or has been misinterpreted due to the limitations and distortions of sound? Like 1966's BLOW UP, which dealt with what the human eye is capable of discerning through the mechanism of a camera and what happens when one zooms in, THE CONVERSATION deals with the manipulation of sound to make out a sentence that lies just underneath the sounds of the city. But while that elusive sentence comes through -- "he's kill us if he had the chance" -- what Harry fails to catch is the intonation itself, which would have radically altered his deduction and completely shifted his attention. Like the definition of the word "caul", Harry is unable to see (or hear) the reality, or that he's been a victim of his own occupation by the end of the film; by making himself visible to whom he thinks was in danger, he's now made himself the target of surveillance by the same agency who employed him as he receives that disturbing call at the end: "We'll be listening to you." Whether it be real or not, one shot implies it is: a panning shot to the right, then to the left, from an elevated angle, showing us the destruction of Harry's apartment through his own hands as he has fruitlessly tries to debug his place. It's the tell-tale pan of a surveillance camera, which he has failed to discover. Again.This is most definitely not an action-packed thriller, but one that is totally cerebral -- it forces you to pay attention, to listen, to heighten your senses and discover for yourself what Harry is trying to find even when we know he will be wrong all along. Even as he seems to teeter over madness near the end as his grisly discovery of blood pouring out of a toilet bowl at the Jack Tarr Hotel indicates, we still wonder if he's actually seeing this, or not. Like BLOW UP, this is one of those mysteries that doesn't look to get solved cleanly, but by being inconclusive, lingers in the mind long after the credits have rolled, and in the process, leaves one man destroyed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Conversation' sadly doesn't get mentioned as much as Coppola's other (more flamboyant) seventies movies ('The Godfather' parts one and two, 'Apocalypse Now'), even though it as good as, if not better than the aforementioned. In fact if someone argued that this was his greatest achievement as a director, I would be hard pressed to disagree.'The Conversation' bears many similarities to Antonioni's 'Blowup', another superb movie that requires multiple viewings to really appreciate. Both movies are very much of their time, and therefore 'The Conversation' is fuelled by the keywords of the decade it was made in - paranoia and deceit. The other main difference between the two movies it that 'The Conversation' is not only a head trip but also a taut and suspenseful thriller. Post Simpson/Bruckheimer audiences may not have the attention spans to appreciate it, but that is their failing, not this movie's.Gene Hackman gives one of the finest performances of his career here as the complex and troubled surveillance expert Harry Caul, one that is possibly rivaled only by his too little seen gem 'Scarecrow'. And the supporting cast is first rate, and includes the late John Cazale, a favourite of Coppola's, Harrison Ford, Frederick Forrest, Cindy Williams, Teri Garr, and (an uncredited) Robert Duvall. Last but not least a superb turn from the underrated Allen Garfield, an actor who has appeared in many odd movies, from 'Get To Know Your Rabbit' to 'Destiny Turns On The Radio'. He is dynamite here, in a role originally intended for the legendary Timothy Carey, as a pushy rival bugging expert.'The Conversation' is hypnotic, multi-layered and haunting. See it whatever you do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Conversation" is a really great movie. I was quite surprised when I saw it. Not at how good it was, but how few people have seen it or heard of it. This is a classic suspense thriller, and a terrifying psychological horror film! From the opening credits, I, like the characters, was unsure of where I was going, or what the opening conversation (which is what the entire film is built around) might lead to. It seemed so unusually powerful, despite its masterfully simplistic execution. There is no overkill or excess in this film, nor is it under written or underplayed. It's just perfect! And I was even more surprised at how little was shown, and how much it could engross or frighten the hell out of me! My heart was racing, even though there was little action! This is the kind of film Alfred Hitchcock would have been proud to direct. The direction went to another master instead, Francis Ford Coppola. I felt ahead of the movie at its opening credits. But then, it blasted me and got miles ahead of me. It is an attack on our psyche and our fear, and it's amazing how, like the film itself, the conversation in the film that seemed so small and irrational could lead to something as big as it did!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everyone's Talking at Me.....I Think I Hear Every Word They Say.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enigmatic, frustrating, confusing, intelligent and overall extremely brilliant work by writer/director Francis Ford Coppola (Oscar-nominated for his screenplay) has surveillance expert Gene Hackman recording a conversation between Cindy Williams and Frederic Forrest. It immediately appears that the duo are having an affair behind Williams' very wealthy husband's (a cameo by Robert Duvall) back. However nothing is quite as cut and dry as it seems. Hackman, a devout Catholic, has a bout of conscience as he worries that Duvall might have deviant plans for his wife and her apparent lover. Apparently Hackman's work had meant the lives of some he had spied on many years earlier in New York and he is shown as a quiet man who has some loud personal demons within his soul. The suspense builds when Hackman is followed by Duvall's shady employee (Harrison Ford) and eventually the heat rises to a boil as all the very loose ends are tied together in a wickedly twisted final act. "The Conversation" was Coppola's other film from 1974 (remember Best Picture Oscar winner "The Godfather, Part II"?). With this movie, Coppola created arguably the two best films of that dominant cinematic campaign (of course Roman Polanski's "Chinatown" would have something to say about that). Hackman delivers a deceptively difficult and dark performance as a man who seems to be self-destructing slowly on the inside out. By the end "The Conversation" is a thought-provoking product that will chill you to the bone with its cold elements. 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paranoia and alienation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Conversation is a quiet film that slowly builds on the central theme of paranoia. Gene Hackman is hired to record a conversation between two people. As Hackman pieces the dialouge together, we get to hear more and more of what's being said. Only thing is, we don't know exactly what is being referred to. Hackman seems to have an idea, as does the audience. As he starts to realize what's at stake, Hackman starts to develop a feeling of regret and refuses to hand over the tapes to the "director." Along the way, we see just how alone Gene Hackman's character is. His only solace in life is playing the saxaphone along with jazz records. He values his privacy and has trouble connecting with people, even members of his own team. Francis Ford Coppola keeps the story moving and lets it build naturally. He gives us glimpses into Hackman's mind as he "thinks" he knows what's going to happen to the people he recorded. The only way to see what happens in the end is to watch this quiet masterpiece. To tell about the ending would ruin the fun, not to mention the suspence of this understated thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Privacy and Responsibility - A Conflicting Moral Choice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Francis Ford Coppola's 1974 classic is an ingenious, meticulous examination into the nature of voyeurism, as well as a harsh criticism of the deceitful morality of privacy. At its basic form, however, The Conversation is a film that carefully follows a man who is curiously trapped within his own secretive existence of solitude. Harry Caul is nothing more than an observer; we do not witness any noticeable personal interests outside of his profession, aside from his occasional musical performances. But notice how Harry is always playing along to another band (contrast this to the solo at the ending), and never performs for an audience. There is no audience for Harry, a man who is entirely absorbed within his occupation, and allows his neurotic obsession to control his personal relationships. Harry treats himself like he treats his clients, he divulges no personal information, displays no easily distinguishable characteristics, and remains blissful in his peaceful state of ignorance. Whenever he is not entirely engulfed within his work, Harry disappears into his apartment, satisfied with his general indifference towards any truly beneficial, active existence. Harry has thoroughly convinced himself that it is inappropriate to become involved in his client's affairs. After all, Harry's job is not to take responsibility for himself, or to investigate any potential consequences resulting from his surveillance intrusions. Harry's job is to take orders, display no personal interest in the content of his recordings, and deliver the results completely unconcerned for anyone's potential safety or security. It is only after Harry accepts his need to take responsibility that he is able to take interest in his client's mysterious, dangerous affairs.As Harry slowly drags himself into the precarious business of strangers, the film's intentions become increasingly suspenseful and perplexing. Coppola maintains his deliberately methodical pace throughout the entire film; it is only through our imagination that we are capable of creating and perpetuating such a consistently fascinating atmosphere surrounded by a cloud of tension and mystique. The Assistant Director never physically carries himself as an intimidating antagonist; it is through the complexity of the film's plot and through the continual uncertain environment that we are able to associate this element with his character. Every person that carries himself in a convincingly dubious manner immediately becomes a potential suspect. Harry becomes compulsively obsessed with the fate of his client's targets, completely submerging himself into the substance of the recordings, looking for any potential details that might assist him in solving the mystery. Harry's investigation quickly becomes our task as well, as we begin to subconsciously observe and scrutinize each character involved. The beauty of Coppola's film is the fact that it makes its point by using the audience as proof of the inherent devious nature of privacy. The movie transports us into Harry's world, as we become infatuated with the secretive plot unfolding before us, and we desperately search for clues into the lives of the film's characters. Of course, after intense investigation, Harry ultimately comes to realize that he has violated all of the principles that he had once stood proudly for. Whether or not Harry ended up better off by becoming involved in the dealings of others is a completely subjective matter, but it is a crucial question that the viewer must ask him/herself.The ending of the film is what interested me the most about The Conversation. The consequences of Harry's obsession become manifest through the destruction of his own privacy, his property and even his faith. Was Harry morally appropriate when he decided to intervene into the relationship and associations of complete strangers? Did Harry do the right thing by taking responsibility for his actions, and reaching out to help another in desperate need? These are the most important questions that the film ultimately asks its audience. The final shots of Harry perfectly capture the ambiguous mood of the film's finale. Harry is sitting alone in his stripped down apartment looking exhausted, humiliated, and defeated. But if you look closely you will realize that he is indeed playing the saxophone to his own beat, for a change. At what costs do we accept the need for our responsibility to others?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You Have To See This More Than Once</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those films I'm glad I gave a second chance because it got much better, and has continued getting better with each viewing (I've now seen it four times).I know a few other people who watch this and ask, "What's the big deal?" Well, do what I did and give it another chance. Here's a tip: put on the English subtitles. It helps understand what is going on, as the taped conversations are often difficult to discern. Then, you might discover what I did: a fascinating character study, one that did not bore me as it had on the first viewing.It's the study of a paranoid loner who is suffering a guilty conscience over the work he has done over the years, and what tragic consequences could happen with the latest project he's involved with. Without giving anything away, the loner's fears are realized in a shocking ending, but not in the way he imagined.Gene Hackman, as always, does a super job of acting. He dominates the film as the main character, "Harry Caul." The topic matter - high-tech surveillance - was intriguing, too. After watching this film, I wondered what kind of surveillance tools are available now, 30 years after this film was made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Movie About Poor Communications Skills</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Conversation is a stark look into the modern art of surveillance and its affect on one of its practitioners. Harry Caul (Hackman) is at the top of his business, but he's disturbed. Highly paranoiac, he is troubled by bad things that happened to some innocent people as a result of a prior surveillance job. Now he's afraid it's happening again....The Conversation could not be more antithetical of the current movie making style. Stark, claustrophobic, unsexy, slow-paced, and with almost no soundtrack, it slowly builds to its dramatic noirish denouement.A real treat, and as an added attraction the actors include a young Cindy Williams, Terri Garr, John Cazale, and Harrison Ford. Worth the rental unless anything outside of the MTV mould causes agitation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easily the top Suspense Film of all time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harry Caul: `I'm not afraid of death, but I am afraid of murder.'Two weeks ago I wrote a review of `The Silence of the Lambs' I said I thought that it was one of the greatest suspense films of all time. Well Francis Ford Coppola's ingenious and frightening film isn't one of the best suspense films of all time; it simply is the greatest suspense film of all time. It follows professional ease dropper Harry Caul's job on a conversation that goes way beyond anything that he ever could expect. This film is truly something else in its own right. Coppola is such a master, such a brilliant mind. This film is him at his best, after `The Godfather' and before part two. He makes this film so brilliantly and so knowing of what emotions the audience will feel, every pause and every silence is direct and timed. The film is completely intentional. It is constructed off of films like Michelangelo Antonioni's `Blow-up' or most Hitchcock films. Coppola takes these aspects brought by most of the great filmmakers and takes them to a whole new level of personal texture. He puts so much more into it. Making him (I can't say this enough) one of the greatest filmmakers of all time, and most misunderstood. His films are like pie, they look good, they taste good, heck they even smell good, but you never really know what they are made of. All his films are deeper then they seem, it takes a true (TRUE!) film lover to respect what influences the man has made. Look at it like this, the greatest Hollywood film of all time, `The Godfather,' the greatest War film of all time `Apocalypse Now,' The greatest Sequel of all time `The Godfather Part II,' and the greatest Independent/Suspense film of all time `The Conversation.' What else is there to conquer? Science Fiction? His next film `Megalopolis' will tackle that void. Who cares about his slips, he has made some of the greatest films of all time.In this film his talent is at its best with an involving, brilliantly executed screenplay and flawless direction. He makes cookies into Danish, if any other man ever made this film it would be good no doubt, but the greatest suspense film of all time? I think not. Harry Caul's (Hackman) character is so deep and so magnified. He is such a character's character; this film is a pure and simple character study. Not to mention the flawless cinematography and music. The little jazz piano riff fits the film perfectly and the cinematography is so mechanical like a piece of surveillance equipment. The dialogue in the first few minutes is so perfectly written it makes the viewer cringe wanting to know what it is the couple is saying so when we find out it is more of a gift. The conversation that the film is based on is set up so well all threw out the film, the more we hear the more we think, it is repetition at its perfection. The repetition is a true part of the film, the more the viewer hears something they ask themselves why am I hearing this again, what does it mean? Then the conversation tears at the viewer until they fall apart, just like Harry. The viewer understands his motivations, they see his reasons. We are set up and moved around this maze of murder and mayhem, we are Harry (J). This is just one of many brilliant aspects of the film. It never dives down or falls off it always stays paranoid like the main character. `The Conversation' is a haunting and well constructed masterpiece that molds great acting with brilliant storytelling. This is what films in this day and age should try to do. But they won't, they never will, and `The Conversation' will hold its ground as the most thoughtful and suspenseful film of all time.Mark: He'd kill us if he got the chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Subtle Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To me The Conversation is one of most underrated movies ever. The movie carries on so quietly throughout that the suspense of the movie keeps on building up to one of the best endings in movie history.The directing of this film was among one of the best I have ever seen. Coppola is able to craft his way through another one of his classics. The movie is just perfectly edited together and is so gripping throughout. His directing really takes the audiene to another world that most to almost all of us do not know about. That world is the world of security surveillance and spies. This though is not an ordinary spy movie, it is a very realistic psychological portrayal and the affects of knowing the real truth. Instead of this movie becoming a complete flop it becomes better and better as it carries on. Along with the cinematography and music he makes the audience feel how remote and controlled our society is. Coppola did not just show it he gave you the actual feeling of it. Coppola deserves much of the credit for this.The writing was very good too. Once again Coppola uses his writing to keep the audience very much engaged into the movie. The writing in this movie ranks up their with his other screenplays such as The Godfather series, Apocalypse Now and Patton.The acting was a bit of surprise to me. It was better than I expected. This film convinced me that Gene Hackman is prime talent. He is not just a man who plays the man always involved in a shouting match but in fact he is a versatile actor who has really limited himself rather than his abilities limiting him. He was perfect for this movie. The supporting cast was great as well. Robert Duvall who always gives the best cameos was good in here too. Harrison Ford who I wish actually had some more screen time was very convincing as a manipulative high ranking executive.The ending in this movie to me is one of the best ever. It shows how or fears can consume us and alter our live. It displays how if our fears consume us we lose the feeling of life itself. That is at least my take of it. This is Coppola's hidden masterpiece that should be seen by all. It will definitely make you think.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Performance... (possible plot spoilers... you decide)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film because of all the recommendations people had made about it and also because of Francis Ford Coppola and Gene Hackman. The thing that marks this film out from other thrillers is the level of realism in it. 'Harry Caul', Gene Hackman's character, makes for a complex hero. He's emotionally disciplined and brilliant at what he does. He's a man who eavesdrops on others for a living yet values his own privacy to a self-stifling fault. He also lives with regrets. As the film progresses the plot almost takes a backseat to the closely guarded world of Harry, who is impressively brought to life by Gene Hackman. It's perhaps the kind of role we rarely see him in and yet he gives one of his best ever celluloid performances and an understated one at that. The film also makes great use of sound as a tension-creating device. We, the viewer are invited to eavesdrop with Harry and his assistant 'Stan' (played wonderfully by John Cazale - The Godfather, The Deer Hunter), and participate in the films central theme. This device is effective in gaining sympathy as when Harry is eventually faced with a dilemma, his problem is one the viewers can identify with. Yet he isn't the gung-ho grit-bearer that we wish him to be. He crumbles when faced the truth he reluctantly seeks and he takes money from the very people that he suspects of a possible murder. All these traits make him a frustrating man to side with. A lot of credit has to be given to Francis Ford Coppola for the film's suitably subtle pace. This isn't a car-chase type of movie so don't expect 'The French Connection'. But if you want a plausible plot and a challenging, vulnerable performance by Gene Hackman then see this. One of the best thrillers I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coppola's best film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ingenious and mesmerizing little art film from Francis Ford Coppola, just off "The Godfather Part II" and doing astounding, fluid work. Gene Hackman gives a superbly controlled performance as a wire-tapper who gets too involved in one of his cases, leaving him in the center of a macabre swirl of events. One of those quiet movies that fans of today's blockbusters probably won't appreciate; it tells us quite a lot about the main character without actually saying much at all, so assured are the visuals. It ends on a chilling note that leaves the protagonist alienated from his life, but Coppola is careful never to alienate his audience. It's a winner. ***1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh, the Boredom! Torture Worthy of Amnesty International Intervention!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Conversation" is the single most boring movie, out of thousands, that I have ever seen.Critics and fans praise it as a classic. These critics and fans should be arrested, booked, and sentenced.I would like to stick a pin in the fans of this movie, to see if their blood is green.There needs to be a new word to identify the level of boredom this movie induces. I had flashbacks of something I hadn't thought of in years: being a small child, sitting in a class I hated, taught by an inept oaf, on a beautiful spring day, my eyes glued to the clock, waiting for each tick of its second hand, straining to will that hand to move, and fearing that time had somehow thickened, like molasses, and slowed, and would never move again.I had to watch this movie for a writing assignment. Had I been able to, not only would I have stopped watching it after thirty minutes, no matter the rave reviews, I would have performed exorcising ablutions on the DVD player.I must immediately watch a good movie -- to get back on the horse once again, as it were. Otherwise, I might never be able to watch another movie again.My Deity! The pretension, the acting class exercises, the shallow take on human nature, the excruciating slowness of the camera movies, the cheapness and phoniness of the dishonest, tarted-up, "surprise" rip-off ending, the utter implausibility, the complete refusal to provide anything so simple as a compelling plot or even one bit of action.Russian playwright Anton Chekhov famously said that you don't introduce a gun in act one if you aren't ready to use it by act three. The application of that famous quote to "The Conversation"? Had Chekhov lived to see this movie, he might have shot the filmmaker. And I'd testify in Chekhov's defense.No, not really. The Chekhovian point is that the basic elements of this movie: an emotionally frozen surveillance man, the couple he's spying on, an older, powerful man interested in the couple -- could have been used to make a brilliant movie. In fact, they were used to make a brilliant movie: Florian Henckel von Donnersmark's "The Lives of Others." "The Conversation" isn't a movie; it's a diabolical form of torture. Its star, Gene Hackman, gives better performances as the voice-over for Lowe's Hardware Stores commercials.That critics and fans have been touting this overrated, self-serious, naked emperor for the past thirty plus years is a mark of shame to the film community, far outstripping previous scandals from the Fatty Arbuckle trial to the latest African adoption. This movie, much more than "Celebrity Jeopardy" skits on "Saturday Night Live," is a damning indictment of some celebrities' IQs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Conversation sees an almost young Gene Hackman play Harry Caul, an unlikable, neurotic surveillance technician whose paranoid tendencies and religious beliefs eventually overpower him as his work contributes to the death of a seemingly innocent cheated husband, played by Robert Duvall.I seem to have a problem with old, or old-ish films. Judging from the high ranking in the IMDb top 250, the cast, the director, and even the action movie-esquire front cover, I was tricked into believing that I would be watching an entertaining and maybe even an exciting film. Unfortunately, I wasn't.The Conversation appears to be widely regarded as a "psychological thriller" that demands your full attention, and judging from some reviews, a second viewing to pick up everything and understand what's going on, but if you're honest, that just means that it is dull and uneventful the first time round. You switch it on, and you're not entirely sure what's going on, and two hours later, when you switch it off, you're even more confused. While this is a formula that often works (David Lynch), and deals with an interesting moral dilemma, I find that in this case it falls down. I don't want to watch it again, ever, and I think it's because of the characters.While Hackman puts in a very good if somewhat understated performance, his character is so boring that I found I didn't care at the end as he is outsmarted and eventually falls apart. At least Harrison Ford, who isn't really in it for long and is on the opposite team, has a sort of energy to him, a brief injection of life into an otherwise flat film.Interesting but not entertaining. But I did like that little piano bit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simple</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coppola is a cerebral filmmaker hampered by his heritage in Italian storytelling. The clash of his notions of introspection and layering with the Latin focus on character has resulted in some rather complex constructions. It is my impression that we marvel more at the complexities attempted in 'Godfather' and 'Apocalypse' than how well they were managed.Here is a project that elegantly combines the two notions in a simple way and as a result -- for probably the only time -- Coppola completely surrounds and masters the ideas.This is a voyeuristic artifact about a voyeuristic artifact. We suppose we know what we are doing in casually sitting down to spy on Hackman's character. We suppose we know what is to happen, just as he supposes, both of us relying on our history. In our case, it is a history of films.All films are about other films. The dumb ones follow, the smarter ones comment and tweak and sometimes contradict, as here. And as with Caul, we are surprised to have our expectations turned inside out without completely understanding why.This was back when Hackman actually tried. I wish Coppola still did. Oh well, we have his kids. Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS.Coppola made this, a personal movie, after the rip-roaring commercial and critical success of "The Godfather." And it's a good one. Whereas "The Godfather" was a splashy violent well-done gangster movie dealing with power and sex, and persuading us to sympathize with a family at least as murderous as that in "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre," this one has to do with something else entirely. It's not about that old theme of illusion vs. reality. Nobody plays, say, Jack the Ripper in a stage play and then begins to butcher women on the streets. It has to do, rather, with the interpretation of reality (whatever that is), which is an issue of a different color.Briefly, Harry Caul (Hackman) is hired by "the director," who seems to be a rich and powerful executive, to spy on a young woman and the guy she's seeing (Cindy Williams and Frederick Forrest). He's the best surveillance technician on the West Coast and he does an ace job of capturing them on film and audiotape while they wander around Union Square in downtown San Francisco. Harry puts the pieces together and suspects the Director plans to murder them. Well, this isn't Harry's first time at bat here. Back in New York, doing his usual dispassionately expert job of spying, he was responsible for the deaths of a man, his wife, and his child, the incident that drove him to The City. He's a very secretive guy, Harry, and minds his own business, but he's not about to let THAT happen again. When he tried to withhold his tapes from The Director, the tapes are stolen. And when he tries to interfere further a murder does in fact take place. But Harry had it backwards. He interpreted everything on his tapes as signs that the young couple were in danger from The Director, whereas in fact the couple had been planning to murder him for the inheritance, and they succeed too.You can never truly be sure that your interpretations of what's going on are the correct ones because, as Kant argued, our interpretations are limited by our perceptual apparatus, just as Harry's interpretations were limited to what he could learn from four unidirectional microphones, a camera, and a hidden portable mike attached to a receiver. And what all this electronic junk told him was real enough but so ambiguous that its meaning could be twisted one way or another.The movie is rife with symbolism that I'm not sure I'm getting because it too is ambiguous. Harry is as secretive as anyone can be without being frankly paranoid. Nobody knows his home phone number. His girlfriend, who deserts him, doesn't know his birthday or his age. A "cawl" is the thin layer of white fat that covers and conceals a piece of meat such as a leg of lamb. But Harry's raincoat is translucent, one of those ugly plastic ones you can pretty much see through. And he wears prominent glasses so his sight can't be what it used to be. And, after all, an envious competitor in the bugging business does manage to plant a hidden mike on Harry and record a private conversation. And somebody does get Harry's home phone, calls him up and tells him, "We're watching you." (This leads to Harry's tearing his whole apartment apart in a futile search for the hidden mike, and leaves him playing a desolate tenor sax while sitting alone on the floor.) Harry has no family. His assistant, John Cazale, is a little too inquisitive and is fired. Someone describes Harry as "anonymous and lonely." But he's neither anonymous nor lonely. God and "The Director" know who he is, where he lives, and what he does. And everywhere Harry goes he is now accompanied by his guilty conscience. Oh, Harry's got a lot of company. Or, as he tells his new fake girlfriend while listening to the tapes, "It's no ordinary conversation. It makes me feel -- something."There aren't too many weaknesses. There's a murky dream sequence in which Harry describes his childhood paralysis, but it doesn't have too much to do with the person we know as an adult. Cazale is professional and sympathetic. Allan Garfield is a standout in a mostly comic role as Hackman's jealous rival, a blustery showman who pulls jokes on everyone including himself. The way he uses his blonde assistant in a tiny dress to help him display his wares at a buggery convention is hilarious. He's like an on-stage magician cracking jokes while he stuffs the doves up his sleeve. The party scene reminds me of "La Dolce Vita" when the party-goers explore the ancient castle. People inhabit vast empty echoing spaces. Most of the time they are blocked from one another by iron gratings or hanging sheets of plastic. They whisper intimacies to fantasies.The score is fine. Carmine Coppola uses old melodies behind some of the scenes, and a tinkling puzzling piano statement behind most of the incidents. Sensibly the screen is left silent except for natural noises when Harry looks into the scene of the murder he thinks he witnessed.You know, sometimes it's possible to read too much into something, to see Gestalts where there be no Gestalts. I don't know if I'm making something out of nothing, but is it a coincidence that Harry's birthday falls on the same day he develops a conscience? Or that on the same day, the Director's assistant offers him "Christmas cookies"? Is it pure chance that the repetitive song "Red Red Robin" contains the line, "Still I listen for hours and hours"? That the assistant's name, Stett, means "leave it alone" in Latin? There's much more to be said about this film but I don't want to run out of space so I'll simply recommend seeing it. In its own quiet way it's a far more provocative movie than "The Godfather."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film cheats the audience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a mystery to me why so many people think this is a great movie. Apart from being mind-numbingly slow and tedious (like, gasp, the Godfather), the worst thing is that the film insults the audience by cheating at the end.SPOILER:Early in the film we hear the line from the 'conversation' which goes 'he'd kill us if he got the chance'. This is spoken with the emphasis on 'kill'. At the end of the film it is changed so that the emphasis is on 'us'. So 'he'd *kill* us if he got the chance' changes to 'he'd kill *us* if he got the chance'. What a con! If we, the audience had heard the latter version early on, we'd know that the couple planned the murder and there would be no 'twist' (yawn) at the end.Terribly overrated movie, which never gets going and never goes anywhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intelligent and ingenious thriller with magnificent acting by Gene Hackman and perfect direction by Coppola</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A paranoid, secretive surveillance expert called Harry Caul (reportedly Gene Hackman's favorite movie in which he has acted) will go anywhere to bug a private conversation , as he is becoming increasingly uneasy about his current job . He is a solitary man in both his personal and professional life, only helped by his assistant Stan (early deceased John Cazale of Deer Hunter) , as they are watching a young couple (Cindy Williams , Frederic Forrest , Coppola's fetish actor) when Harry begins to suspect that they are murder targets . The professional eavesdropper haunted by the time his bugging cost the lives of some people and terrified that it is happening again , as he has a crisis of conscience when he suspects that a couple he is spying on will be murdered . As Harry refines and re-refines the recording, he interprets what he hears in different ways . As Harry discovers shattering revelation believes that the lives of the young couple are in jeopardy .This interesting flick turns out to be a powerful statement about privacy , guilty and responsibility ; being ¨surveillance¨ as the basis and theme of the film . The picture contains thrills , emotion , thought-provoking issues and plot twists during the last reel . Very good acting by Gene Hackman as a freelance surveillance expert as well as an intensely private and solitary mature man . His mood of isolation and loneliness is pretty well established . The ¨Tapper¨ Gene Hackman learned to play the saxophone especially for the film . Gene Hackman later plays a former NSA agent who is a surveillance expert in ¨Enemy of the state¨ (1998) by Tony Scott , and the images of his character in his younger days are taken directly from this film . Secondary cast is frankly good , such as John Cazale as his business associate , Allen Garfield as Bernie Moran , Frederic Forrest as Mark , Cindy Williams as Ann and special appearance by Robert Duvall as the Director . In addition , a pre-stardom Harrison Ford , Billy Dee Williams and Teri Garr appear in minor characters . David Shire's original music was composed prior to production and played for the actors prior to their scenes to get them into the proper moods. Evocative and appropriate cinematography by Bill Butler and Haskell Wexler as uncredited director of photography . This well-made motion picture was stunningly directed by Francis Ford Coppola . In fact , this is Francis Ford Coppola's personal favorite of his movies. Coppola had written the outline in 1966 but couldn't get financing until The Godfather (1972) became a success. ¨The Conversation¨ resulted to be one of the best films of the 70s . Rating : Better than average , don't blink during throughout the film . Essential and indispensable seeing for thriller lovers and Gene Hackman fans .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Retribution: Wait For The Lightning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:As an earlier great reviewer wrote this is about guilt not paranoia. For people who find the movie boring, with all the scientific minutia about sound recordings and playback, the movie is about Harry Caul. It is a psychological study of the moral and psychological consequences of taping people, usually for criminal reasons, then trying to live with the consequences. He is not paranoid; if your recordings had the kind of horrific fallout like Garfield reminds him, to his rage, at the putative, friendly party. Martin has sent a prostitute to the party to get those tapes back from him. Harry retreats into a complete bubble with only his badly played with jazz to keep him company. Coppola's attention to detail is thematically relevant; he is showing you that part of Harry's coping is to disappear within the equipment. He hides there. He is the best but it is not for meritorious reasons. He cannot stand the memories of the unheard screams of all the people he helped destroy for some money. Many viewers found his laconic speech to be boring and uninteresting; again, this is a defense mechanism, like his attack on his landlady for the birthday card or dumping Teri Garr for being too inquisitive. Harry is certain someone is coming for him; he seeks redemption, finally, when he is sure that the young couple is going to be killed by Duvall. Harry refuses to give Martin the tapes; you sense that he needs to confront Duvall personally. Coppola's great plot twist is so shocking and unexpected. Will anyone ever forget that toilet flush? It was such a great simile for that is how it effects Harry his imagination shows him the horror he caused. When he sees Cindy Williams, safe and unharmed, he runs for cover but it is too late. The movie ends with perfect irony; he will live the rest of his, probably very short, life in a fishbowl; how apropos. His fate is just what he earned. As we see him ripping his apartment to pieces, we feel no sympathy for him. He got just the fate he deserved. Coppola's little gem, this is such a great movie. The acting is great with the exception of a young Harrison Ford as Martin he is just dreadful, bring in Chewie, please. Other than Ford, Hackman, Duvall and Cazale are all excellent. Garfield is always the villain you love to hate. He always plays a loathsome swine. The movie is not an action picture, go watch Man of Steel. It is a study of an immoral man hiding from himself the horrors he is doing for money. He has erected a fortress around his conscience speaking almost nothing. He wanders about in a fog, losing himself within the science of surveillance. Yet, his deeds return back upon him. Ironically, it is most like the modern movie THE American, Clooney is more aware than Harry and even more sociable but both have fate chasing them. It shows the hand of the master who made it: Francis Coppola. I cannot recommend it highly enough; when you watch it remember it is about Harry. The Conversation is only relevant in that it breaks Harry's fortress to pieces like SCARFACE the protagonist's attempt at redemption brings about his downfall. A GREAT FILM</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coppola's 'other' nineteen-seventies classic; one of Hackman's most complex performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Francis Form Coppola's The Conversation was his only film from the seventies written and directed by him (and made through his Zoetrope studios), and it is no less than a major credit to his status as a creative, successfully experimental filmmaker of the new-wave of American directors of the 70's. The Conversation is a first-person story of a surveillance man named Harry Caul, played by Gene Hackman, who's well respected by his fellow snoop-peers, but isn't always that good at it. After getting audio on a conversation between a man and woman talking about a murder, or one that could happen, and trying to decipher some muddled words in it, he leaves his door open for the tapes to be stolen, and this sets him into a paranoid state fearing a deja-vu will occur for him (his work caused some deaths years before).What's so fascinating and telling about The Conversation is that its basic storyline and development is that of a thriller, yet the way Coppola uses Hackman's Harry brings to the story themes of guilt, privacy, fear, loneliness, and so forth that go to reel the viewer into the psychology of this character. The ones Harry is listening in on are important to the story, but not so much as Harry's placement on the outskirts of what else is going on in the story. A more conventional film would've gone with The Director character (in a cameo by Robert Duvall), or even with the people Harry Caul listens in on. Instead we get a viewpoint strictly from the sideline, which is often harrowing, especially from his perspective.Two aspects to The Conversation really struck me on my first viewing, outside of Bill Butler's keenly observatory camera-work and the acting from the main and supporting players: the sound in most scenes is rather extraordinary for the times. Whether we're hearing the conversation in its repetitious form(s), listening in on a silence about to break, or even in just a seemingly normal scene, when sounds, either diegetic or non-diegetic, come into play it's like Coppola, and his Academy Award nominated (should've won) sound men Walter Murch and Art Rochester, are stretching the boundaries for it, and were arguably expanding its usage before movie-goers ears. The other thing that struck me was how Coppola gets the viewer deeper into Harry's mood with surrealistic images that are all the more frightening since they seem totally real to Harry. The prime example of this would be the hotel room scene - because Harry is a sort of anti-hero, and we can still identify with him slightly on a moral level, the dream-like moments become potent, visionary.And then there's Hackman as Harry Caul- he plays him to the best of the great actor's ability, revealing levels of sorrow, bitterness, humility, and regret all with total conviction that another actor might've not grasped. By the end of the film, the viewer's been brought along on this journey via Harry, and though Coppola was the mastermind behind how it was crafted, it was Hackman to me who brought the whole experience to a sense of realism to a thriller that has illusions to spare. Whether or not the conversation hurt others or brought upon shame on The Director isn't the point, and that's how Coppola must've wanted it - he was inspired by Antonioni's Blowup, which used photographs as a man's obsession instead of sound - the point is Harry's journey through this assignment, and how it begins to whittle him down to a nub...One of the best films of 1974, The Conversation also won the prestigious Palme D'Or at Cannes that year.

Builds an unsettling, tense mood &amp; sustains it throughout. Doesn't overdo anything. Probably doesn't have enough "action" for moviegoers today.

		<fullReview>This movies sucks. I just finished watching it. I could hardly finish it. In fact, for the last 10 minutes of it I was reading the reviews on here -- I was happy to see that some people agreed with me that this is a seriously overrated bore of a film. I called it during the credits to my girlfriend --- "Oh man, this is going to suck." And boy was I right. It was so boringly slow. What is the point of such a plodding pace? This director has no taste. The conversation of the title was so uninteresting, and yet we heard it over and over again. There was nothing to it, and it never got interesting. I found none of the characters interesting except Gene Hackman's character, who was only mildly interesting because of his paranoid ways. But speaking of his paranoia, some aspects of the plot itself were wildly improbable. Would a man who's so secretive, and who thinks he's being followed, invite his competitors in the surveillance business up to his secret workshop? So preposterous, and yet it formed a critical element of the plot. This movie is like a short story stuffed full of filler to make it long enough to be a novel. Dull, dull, dull. It should have been only 20 minutes, and even then it would have been only mildly interesting. In fact, it would be an interesting exercise to edit this movie down to 20 minutes... I didn't appreciate the camera-work, the music, the acting, or the plot. The music was an unsuccessful choice. The plot was simple and far too slowly presented. The movie that came to mind to compare the pace of this movie to was Tarkovsky's "Stalker". I found nothing of redeeming value in this movie. I'm a jazz buff, too, and didn't even like the music.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gene Hackman is outstanding as surveillance expert Harry Caul, who makes a living wiretapping others, and finding ways to plant his listening devices without being detected. Harry is paradoxically a deeply private man who lives alone and anonymously, taking the bus, and making calls from a pay phone, so he won't be intruded on. His world is threatened by an obnoxious competitor, and the waning interest of his one love(played by Teri Garr), whom he visits sporadically.Harry becomes embroiled in a new case involving a young couple who seem to be fearful that they will be murdered(by Businessman Robert Duvall) but for a man who makes his living recording other's conversations, he doesn't pay enough attention to what is actually said, and a terrible misunderstanding of intent nearly destroys him...Francis Ford Coppola's direction is stylish and incisive, as is the script and editing. Twist-laden ending is breath-taking, and one can't help feeling sympathy for poor Harry, even though his mistakes brought this fate on himself...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Finest Thrillers Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Conversation {dir. Francis Ford Coppola, 1974} [****/****] Lets get the definitive statements out of the way early. Francis Ford Coppola's The Conversation is one of the finest thrillers ever made. In terms of thrills, in terms of originality, in terms of bravery, it stands on its own as a uniquely powerful film. Its premise is simple, concise and true and the craft employed in its making is truly masterful. Yet, as it currently stands the film is greatly unappreciated by most film enthusiasts. Sadly the film is a victim of circumstance, as it has the particularly difficult task of being the bridge on writer director Francis Ford Coppola's filmography linking The Godfather and The Godfather Part II. As such, film historians have been so busy heralding Coppola's exploits with the Corleones, that they allowed what is probably his best film slip them by. However, The Conversation is not a film of epic scale or grand thematic vision, it is an intense character study. Yet, it success is so considerable that it may even outshine all the other entries into the Coppola cannon.This is the story of surveillance expert Harry Caul, played by Gene Hackman. Amongst those in his field, Caul is legendary; a man notorious for his ability and his insistence on using all his own, home made equipment. Harry is a man of extreme secrecy, a snoop with a crippling fear of being snooped upon. He seems unable to make any deep personal or emotional connections, and he is the man we are about to spend two hours with.His current assignment is to infiltrate the conversation of a young married woman and her lover. Harry picks up the audio, but when listening to it closely Caul hears something that frightens him, shakes him, sends into into a state of frenzied paranoia. He knows what he heard, but are his fears justified or a result of his seemingly compulsive paranoia? We as an audience follow Harry as he attempts to unravel the underlying plot to what seemed at first to be a mundane day's work.Coppola's control of tension is relentless and thrilling. In terms of goals set and achieved, this may very well be his finest effort. He plays with reality and imagination in a particularly blunt and effective fashion, presenting scenes numerous times with varying outcomes. Coppola waits until we lose our footing on reality and then pulls the rug out from under us in a way which is devastating and effective. Yet, this is not a film of twists and turns, but rather of developments. No dues ex machina to be found here.There is not a wasted frame of film in this one, and the sound design and editing are so intricate and precise that it digs deep under your skin. The emotions The Conversation inspires, the claustrophobia an the alienation, do not fade away with the end credits, they fester in your mind and stay with you.This is not a jigsaw puzzle thriller, it is a trip into the psyche of a fairly disturbed individual. Hackman, one of the finest of all actors, gives a performance that is so well studied and quiet that you really lose the movie star beneath that bald head and those thick glasses. The film's power relies on the character of Caul and the acting and writing cut deep, revealing a man uncomfortable even in his own skin.The film is thrilling, heart stopping, frightening yes, all those things. But it operates more importantly as a meditation on personal privacy and psychological paranoia, right down to its haunting final image, which contains more sorrow, more anguish and more tortuous claustrophobia than any movie you're likely to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite Coppola film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE CONVERSATION is my favorite film of Francis Ford Coppola. For all of the hoopla surrounding THE GODFATHER films and APOCALYPSE NOW over the years, I actually think that THE CONVERSATION may be Coppolas most perfect, entertaining film. Coming out in 1974 at the height of the Watergate scandal, THE CONVERSATION is on the surface a film about wiretapping and spying on other people's private conversations. But it is also an effective thriller as the viewer is hard pressed to figure out what is really going on, even upon multiple viewings.At its core, it seems to be a very personal film about a man who has serious difficulty distinguishing fact from fiction due to his super-sheltered existence. Gene Hackman stars as professional wiretapper Harry Caul, and this folks, is the absolute best performance of Gene Hackman's career! And that's saying a lot b/c the man has always done fabulous work. But here, you almost won't know that it's Gene Hackman. As Harry Caul, Hackman is extremely quiet, lonely, sad, sensitive, and suspicious. And Hackman embodies all these characteristics with 100% believability. It's one of the most perfect performances that I've ever seen. It's almost too bad he won Oscar for French Connection in 1971 b/c had he not, I almost have got to believe that he would have won for this film, and he wasn't even nominated for THE CONVERSATION! Supreme oversight by the Academy.At the start, we are introduced to our hero Harry Caul through a brilliantly executed sequence of long-view, overhead tracking shots of a bugged Harry circling a park while his cohorts are in a building, on a rooftop, and in a van picking up the conversation between a couple that Harry is following. The editing in this scene is fantastic as it subtly shifts between hearing the muffled words that Harry and his men are picking up and the actual words spoken. They are speaking at such a whisper that you can hardly make out what they are saying. You also get a lesson in wiretapping here.During the film, we meet several of Harry's cronies. One is his very young girlfriend Amy (played by super-young Teri Garr), who loves Harry but hates him keeping things from her. Another is his partner Stan (played by the great character actor John Cazale, who seemed like he worked in just about every great film of the 70s). Stan also doesn't like the fact that Harry is so guarded and leaves to work for a rival. During a wiretapper's convention, we are introduced to one of Harry's biggest rivals Bernie Moran (played by Allen Garfield in perhaps the second best performance of this film). Bernie is extremely jealous of Harry and has an eerie, stalker-like affinity for him.Harry is working for some mysterious 'Director' of a powerful company (played by an uncredited Robert Duvall) and the woman of the park couple is The Director's wife (played by Cindy Williams in a refreshingly mysterious and sexy performance), who he thinks is cheating on him with the man (played by Frederic Forrest), who works for him. Upon taking the conversation tapes to The Director, his assistant Martin Stett (played by an extremely youthful Harrison Ford in an effectively creepy performance) tries to intercept them and take them from him, but Harry only wants to put them directly into The Director's hands. A suspicious Harry begins to investigate further and carefully tries to make out the meaning of the couple's conversation and concludes that they are having an affair and based on what they said, he thinks The Director wants to kill them.The film speaks a lot to the paranoia at the time due to Watergate and the disillusionment and general malaise that existed due to the Vietnam War. The film itself is an effective and thought-provoking thriller that keeps you guessing until the very end. It has one of the most ambiguous film endings of all time. A highly provocative and unique film! Perhaps Coppola's best!</fullReview>

Gene Hackman was terrific as a loner ... a bugging expert who finds his moral compass after overhearing a conversation between Cindy Williams and Fredrick Forrest.Ironic that it came out around the time President Nixon resigned, even though Coppolla started writing this back in 1966. Kept my attention from beginning to the end. Great locations throughout San Francisco. Robert Duvall does a fine job in a cameo and Harrison Ford playing a out of character ( and a good job too )Kudos to Allan Garfield, Terri Garr and John Cazale also.

		<shortDescription>"I'm not afraid of death, but I am afraid of murder."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sandwiched between the epic successes of 'The Godfather' and 'The Godfather: Part II,' Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Conversation' might at first seem to be a comparatively light film. Admittedly, I found it rather underwhelming while I was watching it, and yet, the more I thought about it, the more I recognised the complexities of what had originally seemed a completely straightforward plot. In this brooding character study, Gene Hackman plays Harry Caul, the most respected surveillance expert in the business. In order to succeed at his job, Harry has learned to value a certain level of detachment from his "victims," maintaining that his client's troubles are of no concern to him. Accordingly, Harry often distances himself from intimacy in his personal life, his only relationship being with a lonely woman named Meredith (Elizabeth MacRae), to whom he reveals nothing about himself.After Harry successfully records a quiet conversation between two people (Frederic Forrest and Cindy Williams) in a crowded courtyard, he begins to suspect that his surveillance may lead to their assassination. For the first time, he begins to question the ethics of his chosen field, eventually becoming actively involved in his client's issues. 'The Conversation' is probably most remarkable for its brilliant sound editing, mixing together recorded conversations, muffled words, microphone static and ambient sounds (it was nominated for an Oscar in the Best Sound category, but lost out to Mark Robson's 'Earthquake.'). By the end of the film, after his suspicions have proved him to be completely wrong in his assumptions, Caul has become paranoid and insecure. Being reputedly the best "bugger" in the business, he is finally forced to face that terrifying possibly: what if there is somebody better than him?As Harry literally tears apart his apartment in search of the bug (notably, he doesn't look anywhere in his beloved tenor saxophone), the camera slowly and mechanically pans from right to left, just as a surveillance camera might do. This camera movement reinforces one of the Coppola's main themes: just as Harry is a voyeur on the private lives of his subjects, we, the audience, are complicit in his deed. Indeed, we are surveilling Harry even in his most intimate moments, and the knowledge of this has permanently unhinged him, forcing him even to destroy his statue of the Virgin Mary, which symbolised the relics of his devout Catholicism. Gene Hackman is brilliantly understated in the main role, his brooding silence saying more than even the most colourful dialogue possibly could. We see him, complete detached from sharing his emotions, and we see and feel his loneliness.Hackman is also supported by a solid cast of talented actors, including John Cazale and Allen Garfield as fellow surveillance experts. Frederic Forrest and Cindy Williams play the young couple whose taped conversation forms the backbone of their story, and, through clever editing, it is remarkable how the meanings behind their words changes depending on the context in which it is heard (notably, one very important piece of dialogue, "he'd kill us if he got the chance," was re-recorded for the climax, since preview audiences had difficulty picking up on the change in emphasis). Robert Duvall makes an uncredited cameo as the Director who hires Harry's services, and I was exceedingly impressed with a young Harrison Ford, straight from George Lucas' 'American Graffiti (1973).'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does for Sound Recordings What "Blowup" Did for Photographs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Conversation" is a deeply unsettling film about a surveillance expert (Gene Hackman), who becomes involved in the private lives of a couple on whom he is spying when he hears a fragment of a conversation that suggests the two will be murdered. The truth that he uncovers rocks his world to its foundations, and the man who's spent his life uncovering the secrets of others suddenly is forced to wonder what secrets others might be uncovering about him."The Conversation" seems to be somewhat overshadowed by Francis Ford Coppola's other 1974 release, "The Godfather Part II," but I think this is the more fascinating film. He brings an eerie, art-house style to this film that compliments nicely the accessible, linear storytelling of his famous crime saga. This film actually becomes more and more prescient with each passing decade, when the Internet has guaranteed that complete anonymity and privacy is virtually impossible.Grade: A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this movie in a film studies class in college about a year ago. Ever since I had to own itIt took me that entire year to find it, I had asked the only few decent (not huge corporation) store for a while, she always said they will be getting one in, but never had a copy, just like what every other place said.I ended up giving in and buying it online from best buy, but it's worth it, the wait was finally over.One of the major things that strike me about this film is it's amazing camera work. The first shot is the best example, that transiton from extreme long shot to a close up is beautiful work, and extremely difficult, executed buetifuly, a forshadowing of the movie to come.This movie is a must watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Conversation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Francis Ford Coppola's provoking mystery-drama explores the morality of privacy and stars Gene Hackman as Harry Caul, expert surveillance man.A routine wire-tapping job turns into a modern-nightmare as Harry hears something disturbing in his recording of a young couple. " He'd kill us if he had the chance." Caul soon begins to wonder about what the tape may be used for and he soon becomes involved in a maze of secrecy and murder.Set in San Francisco, the film also stars Cindy Williams, Harrison Ford, Frederic Forrest, Teri Garr, and Robert Duvall. Nominated for Best Picture in 1974. The Conversation was made between the Godfather and The Godfather: Part II.At its core, the film is really about this one man's, Caul's unraveling. The fact that he truly begins to wonder what the tape is going to be used for and by who- he takes a sort of responsibility over the fact that he does this for a living. Of course, in a sense this is also his downfall! The fact, that this man who is an expert in this particular field, ends up being a victim of his own profession.Coppola creates some brilliant scenes here, of course one of the best is the scene with Caul tearing apart his own apartment looking for a planted bug. This is not only a brilliant ending for a brilliant film, but it's also one of those endings that lets you draw whatever conclusion you like. Was there really a bug? Is it in his glasses? In his sax? Or has Caul simply engrossed himself in his own paranoia? Brilliant.Another scene that just blew my mind was when Teri Garr's character starts to sing the Red Robin song, that the gal ( Williams) in the recording does. So is she part of the conspiracy as well? Of course, in Harry's world there is no accident or coincidence anymore! Course, I don't believe in em either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Francis Ford Coppola´s finest hour. Forget about The Godfather and Apocalypse Now, this is one of the best movies of the seventies. Gene Hackman´s performance in the leading role is outstanding, although quite different from that in "The French Connection" a couple of years earlier.You really never know what will happen in this thriller, you get as paranoid as the main character gets, what is it really that he has recorded on that routine assignment, bugging the assumed cheating wife of a company president?Note a relatively young Harrison Ford in a supporting role, as well as Robert Duvall. Brilliant score by David Shire. A must-see...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An important, but unappealing work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Conversation is not an easy experience and it is not an entertainment movie like Alan J. Pakula thrillers, it is an idiosyncratic film. This has advantages and disadvantages both. Briefly the advantage is that the movie is unusual, so not cliché and the disadvantage is that it is not appealing. This is an important work, but not interesting, not entertaining, so rather the movie of cinema historians who write analyzing articles. I don't say this as a flaw, but there is no suspense or it is not a thriller, like a study. The Conversation is about a listener who understands that a couple will be assassinated by a record, but this is just the story on the surface and despite, it sounds insipid, the movie is not interested in that. I can't say that the movie is engaging, but also cannot say that it is uninteresting, in the middle of both. As said, another advantage of this story telling (direction) is that the movie looks very realistic. For example, the scene which Harry returns home shows that. We meet his woman, his love affair is not cartoonish. Mostly, our 'hero' talk with his woman, makes love with her or they argue each other. The work place of Harry, the set decoration is dazzling, all those details. The very famous bugging scene takes place in the second half that I had read and wondered for years, but it was not that great, just interesting, so I disappointed. In addition, it seemed me a little pointless. Therefore, don't expect something like Blow Up's photo analysis scene. There is only one more interesting thing in the movie, it is Harrison Ford. I had not known that he is in the cast before watching the movie. There is not a powerful final either, but at least the story is collected. As for Gene Hackman, Harry is Hackman's most different character he ever played probably.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unworthy of its subject matter.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Conversation' alludes to and dances around the issue which should be central to the film; Security vs. Privacy, both in the government and the corporate arena. The true focus of the film is the character study of a 'wiretapper', his reclusive personal life, and his growing obsession with an assignment he fears may lead to a murder.Honestly, I don't care for Coppola's direction in this film. It's slow and frequently incoherent, with elements that don't fit or are just incorrect. One example of this is the ending scene, where the director artificially shifts the emphasis in the recording that is central to the film. You hear this recording half a dozen times, so it is easy to tell that the emphasis has changed, not been 'revealed'. Another glitch is when the camera that Hackman supposedly 'misses' while searching his apartment pans back and forth. Firstly, a tiny hidden camera wouldn't have been in color or in high resolution, not in 1974. Second, it wouldn't pan. Panning is motion, and motion draws the human eye, which is the LAST thing you want with a hidden surveillance cam. The whole movie is full of poor tradecraft like that, even for the period.If you are a fan of Coppola, more power to you; my post isn't about him, one way or another. Nor is it about Hackman's performance which, despite the film's overall mediocrity, is superb. My complaint is that this could have been a great film. It could have been earth-shaking. It could have had consequences lasting beyond the Nixon administration and Watergate, changing how the privacy issues of today are viewed... but now it is dated and largely forgotten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Ironic Title</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harry Caul is a surveillence expert who records a conversation that places himself as a witness to a murder plan . I thought I'd point this out because watching THE CONVERSATION it's obvious within seconds as to what Harry is but any possible plot development involving a possible murder plan doesn't take place until about 40 minutes into the movie's running time . Instead of cutting to the chase those of us with a low attention span have to wade through a story that doesn't appear to be going anywhere . Harry sits in a van , Harry plays the sax , Harry celebrates his birthday , Harry gets to meet Hans Solo before he became a space pirate . Maybe the slow pace shouldn't be taken as a criticism since no one is under any pretension that THE CONVERSATION is a fast moving thriller but at the same time it could have done with a little more excitement , or at least tighter plotting with more obvious high concept aspects Francis Ford Coppola amazingly is on record as saying this is his favourite directorial feature . I guess that as a director it was far more enjoyable to make than APOCALYPSE NOW but as a piece of breath taking art it is lacking . I won't be too negative though since Gene Hackman is as good as he always been even though he gives one of his more subtle performances and despite the criticisms this is a much more involving film that the very similar BLOW UP</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A better title: "The Mind-Numbingly Boring Conversation, Which Is Made Only a Little Bit More Interesting by Being Bugged"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My hunch is that the buzz surrounding this film is largely due to the fact that it OUGHT to be good. The idea is a good one. It's been made into a film, so far as I can tell, exactly once: no other film in history that I'm aware of is a remake, a foreshadowing, a knock-off, a parody or a faithful homage. There's really nothing better (or worse) to compare it to. Coppola made the film, between "The Godfather" and "The Godfather Part II", two films which are widely, if incorrectly, regarded as among the best of all time, with a talented crew and without any obvious mistakes. However few (or many) positive virtues it may have it has few positive failings. On balance it's probably okay, and certainly worth watching once.Spoilers follow...But surely even the film's champions can see how painfully boring most of it is. It's depressing, all right, because it's always depressing to spend two hours in the company of someone or something with no energy, no life and not very many thoughts; and I'm not referring to Harry Caul here (although I could be), but to the film itself. Coppoloa is as obsessive about getting down every little uninteresting detail about people and events he doesn't understand the significance of, as his protagonist is; if the process of watching the minutae of bugging is SOMETIMES involving (as in the opening scene, where we see how the title conversation was recorded in the first place; or the sequence in which Caul patiently and methodically sifts through what sound like random crackles in order to pull out complete, comprehensible sentences; or even the trade show, where matters of moment look as though they might be under discussion), this is because it's sometimes going somewhere. But Coppola doesn't know how to build. When the key sentence "He'd kill us if he got the chance" leaps out of the soundtrack at us, it's an arresting moment, but only because we suspect that the sentence means something. Only gradually does it dawn on us that we're never going to be told what it means; nor will we be given any further evidence, not even the thinnest little sliver, that might help us work it out. Nor does this sentence move the story forward in any way. Harry gets more paranoid as a result of hearing the sentence but while he moves around more frantically he doesn't seem to be going in any particular direction.Another writer calls Coppola's film "a great paranoid character study disguised as a thriller", and goes on to say that it works well on either level. This view could not be more wrong. If "The Conversation" worked well as a thriller, we wouldn't need to invoke the central character's madness, and the fact that any particular thing we see may not really be happening at all, simply to make sense of the story; and if it worked as a paranoid character study, we wouldn't need to think that some of Harry's delusions may not be delusions at all in order to be interested in them. This leaves open the possibility that the film works as a COMBINATION of paranoid character study and thriller; but for that to be the case it would have to be less tedious.The "ambiguous" ending is a simple cop-out, which is why the final shot of Harry's smashed-to-bits rooms, which OUGHT to be shocking and creepy, carry almost no charge whatever. Ambiguous endings only work when there is at least one satisfying disambiguation in there somewhere. There's none to be had here. This is the best I can come up with: Harry has been had by is colleagues again, just as he was at the trade show. The device he thought was fake, the one which would purportedly a distant wiretapper to turn any telephone receiver anywhere in the world into a live microphone, in fact WORKED, and Harry destroyed everything in his flat looking for newly-planted bug when the only bug present was the one that had been there all along.The murder, or would-be-murder, or imagined murder (whichever it was), is, on this theory, little more than a red herring. I don't like this, but don't blame me if the film doesn't know what it's about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good plot, bad script, dull characters...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>GENE HACKMAN gives a virtuoso performance as a loner, a weird one at that whose character is never fleshed out because he can't bare to reveal himself to anyone--not even the viewer. At least that's the limitation imposed upon him by the dull script. What could have been an extraordinarily fine suspenser, is turned into a slow-paced character study that only skims the surface of its protagonist who is an expert in surveillance but unable to connect with any of the rather boring individuals around him. The script fails to inject any of the other characters with life, so that we never get to know what makes anyone tick. Annoying? Yes. Frustrating? Yes. Enigmatic? Too enigmatic for comfort. After nearly two hours of watching Hackman spy on a young couple and teasing us with the one sentence he is sure means they are afraid of being murdered, the script takes a different turn at the last moment and the audience at least gets a bit of a twist if it is still awake to face the denouement. Maddeningly slow with scenes that aren't even needed to fill in some awkward gaps in the screenplay, this could have been a tremendously suspenseful film under a director like Alfred Hitchcock with a writer like Ernest Lehman (who did "North by Northwest"). But Coppola has skipped all of the conventional ways of building suspense in favor of a semi-documentary approach that falls flat and fails to register in a gripping enough way to keep the story taut and interesting. Instead, his departure from the usual way of filming, is an exercise in tedium. This is the sort of film-making that became common in the '70s, a sort of audio version of Brian De Palma's BLOW UP, but not nearly as effective. What might have made an interesting story never reaches its full potential.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He'd kill us if he got the chance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harry Caul is one of the best in the business, but he doesn't show it. In the presence of others he is anti-social, nervous, unwilling to open up. He deflect questions, and walk and walks and walks away from conversations. When he is alone he displays he worst insecurities; four locks and an alarm cannot keep out a well-meaning landlord leaving behind a birthday gift, which makes him uneasy. Is he 42, or 44? We do not know, and it is ironic that considering his line of work, that he could be so private. He shows tinges of Catholicism, but sleeps with a woman whilst paying her, and in the ending, destroys a statue of Mary in his paranoia and rage. Coppola immerses us into this slow descent in the mind of Caul, and it is a tremendous performance by Hackman, who seems truly terrified. He is contrasted by his competitor Bernie, who is self-dubbed 2nd best, but must talk endlessly and boast of his achievements, whilst Caul's talent speaks for itself. Through this we hear stories of a past wiretapping job which eventuated in three murders, and which provides the basis for the guilt that Caul is now wracked with. Coppola goes over the recordings again and again until we are as haunted by them as Caul is. The sound design is magnificent; we firstly are treated to snippets of the urban sounds, street jazz, mumbled conversations, which sharply focus and electronically distort as the crew seek to capture damning evidence of an affair. The first shot is a voyeuristic overhead from a telescope afar, as they search for the couple. Later, as the snippets invade Caul's mind, the imaginary footage is hand-held, natural and closeup, intimate yet distant. He replays the tapes over and over, and this seeps into his social (if you can call it that) life. Meredith pushes him to trust and confide in her, and as he opens up, unwillingly being recorded, the camera sweeps from the right to the left, from behind one shoulder to another, and then we cut and it does it all over again and again, and we are sure that even as he speaks of a love lost, his mind is racing on another matter.It is wholly invasive - he finds himself referring to the work of a client, though he knows its stakes are much higher. When he hears those haunting lyrics mirrored in Amy's bedroom singsong, he murmurs that he heard another person 'at work' carrying the same tune, as if it was just another day in the life. He isn't afraid of death, only murder, and keeps nothing of value in his apartment, but is troubled by what he has discovered. The slow zoom in characterises his growing dread very well. Initially, searching for a couple in a random day crowd. Then, as he relives the tapes and painstakingly constructs a lost sentence, we grow closer to the pair as he is desperate to find out, then he recoils as soon as he has, wishing he hadn't. Later, as he visits a confessional booth, he slowly unveils his sins as we try to make out an ear behind that screen, but Coppola cuts before the priest responds, which speaks volumes about Caul's guilt. Finally, as he listens in on the other room, and we think he hears the murmurs of a domestic struggle about to occur. Does it matter whether it is really happening or not? We are focused on Caul. It has roots in Antonioni's Blowup, but also in Hitchock's masterpiece, Rear Window. His famous definitions of suspense and surprise are relevant here, of a bomb hidden yet in plain sight, waiting to explode, and a bomb exploding suddenly. In the thrilling climax in the hotel, we have both, a silent, slow and shaking tension as he creeps through the room. We believe, like Caul does, that a murder will happen here, and that is the suspense, but we are also unprepared for the bubbling pool of blood in the toilet, or a bloody hand thrust up against the glass wall, and there is the surprise. This is an extension of his paranoia and guilt. He plays his saxophone endlessly, his only joy, as a means to complete a recording in the same way as he is diligently at work. In times of sheer vulnerability, a tinkling piano tune substitutes; sitting alone in a nightime train, as the shock of Ann appearing in the elevator hits him, as he struggles to open up to Meredith. And finally he again resorts to his sax as he fails to find the bug in his apartment. Such a film would be different if made today. It would focus on the new marvels of surveillance technology, on the trickery and deduction of the trade. It would unveil exactly how Caul managed to bug the president in a fishing boat. That would expose Caul's power, but in a decidedly different way. Here, he is a man who is seemingly omniscient, unfazed and able to decipher the most private of conversations. It doesn't matter where the bug is or whether he finds it or not, or if there even is a bug at all. He has already been defeated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an absolutely riveting film, but not the way you'd expect after hearing about its plot summary. Oh sure, it has suspense, but it's all pretty subdued suspense, no real big moments. It's basically a study in obsession and paranoia, and it's incredibly riveting. It has some parts where it's maybe too slow, but nothing that really drags it down much. Gene Hackman's performance here reminds me a lot of the recent work of Gary Oldman in Tinker, Tailor Solider Spy. Very subdued as well, very observant, but effective. I can see why he didn't get an Oscar nomination, but I'm surprised they did take to the film well. This is definitely a great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Theme in a Little Depth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can see why many folks find the movie maddening. But whatever its drawbacks as entertainment, I believe it's one of the most important films of our era. Thus, I want to concentrate on one aspect of the film that I think has genuine contemporary relevance.As the movie stands, Harry Caul is a good example of the struggle between humanity and technology. That is, in order to be tops in his highly technical bugging field, he's having to suppress normal human instincts. As a result, he lives almost entirely within himself. As top man, he's got the best devices, but his relentless drive also requires that he be a complete professional by ignoring the consequences of his expertise, whatever they might be. We learn, for example, that on one occasion his bugging success led to the death of three people. So to escape the guilt, he moved to San Francisco, as though that would be sufficient.However, it's apparent that Harry is having to struggle with an inescapable guilt no matter where he moves to. But if he gives in to moral reservations about his profession, they could worm their way into both his top standing and effectiveness. As a result, he likely depends upon religion as a way of salving these inner recriminations. By doing so, he can convince himself that he's not really a bad person, and continue on with his bugging activities. In the same vein, Harry represses anything like normal interactions with other people, since normal interactions would touch on moral considerations in a very real way. Thus he lives entirely within himself, as his generally frozen composure shows. In sum, Harry is about as affectless as any lead character in a movie I've seen, and likely a reason so many viewers object to the movie as a whole.The trouble is that Harry can repress his moral side, but not completely. That, of course, is illustrated by the showdown at the Jack Tarr hotel where he believes a young couple is about to be murdered because of his successful bugging of them. But notice the thrashing agony he goes through in the next room because he can't bring himself to directly intervene in what may be happening to the young couple next door. In short, even in this moment of internal crisis, his attachment to the professional side wins out. As I see it, in the final analysis, he can't give up his fascination with the technology of spying on others instead of interacting emotionally with them.Of course, the ironic upshot is that in the end, he's hoist by his own petard, as he sits alone amidst the shambles of his room playing a tune that only he can hear. The technology that's given him such power over others is now turned against him, dragging him finally over the brink into madness, which has been close by all along.On the whole, I think it's not too difficult to find comparisons of Harry's predicament with America's emerging surveillance state and its fascination with secret bugging technology. By and large, this national process is proceeding without much regard for the effects on individual privacy and how the information may be used. Moreover, just as Harry separated himself from others in pursuit of his bugging goals, so is the surveillance state becoming more remote from the nation. I don't want to exaggerate the analogy, but it is something to think about, particularly when we consider the movie's ironical upshot. Thus the movie anticipates an emerging national issue by 40-years even if in fictional form. Thus, no matter how its dramatic worth is evaluated, the film remains one of the most important and unusual to come out of the 1970's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Conversation - Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Francis Ford Coppola's, "The Conversation" is a character study of the troubled secretive surveillance expert, Harry Caul (played by Gene Hackman).What makes Caul such an interesting character is how he's always at war with his conscience. His job is amoral; and Caul knows this. However he simply chooses to ignore it. He tries to shed any responsibility for the consequences his job creates, convincing himself he's just fulfilling his professional duty. However his conscience fights this theory.His latest assignment consists of bugging a conversation between a couple. This is made difficult however, because they stroll around a noisy town square in broad daylight. Although Caul successfully bugs the conversation he is met with a moral dilemma whilst listening back to the tapes. He suspects that the couple may be killed. He is faced with a harrowing decision. Should he ignore the threat and complete his assignment as intended, or should he try intervene a possible attack? It's this awful dilemma that instigates the core of his mental trauma.Caul's personal behavior also fascinates. His insistence on complete privacy is truly hypocritical given his job. Caul wishes to hide his personal life from those around him. As a result his interactions with others usually don't develop further than work related issues. This constant demand for privacy leads to his case of paranoia.Both leading man (Hackman) and director (Francis Ford Coppola) work excellently together in capturing Caul's trauma. Coppola's crafted patience and use of suspense tie in wonderfully with Caul's psychological descent. Hackman equals this with sheer naturalism throughout, perfectly executing an essence of shame and remorse.The film draws good performances from it's supporting cast as well, including Harrison Ford and John Cazale, with also a great musical score from David Shire also.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Conversation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harry Caul, the protagonist of The Conversation, is assigned to follow and record the exchanges between a man and a woman for reasons he isn't told. Harry is one of the bests in the business. He can record any conversation between two people anywhere. Harry also tries his best to maintain a considerable distance between his profession and his personal interest. He is least bothered about the material of his recordings; all he is bothered about is the quality of it, at least that's what he claims. But in this case it all goes wrong. Through his surveillance, Harry suspects that the conversations he is recording might take the lives of these two young man and woman. Harry also vividly remembers a similar occurrence of the past, where his so called professional interest took the lives of three people, a memory that still keeps haunting him. The film, The Conversation exposes his malfunction as a professional, a breakdown that ultimately ruins his life, something that could be predicted from beforehand. The film was a timely one. It was made during the Watergate era, during the time of sensitive apprehension over the infringement of civil emancipation in America. The film deals with annihilation of privacy, voyeurism and individual's responsibility, all of which were vibrant question that time and probably are still today. Harry is portrayed throughout the film as an unromantic, inconceivable person who is extremely scared to open himself up to others be it his girlfriend or co-workers, thus unable to maintain any normal human relationship. Harry is alone; he is a terrible social misfit. Interestingly during his dream Harry can share his personal existence and verity, but while awake, he would tolerate no one to take a look inside, which stands as an antithesis to his profession. The film has a memorable beginning and extremely difficult use of sound, including taped conversations, stifled voices, background and other mechanically-generated noises, which is met with absolute precision. The Conversion should also be remembered for the wonderful performance, as always, by Gene Hackman</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thoroughly engaging American thriller deftly unfolded and meticulously played.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are few directors with a run of films which are contained within that of an individual decade as good as what American director Francis Ford Coppola achieved in the 1970s. Indeed, amidst the two filmic adaptations of Puzo's Godfather novel as well as later on in the decade's war movie Apocalypse Now, sits his 1974 psychological masterwork The Conversation; a film slotting neatly in between either of the said gangster movie entries before being later rounded off by that Vietnam War piece one is tempted to say is the best of the lot. The Conversation is a quite incredible drama, a film about a man whose life consists of attempting to capture the genuine nature of other peoples'; a film about an ageing man whose expertise seemingly lie with the making sense of other person's existences when his own are nonexistent; a film about a man who takes it upon himself in this chapter f his life which we observe to untangle the communications of two very specific people within when he can barely at all formulate communications for himself. The film is a deft piece of work, a scintillating lower end drama mutating into a conspiracy thriller weaving its way around one man, and his lack of a life, doing his best to save that of two strangers'.Harry Caul (Hackman) is this man - a surveillance expert; someone with many years experience in the job and a large network of colleagues of whom reinvent, practise and hone their craft with an array of gadgets and other such things designed to spy on, infiltrate the lives of as well as generally capture what is required to be captured once designated folk have opened their mouths to speak. The film will open in a manner akin to Coppola's The Godfather, his previous film from the previous year; but where the first of three entries detailing Puzo's life-of-crime piece of fiction began with a slow track outwards from a man's facial features to reveal them speaking, thus encapsulating this notion of a what a suited gangster, shot in medium close up format, should look like before coming outwards to reveal more about the nature of the location and those whom inhabit it, The Conversation veers inwards from a city skyline and all the way up to an individual's face as they sit there eavesdropping.This idea of quite literally moving into a world after beginning with your more standard establishing shot so as to unearth truer natures becomes apparent ? those of whom we listen in on, it is suspected, might be more involved in activity of a more sordid nature than is initially obvious. As we listen on, one of the two speaks of how they feel sorry for the homeless lying there on park benches, and we wonder why it might be that someone seemingly so compassionate would need to be stalked in the first place. The scene is additionally rife with this odd, neo-realistic vibe of people going about their business to what appears to be a true to life background of genuine people, and not extras, making their way through the world and surroundings; this, as Coppola's camera rolls on capturing it all. This parallel between capturing life or the invading of one's privacy through what Hackman's character does and how the non-diegetic camera intrudes on the lives of others comes across as rather prominent.Away from this nature of work, Caul's life is lonely and drab; a life mired in a sense of paranoia or suspicion simmering and waiting to break out. When an escort begins to talk to him and make conversation through questions, he gets agitated and other than this, we observe his low key birthday celebrations as a result of refusing a friendly neighbour's attempts to instigate something special. The real strife begins in Caul's life when he refuses to hand over the piece of film-come-recording he shot during the opening to someone representing his employer. This man is a young and somewhat slimy high-rise dwelling male individual; a man whose badgering and insistent tone that he take the goods off Caul causes us to be wrapped up in Hackman's character's world enough to think that the people with whom he shares the elevator ride back down again exist right there and then to be both wholly afraid and suspicious of, in so much they might, for some maddening reason, know of the precise nature of the aforementioned exchange and will attempt to wrestle the produce away from Caul.The film is a burning, agonising piece; a film so proficient and so workmanlike that, and very much syncing up with what it is those depicted within do, director Coppola has manoeuvred proceedings away from someone living an unglamourous San Francisco based life trudging on with their work and strained friendships and down a path encompassing both real fear and terror that is more broadly representative of a conspiracy thriller. The gear changes and shift changes are executed remarkably, the notions of characters and their distrust with certain prominent figures of such power maintaining a sociological tract of America's distrust with their system at around the time, with a further tract of technology infiltrating one's life and invasion of privacy through gadgets and technology eerily rearing up a whole forty or so years prior to here and now when such things are as prominent as ever. If one were to be mischievous, one could say it was the worst film Coppola made in the period 1970-80; if one were to be honest as one always tries, one would say it is a blinding exercise in atmosphere and tone hitting all the right marks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe the best Seventies paranoia film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The ConversationThis may be the best Seventies paranoia film, chock full of astounding actors: Gene Hackman, John Cazale, Frederic Forest, Cindy Williams, Teri Garr, Harrison Ford, Robert Duvall, and others. This was written and directed in 1974 by Francis Ford Coppola, and Coppola and his actors were at the height of their talents.Hackman plays Harry Caul, a surveillance expert who has caused the death of at least one innocent person and may be on the threshold of the deaths of other innocents. Or maybe not. He's so paranoid, who can tell? Forest and Williams play a young couple who walk around Union Square in San Francisco and have puzzling conversations that only Caul can arrange to surveil. Are they going to be murdered? Or are they just lovers on a lunch break?Hackman gives Caul a soul-wrenching angst that lifts "The Conversation" out of the run of the mill genre like "Three Days of the Condor" and "Night Moves," another Gene Hackman movie. John Cazale, Teri Garr, and Harrison Ford make major contributions to the film as well. The technology, of course, is horribly dated, but this is a character- and paranoia- driven movie, so I'm happy to overlook the equipment.SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER The key to the film is what the couple means when they make a particular statement, which Caul has recorded. Caul listens to it over and over trying to parse it out, but the problem with the film is that Coppola had the statement re-recorded by the actors with different emphases to create the confusion Coppola needs for Caul to feel, instead of having an ambiguous reading of the line to begin with. The meaning changes drastically from our first hearing of the statement to the last because the way the line is said changes drastically. It totally turns the movie around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A strange and fascinating film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harry Validity, a detective whose prestige as a specialist in surveillance and security systems is recognized by his colleagues around the country, is hired by a tycoon to investigate his young wife. Should listen to their talks with an employee of his client, of which seems to be love. The mission, for an expert from his category, is at first sight inexplicable, since the couple offers no interest outside of the flow. However, when Harry terminating his work, warns that something strange is hiding behind the banality that has been investigating, already that his client refuses to identify, using intermediaries...It is a small and staff work of Coppola in the same year that "The Godfather II" and that always said that he was more proud of this thriller. It is a film that only in the 1970 could be done, or at least only in that decade was usual. A film that begins as a research but that, little by little, goes to the tortured emotional instability of a Hackman colossal in the interpretation of this taciturn and solitary catholic who drags the weight of the blame. What really matters at the end of the film is the obsession of the protagonist and not so much the result of its investigations.Coppola, returns to demonstrate his high class as director and the state inspiration was in the 1970 in all the sequences, leaves something to his mastery. The staging is an excellent precision. Only the down and slow zoom of the presentation of the film already worth. The tempo slow Coppola and the contained interpretation of Hackman fit perfectly in this story in which we cannot forget the magnificent interpretation of the secondary, with a young Harrison Ford.The feeling that is at the end is having a film strange, exciting at certain times and claustrophobic in others, a film considered less among the monumental "The Godfather", "The Godfather: Part II" and "Apocalypse Now," but did not disappoint to lovers of good cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From the golden age of paranoia and conspiracy theories</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Can you imagine a major studio giving the green light to a film of this stature today? I don't think so. Just look at when Hackman more or less reprised the role of Harry Caul in Enemy of the State. Tony Scott, jump cuts and Will Smith in the lead. Not that Enemy of the State is a bad movie but it doesn't hold a candle to The Conversation.As much a character study of insecure loner Harry Caul, who has found his perfect vocation in life, as it is a thriller, its pacing is languid compared to contemporary big major studio thrillers. The mid section surveillance conference/party at Cauls warehouse may stretch the patience of those only used to recent action films. Yet while Caul is an industry wide respected surveillance expert he is continuously careless throughout the movie despite his paranoia. Haunted by a referred to previous contract in which people were murdered he becomes obsessed with his current surveillance contract and in this state of mind misreads entirely the intentions of the protagonists captured on his tapes. Along with the outstanding central performance by Hackman also worth mentioning is the melancholy piano score which really adds to the sense of dread and paranoia. A similarity to the also excellent Parallex View is in the capturing on screen of the 1970's architecture of office blocks which are futuristic and yet cold and austere like the plotting conspirators housed within them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A work of genius? Maybe not, quite, but a window to a genius at work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Conversation (1974)There is the movie, and then there is the director, Mr. Coppola. The two are better understood together, because "The Conversation" comes between the first and second of the "Godfather" movies. What release, what diversion, what inner thinking was going on in the making of this very small, very different film?The clues should be found in the product, if possible, not just in the biography, the externals. It's true that all three of these movies (1972-1974) come at the end of the first explosion of New Hollywood, and in Coppola's movies, as with, say Bogdanovich's, there is a the movie buff, the movie student, the movie obsessed inside the director. If the "Godfather" is about the seamless epic with great character acting and terrific mise-en-scene, a full blown extrapolation of the gangster film into modern terms (sex, violence, honesty, and lack of accountability all at hand) "The Conversation" is almost an academic study of how movies can work their way to a fine point. Few people will say this is the better movie, but in many ways it's a more clearly delineated one. It is repetitive to a fault, it has some clumsy scenes in the middle with some caricatured surveillance guys, it has a curiously obtuse center of attention in this couple who don't quite seem to say or do too much of interest, even by the end. But it is interesting, emphasis on the word. It makes you think, what is going on here, rather than just roll back and soak up the scenes and the sweeping drama of the Corleones (or, a little later, of Vietnam in "Apocalypse Now"). Gene Hackman is always impressive, I think, the way Michael Caine is impressive. They inhabit the screen with a consistent persona, utterly at ease even when doing complicated roles requiring emotional nuance. Hackman pulls of many long segments almost singlehandedly. Not that we can disregard Coppola's direction, but even under a different baton, I think Hackman would have been both sympathetic and baffling. His descent into a surrealist madness is quite reasonable, and that's easier said than done.Realizing the movie is not about the central spying activity, but about the mind of this talented but emotionally stunted man, you come to see how it was made a little differently. There is an odd emphasis on things that don't matter, too often and too extended for me, and there are those little extra roles that don't quite click. Maybe the other parts are less believable to enhance the believability of Hackman's performance, but I don't think movies really work like that.Many people will fall asleep to this, quite literally, just as the woman does with the eavesdropped conversation still playing in the room. But others will really click into the mind game, the puzzle of what matters, and what's really going on. A work of genius, maybe not quite, but a window on a genius at work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Union Square, San Francisco. Noontime, December 2, 1972. A mime mimics passersby as a young couple walk around in circles, talking in fragments. We zoom in closer as the woman spies a derelict sleeping on a bench."I always think he was once somebody's baby boy," the woman sighs.We aren't the only ones eavesdropping on this conversation. Harry Caul (Gene Hackman) has two parabolic microphones and a guy carrying a tape recorder following their every move. Why? Don't ask him."I don't care what they're doing," he tells his associate Stan (John Cazale). "All I want is a nice fat recording." But Harry wants something more, it turns out, in this moody paranoia piece by director Francis Ford Coppola, shot between two "Godfathers" that won Best Picture awards and every bit as good as either of them. Not perfect, but very, very good, a film that captures the zeitgeist of the 1970s like a butterfly on a pin. Harry is a professional eavesdropper, yes, "the best bugger on the West Coast," but try as he might, he's not immune from the human mystery of his work.You know you are watching a terrific film when you see Hackman sharing a scene with Robert Duvall and Harrison Ford, the latter in an early role as a weaselly majordomo. You know you are watching a subversive one when the three great actors are being upstaged by a Doberman. "There's not a laugh in the whole movie," Harry is told at one point, perhaps a wink from Francis regarding the heavy subject matter. But it is relevant, what with Watergate exploding at the time of the film's release and the question of surveillance a constant one.I could have done without Allen Garfield's too-heavy turn as a rival of Harry's, or a detour between Harry and his girlfriend (a badly shot Teri Garr) that takes us nowhere. Yes, as many point out here, the main riddle of the film, having to do with the mystery couple and a stray line of conversation Harry picks up, doesn't exactly match up on later reflection. But it doesn't have to, because Coppola establishes early on, by focusing so much on Harry, that what we are dealing with here is subjective, not objective, reality. It's "Rashomon" wired for sound, and a perfect companion piece where reality itself was a twistable thing.Great central work by Hackman, who according to Coppola's commentary track felt miserable in the role of Harry and looks it. Other superlative work includes David Shire's creepy and sad score for solo piano, Walter Murch's editing and sound "design" that captures the title conversation in all its odd, devolving permutations. It's amazing to me how anyone who lived through the 1970s can still totally buy into the enveloping mystery of the story, even if it does feature Han Solo and Shirley Feeney. (Cindy Williams, perhaps a bigger star later that decade than Ford or even Hackman as one-half of TV's "Laverne &amp; Shirley", makes for a great object of Harry's bugging and, eventually, his tragic passion.)In the end, "The Conversation" isn't really about the politics of surveillance, or the individual versus society. It's about a guy who realizes the world he watches has teeth, and that the sad derelict he overhears someone talking about may well be himself. No man is an island, even if some are better off that way."I have nothing personal, nothing of value," Harry tells us. The bitter brilliance of "The Conversation" is Coppola's way of showing us how much better off he would have been had he been right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In-between The Godfather (1972) and The Godfather Part II (1974), Francis Ford Coppola made this techno nerd favorite, a film he had wanted to make for years, but couldn't get the backing until The Godfather gave him the clout. Coppola has said this is the movie of his that he likes best, and Gene Hackman who stars as Harry Caul, the paranoid, nerdish surveillance snoop who suddenly develops a conscience, said it was his favorite role. In the case of Hackman, one can see why. He dominates the screen with a subtle touch and some serious acting skills. In the case of Coppola, well, I'm sure in his heart of hearts he knows he made at least three better films. And of course, "favorite" doesn't mean "best." Because of some glaring plot holes and assorted implausibilities plus a slow pace, this film is not liked by some viewers. But it has a kind of haunting power, partly based on the studied camera work, and partly based on a chilling (and clever) story that explodes in Harry Caul's face and surprises the viewer. Also there is a nice underlying tension that Coppola develops and maintains that makes us want to know what is going on and to find out how it ends.Cindy Williams of TV's "Laverne and Shirley" fame plays Ann, the wife of a Fortune 500 type exec who is being recorded as she has a conversation with a friend as they walk around Central Park. Harry Caul is doing the snooping. It isn't clear why the conversation is important, and even though we hear bits of it again and again, it seems innocent, although one notes, Cindy Williams isn't smiling. As the plot nears denouement, however, we and Harry Caul and the husband, who has hired Caul, realize something is being hidden behind the denotative meaning of the words that are spoken. Part of the intrigue is to catch the real meaning of what is said.The plot holes? Well, it is unlikely that super secret Harry Caul would invite rival snoopers to his studio for a party. He is so paranoid about people knowing his business that he loses his girlfriend Amy (Teri Garr) because he won't give her his phone number or tell her where he lives. And the way he tears up his apartment at the end looking for the hidden bug is silly (but psychologically correct of course since he has gone full blown obsessive). Rationally speaking, he would be better off just moving. I understand that in the original script penned by Coppola, Harry owned the apartment building and that would explain why he chose to tear up his apartment looking for the recording device rather than move somewhere else. And think of the professional challenge! Frankly I didn't mind any of the inconsistencies that viewers have pointed out. Yes, he would suspect that the pen put in his pocket by rival snooper Bernie Moran (Allen Garfield) might be a microphone, and, no, the hidden bug was NOT in his saxophone, but may have been in his eyeglasses (and anyway it doesn't matter). What I didn't like were the dream sequences that you couldn't separate from reality. I also didn't like the pristine clean toilet in room 773 that overflowed with bright red blood when he flushes it. Not likely, when you think about it.But none of this matters. This is an intriguing film with a significant theme, namely that the invasion of privacy has consequences, which is as relevant today as it was then. Look for a young Harrison Ford as Martin Stett, the exec's assistant, and for Elizabeth MacRae as a caloric-challenged seductress. But by all means see this for Francis Ford Coppola, one of the greats. The Conversation is rated #169 at the Internet Movie Database. It's a must see for Coppola fans.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!" Get it at Amazon!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thriller as well as a study of human nature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I don't know about human nature", says Harry Caul at one point in the movie; but the truth is we will be given the chance to look closely to his true nature and reach interesting conclusions in "The conversation", a surprising and highly recommendable mix of thriller and character-based drama.Harry Caul is one of the best and most renowned experts in private surveillance. He has been hired to record a conversation between a young couple, who are related to a mysterious (and very rich) businessman, and hand in the tapes to his client, the businessman in question. But Harry is not all convinced about this particular job; he fears the consequences of sharing what he knows with his client.I won't give more details about the plot; I'll just say that, at the same time we follow Harry in his increasing obsession about the conversation he has heard and its possible meaning, we get to learn more and more about his personality, which is revealed in small but meaningful details. And his personality is the ultimate key fact as to how the story will develop and eventually reach a very revealing ending.This is no ordinary thriller. Don't expect a lot of action, violence, or scares. But the tension is elegantly and convincingly built up, and the ending will make you think and reach your own conclusions. I definitely recommend this gem by Francis Ford Coppola, deserving of much more credit than it has.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant Character Study</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a brilliant study on obsessive and paranoid behavior and the effect technology has in our lives and society in general. It's about a surveillance expert, Harry Caul, who has a crisis of conscience when he suspects that a couple he is spying on will be murdered. This had happened before and he feels very guilty about it. But can he really know what's happening, or did he lose something with the capture of the sound? Or is his mind playing tricks on him? This has a brilliant screenplay. The leading character is fascinating, and the other characters are seen by his distorted eyes in a frightening way. The dialogs, especially the conversation the title mentions, are mind blowing, meaningful and hold clues to what's going to happen. The pace of the movie is just right and it keeps you guessing and on the edge of your seat. The story is interesting, reflective and intelligent, and all the touchy subjects the movie talks about are spoken of with sensibility, even if sometimes they can make you feel uncomfortable. You get to a point in which you don't know what's reality and what isn't, making this thought provoking. It's simply a great screenplay.The acting is all at least above average. Gene Hackman gives his tortured, paranoid, character complexity and sincerity. He disappears into his part and you believe everything he does. He gives the character vulnerability and his acting is one of the main things that made me see the story by his point of view. Frederick Forrest and Cindy Williams do a good job in creating dream-like characters in just one scene, and Cindy Williams has an amazing delivery of her lines. John Cazale makes his character likable and has a convincing chemistry with Hackman. Harrison Ford makes a good impression in playing the bad guy, with his soft spoken ways and strong eye expression that contrast.The direction is amazing. Francis Ford Coppola not only gets great performances from the casting, but he chooses meaningful camera angles, giving his movie an unique feeling, and gets the best work from the crew. The angles he chooses suggest an invisible presence, peeking into Harry Caul's life. They can be truly claustrophobic and make you know the characters' feelings. They give you a sense of space and time the way it's experienced by Caul.The technicals are all great. The sound plays a huge part in this movie, and it's intelligently manipulated. It connects with the images during the conversation itself in an original fashion, in a different rhythm, volume and tone than reality, showing us Harry's point of view and how what we hear is not always what is there. The cinematography, with all the dark, dirty colors works in showing us Harry's trip to a personal hell and the sudden flashes of red-the hotel scene-are shocking and used hauntingly. The editing gives the movie its exciting, but reflective pace. I really recommend this. It's thought provoking, technically brilliant and haunting.</fullReview>

It's meant to be a modern classic and having Francis Ford Coppola's name on it doesn't hurt its chances, but whenever I've tried to watch it I have found it so slow and boring each time, I have just given up and switched it off.I like Gene Hackman. He's a great actor who is either excellent in everything or at least interesting. He chooses his roles well, in fact, now that he has been around for many decades (the oldest movie I've seen him in is 60's classic Bonne and Clyde) one can say with much certainty that the length of his career isn't just down to his acting talent and energy, it's also down to his intelligence and excellent taste in picking roles.I just wish he hadn't chosen this one.

		<fullReview>In "The Conversation", a character study is used to consider the ease with which ordinary people's privacy can be invaded, the role that technology plays in facilitating this and the degree to which those who work in the surveillance industry should be held responsible for the consequences of their actions. The increasing use of equipment to monitor people's everyday lives naturally creates an atmosphere of distrust and suspicion and is ultimately shown to have a deleterious effect on the lives of everyone involved.The timing of the release of this film was fortuitous because it pre-dated Richard Nixon's resignation from the Presidency in the wake of the Watergate scandal and capitalised on the widespread interest that existed in the subject of wire-tapping etc at that time. "The Conversation", however, had actually been written some years before and was consequently more prescient than most people would have realised. Remarkably, the ethical issues associated with the on-going and insidious erosion of personal privacy are just as pertinent today, as the advent of the internet, social networking and CCTV cameras have added to the types of concerns expressed in this film.Harry Caul (Gene Hackman) is a private surveillance expert who's hired to record a conversation between a man and a woman who spend their lunchtime together in San Francisco's Union Square. As the woman is Harry's employer's wife, the purpose of the assignment appears to be to gather information about the existence of an affair. After working on three recordings of the conversation to produce a single coherent one, Harry becomes disturbed by the remark "he'd kill us if he got the chance" because this suggests that by handing in the finished tape to his employer, Harry could be putting the couple's lives in danger.Harry's a consummate professional widely known as "the best bugger on the West Coast". He keeps his private and professional lives entirely separate and also makes it his practice not to concern himself about the content of any of his recordings. The reason why he finds it impossible to abide by his own standards in this case is because of the intense guilt he feels about one of his previous assignments which led to the deaths of three innocent people. Harry's employer is an extremely powerful corporate executive simply known as "The Director" (Robert Duvall) and a man who, he has no doubt, would have the means to commission such a crime. Some unexpected developments linked to his assignment then cause Harry further anguish at a time when his private life is already falling apart at an alarming rate.Harry is a man who's obsessed about his own privacy to the point where he's fearful of disclosing information about his job or where he lives to his girlfriend and immediately becomes nervous when he realises that his landlady has a spare key to his apartment. He lives a very solitary existence but on the one occasion when he relaxes his guard and entertains some colleagues at his workshop, he feels humiliated by a rival who bugs one of his conversations with a woman who subsequently steals his tapes after sleeping with him. This experience reinforces his need to protect himself from other people and the possibility of his own privacy being violated.Gene Hackman is tremendous in his role as Harry Caul as his posture and often haunted appearance, makes his paranoia and loneliness perfectly clear. His awkwardness with others is a manifestation of his innate distrust of everybody and contributes powerfully to his inability to maintain good relationships with even his girlfriend and his assistant. The work of the supporting cast is also consistently good.Francis Ford Coppola who wrote, produced and directed "The Conversation" has often acknowledged the influence that Michelangelo Antonioni's "Blow Up" had on him during the period when he was working on this movie. The most obvious similarity between the two movies is the style in which the stories are told. Information is imparted in a manner which is often cryptic and ambiguous and repetition features strongly. This style is extremely effective in "The Conversation" because it places the audience in the same situation as Harry in trying to understand the meanings of his recordings and thereby creates some empathy with this tragic character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well written and well acted masterpiece of the 1970s.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Filmed in between his first two "Godfather" films, Francis Ford Coppola's "The Conversation" is indeed one of the most striking and intriguing productions of the 1970s. Above all else, it's a study of one character, an obsessive surveillance expert named Harry Caul (Gene Hackman). He's been hired to spy on a young couple, Ann and Mark (Cindy Williams and Frederic Forrest) by a mysterious "Director". He comes to believe that the young couple is in danger and decides to take a chance on becoming personally involved in the case. What motivates him is the guilt that he feels over a past case that had led to some deaths. "The Conversation" is a story of not only guilt, but personal responsibility and paranoia, and as such is one of the best films of Coppola's career. It takes a good look into the entire surveillance business, at the types of characters that inhabit it, the kinds of gadgets they use to ply their trade, and the lives they lead. It also features a scenario where things aren't as they appear. It doesn't really spend too much time on Harry's main dilemma but uses the premise to create lots of good individual moments. Hackman is excellent in the lead, delivering a low key, nuanced performance, and the supporting cast is full of talent. John Cazale is highly engaging as Harry's partner, as is Michael Higgins as another of his associates. Williams and Forrest are actually not in the movie that much but a certain amount of mystery surrounds them - what could make them so important? It's irresistible to see a young Harrison Ford as the Director's all-business assistant. Teri Garr is wonderful as Harry's briefly seen girlfriend, Allen Garfield has a juicy role as one of Harry's competitors, and Robert Duvall appears uncredited as the Director. The film is a great technical achievement as well, especially for sound re-recordist Walter Murch, and the score by David Shire is perfect; Hackman did his own saxophone playing as accompaniment. Overall it's a film very much of its time, perfectly capturing the distrust that people felt. The ending is particularly resonant as Harry is able to deal with the consequences of his actions and even find that despite his situation he's got a good handle on things for once. Even at an hour and 54 minutes, this never feels as long as it is, remaining a compelling experience through and through. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gangplank Movie ReviewThe Conversation Francis Ford Coppola - 1974After finishing of the Godfather in 1972, Frank Ford had enough juice with Paramount to get the money for Gene Hackman's finest hour playing Harry Caul, a surveillance specialist caught up in a murder rap. Caul's the self-tortured "best in the business" according to rival bugger Bernie Moran, brilliantly brought to cruddy life by Allen Garfield. The trade show scene sizzles as Bernie peddles his wares with polyester aplomb. Also annoying audiences is John Cazale, Caul's persnickety, cantankerous and lovable assistant. His betrayal is gleefully washed away in a sea of booze and bimbos, the greatest, lamest party in the history of San Francisco. Harrison Ford plays a weird bureaucrat, Robert Duvall an adequate angry old guy, Teri Garr a supine concubine. Harry's transparent raincoat complements her white tube socks in a hideously enthralling love scene. Plenty of mental, Catholic nightmare cerebral stuff going on between the eardrums of our hero. Allen Ginsberg and Fred Flintstone cameo on a hotel room TV as Hackman, fresh from the French Connection, goes fetal. An absolute must see. Some audio trickery with the script's Big Line elicit expansive and boring apologies on the DVD by Frank and Sound Designer/Editor Walt Murch. A piano movie.John Veit</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coppola's most underrated film: The definitive psychological thriller !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a masterpiece in almost every way. First of all the performances are entirely magnificent. This film easily ranks proudly among Coppola's very very best and it is a wonder it is not more widely recognized. Coppola produced a brilliantly wrote screenplay for this film ,which he also expertly directs with a precise and correct amount of balance between tension and despair. In this picture, we see Harry Caul(Hackman) struggle with this latest job he's got in surveillance through the film. The casting of this film is amazingly good. Every actor and actress casted fulfilled their retrospective role's immensely well delivering a great sense of believability.Gene Hackman does excellent acting as Harry Caul. A career best in my Opinion. And for me to say that, regarding Gene Hackman shows how good I think his performance is. Hackman is quite, reserved and methodical in every movement as Caul at first, showing us Caul as the constant professional. A man who is always on the guard, and protects his personal privacy with the utmost care.As his world untwines in this great masterpiece, we see Caul's front as a man in control disintegrate.Past mistakes in his specialized line of work leave him querying his position regarding this current job he has in the film. He wonders how this particularly sensitive surveillance case will affect the people at the centre of it . Caul becomes wracked by guilt, immersed in deep reflection on that previous case gone wrong. A truth he hid from himself for so long becomes apparent: That his work Can affect people gravely. He loses belief in that strong doctrine of his that the lead on affects of his actions are not his responsibility; that after all He is just a man doing his job. He becomes emotionally attached to this particular case and as a result drops that vital control he coveted of ironically his own privacy whilst trying to figure out the details of the people he listen's persistently to on the tapes he recorded for his current job. . Hackmans performance shows Harry Caul's deep guilt and disintegration into despair wonderfully in Caul's world of ever growing paranoia. Harrison Ford as Martin Street is great too as a deceptive and cunning supposed aide to the man who commissioned Caul for this assignment that so deeply effects him. John Cazale also does very good work here acting as Stan, Harry Caul's loyal assistant, who becomes somewhat perplexed and annoyed at Harry's obsession with their latest job which he can't quite comprehend. Frederick Forrest and Cindy Williams deliver good performances in small but significant roles as well as Also notably Allen Garfield.Garfield does real nice work here as the desperately sleazy Rival surveillance expert, Bernie Moran trying to suss out Caul's seemingly renowned technique used for a particularly good job in the past that Caul himself would much rather forget than discuss at length. Caul protects his methods with the same exactness he executes them with. Even when Stan his assistant utters a slight clue to Moran when their in his company, he reacts angrily . He has to maintain that self privacy in his work and life. All in all, This film has a great ensemble cast as I have commented on previously, full of wonderful performances crowned of course by the cream at the top...Hackman.The way the plot unravels in this film is outstanding. Anyone who has not had the pleasure of seeing this gem should go see it immediately! It's not a film you see on too many all time best's list, but it was an absolute joyful watch for me on a dreary new years eve at home. In it we see a director and leading man absolutely at the the top of their game. I stand by my opinion that this is Hackman magnum opus. He's plays Caul with a great tense power rarely seen. We see a quite and controlled man realistically transform into a man mired with great guilt,tension,paranoia and finally despair. There is a great style in this film also. The set of Caul's workshop is excellently believable and the opening scene is marvelous. And of course Coppola doesn't drop the ball as he never let's a frame of film seem irrelevant here,letting Harry Caul's story move along at a fine pace . This is a realistic thriller film wonderfully executed. This is cinema at it's very best. MY PERSONAL FAVORITE FILM.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What happened?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was executed brilliantly, and the ending sequences were extremely terrifying due to the paranoid nature of the film. I have a very hard time, however, figuring out what is purely Caul's overactive imagination and what is the reality. When Caul sees the blood overflowing from the toilet, this seems to be a figment of his imagination.The prior scene, however, when Caul witnesses the murder and hears the shriek of the women who is supposedly dying, appears to be actually real. This scene made me jump and cry out while watching the film, which has really never happened to me while watching any other film. It is truly amazing. My real question is how do we tell what is real and what is Caul's imagination?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw The Conversation for the very first time this past week. I was surprised to notice that Francis Ford Coppola had directed the film. I grew up knowing who Coppola was because of famous movies that he had done such as The Godfather, The Godfather Part 2, The Godfather Part 3, Apocalypse Now. The Conversation was not a movie that I was familiar with but I was open-minded because of Coppola. I also noticed that it had some accomplished actors in the leading roles. Gene Hackman plays the main character, a professional "bugger" named Harry Caul who spies on people for money. The film also featured John Cazale as Caul's assistant Stan, Cindy Williams as Ann, the women on whom Caul is spying, and a young Harrison Ford playing Martin Stett, assistant to the business executive who is paying Caul. There was also a pleasant cameo appearance by Robert Duvall playing the business executive.The film begins and progresses slowly and begins with the conversation that gave the film its title. Not much is known from the beginning about what the conversation is about or about the characters themselves. We finally get to know Harry a little bit when he goes home to his apartment. When we see him go to his door, he unlocks several locks in order to enter his apartment. Immediately we get the feeling that this person is extremely paranoid. He finds a wrapped bottle of wine inside his door and immediately calls whom we assume is the landlord to complain about how she entered the apartment. Harry tells her that he wants the only key to him apartment and no one else. We can tell that Harry is paranoid, secretive, and he does not trust people. This seems very ironic because his business is robbing people of the same security that he treasures so much. This irony becomes more prominent as the film progresses.Eventually, Caul makes a startling discovery when listening to the tapes of the conversation. He hears the words, "He'd kill us if he got the chance." Hearing this, Caul wrestles with whether to give the tapes to his employer. He does not want to be an accessory to murder. Finally, the tapes are taken from Caul while he sleeps and they are given to the director. Caul goes to pick up his money and we finally meet Caul's employer, the director (Robert Duvall) and her learns that Ann is the director's wife. Now Caul must decide what he is going to do about the information he has received. Does he try to stop the murder he thinks will happen? Is the murder even real? Is he reading too much into the conversation? All of these questions plague Caul up until the end of the movie.As it turns out, Caul did misinterpret the conversation, but it was not about whether there was going to be a murder, but rather who was going to be murdered. He learns that it was not Ann who was killed but the director. Ann, and her acquaintance Mark (Frederic Forrest), set up the director and killed him, making it look like a car accident. With the director's death, Ann gets everything he had. The whole thing was a ploy by a greedy wife, her lover, and an executive assistant. After learning the truth, Caul realizes that there is not much he can do about the situation. He decides to go home and, while playing the saxophone, he receives a phone call from Martin Stett telling Caul that they know he knows and they will be listening to him. Caul, being paranoid, rips his apartment apart searching for bugs and he does not find any. The final scene is haunting with Caul, sitting down, playing his saxophone, with his apartment in ruins, a victim of his own way of life. He spied on people to make a living and now he is the one being spied on, probably for the rest of his life.The film, technically speaking, is very well done. Coppola does a great job directing and writing an interesting and engaging story. He also creates an interesting character in Harry Caul. Caul seems paranoid, secretive, and unwilling to let people get close to him. This is why I believe that Caul will be alone for the rest of his life. The film was made during the Watergate years where the surveillance tactics of the government were in question. Many people were afraid of there civil liberties were being infringed on, not unlike the situation today with terrorism. Today, we are dealing with the same problem when deciding whether we want to give up civil liberties in order to be safe from terrorists. The cinematography of the film is interesting. In Caul's apartment, the camera-work is done to make us believe that we are in the camera that is spying on Caul and, indeed, that is the case when the film ends. The sound in the film, as one might expect, is superb and the acting is great as well. You truly believe that Gene Hackman is Harry Caul. The Conversation is a great film of the 1970s, one of Coppola's greatest films, and not one that should be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great moviemaking, good-movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coppola captures perfectly the theme of paranoid intrigue so prevalent in the Vietnam-Watergate wake of the early 1970s. What's more, you never see Gene Hackman acting; you see a middle-aged loser who never got a life and compensates with his bugging equipment.That equipment has aged but the bugging ethos has sprouted in today's global, digital age. ANYONE can do these things today, not just some anonymous suits in a windowless office. The digital economy has spread eavesdropping all over the world to virtually everyone.On the other hand, that digital economy has also provided the ways to deal with it; in some strange way the ability for anyone to bug has dissipated the paranoia. That no one in 1974 could or would have imagined so, no more than they could imagine the fall of the Berlin Wall, is what has really aged this movie, But to talk about the movie: Someone once said that you can see more of a building when it's half-finished than when it's finished. Clearly inspired by Blowup (1966) and likewise a favorite of film-school professors everywhere, this is a "director's film" with the usual clichéd traits:* Slow pacing* One interesting character.* Stretched-out character development that could have been done in the first act.* Obscure meaning we're supposed to interpret.* Scenes that don't move the story along.* Great cinematography.* Neat plot twist at the end, instead of earlier or throughout on which to build the story* Director, and not the characters, tell the story.* Clever cinematic tricks and angles.Nonetheless, I bought a copy. I won't call it a great movie but I will call it great moviemaking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sphinx without a secret</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film may have garnered high praise and many awards, but is it..all...that...interesting? The Gene Hackman character, who does not just dominate the movie, but who IS the whole movie, is very secretive, shuns contact with other people, but what is he hiding? He's the sexless equivalent of a tease, making a huge fuss about his privacy but not having any secret facts or emotions to be private about. To speak plainly, he is dull. Not only is he an empty shell to begin with, he never develops or surprises us. We feel we have been led up the garden path, taken on a confidential mission at the end of which we are just told goodbye without anything happening.Yes, there is a bit of plot, in the form of the adulterous couple whom Hackman is paid to shadow. But his struggle to disrupt his own secrecy and the switch at the end that shows us that Harry has deceived himself- -these are not nearly enough to fill up the emptiness of the movie. The premise of the film and the San Francisco setting reminded me a bit of a Ross Macdonald novel. The differences are that Macdonald would have had an interesting, witty hero, and either the plot twist would have been dealt with about a quarter of the way through, or it would have been one of a dozen clever misunderstandings and missed connections. The Conversation, by comparison, is a pale and feeble piece of work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Caul(Gene Hackman)is a man with relationship issues in this excellent directorial effort from Coppola. He is the best in the surveillance field. A man who has learned not to trust anyone. Caul's mood swings are what the viewer grows to live with. For a major part of the movie, Caul is shown listening to a conversation which he had recorded for a client we simply know as the 'Director'. John Cazale plays a prominent role in this movie as the person who works for him. This movie proceeds at a very slow pace to build a superb momentum at the finale. I would recommend this movie for the following reasons:1. Gene Hackman's portrayal of Caul is authentic and superb. I cant imagine anybody else in the role. 2. Harrison Ford. He plays Stett, a man who is in constant conflict with Caul. He looks very young and refreshing.3. The cute cameo from Teri Garr. 4. And finally, the surprise that awaits you at the end :).Enjoy the movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Coppola's Most Personal Project and It Shows!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Francis Ford Coppola remarked that The Conversation is the most personal project he's done, and that really comes across on screen. I suggest that any movie lover watches this movie attentively and with appreciation for the personal nature of this project.There are many that have reviewed this movie and called it "overrated" "boring", "slow-moving" etc.I don't think that that is very fair. It is clear from the nature of their reviews that they're not "giving the director their time". That is to say, if you sign up to watch a movie, you must realize that you are giving some of your life to the running time of the movie and the Director. What's important is what the Director does with that time, not what he does with your very personal expectations and wants out of the movie.With all of that in mind, The Conversation is great. It is a character study, a morality tale, a comment on technology and society, and a thriller all wrapped into one movie. And YES, Coppola takes his time building it and it is a bit slow-moving. But that doesn't make it bad at all. It is Coppola's personal story to tell, and he goes about telling it the way he likes.Go in understanding that, and you'll enjoy The Conversation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some have Said that this is Director Coppola's most Underrated Movie. Nominated for Three Oscars (including Best Picture), and Critically Acclaimed, it is a Weak Case. "Tucker: A Man and His Dreams" (1988) is Probably His most Underseen and Overlooked.Gene Hackman is the Focal Point of this Character Study with Technology as Villain, and the Viewer is Drawn to Hackman's 'Harry Caul" in every Scene. As a Dull, ironically Conversation Less Surveillance Pro, with His Outdated Clothes and Oddball Demeanor, He Nevertheless is a Magnet that Attracts Attention in the Frame.Paranoia was Beginning to become a National Personality Trait by the Mid-1970's, what with the Trifecta Assassination Coup in the Sixties (Kennedy, King, and Kennedy), the Vietnam War, and Watergate, it comes as No Surprise.One of the many Interesting Shots, is of Harry's Team on the Job situated in an Upper Floor Opened Window, pointing what Looks like a Rifle (complete with scope) and it is non other than a Directional Mike. Privacy Killed by Technology with Elitist Efficiency and Disregard for Citizen's Rights.A Good Cast and Crackerjack Production make this Cerebral Cinema at its Best. Captivating, Suspenseful, and Extremely well Crafted, this Film is a Testament that Captures the Time with its Mood, Understatement, and Sharp Characterizations.A Must See for Anyone Interested in Cinema as Art and Social Criticism, Fine Acting, and Especially for Affectionados of the "Slow Burn".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brooding exercise in psychological horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow! Despite being a classic movie, not many people have actually heard about this one, even though it gets brilliant reviews from just about anybody who's seen it. Noticing in the schedules that it was on in the middle of one night, I decided to set my VCR to record and see what Gene Hackman could do for me. I wasn't disappointed. Having seen ENEMY OF THE STATE when it first came out at the cinema, I was surprised at how alike the two films are and specifically the identical characters that Hackman plays in both - even down to the same deserted warehouse being used as a hideout. ENEMY OF THE STATE can be considered an unofficial sequel, and while it's a lot flashier, more exciting and more hi-tech, THE CONVERSATION is still the most gripping film of the two, a powerful and disturbing look into one man's psyche as he suffers a nervous breakdown from being overly paranoid.A different kind of horror is portrayed here: psychological horror. Hackman gives a superb performance, a subtle and moving study of a man haunted by paranoia. In the end it gets so that even his friends and associates can't be trusted. You can't really blame Hackman for getting so wound up, as he IS caught up in the middle of a conspiracy fronted by the sinister Harrison Ford. I hadn't realised that Ford was in any films before that little sci-fi picture but here he plays it coolly and coldly as a businessman who may be involved in murder. Robert Duvall gives a creepy cameo while other familiar faces pad out the cast - particularly noticeable the late John Cazale.Even though little actually happens during the film's course, and the running time is lengthy, it grips the interest all the way through. Hackman's obsession is to be his ultimate downfall and it's difficult to watch as his sanity begins to slip. Indeed, his systematic search of an empty apartment is heavy with suspense, even though there is nothing there. Hackman's final hallucination of a toilet overflowing with blood is potent horror image, simple yet effective. And, dare I say it, the film actually manages to be extremely frightening, especially in a key scene where he ventures out onto his balcony to see a bloody murder being committed next door.The film plays it ambiguously, never saying one way or the other as to whether the events are all in Hackman's head or really happening to him. The final image - of a destroyed Hackman sitting in his destroyed apartment, playing a saxophone - is a great way to end what is a superb little film. Wholeheartedly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest films ever made about the problem of surveillance!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unfortunately, it appears with every passing day that the great American paranoid political thrillers of the 60's and 70's, with its strongest work bookended by 'The Manchurian Candidate' (eerily foreseeing the JFK assassination) and 'All the President's Men' (placing a coda of closure on the Watergate scandal), simply haven't aged a day, and are as timely as ever in conceptualizing the palpable fear that ordinary citizens have in those in control of their destinies, namely the police and government of their communities. It's the American ideal that any person born, regardless of circumstances, is in control of their destiny, and that with hard work, guile and determination, can make something of himself. Whether that was ever the case is questionable, but it seems more than ever that the people in power are in control of way more than we could ever suppose, or would ever want to know.This was a nice smaller-scale film that, incredulously, Coppola was able to dish up in a run that is one of the finest a director would ever have, up there with Hitchcock's in the late 50's-early 60's, and Melville a decade later. It's definitely excellent work by Hackman (along with his Popeye Doyle in the pair of great 'French Connection' movies), and is up there with the greatest dissertations ever about the double-edged sword of surveillance, namely De Palma's 'Blow Out' and Antonioni's 'Blow-Up'.As a human being, I only wish this film wasn't as important as it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coppola's forgotten unnerving personal masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers in the second to last paragraph the rest is spoiler freeFrancis Ford Coppola was the king of American filmmaking during the 70s. His films Apocalypse Now and the two Godfather films are considered to be some of they greatest American films ever made, and rightly so. They are sprawling massive cinematic achievements that are perfectly executed. But unfortunately these great films overshadowed another smaller more personal film he made during that same decade, that film was The Conversation.The Conversation is about surveillance expert Harry Caul, (played by Gene Hackman.) who runs his own private company, which will investigate anyone you want them to. He's been hired to investigate a man and woman as they walk around a crowded park by the director of some large corporation. Eventually Harry becomes worried that the people he's investigating might be killed with the information he's discovered. From then on we enter the paranoid twisted world of Harry Caul. The Conversation is an excellent film about paranoia. The film came out at the height of the Watergate scandal, but Francis Ford Coppola says the inspiration for the film was Michelangelo Antonioni's Blow Out. But the film does definitely fit in with the paranoia and distrust of that era, Harry Caul even uses the same equipment that the Nixon Administration used. But the film does not have any message criticizing the political state at the time, that wasn't what it intended to do. The Conversation was supposed to be about a man questioning the morality of his job. Francis Ford Coppola has said that The Conversation was his most personal film, and that's basically true, it's not as complex or epic as something like The Godfather or Apocalypse. No instead it is a simpler more human film. Not to say that The Godfather and Apocalypse Now are bad but they are not as intimate as The Conversation. Gene Hackman gained popularity after winning the best actor Oscar for starring as Jimmy Doyle in The French Connection in 1971. This is incredibly ironic because he wasn't nominated for The Conversation, even though his performance in The Conversation is far superior to his performance in The French Connection. The character of Harry Caul is week, timid, and he has a guilty conscience, all of which are very unusual for a Francis Ford Coppola protagonist. Harry Caul is also a character of several contradictions, like for example Harry is called the best in his field, and yet a competitor is able to plant a bug on him during a convention. Or when his lover asks for him to tell her a secret and he reply's that he has none, she says "I'm a secret." Yes Harry Caul is a complex character and somehow Hackman is able to pull of a performance that is not only believable but sympathetic. The cinematography in The Conversation is largely responsible for where the films sense of paranoia comes from. The opening shot sets the tone immediately. A telephoto lens shows a large crowd in a city park, and slowly zooms in on a couple walking in the huge crowd. The opening was shot by Haskell Wexler, (One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?) who was than fired because of personal differences with Coppola and replaced with Bill Butler. (Jaws) Throughout the film the cinematography itself is unnerving. Like how it will wait for a character to walk of screen before it begins to mechanically follow them like a security camera, this combined with sown of the films creepy sets and how we're often left alone with Harry at crucial moments in the film, give the audience a feeling that Harry is being watched. And he's missing some piece of the puzzle. Next paragraph contains spoilers, skip it if you haven't seen the film yet.Everything about to the ending to The Conversation could not be more perfect. When Harry goes to the hotel and taps their room and when he later goes in their room, and when he tries to see the director, and when he's looking for the bug in his apartment. It could not have been better conceived or executed. There are several interpretations to the ending, manly surrounding which parts are real and which parts Harry imagined. Was the blood in the toilet real? Did the women really kill her husband? It's difficult to tell from what we're given. But considering the fact that Harry jumped to conclusions throughout the film and just generally had an "active" imagination. I would lean towards the side that says that most if not all of what we see did not happen. Also the way Coppola is able to completely change the meaning of the line, "He'll kill us if he gets the chance you know," by putting emphasis on different words, is just amazing.The Conversation was nominated for 3 academy awards including best picture and original screenplay, (the winners of both these categories were actually Coppola's The Godfather: Part II) when it was released. But luckily it won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival that year. In 1995 it was selected to by the library of Congress to be preserved in the United States National Film Registry. And got added to Roger Ebert's Great Movies in 2001. Even with all of its recognition it is still overlooked when people consider Coppola's work. I put off watching this film for a long time because I assumed it wasn't going to be as good as some of his other films. Don't make the same mistakes that I did.9.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Harry Caul (Gene Hackman) is surveillance expert in San Francisco. He is very professional and stays away from the content of what he's recording. He is extremely private and paranoid about being watched. He's a devout Catholic and a jazz lover. He has no friends other than business associate Stan (John Cazale). He's secretive even with girlfriend Amy Fredericks (Teri Garr). Director (Robert Duvall) hired him to spy on couple Ann and Mark. Martin Stett (Harrison Ford) tries to get the tapes but Caul refuses. They bring back a bunch of fellow investigators attending the surveillance convention and it's revealed that he's haunted by an incident in New York. He become concerned about what is going to happen to Ann and Mark.This is a really fascinating character. It taps into the 70s paranoia about technology and surveillance. What starts as fascinating technical idea turns into a deeply disturbed personal struggle. It doesn't give easy answers. The audience strains to understand what's going on in the case. That's part of the appeal from Francis Ford Coppola. He lays out the cards but doesn't necessarily explain them.</fullReview>

The plot is great and really plays with the viewer's psychology, leading to a genuine feeling of foreboding. Great support too not only from John Cazale but also from Harrison Ford, who is genuinely creepy. The whole thing adds up to a couple of hours well spent. Look out for an uncredited performance from Robert Duvall. As for the soundtrack, it does very well to keep the viewer on edge and again adds to the overall experience. The ending is absolutely great, as Caul becomes ever more paranoid and ultimately unravels. Great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to believe that Francis Ford Coppola made this film in between the first two Godfather films. He completely owned the 70's in terms of just making hit after hit after hit. The Conversation is just another critically acclaimed film in his long list of all time greats. But it was also an impeccably timed film as it was right at the heart of the Watergate scandal at the white house along with the world finding out and freaking out about wiring and bugging homes. And there's something to be said about films that speak to real life scenarios.The story centers around Mr. Caul, played by Gene Hackman, who goes into a mental frenzy after bugging a couple walking in a park. I love the way the film starts, having the credits roll as we watch and listen to them walk in and around this park. The process of tapping the targets was interesting but I would have liked to have seen more of that process. What we do get is a look into how much a process like this can get to a person. And how much just the way someone says something can change an entire conversation. The emphasis on words becomes extremely important throughout this film. We get many scenes with Hackman showcasing the horrors of doing something like this puts you through. As of matter of fact this movie can be looked at as a hidden horror film. But at it's core, it's a politically charged mystery thriller.We also get supporting performances from John Cazale, Harrison Ford, Teri Garr, and even Robert Duvall. It's Hackman's film, but everyone gives a good performance. Complimented by a haunting score by David Shire, The Conversation is one of the more disturbing films that isn't supposed to be disturbing. It goes to show you just how small you can be even when you feel like you're in charge.+Hackman's hopeless and disturbed performance +Haunting score+Supporting cameos and performances +Ominous feeling -Like to see more of the bugging process 8.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Clever Character Study</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harry Caul is a recluse, and he takes his isolation to the next level. Early on we find out he needs the security that only he has access to his apartment and that he does not like being called. He has a paranoia of being watched which makes perfect sense: Harry Caul works on surveillance and listens in on people's conversations for clients.Caul isn't likable since, like on-screen characters such as Sorkin's version of Mark Zuckerberg or the infamous Scrooge of A Christmas Carol, he is so caught up in his work that he does not connect with people very well. In fact, there is a great lack of dialogue between Caul and other characters within the film - he talks a lot about himself in a dream sequence, and that is the most information we get directly from him; otherwise, he is the unreliable narrator we see so often in the noir genre.If not connecting with people is unlikable, it gets worse; we learn from a story told by one of Caul's rivals that one job Caul had in the past resulted in the death of three people. The worst part? Caul didn't care about this nasty result - he simply did his job which the client asked for. People are not relevant to him, so why should he care? But he has a second chance with the story of this film; he assumes a woman will be harmed and makes it his responsibility to protect her. After his attempt to do so there is a major twist which I will not reveal because it shifts the meaning of the film altogether.The conclusion may be hard to accept or like because it is pessimistic and somewhat abrupt, but it is important to note Caul ultimately gets what he deserves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best film ever made to be upstaged in the same year by the exact same director. The Conversation is a phenomenal film. A triumph by Coppola. The final 20 minutes is absolutely bone-chilling. In a day and age where our privacy is waining (NSA, net neutrality), this film couldn't be more relevant. It's going to stick with you for a very long time. Gene Hackman, an actor known for his theatrics, is toned down here to an almost Chaplin-like effect, and he is still incredible. There is so much to say, and so little I feel like writing down. You just need to see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good acting, an intriguing story and a thriller soundtrack.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The acting was pretty good, though I did not really relate to any of the characters that much. Gene Hackman does a good job as an anti- social person who respects his privacy, ironic since he invades other's for a living. The rest of the cast was all right too, though the main focus is on Hackman's character and the other's are just transitory. Harrison Ford is really young in this, so much so that I didn't recognize him.The story is at first really intriguing. We get shots of this couple in the Square, but the sounds we hear are disjointed. Then the scenes are repeated and we hear different sounds, sounds that get clearer. That was a really interesting juxtaposition and pleasantly surprised me. I also loved the juxtapositions of Caul toying with his machines and the images of the couple's conversation happening. However, since he had no images to pair the sound with, there is some discrepancy there. How would he know he's missing dialogue if it's just sound he's listening to? Anyway, it was still cool.Speaking of the sound, the soundtrack near the end was really superb. It did it's job of getting my heart racing like mad and complemented the scenes fantastically. I could feel my body tensing up, it was such a thriller element.After the initial beginning the story slows down and around the middle there is a lot of talk and not much action. I did not really understand what the talk was all about and got bored for a bit there. I know it's crucial for character development, but there was too much of a lull. Things picked up again at the end though.Also, the ending was good but I don't really comprehend why it ended like that. OK, maybe now that I think about it I think I know what happened. However, I needed some help from the internet; maybe I wasn't as invested in the film as I should've been.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good idea, one of Coppola's better works</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite works of Coppola, I feel it did not get the credit it deserved. That may partly be because it was overshadowed by his two blockbusters, Godfather part I and II. Coppola stays true to his shooting style in this movie, the obscure camera angles give a really big brother feel. The back story about Caul is said to have been based on Coppola's himself. HIs obsession with gadgets and science is something that Coppola also enjoyed as a child. This movie was very personal to Coppola, it is evident in his incorporation of himself. As a B-movie, he obviously did not get a huge budget from American Zoetrope, the movie was thrown together. He was forced to work with what he had. He did a good job with this, working with what he had, this is a known characteristic of Coppola's movies. Some parts of the movie were slow though, but that's all really based on attention span.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sylistically, it's hard to imagine Copolla making this film between his "Godfather" and "Godfather II".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two of the greatest films of the 1970s would have to be Francis Ford Coppola's "The Godfather" and "The Godfather: Part II". Both films are brilliantly made, amazingly polished and are considered by many to be classics. A much lesser-known film by Coppola came out between them, "The Conversation". However, despite being a much smaller sort of film, it has gained a cult-like following--and many folks think it's among the best films of the 1970s as well. It's as if they see it as an 'undiscovered' film by Coppolla--one the public never really embraced like these other much more famous films. Well, after seeing it, I did appreciate it and am glad I saw it--but I also think the word classic is not one I'd associate with the film. It's good...but not much more.The film stars Gene Hackman as a slimy private investigator who specializes in providing surveillance for his customers. In other words, he uses bugs to eavesdrop on others and the morality of this hasn't so far been a major issue for him. However, in a current case, he is having some misgivings. After all, the young couple who he's listening to with his high tech devices seem like nice people. And, he starts to worry about HOW this information might be used or misused--since in another case, his information he gathered actually led to someone being killed.This sort of topic isn't at all surprising for 1974. Think about it--this came out around the same time that the Watergate affair came to light. I am sure that this has something to do with why the film has a huge fan base. However, despite the timely subject matter and an interesting plot, the film could have been a lot better for me. It had a lot of slow points--and I felt my attention waning many times-- much of it because the acting was so restrained (almost zombie-like). It also had a lot of portions that made you wonder if what you were seeing was real or it it was in the main character's imagination--something that didn't seem to work for me. Still, it's a highly inventive film and is worth your time--just make sure you can stay awake and focused--ultimately it is worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Conversation had a profound effect on me.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A paranoid, secretive surveillance expert has a crisis of conscience when he suspects that a couple he is spying on will be murdered. Harry Caul is a devout Catholic and a lover of jazz music who plays his saxophone while listening to his jazz records. He is a San Francisco-based electronic surveillance expert who owns and operates his own small surveillance business. He is renowned within the profession as being the best, one who designs and constructs his own surveillance equipment. He is an intensely private and solitary man in both his personal and professional life, which especially irks Stan, his business associate who often feels shut out of what is happening with their work. This privacy, which includes not letting anyone into his apartment and always telephoning his clients from pay phones, is in part intended to control what happens around him. His and Stan's latest job, a difficult one, is to record the private discussion of a young male/female couple meeting in crowded and noisy Union Square. The arrangement with his client, known only to him as "the director", is to provide the audio recording. Roger Ebert wrote ""The Conversation" comes from another time and place than today's thrillers, which are so often simple-minded. This movie is a sadly observant character study, about a man who has removed himself from life, thinks he can observe it dispassionately at an electronic remove, and finds that all of his barriers are worthless. The cinematography (opening scene by Haskell Wexler, the rest by Bill Butler) is deliberately planned from a voyeuristic point of view; we are always looking but imperfectly seeing. Here is a man who seeks the truth, and it always remains hidden. He plays the conversation over and over, but does Mark say, "He'd kill us if he had the chance," or "He'd kill us if he had the chance"?" The ending in this movie to me is one of the best ever. It shows how or fears can consume us and alter our live. It displays how if our fears consume us we lose the feeling of life itself. That is at least my take of it. This is Coppola's hidden masterpiece that should be seen by all. It will definitely make you think.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good movie..more than everIt's a film that addresses the old issue between what should remain in private matter and what should be made public. As such, this work reflects on one of the basic rights of human beings: the Privacy ... not in a simplistic way but applying that right with others as the Freedom and Security.It's a movie that could be of this year (2014) or any coming year ... the wikileaks cases of Julian Assange and Edward Snowden prove the timelessness of this work masterfully directed by Francis Ford Coppola ... without any doubt it's his most kafkian film, immersed in anguish where the citizen becomes a pawn piece on the board controlled by the state. The interpretation of Gene Hackman is masterful (his best?).The end of the film (no happy end) seems to demonstrate that the more we have computer means to ensure our safety ... more defenseless we become. It's the price to pay for such technological advancement. What I like most about the film is the feeling of Solitude that runs throughout the film and its main character ...A 'bitter' irony: bigger and better means of information and communication ... greater solitude.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Lives Of Others: who listens to The Listeners...?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harry Caul (Gene Hackman) justifies his indifference to eavesdropping on others when he echoes the "I-just-did-as-I-was-told" line made (in)famous at the Nuremberg trials. "I don't care WHAT they're talking about," he snaps. When he's pressed, he counters: "I don't have any secrets." It turns out, of course, that he does: he was inadvertently responsible for the murder of an entire family, although he tries to absolve himself of any blame: "I was in no way responsible." He may be feeling guilty, but only to a degree- until he realizes that his current assignment may lead to similar results. "There's no protection," he says at one point; just before he begins to get caught up in a very serious way in some very serious s---. He confronts one of the people he's been wiretapping- Cindy Williams- in a dream. "I'm not afraid of Death," he tells her: "I AM afraid of murder." The twist at the end is superb, and Gene Hackman has rarely been better than he is here. One of my all-time favorites.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Hackman . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Conversation is one of Coppola's best and, as I said, it contains Gene Hackman's best performance. He plays Harry Caul, a surveillance expert who makes a living taping private conversations for money. He is a legend among his colleagues in the field of surveillance probably because they aren't privy to his work. He lives alone, keeps to himself, has no friends, builds his own surveillance equipment and values his privacy. His private work station is located in the back of a cold, empty warehouse behind an ugly chain-linked fence.He doesn't exactly look approachable with his thick mustache, horn-rimmed glasses and ridiculous plastic rain coat. Perhaps, that's the point. His colleagues admire him for his skill but he spaces himself away perhaps because if he ever let anyone into his life, they might realize how bad he is at his job. As the movie opens he discovers that his landlady has let herself into his apartment in order to leave him a birthday present. His unlisted phone number, he discovers, is in the hands of two other people. Later, one of his fellow surveillance experts is able to plant a microphone on him with relative ease and then he ends up having some of his tapes stolen by the one woman that he would least expect to have any interest in them.Perhaps the best reason that Harry is so emotionally withdrawn is that sometime ago, one of his surveillance assignments led to the brutal murder of a woman and her child. For this reason, he keeps an emotional distance from those around him and from his work. He does his job, he turns over this findings to his clients and makes his money. Yet, in his latest job he fears that it may be happening all over again. He has recorded a young couple Anne and Mike (Cindy Williams and Frederic Forrest) walking around a busy plaza having a conversation during a jazz festival. Stationing three microphones around, one on a sniper scope, one a parabolic mike propped in a window and one on an assistant, he is able to capture their conversation from all sides. They don't seem to be talking about much at first but as he listens back over their conversation he begins to suspect that the man who hired him will kill these two when he gets the tapes.Harry's conscience gnaws at him. He convinces himself that he is just doing his job, yet the job came by his own hand and by his own hand came two deaths. He tries to reason out his guilt in the confessional. After confessing to meager things like taking more than one newspaper from the box, he gets down to what's really bothering him. "I've been involved in some work that I think will be used to hurt these two young people.", he tells the priest, "It's happened to me before. People were hurt because of my work, and I'm afraid it could happen again and I'm . . . I was in no way responsible. I'm not responsible. For these and all my sins of my past life, I am heartily sorry." We suspect that he only needs the priest there to have someone to listen, the confessional is really a means to convince himself.He plays the recording of the couple back again and again and again, trying to dial down the music so he can better understand what is being said. Eventually, he gets a time and place where they will meet although they never say why. Again and again Harry refuses to give the tapes over to the client, the head of a large company, having to grapple instead with the client's unflinching assistant (Harrison Ford). After a convention he allows his one of his chief colleagues, a blow-hard named Moran (Alan Garfield) and some others into his private work station, Harry has invited them but couldn't look more uncomfortable. He spends the night with a prostitute who tagged along. She seduces him more with words than with sex, comparing the nature of her profession with his "It's only a trick, a job. You're not supposed to think anything about it. Just supposed to do it." We are as surprised as Harry when he wakes up and finds that she has stolen his tapes.He is sure that she has given the client the tapes and decides to go to the hotel where the couple were going to meet and possibly do something about it. What, exactly, he could do is not very clear. He gets the hotel room next door to the one mentioned in the tapes and positions himself in the bathroom next to the toilet so he can hear what is going on, he hears Anne scream and then everything goes silent. What he discovers isn't exactly what he expected but it isn't any better than what he expected either. Sneaking into the hotel room next door some time later he finds it vacated and scrubbed clean, that is, until he something crimson red bubbles up in the toilet. Is Harry imagining things? He panics and runs home and begins tearing the boards out of the walls and the floor of his apartment looking for a bug that he isn't even sure is there.Harry is a man wrapped in his own paranoia and insecurity. He does his job but he feels guilt about the nature of his work, which is really just eavesdropping for money. Watching the film again recently I realized how few characters like this there are in the movies, most are extroverts who do bad things and feel good about it. Very few, a very few ever deal with the guilt of what they are doing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The death of intimacy...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harry Caul (Gene Hackman) is portrayed as a very private, loner, who has acquaintances at best, all of whom he can keep at an arms length. He's a "bugger", secretly collecting audio and video for hire, and that existence has taught him how to further his thin veil of privacy. This film tells us a lot about Harry, as does his dream, when he actually does open up. Oddly, this occurs after he opened up to one of the call girls only to be exposed, embarrassed and hurt. He states, he can handle people getting killed, but not murder. My summary states the death of intimacy, but in truth, intimacy has been murdered. For all of the drama that could have led to such a realization and ironic twist, it is the lack of drama that many find appealing. Me. not so much , hence the 7 out of 10. FFC has a great concept but it's a bit uninspiring today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extraordinary ability to increase the psychological tension during a film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without being a specialist in Coppola, I've discovered this production with surprise It's a great work of art by its extraordinary ability to increase the psychological tension during a film. It's not a horror tension like in Hitchcock's "Psycho", nor a professional obsession like in Antonioni's "Blow Up", but something particular which makes from this film a really special one. The acting of Gene Hackman is also at a very high level. He is able to express the transformation of his character, from a strong, lonely secret service worker to the edge of insanity, proving a great talent and a top moment in his career. Without being really a psychological drama, it makes in inner analysis of the main character during his radical transformation, during the loss of control which takes place in a particular manner, linked with his special job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like a slow burning cigar, it is an acquired yet desired taste</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Conversation" is really not a thriller, which so many people label it as. In actuality, this is a film that studies the methodology of surveillance and its impact on one man. Gene Hackman plays Henry Caul, a master of watching, listening, and following people. He is hired by a company to pursue and record a couple's conversation (hence the title). What seems to be just an ordinary talk turns into a disturbing plot that may involve murder. From this discovery, Caul is placed in an ethical dilemma. He either turns in the tapes for his payment, risking someone's life, or he holds onto them and tries to prevent a homicide. Caul is presented as a very introverted and sophisticated individual. He does not give out his home phone number. He has three locks on his front door along with a security alarm system. Even in his relationships with women, he does not divulge any facts about himself. Given the business he is in, his paranoia and secrecy is justified. As viewers, the only things we learn about him is that he loves playing the saxophone and he occasionally goes to church to confess his sins (which are many). Though we are left a bit in the dark about Caul, we nonetheless can understand his guilt and feelings. Hackman's performance here ranks as one of his best works. Though he has often played heavies or men prone to violence and anger like Popeye Doyle in "The French Connection," he plays the calm, reserved, and polite Harry Caul with perfection. If it weren't for his trademark bald spot, I would not have recognized him at all from his thick-rimmed glasses, mustache, and coat. He truly warps himself into this man of mystery. The movie does not stop there in great performances. John Cazale, Teri Garr, Harrison Ford, and Allen Garfield appropriately mask themselves into their characters. I never would have imagined Harrison Ford playing a calculating bad guy so well or even Teri Garr as a lovestruck ditz so convincingly. Garfield at times seems to steal Hackman's thunder as Caul's surveillance competitor Bernie. Then again, Garfield always had a strong presence in movies as portraying a loudmouthed jerk (see Beverly Hills Cop 2). However, Hackman is still the orbital focus. His contemplative blank stares never get old. We can literally see the wheels turning in his character's head. Like with any Coppola film, the technical prowess is efficient. The editing is clean. The music when used sets a mood of suspense. The cinematography creates a feeling of suffocating loneliness. The sound mixing is impressive, specifically with the incorporation of the old tape imperfections, examples include: hissing, pops, and strange artifacts during playback. Above all, "The Conversation" is like a slow burning cigar. It may take awhile for the plot to develop, but it leaves an acquired, yet desiring taste. I now cannot help but wonder if Tony Scott's lesser film "Enemy of the State" is The Conversation's unofficial sequel. After all, Hackman essentially plays the same character in both films and this movie's conclusion is left open ended for the viewer of a follow-up story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Conversation" tells a story about a man name Harry Caul who is an expert of surveillance and always likes to know what they are talking about, and when things start to go too far, Caul starts losing it. Gene Hackman's performance is without a doubt one of his most finest performance that he has given. The rest of the cast such as Cindy Williams, Harrison Ford, and such all do their jobs well enough. Francis Ford Coppola knows how to tell a story for not only writing or producing, but directing this movie. I do love how the cinematography is as it is being beautifully shot and the audience can figure out what is going on with Caul's mind as the story goes. I thought the music by David Shire was well effective and it does fit the tone for the movie. I thought the movie goes at a pretty good pace, and never gets boring as I am watching it. "The Conversation" is one of Coppola's best and I highly recommend this movie to everyone. I give it a 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Francis Ford Coppola's Most Underrated Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quite possibly Francis Ford Coppola's most underrated film, The Conversation tells the story of Harry Caul; a surveillance expert who is given an assignment to record the conversation between two people in a crowded location and who's extremely private about his life &amp; profession in spite of being the best in the business. The film focuses on his obsession with his latest assignment which he feels might result in some serious consequences for the people he's spying on &amp; eventually has his fears realized but not the way he imagined it to be.Brilliantly directed by Coppola, cleverly written too with a single conversation that opens the film being the core ingredient around which the rest of the plot exists, steadily photographed, finely edited &amp; calmly scored, The Conversation also works as an intricate study of its lead character wonderfully brought to life by Gene Hackman in what is a stellar performance. The supporting cast of John Cazale, Harrison Ford, Robert Duvall &amp; others also play their part well but it's Hackman who remained the most interesting character throughout the film.On an overall scale, The Conversation is a superbly filmed psychological study of a paranoid individual whose new assignment brings back the disturbing memories of the past he has tried to bury &amp; who tries to not let history repeat itself but his foreshadowing of the events occur with a slight twist that's hinted to the viewers in its opening minutes. Definitely worth a watch, The Conversation finds the finest director of the 1970s in a blistering form.</fullReview>

The privacy issues are especially relevant today...Coppola builds the tension slowly but surely, and throws in some unpredictable twists. Nothing about the plot can be foreseen. By the last act there are a myriad of paths the movie can take. It could also just end, and still make sense. The only negative is that maybe it is a bit too slow.Solid performance by Gene Hackman in the lead role. Good support from John Cazale and Harrison Ford.

Coppola draws on a familiar cast (Frederic Forrest, Robert Duvall, John Cazale) and the lead is an excellent Gene Hackman. Hackman delivers a surprisingly composed, sombre performance which echoes the slow-burning feel of 'The Conversation.The conspiracy plot is a conversation recorded by Hackman and Cazale between a man and a woman in a park on a cold New York afternoon. The conversation is hazy and obscure. And when it is played over and over again, and the clarity grows, it becomes quite creepy indeed.'The Conversation' is a beautifully subtle exploration of paranoia and prophetic in its depiction of secret agencies monitoring your every word. The pace is unrushed, yet this makes the explosive ending even more intense. All in all, one of Coppola's finest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thought provoking, paranoia inducing masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have heard of The Conversation accidentally, while reading reviews for another movie. I thought I would give it a try. It's from 1974, but it could be interesting. I am really proud of my decision now. If nothing else, this movie should be used as teaching material for young cinematographers. It is a layered film that affects you on multiple levels.The movie starts with a conversation between two people in a park, while Gene Hackman's team is diligently recording everything they say. You can see that it is a difficult thing to do because it is lunch hour and the two people move around all the time in the middle of a loud crowd. And yet they can record things perfectly.But then the story changes perspective, as you see Hackman's character in his personal life, ironically a very private person who feels invaded when the landlord looks at his mail and learns it is his birthday and then decides to enter in the apartment without permission to leave a present. The girlfriend wants to know more about him, friends ask questions. Suddenly it is all very suffocating.And then there is the actual recorded conversation. It first seems to be about something, then it (slowly) becomes more, then it twists again. The consequences of the actions of the characters are also explored. The ending is surprising and thought provoking. If this film doesn't make you feel all paranoid and helpless, I don't know what will :)Great movie, albeit a little slow, but that slowness gives it incredible depth and effect if you make the effort. I highly recommend watching it. Gene Hackman is perfect for the role, while Harrison Ford plays a secondary (and creepy) role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An extraordinarily subtle, complex study of obsession</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As if to create an anti-"Godfather", Coppolla paints a disturbing and near-subliminal study of a man who makes a living, and in effect lives, vicariously through other people's lives. He observes everything at a distance, including himself. Harry Caul (Gene Hackman, fresh from his breakout performance in "The French Connection") pretends that the surveillance jobs he takes are -- to quote Michael Corleone -- "strictly business," but there is a humanity there aching to emerge. Ironically, it is his failure to adhere to that ethos of detached technician that proves his undoing.Harry is commissioned to record a conversation between two young lovers as they walk continuously around a public square in San Francisco. This conversation is not only the subject of the film, it is repeated so often that it becomes a character unto itself. With each hearing, the content and, ultimately, context of this quite brief conversation shifts in subtle but surprising ways.The film is in part about filters. The mechanical devices that Harry employs to decipher the material are the most obvious. But in the end it is Harry's own mind which proves the most important filter. His fundamental misinterpretation of a single word ("us") takes him down an emotional, spiritual dark alley, filled with demons largely, but not exclusively, of his own making.The cast is first-rate. Hackman perfectly conveys the lonely desperation of Harry Caul. John Cazale (Fredo in the first two "Godfather" movies) shines as his too-curious subordinate, who chafes under Harry's monomaniacal pursuit of the job. Harrison Ford, still several years away from "Star Wars," is superb as functionary for "the Director," and Allen Garfield plays Moran, Harry's rival snoop, with supercilious zeal. Befitting this low-key, haunting film, David Shore's solo piano score conveys loneliness, mystery and pain.Filmed concurrently with "Godfather II," "The Conversation" was almost completely lost amid the hype of that blockbuster. This is a shame. Though painted on a much smaller canvass, "The Conversation" packs an emotional wallop just as effective and, perhaps, more so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rocks the Sound</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching The Conversation was a breath of fresh air for me because it made me realize how little I thought about sound's two cents in a film. I've gained enormous respect for sound mixers, editors, and foley artists for the hard work they put into their job. To capture the reality and impact of a story, sound technicians must manipulate the dialogue with any background or source music to flow naturally. The thing we, as audience members, do not recognize is the complexity and extreme measures sound editors go to in order to capture everyday sounds of background noises and/or to highlight specific aspects of the world the character may be experiencing with more focus.When I think of films with great sound quality, my mind stereotypically thinks of the action genre. The Conversation is not an action film, but stings with a powerful sound design. The sound is more vast than you could expect or maybe even notice on an initial viewing. The storyline allows its main character, played by Gene Hackman, to act as an on-screen sound mixer, so in a way the sound mixing becomes almost self-referential.Uses of Sound That Stood Out During My Viewing: - the volume change in sound perspective with space: the dramatic difference between looking down on a street, then being plunged in the middle of it like a bystander. - every sound in the middle of the street (birds chipping, traffic, people talking, music on the street) may be all added (or definitely enhanced) by foley artists and the way we listen to the conversation between the couple through Hackman's services. - the piano score drowns out city traffic. - the musical composition is stressed in areas, whereas in other places in the film it's muffled. - Gene Hackman's coat sound is enhanced by foley artists. - Hackman tapping on the pay phone is presented with more of a "BOOM" than most likely had during shooting. - the sound of the wine bottle being opened and poured was most likely re-recorded. - the strange sounds in the elevator scenes is curved for effect. - Hackman's sound equipment allows the sound to be creative and playful. - the misinterpreted line that dominates the film as a death threat reoccurs as offscreen sound. - the climatic scene in the hotel rooms plays with its sound in a quiet manner, but hits hard in certain parts (drilling into the bathroom wall and the murder behind the glass), plays with offscreen sound, as Hackman tries to listen to what's going on in the next room.The Conversation frequently withholds the clarity of the dialogue from us for the misunderstood effect of the film. It's a filed with complex sound work, using the stingers to excite us, rounding out the film. Francis Ford Coppola ultimately questions technology with The Conversation? is it more destructive than helpful?Rating: 9Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paranoia And Advancement of Spyware Technology</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers present in this review...We live in an age where personal technology has pretty much become something of a necessity in our lives. How do we know that no one is listening to our conversations or watching us while we are in our homes. Francis Ford Coppola's The Conversation explores the culture and life of a man, Harry Caul, who works in 'surveillance'. This film was made between the Godfather films and released on 1974, the same year The Godfather II was released.Harry Caul is to do a voice recording job on a couple's conversation on Union Square and give the tapes to director, the man who hired him. There may be more to it than just a conversation and he becomes personally involved as he doesn't want something from the past repeat itself. The film also explores this man who, definitely is one of the best in the profession, have become so isolated and guarded. Caul is afraid that someone might be listening or watching him. A certain areas of the film, it also speaks about the technology and how something that may seem like a normal object may be bugged and recording/observing you. The topics of this film, I find very interesting as it relates to the technology that is currently used today and some of us are maybe too naive to think that someone might actually be listening. Coppola has made a wonderful script and using a protagonist who has been mentally and emotionally damaged by his own work.Not a bad year for Francis Ford Coppola. Two films released in one year and both were nominated for Best Picture and one won the Palme d'Or at Cannes; one is very personal and indie, and the other is a big sequel to the best film of the 1970's. The Conversation was clearly something that he always wanted to make but the studios don't think it would be any good or they think he is not good enough of a director, so he made The Godfather and that made them think twice. The Godfather felt very grand, and Coppola wanted to make this film more subtle and quiet. This film is definitely slow when comparing to Coppola's other works but it works well with the subject and story that the film explores. In my first viewing, this was not something I loved and if i reviewed it then, it would have been a 3.5/5, but after a few months I watched it again and the film felt different, there was so much more to it than I thought there was. This film is so enjoyable and the last half hour is so frightening, in a subtle way, that it would be in your minds a few hours after the film is finished.Coppola wanted the photography to be very simple but it's simplicity is effective. The film's opening has a great shot that starts at a height and slowly gets closer and closer to the important characters, and the film ends with a slow panning shot as Hackman sits in the corner playing the saxophone. The photography doesn't try too hard to show off something and this is because it is not needed. I like that this film does not try to show off like The Godfather or be heavy like Apocalypse Now.The score of the film, by David Shire, is also very stripped and simple. The score is driven by the piano and at times is supported by a saxophone. It is so stripped down that sometimes you may not even notice it's playing in a scene. There is a particular moment at the hotel where something happens and this static noise that adds to the imagery makes that scene so frightening.Gene Hackman is incredible in this film, his portrayal of this closed off character was great. He is the main focus of the film and the supporting cast doesn't seem to out play him. Coppola wants the film to follow Caul as he listens to the tapes and uncovers things. The film overall has a great cast, it has actors like Harrison Ford, Robert Duvall, John Cazele and Cindy Williams. Cindy Williams, I was surprised broke off my impression of her from when I saw her at American Graffiti. Nevertheless this is a Hackman show and he delivers, this is possibly his best role.Many may not regard this as Coppola's masterpiece but it is a well made film about paranoia and the advancement of spyware technology. I felt this is one of his strongest films and just edges out The Godfather by a little. It is definitely one of the strongest films of the 1970's and should not be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unnerving, haunting, suspenseful; all of the above. This movie quietly goes for the throat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A masterclass in paranoia and alienation, "The Conversation" doesn't come at you face-to-face. No, it comes from behind. Gene Hackman gives a terrific performance as expert wire-tapper Harry Caul (one of the great film characters of the '70s) who unwittingly places two innocent people in the crosshairs after recording their walk-in-the-park dialogue. And that right there would make for a pretty good movie, but that's not all "the Conversation" is about. At the center of the piece is a character study centering on Caul, himself. As the best bug-man in the business, he's also an intensely secretive and universally skeptical man, living in a fortress of privacy. And one of my favorite moments in this movie is during the after-hours party, when Allen Garfield pulls the rug out from under Caul when we hear his intimate exchange with a woman was secretly recorded. It's a showstopper of a scene, and Hackman plays it perfectly; his tight restraint cracking under seething rage. Hell, Hackman plays the whole film perfectly. Harrison Ford's is the other notable performance in the film. Though not a big role, it's sinister enough to make an indelible impression. Dude was all sorts of ominous. And just when I thought that third-act twist was a punch to the solar plexus, Coppola waits until the end to play the trump card: an unforgettable scene in which Hackman systematically rends his apartment, piece by piece in search of a listening device that isn't there. Not only a harrowing descent into madness, but a shocking and bleak image that you don't easily shake.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been crazy over movies since childhood and now I'm 60, so "I've seen quite a few" is certainly an understatement. In my entire history with movies "The Conversation" stands as unique: I love it, I think it's a "major" film; it drives me crazy, I have a major problem with it.Huge spoiler alert now. Don't read any further if you're going to see the movie (and if you haven't seen it, you've got to). The film's entire plot turns-- and it certainly does turn-- on master-technician Harry Caul's eventual "cleaning up"-- clarifying-- of a little snippet of audio. All of you who have seen the movie know what that snippet is. But not now, not when the movie was made, and not in a thousand years of technological innovation, could what Harry does be done without massive cheating; and the point is that the last thing that Harry Caul would do is cheat. No matter what you do to a piece of audio you can't change the emphasis the speaker put on a particular word unless you decide beforehand that you want to alter the original and then deliberately boost the volume on that particular word. No clarification process by itself can change "He'd **kill** us if he had the chance" to "He'd kill **us** if he had the chance"; you also gotta cheat. Some of you will think I'm doing some serious nitpicking here, but because the entire film turns on the particular transformation of this piece of audio, I just don't agree.So how is it that I still think that the movie is great? I guess the movie so great that every time I see it-- and I've seen it four times-- I'm able to shove my picked nit aside. There are probably a number of great films that contain a major flaw and yet remain great. I wonder what the other ones are.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The are a couple of things worth stressing about "The Conversation" - a movie which unexpectedly had a great impact on me and has even become my favorite FFCoppola movie. What I want to highlight the most is the opening of the movie which is simply stunning, one of the best movie openings I have ever seen. The rhythm, the suspicion in the air, the composition - everything just matches. The locations have been very well chosen. Especially the workplace of the main character - the bars and the shadows created a jail like atmosphere that in a way corresponds with his inner self - lonely, secretive and disturbed. And it is surprising how slow the movie is (for today's viewer) jet how it never gets boring and holds attention by building the tension. One of the specific techniques Coppola uses to achieve this goal is a large portion of whisper and mumbling. But I completely disagree with those who see similarities with BLOW UP, for me it's more Hitchcock style.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Conversation and Media Lit Skills</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harry's office is his space of privacy and solitude. It is where he can control everything and do his work. Harry himself is very dedicated to his work and doesn't want to let anyone know his secrets. Whenever Stan or his girlfriend tries to ask him questions about his work he shuts them out. When Harry does open up to the showgirl after the convention, he gets recorded by Bernie and feels like a fool. He also loses the pictures and tapes after she stays the night, making him regret giving up control. I feel like the film compared well to other thrillers because you didn't know what was going to happen. As soon as you think you got it figured out, the new twist or turn comes into play and you're back at square one. The film keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. One thing that stands out is the paranoia of people. Harry is paranoid of people finding out about his work and finding out why the Director wants to do with the couple. The couple is paranoid that someone is listening to them while they are walking around the square. Stan is paranoid about why Harry won't teach him anything. Another grouping feature is the duos. There's Harry and Stan, Harry and the showgirl, the couple, Harry and his girlfriend, the Director and his assistant. Harry tries to control everything in his life. From using pay phones to call clients and not letting people know he has house phone, his paranoia affects every part of his life. He makes his own surveillance equipment so he can know they work and not be bound to someone else. He wants everything to be under control. All thrillers have someone who is paranoid in it. Harry is paranoid so therefore The Conversation is a thriller. People who are paranoid can take that into every part of their life. It can lead them to being very private and keeping people out of their lives. You start to alienate people who want to be a part of your life. Harry wants to avoid making the same mistakes he did in his last assignment when two people got killed. So when he wanders what the Director want to do with tapes and pictures, he begins to question himself. His paranoia takes over and he goes to great lengths to make sure the couple is safe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>During the duration of the film I sat on my futon in utter confusion, but then I chose to replay the entire film and I picked up on the paranoia that Harry Caul develops from the tapes he is told to uncover. Paranoia is the center around the film. The acting in the film was one I have to give a thumbs up to. The actor of Harry Caul really impressed me with his quiet demeanor and odd quirks that really made him stand out as a character. How he went about doing his work, the phone calls he would make from the telephone booths, and even the fact he broke up with his lady friend in the beginning of the movie because she was asking too many questions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A paranoid and personally-secretive surveillance expert (Gene Hackman) has a crisis of conscience when he suspects that a couple he is spying on will be murdered.So, Francis Ford Coopola originally envisioned this as a horror film? I can see it. It is rather like a high-tech version of "Rear Window" in a way, but of course goes off in its own direction enough to really capture the paranoia of the main character (a paranoia he need not fear, but could easily provide to others).I loved the early, pre-Solo Harrison Ford here. His role is not major, but big enough to let the man shine and to show why he went on to achieve great things (unlike the bulk of his space comrades, who went downhill after the early 1980s). Did Ford and Hackman ever work together again? No idea -- but they should have.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beware of what you might discover ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Surveillance, eavesdropping and wiretapping ? these are the ingredients of Francis Ford Coppola's gripping masterpiece: "The Conversation", Golden Palm winner at the Cannes Festival and Best Picture nominee in 1975. Made between "The Godfather" and "The Godfather Part II", "The Conversation" is a fascinating movie that requires more than one viewing to get its brilliance. And beyond the script and the editing, the film is carried by one of the greatest performances of the 70's, through Gene Hackman's portrayal of the enigmatic Harry Caul.It would be so convenient to label "The Conversation" as a 'character study' but this would inevitably bump into two semantic dialectic obstacle. First, it's not much a study than an examination for we're only left with what we see and hear and Harry Caul is such a mysterious character that only a few little hints can betray his torments. Secondly, Caul is so diluted in his work that the line between the professional and the private man are very uncertain. And it's only while we're trying to solve the enigma around the conservation wiretapped in the opening sequence, that the movie leaves us a few insights on Caul's enigmatic personality, like a mystery within the mystery. We become the Cauls of Harry Caul.Consequently, the narrative of the film obeys the same rules as Caul's profession by trying to solve a mystery on the basis of the 'seen' and the 'heard', with no room left for deduction, because deduction would only be speculation. However, since the world's dynamics are regulated by a succession of causes and effects, there's no action without a cause, and no cause without an effect. The dilemma in Caul's job is that he's a man of action, not of deduction, when he's given a task; he never questions why and for what he works. Like a private eye, he's just an intermediary enabling to discover a hidden truth, how it would be used by his client is not his concern. But actions are guided by conscience too, which Caul is not deprived from. That's why, for the first time as a surveillance expert, he will not just discover the secret but understand what it means.The main plot is centered on the sophisticated wiretapping of a mysterious conversation during the opening sequence in San Francisco's Union Square. Coppola asks for our attention and concentration so early in the film that it's very difficult to be attentive to the words spoken by Mark (Frederic Forrest) and Ann (Cindy Williams), both are discussing in a crowded square at noon, about life and death, a hobo sleeping on a bench, about kids, holiday, It is so banal and so vague, yet we know it must be important, because around them, three men are taping the conversation, using diverse material, and trying to obtain crystal clear words beyond the cacophonous noises surrounding the two targets. These are the limitations of Caul's mission and the basis of the story.And because of its slow pacing, "The Conversation" can't afford to lose its time. Coppola immediately invites us to join the surveillance team and understand the basic functioning of their work, made of a scientific precision and an exact timing, that's Harry Caul's department. And we see a man who's relatively good at his work, his expertise is indirectly highlighted by his colleagues who seem less involved, one gets suspected by the girl and Stanley, John Cazale, hidden in a van, doesn't take the task with much seriousness. But there's something abnormal in Caul's dedication to his work, it makes him uncomfortable with social contact, as if he was alienated by his own job. After the first sequence, we start examining his privacy, with the same mindset he'd use to obtain a clear content of the titular conversation.There are basically two Cauls in the film, and as we discover the professional Caul, we try to understand the private Caul, the pro is a surveillance expert who appears to be a real legend in the milieu, after a remarkable masterpiece of eaves dropping that lead to the murder of a politician, and his family, the simple mention of Harry Caul creates an enthusiasm that immediately contrasts with his modesty, or a visible jealousy from Bernie Moran, his main rival, played by a scene-stealing Allen Garfield. Caul is visibly hiding a guilty secret in his heart, which he tries to repress through a life of Catholic austerity whose only leisure consists on jazz playing with his saxophone. Otherwise, he's a loner, incapable to open his heart as if he was afraid it would be bugged.Caul's métier has an incidence on his paranoid behavior, as a man who uses to tap people would hate to have his own privacy exposed. The irony here is that Caul is so dedicated to his job that he doesn't have much secrets to hide ("I'm your secret", says his girlfriend) and worse, he seems incapable to keep his privacy intact despite all his precautions. His landlord lady left a birthday present in his house and some persons know his phone number. But since whatever can be known about Caul would't give much information, so the only aspect that needs to be kept secret concerns his job. No one would ever know how he was able to accomplish his masterpiece. And this is the secret he keeps the most, and this is the key to understand Caul's behavior, as man wrack by guilt.But guilt starts when the eavesdropper's action stops, and his conscience makes him face his inner demons in order not to commit the same fatal mistakes. The ending doesn't leave much about what is real and what is not, everything is left to interpretation like in any intelligent script, but the genius is in the process of a man, using his conscience to overcome an unbearable alienation. And this is the most thrilling aspect of the film, which is already an extraordinary thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A seventies classic from Coppola</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Francis Ford Coppola's "The Conversation" tends to get overlooked to a certain degree due to having been released the same year as "The Godfather: Part II". Despite the latter film's near-legendary stature I actually feel that "The Conversation" was Coppola's best of the year.Coppola freely admits the influence of Michaelangelo Antonioni's classic "Blow-Up" but his film is no pale imitation. Tapping into the paranoia of the seventies, Coppola managed to construct a highly compelling thriller out of unlikely material.Gene Hackman plays Harry Caul, a highly private individual who, ironically, makes his living in surveillance. Haunted by a past job that resulted in three people being murdered, Harry becomes obsessed with his latest assignment. However, the conversation he's taped is cryptic enough that it's difficult to tell exactly what's going on.Therein lies the beauty of the film. Like in "Blow-Up", the events of the movie are shaded by perception. We know as little as the film's protagonist and we too are compelled to see the mystery through to it's resolution. Ultimately, the film succeeds as both a thriller and an artistic statement.Hackman delivered an Oscar-worthy performance but unfortunately he didn't even land a nomination. In support, there are no real standouts but rather a uniform set of fine performances. Notable supporting players include John Cazale, Teri Garr &amp; Harrison Ford, among others. A less visible, but no less important, contributor to the film was composer David Shire, who provided a fitting score.In the end, I think that "The Conversation" is a very good film though I can't help but note the thematic similarities to "Blow-Up", which is one of my favourite films. As I've suggested, though, this movie is well worth watching in its own right. I consider it the second best of 1974, behind only "Chinatown".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I always was a sucker for movies, where the protagonist is a lonesome genius, the best in the biz is you will. I watched this movie for the first time 3 years ago when I was 16 and I still can't shake off that special feeling I had after watching this. That's definitely a sign of a special film. This movie truly is a brilliant, manipulating, subversive mind game and I was truly lucky to watch it without knowing anything about it. If you haven't watched it , you should go see it with absolute ignorance concerning it as well. But I must mention some of the aspects of the film, of source, without spoiling it. What specifically stroked me and what I specifically remember (having watched it last time about a year ago). First of all, the tone of it. Quite, settled, yet intriguing enough - the movie catches you right from the beginning. Then, off course, there's Gene Hackman. As an actor who usually plays these manly men (French Connection is perfect example), he is really convincing as this quiet, almost isolated man, whose thoughts you can't really figure out. He's great at portraying sadness and terror in this movie. ' But even that is not what sells this movie for me. The ending. Or the final act, should I say. When the first shocker appeared on screen, I was so freaked out that I could move for a few seconds. I actually had a nightmare or two concerning this scene (those who seen it will probably understand what I'm talking about). And then the film wrapped so perfectly - I really can't think of any movie with a better ending that this one. What else I can say - this movie is a masterpiece, a classic, probably the main reason why I feel such inclination towards the 70's without actually living in the 70's . Sublime, 11 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost Perfect! Not Enough San Francisco Shots!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was done between Francis Ford Coppola's classic Godfather films. With John Cazale in a supporting role, this film is step above and beyond one of the best films of the decade. With an all star cast who were unknowns like Harrison Ford, Cindy Williams, and Teri Garr, you have to imagine Coppola's luck in finding amazing talent. Cindy Williams' Shirley is nowhere recognizable in this role. Teri plays Harry Caul's girlfriend. Harry Caul is played by the great Gene Hackman in one of his best roles ever. The film is really about how a conversation and the wiretappers and surveillance experts like Harry Caul live their lives by invading other people's privacy. The film has a suspense and where is this going to be but it's brilliant. Robert Duvall is uncredited as the mysterious director in the film. Anyway, we hear the conversation between Mark and Ann, a married woman and her lover, in Union Square in San Francisco surrounded by listeners. Over the film, we hear the conversation even with distraction such as the band and the people in the square. It's still enough to make you watch it again and again. Harry Caul is an interesting character with a very paranoid mind. He doesn't like anybody else to invade his privacy. His history of his job has clouded his current assignment. He doesn't want to see it end up like it did in New York City. It's a first rate film but the ending needs to be clear as to what happened to those characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The trouble with Harry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, like the main character brilliantly played by Gene Hackman, doesn't lend itself to being all that likable, easy to understand on the surface, or altogether entertaining. Many earlier reviewers have commented negatively, describing "The Conversation" as too-slowly paced, boring, or totally unwatchable. Certainly, the story here could have very well evolved into many different types of films. But what resulted here is a psychological thriller framing a deep character study. And in that context, it is first rate.Admittedly, on my first viewing of the film back in the 1980's, I didn't think much of it; but I was drawn back to it. This is one of those films that needs to be seen more than once, to be drawn into a difficult story, deliberately paced, being played out by largely unsympathetic characters. But it's an effort definitely worth making with "The Conversation". Sometimes it's those films which take their time getting under your skin that become long-time favorites.Hackman's character, Harry Caul, is an intensely lonely, obsessively private surveillance expert who, while on an assignment, breaks his own steadfast rule and becomes personally involved in a case. He maintains a self-declared impunity which he believes distances him from any and all consequences of his eavesdropping. But there is a dark chapter in Harry's past which sub-consciously haunts him, an instance in which his work resulted in tragic consequences for innocent people.One aspect which is key to his actions is his concept of "innocence" as he sees it. His vulnerability stemming from the earlier tragedy has triggered in him an observation of perceived innocence in Ann (played by Cindy Williams), one of the two subjects he's been hired to spy on. He gradually begins to see her as an unwitting pawn- an innocent- who he fears will become another unintended tragic victim of his handiwork. Emotionally, he cannot bear to have (more) blood on his hands. But Harry finds out too late that he was seeing and hearing only as he wanted to, and this becomes his unraveling. In the end, Harry becomes his own tragedy, and the viewer is left to decipher the ambiguity of the final events. Have the tables been turned on him? Or has his paranoia gone into free-fall? Bleak, yes, but an utterly fascinating and essential work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>FF Coppola reunites John Cazale and Gene Hackman in this thriller that has you gasping for air and holding your breath all at once, but it's Gene Hackman that BECOMES Harry Caul and woos us in until we feel it is OUR duty to step in and help....Harry is a loner, but a brilliant surveillance expert, hired by a rich, mysterious man to spy on his wife and her supposed lover. He does so, even though the conditions for the job are nearly impossible, especially given that he uses only home-made equipment. His genius is punctuated by the fact that the raw recordings are garbled and his remixing brings the verbiage to light. Once he has all the transcripts, he realizes he is embroiled in the middle of a case he wishes he wouldn't have taken, and the 2 hours go by like 10 minutes.Awesome performances by Cazale and a young Harrison Ford are overshadowed by Hackman, as he weaves in and out of this storyline like thread. Obviously (albeit unofficially) a prequel to "Enemy of the State" where he plays the same type of man, I can't emphasize enough how good this is: mystery, suspense, action, superb acting, and more than one plot twist make this gem the hallmark of Hackman's career. Should you see it? Does a one legged duck swim in circles?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Conversation pieces</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Taut feature from Francis Ford Coppola which works as much as a thriller as a character study of compulsive behaviour. Coppola skilfully intertwine both strands, centring his movie on an intense, complex performance by Gene Hackman as surveillance expert Harry Caul drawn into what he fears is a murder plot against the young married wife of a reclusive middle-aged corporation boss and her lover. The movie is also about the expiation of guilt with Hackman's increasingly paranoiac behaviour emanating from a previous assignment which ended up with a fatality. Thus we see much of the film through his eyes, even when he has seemingly waking nightmares and portentous delusions. The multi-layered structure of the film continually shifts focus but all the time maintains interest. There are several arresting scenes, including the way that Hackman's character teases out the full conversation between the lovers, his later seduction by a honey-trap employee of said corporation to the backdrop of the actual taped dialogue of the lovers and lastly the strange final scenes where the biter gets bitten as he trashes his own apartment in a futile bid to track down a concealed bugging device. The twist on the murder is cleverly turned, Hackman's bystander gaze a study in incredulity.Hackman is outstanding as the seedy snoop, wearing his grey mackintosh coat everywhere, unable to connect with his fellow humans, especially women, unless it's to talk about the latest technology in his field. The camera never really gets close to him, keeping him at a distance from us or putting obstacles in front of the viewer's gaze to accentuate his remoteness. Of the rest of the cast, a pre-"Shirley" Cindy Williams as the young wife and pre-everything Harrison Ford as a sinister hired heavy make the best impressions. There's no question it's a director's film with Coppola inviting voyeuristic comparisons with Hitchcock's "Rear Window", so skillful is his touch here. An exciting yet discomfiting film,as it was no doubt intended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***contains spoilers*** Francis Ford Coppola's The Conversation is the story of Harry Caul, a surveillance expert who is not only surprisingly bad at his job but deeply unhappy about it. He is a man who makes a living eavesdropping on a conversation in the middle of a busy public place but later allows the tapes to be stolen. He is a man of faith and has no personal possessions of any value but is upset when his privacy is interrupted. His unhappiness stems from a few murders his surveillance caused and he is worried that his current task will have a similar result. In a confessional he tells the priest he has taken the lord's name in vain and stolen some newspapers from a rack but then admits his fears about being responsible for some deaths. He tells the priest he is not responsible but that he is sorry. If he is not responsible, why is he sorry? The character is played to perfection by the immortal Gene Hackman in a near career-best performance. Coppola, who wrote and directed, was probably trying to make a comment on American life amidst the Watergate scandal and the aftermath of the Vietnam War by telling the story of a man who has put too much reliance in technology and fears his personal responsibilities. Harry is a representation of that America: not a bad man, concerned about his work, feels contaminated by it, and haunted by a guilty conscience. He is annoyed by his associates, annoyed by everyone. At his apartment, Harry is stunned to find that his landlord has a key to his apartment and even knows his birthday. Because he has no valuable possessions, he tells his landlord he wouldn't mind if it all burned up in a fire. Later, he foolishly invites a competitor and others back to his workshop where he is promptly humiliated by a mike planted on him by the competitor. A dream gives the viewers crucial information: Harry was partially paralyzed as a child and as a result nearly drowned. Since his childhood, Harry has grown to be a lonely man. He sits in his apartment playing his saxophone along with some jazz records. This echoes his occupation, trying to make a recording more complete. Harry's fashion is non-existent as he trudges around in a transparent rain coat. This brings attention to the meaning of his name: Caul, which is also a word for a membrane that wraps the fetus to protect from drowning. More alarmingly, Harry's Catholicism seems to be rooted in shame instead of faith. We see him tear his apartment apart looking for a bug only hesitating to look inside a Virgin Mary statue. The Conversation works as both a taut thriller and a character study about a man who has removed himself so far from life that he thinks he can monitor it unemotionally from a technological standpoint.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a brilliant study of a guilty conscience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In between his twin 'Godfather' epics Francis Ford Coppola wrote and directed this spare, compact masterpiece of guilt and paranoia, in which a professional eavesdropper begins to question the morality of his trade when he suspects an audio tape of recorded small talk might lead to a possible murder. But there's more here than what first meets the eye (or ear). The climax of the film is drawn around a subtle, seemingly insignificant question of aural perception, and the cold-blooded epilogue provides enough food for thought to fill many sleepless nights. Coppola targeted one of the growing fears of our time (the idea that someone is always listening) with a stark, often chilling introspection, creating in the process one of the few truly audio-visual film experiences, and a haunting parable of post-Watergate America. Filmed in San Francisco with a cast of familiar faces, led by Gene Hackman (in a performance which is all the more amazing foe being almost totally internalized) as master audio surveillance expert Harry Caul, a man who routinely steals other people's privacy while guarding his own empty existence with obsessive zeal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Film Will Surely Spark a Few Conversations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The thriller The Conversation is written and directed by Francis Ford Coppola and stars Gene Hackman, John Cazale, and Allen Garfield. The film takes place in modern day California.The movie starts out with a man and a woman having a conversation in a public park with a large crowd. This conversation is of much importance as to the rest of the film because it is being recorded by a man named Harry Caul (Hackman) and the crew he works with. Caul is a professional in the surveillance business and is considered to be the best on the west coast. When Caul finishes touching up the tapes he recorded he goes to give it to the director for $15,000 but only the director's assistant (Harrison Ford) is there. Caul decides not to give them to the assistant because he wants to give them directly to the director. Then Caul heads to a surveillance convention where he meets a man, Bernie Moran (Garfield). Moran is very competitive and thinks he is the best at the job in the country and pushes a few too many of Caul's buttons. The main plot of the film is that the tapes that Caul has he believes are evidence that will be used so the director can kill these two people and he does not feel morally correct giving the director the man and woman's death warrant.The screenplay was very smart, especially for a thriller. The film is not the average thriller in any way, it has no guns or chase scenes. It is mostly psychological. At points though during the film is was slow and somewhat boring, but it made up for it in the end. There was a lot of characterization in this film which I liked a lot. I completely understood Caul's feelings and I also knew that he was getting annoyed with Moran since the very beginning. In almost every aspect except for the parts where it was slow.Francis Ford Coppola reaffirms the fact that he is a fantastic director with this film. He keeps the suspense going the whole way through and has many beautiful shots. Many of the shots are like surveillance cameras which is just brilliant. He definitely knows how to get great performances out of his actors especially Hackman. He proved that he was the greatest director for the decade of the 1970s but sadly after that decade he did nothing really noteworthy. Hopefully he will come back into mainstream films and end his career on a high note.The acting in this film was magnificent. Gene Hackman was wonderful as the lead being a very introverted type of person. His character was so real he was easily the best part of the film. The fact that he wasn't even nominated for an Oscar for his performance is one of the greatest Oscar snubs in history. If someone had told me that he won the Oscar I would have believed them immediately and said that he deserved it. The rest of the cast acted fine as well. John Cazale had a small part but played it perfectly as did Harrison Ford. Allen Garfield gave a really strong performance as the competitive Moran, who was quite annoying. Overall a very strong ensemble performance.The score for this film was also great and it never missed a beat. It was suspenseful at times and calm at other times and it connected the whole film together. Francis Ford Coppola's films all seem to have great scores in the 70s.Overall I give this film a strong 8/10, it is a great addition to Coppola's filmography and has an ending that will keep you thinking. I recommend this film to those who enjoy thought provoking suspense films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that gets under your skin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Francis Ford Coppola's "The Conversation" is a deceptively quiet little film with a lot more going on beneath the surface than may appear. It's a film about paranoia and distrust; about alienation and isolation and how all these things can have a huge impact on not only yourself but those around you -- a character study, if anything. It's also a masterful and taut suspense/thriller that demands the viewer's utmost attention.Gene Hackman delivers one of his career's finest performances, playing introverted and extremely anal surveillance professional Harry Caul, as opposed to his often aggressive and no-nonsense roles. With very little dialogue, he manages to convey an array of tense emotions and thoughts, which easily transfer into the viewer. As Caul becomes more suspicious and uneasy so do we. It's a very effective film and one that slowly gets under your skin.The music is another highlight of the film, employing a fantastic piano score blended with a snappy jazz soundtrack. It brings back the tone of old film noirs and detective mysteries. It's even more appropriate because the film is set in Jazz-heavy San Fransisco. Caul himself is even shown playing the saxaphone throughout the film.The cinematography is also brilliant. Coppola uses long, static or slow-moving shots to build tension and suspense, as well as shots from far away. It's a great technique that works well here.Overall, "The Conversation" is one of the best examples of both a strong character study and a gripping tale of lies, murder, and ethical dilemmas in all cinema. Coppola certainly did his finest work in the 1970s, churning out the first two "Godfather's", "The Conversation", and "Apocalpyse Now". Having seen "The Conversation", I can say it is equally as brilliant as all of those, but with a much more subtle, personal touch that makes it stand out from the rest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally a perfect conversation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is very certain and usual for people to be getting bored on hearing a same conversation again and again. But this movie is an exception. Here Harry Caul played by Gene hackman, was sort of a private spy, who was acclaimed to be the best in his business. he was given an assignment to spy on a couple, who were about to have a conversation in a park. Being a par, it was really a hard thing to record the conversation of them, coz they were moving around the park, with noises in the environment. Mr.Caul, managed to do this thing with his talents and he find that the couple were in danger. The movie not only focuses on the main conversation and the consequences of handling the conversation to the concerned person. But also it focuses on the character, Caul and his mental disturbances he get during the course of this spying field. All the necessary things for a suspense and thrill has been maintained through out the movie. All the subjects of this movie had been portrayed beautifully. A good patience is needed for this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE CONVERSATION may be a 36 year old film, but it remains one of the finest suspense thrillers of this genre. Francis Ford Coppola wrote and directed this gem between making Godfather and Godfather II and his degree of subtlety and mastery of understatement and jolting events shows. This film is restored now on a new release and the result is a crisp, flawlessly produced souvenir of just what Coppola does best - along with his current TETRO. Harry Caul (Gene Hackman) is a very private person with memories of an incident in his past that permanently scar his ability to trust anyone or anything. He is a private surveillance expert, living in San Francisco, and with his partner Stan (John Cazale) is in the process of taping both audio and visual evidence of an affair of a young couple for a fee of $15,000. for tapes and photos. In studying his tapes he discovers a planned murder and his tension mounts as he realizes he could be considered a participant in a killing not unlike what happened in his past. He becomes paranoid when he attempts to turn over the achieved evidence to the man who hired him and in turn finds he is to give the tapes and photos to an 'assistant', one Martin Stett (Harrison Ford in a very early bit part). Fear consumes him: he distances himself from his girlfriend (Teri Garr) and loses his partner Stan when his obsession with personal privacy drives Stan away. Gaul, well respected in his field, meets his New York counterpart and becomes part of a surveillance scheme himself! How Gaul copes with his situation is the resolution of the film. The pace of the film is slow, not unlike the patience required by those who invade the privacy of others. Coppola allows us to understand the psyches of each of his characters, no matter how small their roles. Hackman and Cazale are superb as they keep the flow of the film tense like a drawn out tightrope. It is a film to see repeatedly and one that has many of the qualities Coppola polishes in TETRO.

		<shortDescription>Voyeurism gets exposed with top-notch Coppola work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone could market or even direct "The Conversation" as a mystery, but Francis Ford Coppola manages to reveal some of our human tendencies in his film just as well as he holds us in suspense. Voyeurism, like it or not, is a human characteristic. Modern day reality television proves both that point alone and simultaneously that "The Conversation" is an excellent film because it has only ripened over the years.Coppola's character Harry Caul, portrayed by Gene Hackman in one of his finest performances, is the embodiment of this guilty pleasure of spying on others whether covertly or casually. He's a professional wire-tapper, one of the best in the business, seemingly able to capture the most pristine recordings for all his clients even though he is rarely enlightened as to the purpose of his jobs. It's not too long before we learn that Harry is a devout Catholic who harbors a bit of guilt because his career founds itself on the don't ask, don't tell principle.The film open with what its title promises: a conversation. Harry has been hired to record a conversation of a man and a woman on their work break. The conversation seems inconspicuous, but the more Harry deals with his mysterious client and goes back to listen to the tapes, the more he begins to hear and infer from the conversation. He eventually comes to the conclusion he might have recorded a death warrant and begins to grow paranoid.Harry's complexity is the finest element of Coppola's script. The story develops slowly but Harry becomes a more peculiar figure in the viewer's mind as time wears on. At first it seems like he isolates himself for protection purposes, but his loneliness becomes more and more apparent. He constantly feels threatened and there feels like a layer of ice between him and his relationships in the film, especially two memorable scenes where he interacts with women.Coppola's elegant framing and precision pacing do the rest of the work drawing us further in as the story progresses, highlighting our own preoccupation with the truth behind this couple's conversation. We're made aware of our own tendency to twist words and misinterpret what someone is saying, not to mention how easy and commonplace it really is to essentially spy on someone and invade his or her privacy entirely."The Conversation" properly mixes drama with mystery while offering a complete character portrait and subtle social commentary. Most films don't have that many tools working for them but Coppola's masterful script does. No single element is consummate or overrides the rest, but together they make for a fine film.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film-making as art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The popular perception is that America, for which read Hollywood, is adept at producing high-value formulaic pap which is nowhere artistically but which creams it at the box office. Then there is 'European cinema' which is not quite as productive ? for one thing it is far more fragmented and has fewer resources ? but which is more apt to turn up gems. Then there is 'art house' cinema, which for many a pretentious Pete can do nothing wrong. Well, like almost all generalisations these three are pretty misleading. Much dross has been produced under the guise of being 'art house', Europe is as adept at producing formulaic cack as Hollywood (though invariably its cack is not as profitable) and America has just as liable to produce a gem of a film as anywhere else in the world. The Conversation is just such a gem. Admittedly, it won't be to every taste: for one thing you can more or less forget about 'plot' and there is no 'action' ? indeed, there is hardly even a 'story'. But what you do get ? a kind of lopsided thriller which is really more of a character study ? more than compensates those who like this kind of thing. It has to be said that Gene Hackman, who plays the central character, a buttoned-up, guilt-ridden, paranoid surveillance expert, carries the film. But then as it is his character which is being analysed, that is no surprise. (Incidentally, Hackman is one of the outstanding actors of the past 40 years with some great roles and performances under his belt. So it is surprising that he can also appear, and not particularly memorably at that, in some rather ordinary fare, Split Decision, which I recently saw on DVD being one such film.) But he gets very good support from a variety of others, notably Allen Garfield as a smarmy, envious business rival, but also a very young Harrison Ford, who doesn't have many lines, buy conveys a kind of sinister presence admirably, and John Dalzage as Hackman's assistant. Although Francis Ford Coppola made ? wrote, directed and produced ?&nbsp;The Conversation more than 36 years ago, it hasn't dated in the least bit. No, this will not be to everyone's taste, but will be thoroughly satisfying for those who don't demand ? and don't mind in the least bit ? that the imbecilic protocols of too much modern film-making aren't followed to the letter. In fact, they are ignored wholesale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Conversation is another Coppola masterpiece, and what is special about it is that it shows his versatility; this is completely different from the stunning imagery of Apocalypse Now and the vivid characterization of the Godfather movies. The Conversation seems like a much smaller movie, which makes it all the more realistic and disturbing.This film is directed with pacing and craft that Hitchcock would be proud of, and indeed, in almost every way, this seems like a Hitchcock film. It is all about mood and tone. What makes the film so effective is the way that it draws the viewer in with its suspense, and then doesn't let you go. I have seen many violent films, from A Clockwork Orange to Hostel, but no film ever scared me like this one. there is hardly any violent content, but it deals with murder in a very serious and real way. After seeing this, I did not sleep for three nights. There were no specific scenes that scared me, but the overall mood and tone. This is film making at its very best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What makes a great film great? When days later you are still thinking about it. The Conversation is such a film. There were times during the film that I grew a little bored, but I think that is inevitable when dealing with a film that builds suspense in a subtle way such as this one does.But the true mark of greatness is that days later, I find my thoughts still drifting back to moments from The Conversation. It has made a strong impression on me, changed me in ways I can't even understand. When you watch a movie that is highly entertaining, it is a fun experience but quickly fades away. That, to me, is inferior to watching a great film such as this that provokes so many feelings, thoughts, and questions in its viewers.The film is beautifully shot and has such a graceful way of developing. Cast is superb. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, so let me start this off by saying people who gave this piece of art 1-6 stars have no taste for real cinema and would rater watch Piranha 3. Just go look at the movies they've reviewed and see what they rated how they rated them...Coppola's masterpiece engrosses more than just a flick on a screen. The themes and ideas addressed in this film apply to today just as much as they did to the Watergate audiences when it came out. The Patriot Act seems to come to mind... "The Conversation" shows just how versatile Coppola is.The performances in this film are great. Gene Hackman's performance is perfect in that we are detached with Caul as much as he is from society. His socially awkward persona is perfect. Here is a man who had devoted his life to other people's affairs and lacks the apathy for his work as much as we do for his character. His only weakness is women and his relations with one comes back to bite him in his derri?re. Harrison Ford's character as the director's assistant is mysterious and clothed in a dark cloud. He seems as though he is the big fish in the director's pond and is running the whole operation, but this is very subtle.The way this movie is filmed is very artistic. Almost every shot tends to alienate Hackman and moves in such a way to mention that he lives in his own world. The only shots showing him with people show him trying to avoid the people. In one shot, when Caul is walking by the windows to get to the director's private room to deliver the photos, we see his head going in and out of the dark suggesting that he is debating whether he should deliver the pictures and add insult to injury for the director.In the end, we see that even "big brother" has a "Mom and Dad" that are watching him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Francis Coppola's best?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After all the mythologies of Coppola's other films fade slightly, I remain convinced this is his greatest script and picture of all. He receives some major contributions from other collaborators, most notably Gene Hackman in one of his three most layered and awesome performances.One test of an actor's skill is how they "think" on film. Not their character necessarily, but themselves. Sitting there watching them, do you really believe something dynamic and cerebral is happening or are they going through the mechanical motions of not very interesting screen acting?Hackman is no doubt a very bright man, but I'll bet his Harry Caul is at least a teeny bit smarter. This Caul is immersed in his trade and has become something of a legend to his peers (even though he is without peer in both good and bad qualities). The fate he has unintentionally sealed for himself is the kind only a brilliant talent can wind up in, not unlike some very talented filmmakers who make a terrible project only as a skilled craftsman could, somehow screwing up in the process.Walter Murch, editor extraordinaire, is the other arm of Coppola in "The Conversation". I recently read a book of his, which is a lecture that was transcribed in novel form and he elaborates on some developments in digital editing in a new afterword. This man is like all the great from Caul in the form of a sound and vision wizard. When Murch is in the driver's seat, strap in firmly and prepare for his cinematic journey you're in store for. Robert Duvall is terrific as always and Harrison Ford and Cindy Williams make early appearances in roles far more provocative than the ones they became celebrities from. "The Conversation" is not a picture that will thrill everybody. But if you're tired of things that insult your intelligence, try it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The element of fear.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Conversation is a frightened film; frightened in the sense that it is filmed very apprehensively. The protagonist, Harry Caul, is a very careful and cautious man who lies about not having a phone, won't let anyone in on his surveillance equipment information and refuses to establish any kind of serious relationship with his girlfriend because that would require him to withdraw information. He is so careful in his life that he ends up making some really stupid mistakes for someone others in his profession say is the best there is.This was Francis Ford Coppola's follow-up to the smash hit The Godfather, and it is a much more personal project than his previous. While it looks to have been made on a small budget, the screenplay covers everything else with fantastic characterization and setups. Hackman plays Caul as a paranoid delusional, whose fear and anxiety drive him to see and do things a more rational person would not. His lack of physical, obvious emotion only helps with the fact that there is a lot more going on underneath. He is backed up with terrific, straightforward performances by Harrison Ford, Cindy Williams, Allen Garfield and John Cazale to name a few.However, the two elements that make this one of the best suspense thrillers of the last half century is the direction of Coppola and the sound editing of pioneer Walter Murch. Usually getting very little credit in a film, the sound editing here is crucial as it gives the audience insight to what Caul is doing, revealing only as much as he knows or has access to. This causes great tension, building with every scene. Some are more silent while others have very low, creaking sounds come on so that you begin to feel as paranoid as Harry does. Putting it all together is Coppola, so masterful at creating tone and atmosphere. His camera moves very little, choosing rather for the action to come into the frame than follow it. What we see may not make sense at first, but the pieces soon start to come together and like Harry we have to deduce what it all means.The Conversation is great because it admits the audience is smart and able to follow along with the action. There are no cars being blown up, no loud explosions or climaxes hitting you over the head. Everything is very subtle, subdued and fits into the context of the story. Simply told and convincingly acted, it explores the element of fear and how powerful an element it can become if it festers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mr. Caul is one of the more interesting characters I've seen. I doesn't help that he's played by my favorite actor (Gene Hackman). The movie starts off as pretty confusing. It's a story about a private surveillance technician that undergoes a job which makes him debate the ethics behind his work. If he goes through with the job, he makes a whole lot of money. The downside is, if he goes through with it - he also contributes to the deaths of two seemingly innocent people. Mr. Caul is a tormented individual who takes a lot of pride in his trade, but is haunted by the aftermath of his work.The movie reminded me of The Lives of Others. Very similar subject matter.The cinematography is incredible for a movie to come out of the 70's. I read somewhere that this film was made between The Godfather and The Godfather 2. I'd like to state that I feel that this film is not only better - but more important to the film industry than the whole GF trilogy. The music... the music of this film is incredible. There's a classy piano piece that plays throughout the extent of the film - sometimes accompanied by Mr. Caul practicing on his saxophone. Music is a huge factor in how I score films. I can't say I found anything wrong with the score, or the movie in general. I'm forced to give this a 10/10. I can't complain about anything. This movie is perfect in my eyes.I'm very glad to have found this at the rental store.P.S. - young Harrison Ford included!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Interesting Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Coversation was overall a great film, but somewhat slow for certain viewers in parts. Here is my usual good, lackluster, and bad section: GOOD: Most everything about this movie was entertaining and mysterious. I like mysteries a lot and this one delivered. Hackman's Harry Caul was an awesome character with his paranoia and suspicious nature. The story was solid and tidbits here and there throughout enhanced Hackman's character while adding interest to the film. The supporting cast did an excellent job, and the actor's were well-cast. LACKLUSTER: The ending to the movie left something to be desired, but that is often the trademark of a great mystery. If the audience knows all that happened, it leaves no intrigue to the movie. However, the ending could have used slightly more clarification. BAD: The only pitfall to this movie was by default. The film's progression was slow and methodical, leaving certain viewers no choice but to stop the movie 1/3 way through and pick something else. Thus, denying that viewer a great mystery. The suspense was just not there the first 3/4 of the movie. It was supposed to be understood, but the audience, at least I, did not feel it. Overall, this was a very good movie. Hackman's performance is my personal favorite of his. I have seen a LOT of movies in my time and this one would be on a top 25 list easily. If you like mysteries and have a couple hours of alertness to spare, this one should not be passed up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Conversation - Intelligent thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Conversation is not exactly a edge of the seat type of the thriller. Neither is it a thriller with a really convoluted plot and an open ending. It is instead a psychological thriller which is deeper than it seems at first. This is one of the movies which require repeated viewing because the on the second viewing, viewers are likely to notice something new at every stage.The plot is simple enough. Harry Caul(Gene hackman) is a surveillance expert who is hired to snoop on a couple. In the process he feels that something is not right and something terrible might happen. Revealing more may be detrimental as the slow revelation of the whole mystery is quite a treat to watch and on the first viewing the viewers are definitely going to be surprised. The main thing I liked about the movie was the slow buildup to the final revelation. The characters are properly fleshed out and this is what separates it from the run-of-the-mill thriller. We get an insight into the mindset of the surveillance expert and the ethical questions that arise in his mind. It also gives an insight into his loner existence and the way he distrusts everything and everybody. One scene that stands out is the scene where he opens his heart to Meredith. That scene portrays the fear and conflict in his mind. Another scene that is also interesting is the dream scene. The atmosphere is dark and the camera-work in this scene is exquisite. Another thing that I liked was the lack of music in many scenes which heightens the tension.I haven't seen much of Gene hackman but his performance in this is quite exceptional. His portrayal of the quiet distrusting man who lives a lonely life ranks as one of the best performances of the 70's. He is the pivotal character who carries the film. John Cazale is quite adequate in his limited role(funny how he has appeared in so many classic movies!). The female characters are not given enough screen time though. I love the dark feel of the whole movie and it has a noir-ish feel to it. So this is a must see for film noir fans too. My only complaint with this movie is the very slow nature of the movie that is likely to turn some people off. But ultimately it is rewarding. Overall it is a great mystery thriller which eschews cheap thrills in favour of character development and a clever ending which is likely to make people rewatch the movie again.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coppola's Silent Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, if you have never heard of this movie it is probably because it was overshadowed so much by the Godfather, but it is definitely worth worth your time. The pace of the movie is slow at best, but this does not mean that it is boring. It is important to keep an eye out for the details in the movie since the much of the genius lies within small and seemingly unimportant scenes. The tone of the movie is relatively silent which is fitting considering the protagonist's profession is personal surveillance, a field that does not necessitate social skill, but instead patient listening.Gene Hackman plays a reserved and sometimes disturbingly disaffected surveillance expert named Harry Caul. His best friend, or the closest he can get to one, is Stan, who is played brilliantly by a sheepishly endearing John Cazale. There are also some good supporting performances from Harrison Ford and Robert Duvall, who is strangely uncredited.Without divulging too much of the plot, Harry faces a major moral dilemma that skillfully includes enough context to make his problems seem genuine. This plot is also enhanced by the skillful sound work of David Shire, which is at times disturbing in order to heighten the tension of certain scenes.In short, this movie is actually a fantastic adventure into the dark mind of one incredibly complex character in a seemingly simple plot. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who can appreciate real cinematic art simply because the slow pace can turn off some viewers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magic realist paranoiac masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Watergate-period surveillance thriller that is much more than the sum of its parts. Gene Hackman's Harry Caul is an unorthodox existential hero. A man whose job it is to uncover and record information he's naturally sensitive to exposing himself. This is out of fear rather than lack of interest - he's prepared to go to confession - although it does mean that he's isolated, lacking love and real friends.Coppola skillfully blends the solemn professionalism of Caul and the portence of what his subjects appear to be discussing with this pitiful isolation. The story begins to dribble out of the grip of sanity as Caul's conscience attacks him in his dreams and then in what could be reality, Coppola producing a visual psychodrama comparable with Kubrick's contemporaneous The Shining. Complete with a first class cast and a wonderful bluesy score (you'd be forgiven for thinking that you're in New Orleans to begin with) this is a classic of modern neurosis that has been borrowed by many less successful imitators. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gene Hackman's character is asked to spy/record a couple's private conversation. Hackman is convinced that he is putting the young couple's lives at risk. "The Conversation" is a a fascinating study on character. Gene Hackman carries the film with honesty and intensity. John Cazale was one of our most gifted actors, and he left s too early. Allen Garfield is always true to his character and completely fun to watch. The cinematography by Bill Butler fits right in with the lonely existence of our main character and also the paranoia that ensues. David Shire's music as well as the production design by Dean Tavoularis enhance that.The director, Francis Ford Coppola, expresses himself like never before. The Godfather movies are classics and great works of art (1 and 2) and this is not competing with them. But I get the feeling that "The Conversation" expresses more of the filmmaker's own feelings and point of view. So, in that sense, I feel that it is more artistic. Coppola has given us some great movies, this being my favorite. I look forward to him coming back with that fire in his belly to deliver another one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Searching for the bug</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few months before releasing his legendary epic "The Godfather ? Part 2", Francis Ford Coppola crafted an understated, intriguing dramatic thriller, "The Conversation". Gene Hackman plays Harry Caul, a lonely private audio surveillance expert from San Francisco who becomes obsessed with a conversation he's recorded. He's afraid the couple he was hired to spy on is in danger, which leads him to paranoia."The Conversation" is not for everybody. Released shortly after the Watergate scandal (although Coppola had written the screenplay in the 60's), it's a slow paced character-driven thriller, and also a poignant study of a man who's too paranoid to trust anybody around him, including his girlfriend (Teri Garr). Gene Hackman delivers one of his best, subtlest performances, and the supporting cast is also very effective (particularly the late John Cazale; there's even a young Harrison Ford in a secondary but important role). Coppola's rhythmic narrative, underlined by a wonderful score that includes unforgettable piano pieces, is very European and seems to homage some important avant-garde directors from the 60's and 70's; some scenes seem reminiscent of Michelangelo Antonioni's now outdated "Blow Up" (1966)."The Conversation", though, more than holds up to the test of time. Even if its slow pace and somberness might turn off some of the spectators who grew up watching MTV and Michael Bay, its gripping story is timeless. The recent German production "The Lives of Others" (the movie that stole the Best Foreign Film Oscar from "Pan's Labyrinth" and is now being remade in Hollywood) has a similar protagonist, played by Ulrich Mühe (except that Mühe's character is somewhat more cold-blooded than Hackman's). In a world where paranoia is all around us (the Iraq war, money and gas crises, global warming, the end of privacy and all the cameras focusing on you right now), Harry Caul's search for the "bug" is tragically poetic - and hauntingly believable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Good 70s Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Conversation is a good example when Francis Ford Coppola use to be excellent director. The film is a 1970s paranoid thriller, focusing on Harry Caul (Gene Hackman), a surveillance expert. He is considered one of the best in the business, but is a very lonely man. His apartment is bare, he has no telephone, an empty office, no friends and spends his free time playing the saxophone. At the beginning of the film Harry is on a mission in Union Square in San Francisco where he records the conversation between a young man and woman. It is this conversation that Harry obsesses about during the whole film. This film is a character study and about the moral ambiguities about the surveillance industry. Harry throughout this film doubts what he is doing and worries about the consequence of his actions. He suffers guilt about what he did and refuses to give the tapes to the people who hired him. This obviously annoys them and puts Harry up against some dangerous people.The Conversation is a fine film. Gene Hackman gives an excellent performance, showing that he was top of his game. Francis Ford Coppola was great behind the camera and wrote a brilliant script, which was smart and compelling. Whilst I prefer the Godfather and Godfather Part II, the Conversation is a good film and shows that the 70s was when Coppola was best. If you love intelligent films then this is for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The hidden treasure between godfathers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Francis Ford Copolla is a strange director. He has made some movies that have little to no interest; but between 1972("The Godfather" )to 1979("Apocalypse Now") all the movies he directed are worthy classics and masterpieces. Those were years of an extreme creative capacity that less than a handful of directors have ever matched. And in the middle of his great run of titles, between the two godfathers, we find "The Conversation".Gene Hackman plays a brilliant and paranoid surveillance expert that suffers a personal turmoil with the way his work may be affecting his targets life.Copolla's impeccable timing in direction allied with Hackman genius construction of loner Harry Caul, makes "The Conversation" a thriller that is as unpredictable as it seems to be timeless; in no way has this movie aged and the subjects remain equally(if not more) pro eminent today as in 1974.The mixture of emotions and the downfall of the character is accompanied by an increased intensity, which reaches a climax with characteristics of horror.Supporting the cast are Harrison Ford, the always great John Cazale and Robert Duvall with a small cameo."The Conversation" is a 9/10 any day and year, with or without wiretapping.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE CONVERSATION (1974) **** Gene Hackman, John Cazale, Allen Garfield, Frederic Forrest, Cindy Williams, Teri Garr, Robert Duvall. Francis Ford Coppola's mid-piece masterpiece ? filmed between the first two "GODFATHER" films ? is a study in Watergate-era paranoia and a seminal '70s classic about a walled-off surveillance expert named Harry Caul (Hackman in one of his best performances ever), whose methods of spy ware enlists him into dark waters ? namely the plotting for a possible murder ? that ultimately sends him into a downward spiral, and more unsettling for Harry: the discovery of his own conscience. Well-crafted and executed with a stellar ensemble including a pre-star Harrison Ford as the veiled homosexual personal assistant to puppet master Robert Duvall and for trivia purists yes that is Robert Shields of Shields &amp; Yarnell as the mime Forrest &amp; Williams witness on one of their ill-fated meetings. One of the best-underrated classics of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coppola's best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A slowly unraveling thriller that reveals more and more with each new scene and all leads up to the stunning, haunting finale. I thought it was really ingenious the way that Coppola revealed more about Harry's past, the plot of the film and the conversation at certain intervals and each new reveal hit me like a brick. There is a theme of repetition used throughout the film that really added to the paranoia and fear of everything. This is mainly seen through the score and the repeated use of the actual conversation. Every time we hear one of these things pop up again it creates a lump in my throat and has me holding my breath to see what is about to be revealed. Coppola added a very dedicated feel to everything and it shows that he educated himself on surveillance techniques and made everything as realistic as possible. This also helped with Gene Hackman's very authentic performance which floored me since I'm generally not a fan of his. Harrison Ford was also very impressive. It's a taut thriller with a twist that shook me to the core and a certain scene involving blood in a toilet that had my heart stopped.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb drama thriller, fantastic performance by Gene Hackman.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think The Conversation is a rare kind of film in that the more closely you watch it and the more deeply you think about the themes and ideas in the movie (including well after it has already finished - it is quite haunting and memorable), the more you will enjoy it. Most movies work the opposite way, the more attention you pay the more flaws that make themselves apparent and the larger they seem to grow.The Conversation follows Harry Caul (Gene Hackman, in a great understated performance), "the best bugger on the West Coast" who secretly records otherwise private conversations for large cash rewards. He doesn't involve himself personally in the cases (as he verbally states), but his suppressed guilt is growing and he ends up personally affected in some way by the most recent conversation he has recorded. He feels something bad could be about to happen and is unsure what to do about it or how he should feel about it.One of the aspects I really loved about The Conversation was the way it was shot, in a somehow objective style giving the feel of peaking in on private lives through hidden cameras. For example, several shots are very reminiscent of security cameras in the way they pan back and forth slowly (including the final shot if I remember correctly). This style of course creates an interesting parallel with Caul's work. It brings to mind Rear Window in that it seems to become almost addictive to simply watch another person's life, though this is no doubt helped tremendously by Hackman's performance which I thought was fantastic.The score by David Shire was great and it helped to create suspense in some unexpectedly shocking scenes. I don't think many movies capture the true feeling of guilt the way The Conversation does (nor as memorably). I could go on and on about why I loved this movie, but that would arguably be a waste of time. Anyway, I can't wait to watch it again some time (as well as the commentary)! Highly recommended, but watch closely!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that respects its viewers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sandwiched between Godfather movies,this late-1973,early-1974 entry(I'm guesstimating there,actually)offering from director Francis Ford Coppola picks up on the burgeoning craft/profession of surveillance(no doubt this is in the shadow of the Watergate buggings,among other occurrences of the day!)and creates an intelligent and chilling movie.Seemingly ordinary and unassuming(and more than a little rumpled looking),Harry Caul(Gene HAckman,in a stand-out performance,which is saying something since he's had a strong career overall!)goes about his business efficiently and effectively. His business is surveillance,and he's considered one of the best at it. He knows just about every trick of the trade,and he regards his work as just that:work,done as professionally as possible. His private life reflects that on the distaff side:fully aware of the way his life could be invaded,he lives the bare bones,simple life of a hermit. He has no family,no pets,an unlisted phone number and a small underground apartment where he knows precious few of the other tenants,save the sexy,laid-back neighbor(Teri Garr)who will sleep with him.On an assignment to track a couple(Cindy Williams and Frederic Forrest),Harry becomes obsessed with the targets--particularly the female--and fears that this surveillance may cause their demise. Of course,not about to break with his professional ethic,he goes ahead with finishing the assignment and collects his money,but this doesn't change his obsession with this case. In fact,it just makes it stronger.Supplimented by strong performances by Coppola stand-bys John Cazale(as Harry's partner)and Allen Garfield(as a mouthy professional rival of Harry's)as well as up-and-comers(At the time)Garr,Williams and Harrison Ford,this movie trusts its viewers to understand the story at hand,the characters and their quirks,and the risks and moral traps involved. It seems like few,if any,movies these days want to spell out the visceral dread and terror of similar situations without some type of high-tension climax(i.e. explosions,gunfights,etc.)and that's a shame. When Hackman showed up in the 1998 Bruckheimer-produced,Tony Scott-directed Will Smith vehicle Enemy of the State,it was said that that character,also a reclusive surveillance guru,was possibly a continuation of that character. While it makes sense,it seems to me a shame to link a measured,intelligent film like Conversation to a very "Ka-boom"-oriented,linnear action film like EOTS. But that's just my opinion,I s'pose.Arguably one of the strongest movies of the era,it's lack of action or sexiness(for the most part)probably caused it to slip through the cracks of larger audience attention,particularly after it left the theatres. Good word of mouth turned me onto this film,and I want to spread it on. If you like a movie that trust you to understand the story it's trying to convey without hitting you over the head with it,this film's for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhat dull, but nonetheless, a good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The main criticism of this film is the playing over and over again of the same recorded message. Other than that, this movie was very good. Hackman is really a great actor. There is no guy, who is no Clark Gable, that can rivet the audience as well as Hackman. He plays a very intense character - someone who is a very good freelance wiretapper. You can see that although a very tough guy, Hackman's character is also a "geek" - really into analyzing and recording conversations. He alienates people in his life, because he is so intensely involved in every detail of his job. Terri Garr plays a love interest, who finally tires of his lack of attention to her. Harrison Ford is great as a spooky member of a private corporation that specializes in audio recording. This is basically the plot of the movie, a seeming innocent conversation between a man and a woman that turns out to anything but a casual, innocent conversation. The ending was very good. Hackman turns into a paranoid lunatic, sort of like at the end of the French Connection. Copolla was trying to show how technology has invaded our lives, and privacy is no longer a right. Enjoyable movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very interesting drama about surveillance, two decades before Enemy of the State. Much quieter and more low-key than that film, though the basic idea is the same. Gene Hackman delivers a brilliant performance, against type, as the paranoid, shy, scared Harry Caul. The sound is absolutely fantastic, edited brilliantly by Walter Murch. A young Harrison Ford is solid in a supporting role, and the ending is quite effective. Only one (big) problem: the story moves at a snail's pace throughout the sagging middle, and the central plot - the conversation which Caul has recorded - is never given enough time to develop. All-around well-made film, though, from directing to acting to editing. Not quite good enough to be well remembered, though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Conversation, On of Francis Ford Coppolas least talked about films, is a piece of film and sound history. Gene Hackman starring as Harry Caul, a "spy" for hire, gives an overly convincing performance. The use of sound in this film is key, and Coppola does not play lightly with it. Using a certain dialogue over and over again throughout the film in different scenes and yet not making ever boring or repetitive, but more intriguing each additional play. It is very interesting to watch a man who is so private and paranoid that someone is doing to him, what he does for a living, what I like to refer to as sophisticated eavesdropping. The only thing lacking is the characters motivations. He is clearly the best in his field, and obsessed with what it is he does, but we never find out why. Why does he love this work so much? It may be his fear of intimacy or his fear of allowing others to judge him, but it is never crystal clear. Overall the film develops without a hitch, and Coppola brings us the climax with the recurring style of the film very prominent. Sight and sound, when they are not properly viewed together can compose a completely different symphony than that which actually has been written.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great film, too often overlooked</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Conversation is a great film, even better than it is often acknowledged to be. I see it as essentially a study of loneliness. It turns on the irony of the title, for Harry Caul is a man incapable of conversation. He's an expert at eavesdropping and detecting the misdeeds and flaws of others, but he's incapable of real human relationships with the people around him. The poignancy of the film is that he really does *want* these relationships, and something in him also wants to do the right thing, to be a good man. But his efforts to do this in the course of the film only lead him into further isolation and paranoia.This is one of the best performances by one of Hollywood's really great actors, Gene Hackman. Hackman is one of those actors who can play either the villain and hero with equal skill and originality, but here he conveys with great nuance, restraint and poignancy the vulnerability and dysfunction of Harry Caul. As time goes on, this film can also be seen a gem in a particular era of telecommunications. All the loop-to-loop reals squeaking back and form, the cheesy listening devices -- all these props are used brilliantly by Francis Ford Coppola to intensify the sense of Harry's isolation and frustration, his painful inability to deal with anything but machines and recorded voices.This film should much higher on the IMDb list of the greatest films. Few films combine poignancy, psychological drama and suspense with such quiet mastery.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Harry Caul is a surveillance expert who has his own business. He spies on anyone for anyone for a price. Harry's philosophy is that he doesn't care what his targets say, he just wants a "nice fat recording." However, a past job seems to have led to three deaths and the thought of that has come back to haunt him as he works his current assignment.In parts this movie just screams brilliance. Gene Hackman's performance is top-notch as well as the film's many supporting roles. The story starts with a terrific attention grabbing scene and you are undoubtedly held by it. Nice voyeuristic camera angles and great sound editing from Walter Murch as Harry and his group spy on two people in a crowded square. The interest continues as Harry then goes to footage to prepare his tapes, but that is also where the movie somehow slows down inexplicably.The attention is all of a sudden not what the initial setup has made it out to be - the contents of the conversation in the square - but Harry's own empty life. A few scenes just drag as Harry does in fact have a boring life without many interesting goings-on. Other than his work, of course. The film picks up again for a well executed and even startling conclusion, but parts of the second act could have been executed much more swiftly.It is understandable that Harry's life is dull, that is even the point that the film tries to make, but it could have made it without itself being dull in those parts.Good overall, but a few steps away from the greatness that could have been made from such interesting material. 7/10Rated PG: some violent content and occasional profanity</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Conversation Francis Ford Coppola's film, The Conversation, does an outstanding job in examining the conscience of the human mind and the paranoia involved with privacy and secrecy. Harry Caul, a bugger extraordinaire, is able to find a way into the lives of even the most concealed person. He observes people in their surroundings and records conversations as a freelancer. His business is always successful, but he displays certain humility in his talent. However, through a suspenseful discovery, the audience finds out that his recordings have been a leading cause in the murder of more than one person. His Christian mind if horrified that he will not be redeemed because of his mortal sin. Then he finds himself in a similar situation. A conversation recorded between two people in a crowded park becomes the focus of a murder scheme. Once he realizes this possibility, his mind slowly falls apart as he attempts to make up for his last mistake by not giving the tapes to the person who could harm the people. He has an obsession with his own privacy that stems from his remarkable ability to track others. This is evident from the scene where he is given a birthday present and card, and his only thought is, "How did you get the present in the door?" The director geniously incorporated the audience as playing a huge role in the issue of privacy. We are watching this movie and trying to figure out all the small details, how it fits together, and what is going on in all of the characters lives. The suspense provided by the eerie music, the suspicious glances from Harry to the rest of the world, and the unknown plot create that curiosity in the viewer. This draws us closer to Harry because of his equally keen sense of curiosity. Although he strives to be morally right by telling Stan that he does not record people to find out about their lives, rather it is only his job; he goes against his own beliefs as a detective in this murder case. Everything that he stands for is questioned which ultimately leads to his being recorded.Harry's insanity is expertly directed to show scenes of blood and murder, and a graveyard scene where he desperately tries to warn the woman involved in the conversation. He tries to de-bug his place and fails to find the recorder, but after the scenes with the toilet overflowing and woman being brutally murdered, it leaves it up to the viewer whether he is actually being watched or not. Especially considering the fact that the telephone was recording him, which was the same "trick" used by his competitor as a sales trick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paranoiaaaaaaaaaa</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, which came out in 1974, is truly one of Francis Ford Coppola's (writer, director, and producer of the movie) most under-appreciated movies. The Conversation, starring Academy Award Winner Gene Hackman is a film of mystery, suspicion, paranoia and murder. Hackman plays a professional surveillance man, or "wire taper" named Harry Caul. Caul is one of the best in the surveillance business, and he is very secretive and personal about his business. During a seemingly routine surveillance job, Caul gets caught up in the conversation between the young couple he is spying on, and suddenly doesn't wish to bring his evidence to his employer. His suspicion and paranoia slowly come to a climax as he comes closer to discovering the truth in this mystery.The part of this film that has the most long lasting effect is the character of Harry Caul, and the emotional turmoil he goes through deciding whether to do what is humanely right, or to do what is professionally right. When he suspects through his analysis of the tapes that the couple having the conversation is in danger of being murdered, (based on the man saying "He'd kill us if he got the chance") he becomes suspicious of everyone, and acts in unkind ways to his friends, lovers, and colleagues. His partner, Stan (played by John Cazale) quits when Harry first becomes obsessed with the conversation. The woman Harry seems to be seeing, Amy (played by Teri Garr) says the wrong thing and Harry walks out on her, never to see her again. Harry's paranoia is tearing his life apart. We see this tearing apart of his life in the ending, when he complete demolishes his apartment in search of a bug that was planted in his house to spy on him. Harry's paranoia and suspicion of everybody is one of the reasons this film is so strong.Harry decides to finally bring his client, "the director" the evidence he and his team have found. However, the assistant director, Martin Strett (played by a very young, and very convincing Harrison Ford) wishes to take the evidence instead. Harry, as paranoid as he has become, refuses to give the tapes to Strett and leaves the building to try to warn the young couple of their impending doom.Finally, Strett sets up a plan, and a young woman who Harry sleeps with steals the tape from his loft and brings them to Strett. Harry feels a personal responsibility to help the young couple, and goes to the hotel where he suspects the murder will take place. He hears an argument beginning, and from the adjoining room, he sees part of the violent act being committed. On further inspection of the hotel room hours later, he finds that the murder has been concealed, and finds blood soaked towels in the toilet.He again goes to see the director, to confront him about the murder of the couple that he believes has happened. However, there he sees the couple alive, and finds out the director has died in a car accident. He realizes that the young couple have killed the director (who was the young woman's father) and fixed the car crash to make the murder look like an accident. During the conversation that Harry listened in on, the young man said "He'd kill us if he got the chance" emphasizing the "us", showing that the young couple, and probably Strett and the rest of the organization, have constructed the murder of the director.This film, certainly one of Coppola's greatest of his illustrious career, is one of mystery and paranoia. The great performances of Hackman and Ford make this stand out, and the mystery that surrounds the plot create suspense that keeps the audience focused and interested throughout. In general, this is one of the best mystery and suspense thrillers I have seen.</fullReview>

Gene Hackman plays a paranoid surveillance operator, Harry Caul, that tries not to reveal any details of his life to anyone, however no matter how hard he tries things still end up getting out. His sense of self and the world around him is completely destroyed by the events that follow him in the movie.Harry takes all precautions to make sure no one is following or listening to him. He takes the bus so his car cannot be followed, he says he doesn't have a phone and always uses payphones, and his apartment is guarded not only by several different locks but an alarm system as well. Harry plays the tragic hero in many ways. He wants to do what is right for a change and it ends up coming back to bite him. Despite the alarm on his apartment his landlady is able to leave him a Birthday present, and his house is easily bugged. In fact Harry is bugged twice during the movie, and he is supposed to be the best. You feel sad for him because he is so alone. When he finally does give in to a woman and seems to "trust" her she goes behind his back and steals the tapes right from under his nose.This movie not only follows the lonely life of the saxophone playing eavesdropper, but explores the morality of spying as a profession. Because of his work people have died and once he actually becomes involved, like he never wanted to, and listens to the words themselves he grows a conscience. By the end he has literally torn his life apart over it. Throughout the movie there are images of religion that cannot be ignored. It seems that God is the only thing that Harry can truly reveal everything too. It did surprise me that he went to confession though. I was expecting it to be someone that would use what he said against him. Every time he begins to be "normal" something confirms his need to be constantly on guard. It is sad to think what happens to him after this is over. At first it seemed like he took precautions because he wanted to feel important enough that someone would actually want to follow him, and now that someone is it destroys his life. It was surprising that he brought all those people back to his workshop as well. Either he was drunk or just wanted to fit in and not seem out of place, but it showed that he wasn't being careful when it mattered most. Standing outside his "girlfriends" place for an hour seems a little much, but taking precautions with your work is understandable.It seems as if Harry is caught between the world of religion and the world of spying, and also reality versus perception. Towards the end it is hard to tell what he is really seeing and what he perceives to be real. His mind is slowly slipping, along with his ability to separate work and the personal. Music seems like the only thing that will save Harry or at least give him some comfort. He allowed himself to become too involved with a job and it ultimately was the cause of his downfall.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Voyeurism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Conversation Response Annie Gleba Francis Ford Coppola does a superb job of making the audience feel incredibly uncomfortable with his film The Conversation. The film is entirely based on the feeling of paranoia and constant awareness that the nation was feeling during the time the film was made (the early 1970s-during/after the Watergate scandal). The main character of the film, Harry Caul (played brilliantly by Gene Hackman) seems to be paranoid as an occupational hazard; however by watching him and others throughout the film, the audience ends up sharing many of the same thoughts that Caul presumably has.The opening of the film dives straight into the voyeurism that is represented throughout. We are watching a crowd in a park, and closing in on an individual. We're able to hear all the distant noises from the crowd, but we're also able to hear louder noises that seem closer. We are the voyeur. We are the eyes and ears of one of Caul's assistants. We see and hear what the spy sees and hears, and we will stay in the position of voyeur throughout the film. The first time it gets to be very uncomfortable to be in this position is the scene when Caul arrives at his apartment. He walks into another room, but our focus stays in the same place. We can hear him talking, we can hear him moving around, but we can't see him. We're merely a peeping Tom, observing what we can from a fixed position. This becomes even more uncomfortable when the position shifts and we watch Caul unbutton and take off his pants after a long day of work. These are very personal things we're witnessing, it seems wrong to be watching, but that is what Coppola wants us to feel. Coppola wants us to play the part, wants to put all of the stresses of the paranoid voyeuristic character (like Caul) on us, so that we end up relating with him more and more throughout. We're being conditioned to feel uncomfortable.Caul (and eventually the audience) represents the sort of paranoia and distrust that was largely felt by the people of America during this time in history. After Vietnam and Watergate, the numerous assassinations that occurred in the 1960s, etc, the country was on edge. It seemed one could never be too careful. Caul is the epitome of careful?he doesn't want anyone to be able to have access to any personal information of his, and is deeply suspicious of everyone he comes into contact with. He's lonely, yes, and his paranoia prohibits him from ever being able to have a real/loving relationship with anyone (he loses Amy, a girl he had presumably been seeing for this very reason), however he is safe. When he starts to trust (like the woman he slept with in his office, his fellow bugger friends), he embarrasses himself or loses power over situations that he wanted to have ultimate power in. At times, it seems as though Caul is paranoid about the wrong people/things. For instance, he's suspicious of Amy?he spies on her doorway before he goes to open the door, he never shares anything with her, but he's not suspicious with the easy blonde that he sleeps with and she's the one who ends up betraying him by stealing the tapes that he had gone through so much trouble to protect and keep to himself. Also, he is always concerned about being bugged or spied on himself, but he doesn't think twice when a fellow colleague sticks a pen in his pocket for no reason (and since the audience has now become deeply paranoid by this point we cringe at his ignorance).This film hit hard. During one of the ending scenes, when Caul is in the hotel room looking for signs of the murder he thinks he has caused, the audience is just as on edge as he is. We share every fear, every sigh of relief, gasp of fear, and feeling of shock that he has during this scene. It is the epitome of uncomfortable, and Coppola's point of making the audience aware and paranoid is thoroughly understood at that moment. It's a smart film, although a bit slow-moving, and makes a strong comment on the American mentality during this time and on the power of film in general.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is there privacy?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Conversation is a brilliant conspiracy and paranoia film. Staying consistent with many of the films that we have viewed this semester, it is also an allegory of the times during the paranoia stricken early seventies. The turbulent years of Watergate during the Nixon administration (1972-1974) put the country in a fearful state. One in which they felt they could no longer trust their government or their privacy. This movie speaks to that mood perfectly with the character of Harry Caul (Gene Hackman). He plays a surveillance expert, and being in this line of work has seen how easy one can be monitored. Because of this, he has geared his life towards protecting his own privacy to the point where he has no real connection with anybody and is totally alone in life if not for his coworkers, who only know him as the best in the business. They are unaware if he has children or even a wife. His paranoia propels his desire to protect himself. It seems to be almost a sickness as he is able to speak his true feelings once drunk to the spy that Martin Stett (Harrison Ford) sent to infiltrate his lab and steal the tapes. He says that he wishes he was able to be intimate with someone, but was still unable to disclose anything about his personal life.Being that paranoia is a valid response to the dark and deceitful things that had been going on around this time period, Francis Ford Coppola is able to instill that uneasy feeling in the viewer even if you are of this generation. A contrast can even be made today with George Bush's patriot act. Being that country is completely divided, it is not beyond the government's will or means to take certain rights breaking precautions to protect itself from any harm. At what cost do we sacrifice our right to privacy. Harry Caul would say no cost. Even with his guarded demeanor and isolated lifestyle, Harry is unable to free himself from being monitored himself. The climatic point is when Harry finally decides to do the right thing and ignore the objective aspect of his work. This in-turn makes him subject to the very surveillance he had been running from all of his life. The movie leaves the viewer with an eerie feeling that no matter how one lives his or her life, or what we think we know about our government, we could be completely and entirely wrong and unknowingly be subject to government interference and surveillance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Conversation was such a great movie because the whole movie was a mystery and this made it very suspenseful. The whole movie was centered around the one conversation between the couple and this was the big mystery, but there was also many other mysteries that weren't explained in the movie. There were many things that we never found out or when we did find out it was the complete opposite of what we thought.The first little mystery we encounter is how Harry Caul's landlord was able to get into his apartment to give him the bottle of wine on his birthday. He has three locks on his door and an alarm system in tact. She is able to get into the room because she has keys to all three of the locks which Harry is not aware of. Then somehow she is able to get around the alarm. How she does this we don't know and never find out.Another unknown detail is how Harry's apartment was bugged. First off they were able to get into his apartment somehow through the three locks and the alarm. Also they were able to hide the bug somewhere that was impossible to find. Harry ripped his apartment to shreds and found nothing. This tells us that the bug is somewhere that is very hidden because Harry, the master of surveillance, can't even find it. The way I think that they did it was through the telephone bug that Moran demonstrated at the spy conference. I think this because the first time the phone rang no one was there, then the next time it was Martin Stett with a recording of Harry in his apartment. The only reason that it couldn't be the telephone bug is because the phone rang the first time and Moran said the phone would not ring when the bug was used. That is why this part is a big mystery.The big mystery of the film is what the conversation between the couple was about, and who was getting killed. The whole movie we were lead to believe that The Director was going to kill the couple for reasons unknown to us. The whole time we followed Harry as he tried to solve why The Director would want to kill this couple. Then in the end it was the couple that killed The Director because she was married to The Director. Martin Stett was in on it the whole time with the couple and we were never shown this. It was a very unexpected ending. I figured that The Director had Martin Stett kill the couple in the hotel room, but it was the complete opposite. That is why this movie was a great psychological thriller. It had you thinking one thing the whole movie and then turned it on you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Technology is the root of all evil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this is Coppola's best film. It was a sleeper; going unnoticed in the wake of the Godfather films. This is a film of great intensity. Gene Hackman's Harry Caul knows everything; or so he believes. As a communications expert, he is privy to all the new junk that continues to be produced to invade the privacy of people. He relishes the fact that he can listen in on anyone and is held in high esteem by his peers. Then, suddenly, it becomes obvious that if he knows about this stuff, others do, and perhaps someone is watching him. The conversation between two young people sets up the intrigue. Caul first obsesses on his work; his efforts to decode the conversation. Then it gets to his efforts to thwart those who are coming after him. He goes from a man, confident in who he is (though he is pretty unconventional), to the hunted. The beauty of the film is that there are unseen layers that continue, even after the credits. It's the old thing where one door closes and another one opens. Harry must close all the doors and is left in a labyrinth of modern technology, much of used to betray the premises this country is based on. There is no guilt. We often ask how far can science go. How much should be given to the scientific world. Some say there should be no limits. Whenever we see movies of foreign espionage, we realize that our government has a lot of clout that we can't even envision. Can we ignore it? Can we do anything? That is the question. This is one of the best films ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great, "looking over your shoulder" mood piece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Conversation" (1974): Nominated for Best Picture of 1974, directed by Francis Ford Coppola, starring Gene Hackman, Frederic Forrest, Cindy Williams (soon after "American Graffiti"), Harrison Ford (ditto), and get this ? an uncredited Robert Duval- all add up to one creepy, suspense drama, with a solid character study to hold it all together. Character "Harry Caul" is a surveillance expert. He's a professional spy, and gets good money for doing it. He's also a loner, and has an intense, justifiably paranoid streak that his privacy is something of an illusion. He's also haunted by some of his past jobs. This is not a comedy, obviously, but nor is it a crime story packed with action. It's a great, "looking over your shoulder" mood piece of the highest quality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrifyingly Realistic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Conversation is the story of Harry Caul (Hackman), a man hired to record a conversation between two people who work for someone known only as The Director. Since Harry is an expert in surveillance, he knows there's something behind what these two people are saying. As the story unfolds and Harry's character develops, we realize that he may be in way over his head as he's lead into a world of intrigue and murder.Gene Hackman's performance is up there among his best and may only be beaten by his character in The French Connection. If you liked that film, then this will be up there on your favorites list as well. He plays Caul as if he's set on getting the character exactly right. Down to the pauses and nervousness that he gives off, Hackman is perfect for the role and shows that he's definitely one of the best actors of the past 50 years.But he's not the only one that shines in this haunting film. John Cazale's performance is something else to behold. Since he only made five films, one should cherish what he's made and what we get to see of him because every time he's on screen, we know that he can set the tone of a scene with just one line of dialogue. Cazale does just that in a perfect supporting role.Fredric Forrest and Cindy Williams play the two talkers who we know barely anything about, but, like Caul, we're sympathetic to them from the start. The more and more we hear of their conversation, the more and more we feel as if we know them. Since that's pretty much the only dialogue they have in the film, both actors knew to make the most of it and they certainly did.What makes this film stand out for me are the subtleties that we only see with further viewings. Of course, you only need one viewing to know that this is one of the greatest films ever made, but you'll like it even more if you watch it again a few years later. On a recent viewing I noticed that it opens with an aerial view of the park where the conversation takes place. Our eyes are fixed on a mime walking around and imitating the passing people. Only on this viewing did I realize the importance of this silent character in a film that's all about the sense of speech.With such perfectly executed continuity, brilliantly acted performances, and an excellent script, one must wonder why such an amazing film isn't as well remembered today. I can't give you the answer to that question, but I'm sure that anyone who sees it will wonder the same thing because they'll know that what they've just witnessed is a masterpiece that only the greatest of filmmakers could give you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gene Hackman's performance as paranoid wiretapper Harry Caul will be looked back on as one of the best in his career, and easily Francis Ford Coppola's most non-Hollywood film. This style of film is rarely seen in the U.S. today, which makes it so refreshing to see even though it's over 30 years old. This film will never become dated, and may even become more relevant in the years to come. I would to say anyone interested in the art of film-making, and not bound by Hollywood formula, that this is a must. The acting, direction, and pacing is brilliant, resulting in one of the most intriguing movies of the 20th century.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Francis Ford Coppola's slick espionage caper in between his two masterful Godfather installments is well worth while to watch. 'The Conversation' follows a surveillance professional, Harry Caul (Gene Hackman) who becomes madly obsessed and sort of in love with his client. Gene Hackman gives a performance nothing short of riveting that should have earned him an Oscar nod, no ifs, ands or buts. 'The Conversation' is so intricately written and crafted it earned three Academy Award Nominations in 1974 including Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay, but the film was out-shadowed since it was released the same year as The Towering Inferno, Chinatown, and of course, The Godfather Part II. This interesting espionage thriller also stars John Cazale, Robert Duvall, Cindy Williams, Teri Garr and a very young Harrison Ford. 'The Conversation' is a little slow moving at first, but it pays off big time towards the end. The Oscar nominations in 1974 for this classic should have been - Best Picture, Best Director - Francis Ford Coppola, Best Actor in a Leading Role - Gene Hackman, Best Original Screenplay, Best Film Editing, Best Sound. I highly recommend this. Grade: B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Gem.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of Francis Ford Coppolla's least hyped films and made between filming Godfather 1 and 2, this is a real gem of a movie, and ripe for re-discovery. Gene Hackman gives a fantastic, understated performance here as surveillance expert Harry Caul - it's the kind of film where he doesn't have an awful lot of dialogue, yet he still manages to breathe life into his character. It's such an un-glamorous character that it must have been a brave role for an actor like Hackman, who was a rising star at the time. It's a million miles away from his performances in other films of this era such as 'The French Connection'. Harry Caul is a sad, lonely, seemingly un-emotional man, yet considered by his peers to be the best in his field. When he is asked to spy on a couple of lovers he begins to question the motives of his mysterious employer. He is reminded of an incident in his past which lead to the deaths of some people he was spying on, and so he begins to become obsessed with the case, and the fate of his targets........It's the kind of film that many younger modern day film watchers may struggle with as everything about the film is understated, from the deliberately slow pace of the film to the acting. There are no action set pieces to speak of, and yet it's the kind of film that (if you let it) gradually draws you in and in it's own way is more gripping than many of todays so called thrillers. It's a great cast and viewers will no doubt enjoy seeing a very young Harrison Ford in an early, unsympathetic role. I also found many of the themes of the film (religious guilt, fears that 'big brother' is watching') to be very relevant today some 30 years on.Not for all tastes for sure, but those who appreciate great acting and like their films to be thought provoking should check this out. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

The tortured life of Hackman's character, his gradual disintegration into final redemption and acceptance of his lack of control. The loneliness of a man's struggle to live his own life on his own terms within his own moral codes, and how these presumptions betray him.The empathy I feel for Hackman's character in this film can't be expressed in words. I suspect you must live the life portrayed, at least to some small degree, to recognise its genius.</fullReview>

It paints a portrait of a truly lonely man whose loneliness ultimately leads to his downfall. It all felt very "David Mamet" like but done for the first time. In retrospect, John Caul seems to be developed much like the Val Kilmer character in "Spartan." The cinematography completely adds to the character development and the feel of the movie. Dialogue is kept to a minimum to give further insight to who we're dealing with. In sum, watch this movie, you won't be disappointed except by the current state of movie making!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On the shortlist of the critics lists and not appearing on any viewers' lists (let alone Coppolla fans), The Conversation had the unfortunate distinction of being released at the same time as Coppolla's Godfather 2. If not for Godfather 2, this film would have been given the Oscar for Best Picture (it received a nod, and Godfather 2 took the well deserved prize).Gene Hackman is a Harry Caul, a professional eavesdropper with a conscience. He's been mixed up in problematic situations in the past and they haunt him. His personal life is a mess, and his new job uncovers a plot that he can't excise himself from without going crazy.Harry Caul is no Popeye Doyle. Harry Caul is no Royal Tenenbaum. Harry Caul is no Little Bill Daggett. Harry Caul is closer to Sen. Kevin Keeley, a man with authority but also a shaky inner strength.Gene Hackman plays Harry Caul brilliantly. Also stars Cindy WIlliams and Harrison Ford.</fullReview>

Minimalist yet vivid plot. Fun to see Harrison Ford in first of his two minor roles in Coppola masterpieces. The theme of the movie is particularly apt today - the ability of surveillance technology to access our innermost secrets - we've come a long way and yet nothing quite shows its spookiness the way this movie does. I wonder if Hackman's lab in Enemy of the State is a sort of homage to The Conversation - I truly doubt it but would like to think so. Of course, there's also Lex Luther's laboratory in Superman, with its even more obscure entrances. Then there's Hackman as powerful politician who kills girlfriends (two movies, both times near the beginning of the film)...hmm...I wonder if he also has recurring dreams.</fullReview>

Read "The Movie Brats" by Micheal Pye/Linda Myles for more detail. The film it self is fantastic,but it is pathetic that Coppola has not given much, if any, credit to the man who really was instrumental in it's creation.I am not saying that.

		<fullReview>'The Conversation' is a superb mystery/thriller. Gene Hackman, rising star after the vastly over-rated 'French Connection' finally gets a chance to shine under the direction of Francis Ford Coppola, who was 'between Godfathers' at the time.The plot begins with very little: Hackman is an eavesdropping expert, employed to record the conversation of a young couple in a park - why, neither he nor the audience knows, but as the film progresses, so do Hackman's misgivings over the whole business. The tension which is conjured by Coppola is remarkable. Almost nothing happens: the film is very slow, there is almost literally no action at all, yet the movie gradually develops a paranoid, claustrophobic atmosphere, such that seemingly innocuous shots seem to be imbued with a sense of dread. And without giving anything away, I'll just say that the one substantial use of stage blood in this movie makes Kubrick's elevator scene in the 'The Shining' seem benign (and no, the scene doesn't involve an elevator).I watched 'French Connection' a week before this, and couldn't believe how much Hackman had improved in the space of three years. Of course, in 'French Connection' he was given a bog-standard cop character: even Roy Scheider was boring in that movie. Coppola gives him a fascinating character which really lets him stretch out and show us what he's got; which turns out to be a lot.I won't spoil the movie for you, but I had actually never heard of it, and judging by the modest number of votes here, it has been largely forgotten. See it. It's quite superb, though those who demand action and thrills at every turn will be disappointed by its slow pace.As a side note, I presume Hackman's character went into retirement for 23 years after this movie, to emerge as an even more paranoid surveillance expert in 'Enemy of the State'9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Technically, this is one of the best movies that I have seen in a long time.Coppola was really on a role in the 70s, and this movie is a fine example of his skillful filmaking. "The Conversation" is an extremely intelligent movie, like an older Momento or maybe a Hitchcock movie. The story is not only captivating, but it is also a good character study on Hackman's character. There are some amazing performances in this movie -- Gene Hackman is phenomenal, but I don't think we expect anything less from him! Coppola captures Hackman's growing paranoia very well. He knows how to create a very tense, almost painful to watch mood, which is very effective in a movie like this. I also thought that the score was really beautiful... great music. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harry as Us</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Conversation works because Harry Caul is a tragic everyman figure. He is poignant and misguided in the all too familiar way of the mere cog in the machine, taking dubious pride in keeping one's little part of the mechanism running, steadfastly refusing to look at consequences or take responsibility for one's own behaviour. Harry is proud of and obsessed with the wrong things (with technological prowess, with being `the best'), afraid of the wrong things (being proved wrong or incompetent), and he is finally undone and wretchedly alone, without any real understanding of how he has become so.In Harry's case, when his composure starts to shift, he becomes persuaded that his technical competence has been used by the wrong people, with deadly consequences, and is about to be misused again. In the end, however, he retreats further into himself than at the beginning of film--when he was already remarkably alienated and cut off from others. His tragedy is in not progressing or learning anything in the course of the dramatic action. He remains fixed in the stubborn choices that have left him without a human connection. He is as proud as ever, but brought down, because in his own eyes, he has failed at the very thing at which he is supposed to excel--namely, being a faceless spy without vulnerability. He has tried to make himself unknowable, and in the end, succeeds too well. He does not know himself.Harry also has no insight into the inherent risks of the technology with which he works, doesn't see that he has made himself into a paranoid extension of his spying tools. The whole sad, alienated beauty of the film would never work on us so well if we were not a sad and estranged people, keen on our technical toys, vaguely afraid that ruthless and unethical people are running the show as we go about our little chores. Harry brings all that unfocussed sadness about who we are to a distinct and squirming point of focus. We feel for him, feeling for ourselves. We would ALSO like to rap him on the head and say, `give it up, Harry, that's beside the point.' There's more than a little insight into our own forms of pointless perseverance available from viewing Hackman's fine performance, in Coppola's great little film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently watched this movie for the first time and was really interested to read everyone's comments. I did want to add something about Hackman's character's name....Harry Caul. Occasionally a baby is born with the amniotic sac empty but still basically intact around the baby. (There's nothing wrong with the baby.) This covering is is called a "caul". The old wives' tale is that a child who is born with a caul is possessed of extra-sensory powers throughout its life. Obviously this is a fantastic symbolic point for Harry. He even walks around with his own "caul" in the form of the plastic raincoat he wears.Leonard Maltin gives this 4 stars and calls it "one of the best films of the 1970's". I wouldn't go that far but it was gripping and creepy. I loved the simple piano score. I agree with the person who commented that this movie made him think of current society with John Ashcroft and his minions threatening to undo many rights to privacy. (Heck, he even wanted mailmen to report unusual behavior, remember?) Makes you wonder who's watching, who's listening, and who's keeping score. I don't think it's a great film but I'd give it 6.5/10 and say it is worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the genial excesses of The Godfather, Coppola's minimal account of Harry Caul's falling from grace anticipates the Apocalypse to come (here's also a man commanded with a job that turns into a personal obsession). Like De Palma's Blow Out, this is essentially a film about filmmaking and film watching. The task of reconstructing a whole from disconnected fragments, the necessity of sharpening the eye (or the ear), the fatality of becoming both the voyeur and the object of his look; the themes are universal, Coppola's mastering of them is unique.</fullReview>

Ok now back to the movie at hand, no spoilers HERE.

He agreed only if they would finance THE CONVERSATION. IMAGINE THAT.David Shire provided the simplistic movie score, with only a PIANO, no Orchestra, no guitars, vocals, etc, etc. Coppola wanted only just a Piano being the person at hand Played by Gene Hackman was very secretive, private and paranoid to begin with, the music fit his every day schedule i suppose.FIRST MOVIE TO INCORPORATE THE TITLE SOUND DESIGNER(MONTAGE), wALTER MURCH, the behind the sound of Apocalypse Now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Still-Relevant Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I won't rehash the plot of THE CONVERSATION, beyond stating that I think it works perfectly as suspense - the slowness only heightens the tension as we watch Caul's paranoia slowly take over. This film was a brilliant creative commentary on Watergate - the moral implications of watching a surveillance expert (a potential agent of control) collapse into paranoia is compelling, and the final scene - which is devastating - implies that Caul may have psychologically gotten what he deserved, even while underscoring his humanity. Hackman's performance is magnificent, and Harrison Ford and Cindy Williams work is excellent as well. David Shire's skeletal piano score is outstanding, and the cinematography - which occasionally mimics various types of surveillance cameras to devastating effect - is easily one of the high-water marks of 70s American cinema.After watching this for the 1st time (about a year ago), I immediately and unconsciously thought about John Ashcroft, the presence of technology in our daily lives and new-ish political incursions into personal privacy, and couldn't help but feel stunned at how newly relevant this 32-year-old film is (and hoping someone doesn't come up with a short-attention-span remake). Artistically and sociopolitically this film blew me away, and I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great insight into the "Watergate" era.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After "All the President's Men", for anyone interested in the mood of the country during the Watergate era, this movie is a great companion film - avoiding all the mistakes made by Oliver Stone (who confuses fact with screenwritten fiction in 'JFK' and to a lesser extent, 'Nixon') . Coppola creates a chilling "first person" viewpoint of the protagonist in a dream sequence - capturing the inner voice of an intelligence operative. His isolation, paranoia and soul-searching is very representative... with a small religious statue in the final scenes symbolic of the internal crisis many good men in government and intelligence were probably experiencing post-Watergate. Hackman is brilliant and Cindy Williams is a pleasant surprise in her role. This is the type of script that would be "test audienced", reshot, reedited... and ruined in the search for a greater audience. Of incidental interest is the analog surveilance technology of the era.</fullReview>

The way he gradually reveals his fears of repeating the unfortunate incident with his union taping in years past is just devastating. I will never look at a hotel toilet in quite the same way again. Harrison Ford could have played more bad guys-its almost a shame that Han Solo and Indiana Jones have been his defining characters. The rich and creeping hell of the final scene will stick with me for a long time. For those of you like me who thought Popeye Doyle and Little Bill were Hackman's ultimate characters, please give Harry Caul a chance. The Conversation is outstanding on many levels!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a quarter of a century, Humankind (pun intended) did a lot to perfect the technology of spying, intruding on your fellow citizens. As humankind is so removed from a way to perfection, you'll easily identify with some of the characters - eventually with the wrong ones, as the film has a couple of surprises coming at the end. I saw Antonioni's Blow-Up at its release, and saw it several times after. What Antonioni did with still photography as a means to "solve" a mystery, Coppola does here using another media, sound. These two films are a must-see, and should be together in a DVD. In my opinion, Coppola adds more interest, and personal drama, to the main character, but that may be is due to Gene Hackman's master acting.I hope this film will not die on a film archive's shelf. Great lesson on how sophisticated technology is nothing, without the human brain to make the correct lecture of "objective" results...

		<shortDescription>Interesting Downer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>* warning: although I don't go through the plot, I do refer to it.Yes, this film is an interesting downer. I can watch it a few times in succession, and feel no better about myself or anything else as a result. It draws attention to the emptiness in my life, such as mundane conferences, playing instruments alone in an apartment, and paranoia.I have some random thoughts which occurred to me while watching this three times in the last two days.First if all, it's interesting to hear Coppola's sounds. Besides the interesting sounds associated with the tape, the horrific sounds which occur at the time of the 'murder', banging on the piano with those odd synthesized horn sounds, are clearly tied to the sounds he used on Apocalypse Now.As for the piano soundtrack, it reminds me directly of the piano soundtrack in Bullitt. Basically, it sounds like the same exact chord progressions and melancholy tempo. In many respects, this film can be seen as a more introspective, less sexy version of Bullitt, both investigators getting personally caught up and estranged in their research, in San Francisco.The more times I've seen this, the more I see that ambiguities are a part of the picture. I can't resolve certain crucial issues. Here are some examples:1. In order for that blonde chick to run off with his tapes, one must assume that his recently defected good buddy, and the guy he defected to, and possibly his other buddy as well, are in on the scheme and have collaborated with his client's assistant, which is, frankly, far-fetched to me.2. Hackman is upset when the landlord used a key to gain entrance to his apartment and leave a bottle of wine behind the door and a birthday card, since the landlord should not have had a key nor knowledge of his birthday. There's an absurdity to this though. After all, Gene doesn't have one key, but a whole slew of keys and an alarm system blocking his door. For anyone to have penetrated that, I would imagine Gene should have been not just suspicious, but certain that someone has been invading his area, and, knowing Gene's character, he should have begun an immediate inspection of the premises for theft or tampering.3. If the assistant indeed procured the tapes from Hackman using the blonde as a thief, and if the assistant was a conspirator against the corporate directory, then why would the assistant play the tapes for the director? Maybe that wasn't the real director? Maybe the whole event was imagined in Gene's mind?4. The tip-offs for me that Gene is hallucinating revolve around his images of the murder scene. It's as if he reconstructs scenes from his imagination. When he's listening to the conversation in the adjoining hotel room, it's the couple talking, there's no hint of the director in the events leading up to the murder. He imagines a bloody murder scene, but he never saw one. He imagines blood bubbling up from the toilet, but clearly that never happened. In short, it would appear that Hackman's character is crazy and that this film is shot through his eyes. All this talk about how good Hackman is and how professional (his character is). Well, is it so? He gets completely caught up in the emotions of his work, misunderstands everything, and can't even figure out that the bug might be in his saxophone.Other notes:I think I remember seeing a version of this film where he has a big safe in his apartment, and he puts the money in there. I don't see that safe this time, in this version of the movie I'm watching. Maybe that was another film?Lastly, this film is a real downer. At moments it's terrifying, but more often it is just alienating. This character is similar to Hackman's portrayal in the French Connection as well, a detective who bumbles his way through a case and doesn't figure it out. Both films end in the same way: Hackman alone with himself, tracking his villain in vain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coppola's most personal film. Proves him as the best director of the '70s.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Conversation" is a great paranoid character study disguised as a thriller. And it works magnificently on either level. It's one of the finest, most interesting films out of the '70s, a great decade for movies. While I should probably see "The Godfather Pt. II" again, this film assures Coppola's position as THE filmmaker of the '70s. He somehow managed to take great art -- that was also wickedly entertaining -- and make it commercially viable. There's a sad moment during his commentary for the film where he reflects on never having attained that position again after the great, ambitious masterpiece "Apocalypse Now" was.The opening shot of the movie, by Haskell Wexler, who, Coppola says, left the film due to artistic differences, is a great one. Shot with long lenses, we see a mime walking around a couple in a park area. He walks by a man who then proceeds to follow that same couple, observing. The man then leaves, goes over to a van, and gets in the back. He's a surveillance expert, we learn. A professional eavesdropper who's been hired to piece together the conversation between the couple in the park. In the van, the man, Harry Caul (Gene Hackman) checks on the other people surveying the couple. They're using things like gun microphones which can be aimed at objects from long distances and pick up specific noises. Also in the back of the van is Harry's partner, Stan (the late, wonderful character actor John Cazale).The movie focuses on Harry. The conversation, of course, is important, but what's more important -- what Coppola (who also wrote the screenplay, inspired by Antonioni's "Blowup") is interested in is Harry's life. When Harry goes home, to his apartment, he opens the well-locked door to find a bottle of wine left by someone downstairs. He wonders how they got in, and we start to wonder if Harry is as smart as he seems to be. We see Harry's girlfriend Amy (Teri Garr), though she's not really a girlfriend; Harry just sees her at his own convenience, neglecting to tell her about himself.At Harry's workspace (it looks like a caged section of an underground parking lot) he tries, rigorously, to piece together the elements of the conversation he and his assistants have recorded. When Stan starts to inquire as to what the couple is talking about, Harry becomes incensed, saying it's not important; that what's important is that he gets a good-quality tape to transfer to whom it is that hired him. Of course this is ridiculous, as Harry himself becomes more obsessed with the tape. And when he unscrambles one line in particular, "He'd kill us if he had the chance," he becomes infatuated beyond help.The man who's hired him to record this conversation, we learn, is "the director," a head of some corporation. When Harry decides to turn the tapes over, the director's assistant (who'll appear later), played malevolently by Harrison Ford, motivates him to change his mind.Harry is deeply religious, and we see him at a Cathedral, in confession, confessing that his tapes have gotten people in trouble before. We hear of one instance, in particular, that left a family murdered; one of Harry's recorded conversations made one man in a two-man scheme think the other had talked to someone.At a surveillance convention, some of the background is given to us. Another surveillance expert, Moran, is thrown into the mix for coloring. He doesn't affect the plot that much (or does he?), but he adds some flavor to the film by "penning" Harry. When Harry's tapes mysteriously disappear, the movie kicks into gear. Everything up until now has been build-up.Harry becomes a part of a larger conspiracy. His phone number is suddenly made available, he fears that he may have become the surveyed, he doesn't know who to trust.The two repeating themes of the movie are: repetition and eavesdropping. The principal tape from the opening is listened to again and again, at different times. The more we learn, the more the tapes begin to mean, the more they change meaning. The editing in the film is, as is often said, amazing. I didn't know how, going into the film, the editing could be anything special, but it really is. The way the initial conversation is edited into the film as it goes; as Harry listens to the tapes, we're shown the scenario in different angles, from different viewpoints again and again. As Harry deciphers the tape, the jumbled words (sounding like computer language) slowly come into form.The sound in the film is extremely important; the subtlety of the tape, the sound of the voices. David Shire's soft, jazzy, haunting piano score is invaluable. Also, the camera is interesting. Aside from that terrific opening shot, some of the camera shots seem delayed, which is interesting. On the commentary, Coppola describes how he intended the camera to act as a surveillance object, moving as if it were automated.The conspiratorial suspiciousness makes an interesting parallel to the Watergate scandal which was occurring (or about to occur) around the time the movie was released.Hackman gives one of his best performances, understated, and intelligent. He plays Harry as a loner who's closest companion is his sax -- a close companion that, by the end, Harry might have been wise to get to know better (wink, wink).Naked from the excess of "Apocalypse Now," and not as lush as "The Godfather," "The Conversation" may be Coppola's most important movie in terms of showing what he was capable of, alone, at his peak. All that, plus a great ending with the most freakishly horrific toilet flushing you're ever likely to see.A masterwork of real suspense.****</fullReview>

As an hommage to Blow-Up (Antonioni) or as a model for Blow-Out (dePalma), it clearly stands on its own as a truly brilliant film. Relationships are explored within the skewed viewpoint of the introverted Harry. The isolation of Harry is depicted as a character flaw rather than as a "disease" as today's pill-happy society would like to label it. He is intensely distrustful. One of the most poignant final scenes in film history. Meshes well with the ceiling tracking shot at the end of Taxi Driver, although much more effective.The whole movie is an illustration of paranoia.Operates at many levels, including the social, psychological, emotional, spiritual, financial, socioecomomic, interdependent, and supernatural.

		<shortDescription>A sound track to die for</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILER AHEADA pristine print and a theatre with a good sound system made it a delight to see this film again after nearly 30 years. The sound track somehow puts you in the head of Harry Caul, 'the best bugger on the West Coast'. As Harry, Gene Hackman, fine actor that he is, has probably never done anything better than this superb portrait of a true professional forced to face up to the consequences of his work. Here, a corporate executive (Robert Duvall in a brief and uncredited cameo) uses Harry to get the goods on his much younger wife Anne (Cindy Williams), who seems to be spending rather a lot of time with one of his underlings, Mark (Frederic Forrest). Harry starts out a firm adherent to the credo 'I just do surveillance within the law and I'm not concerned with what my client does with the data I collect' even though we discover that a few years previously Harry did some bugging for the government which resulted in the death of an innocent woman and her child (the woman was married to a mobster who had turned informer). By the end of the movie though, his views have altered considerably.As a thriller, this film is not particularly fast moving, and the time spent at the security trade show and the drinks at Harry's afterwards, amusing as it is, seem a little off track ? his relationship with his professional peers could have been established more economically, one would have thought. Only the very end of that sequence, the encounter with Meredith, advances the plot. On the other hand, the opening sequence as we zoom in on Union Square in San Francisco while Harry walks toward the targets is terrific. We hear their voices amongst the myriad sounds around them as if we were standing next to them. However, the clarity is intermittent. Later, in his warehouse workshop, Harry and his assistant mix and match the three sound sources into one, and what seems babble on each individual track suddenly makes sense ? the phrase 'he would kill us if he could' jumps out. But which word is stressed? Harry doesn't find out until it's too late. Harry is a fine technician but a bumblefooted investigator, and it is not surprising that he fails to prevent tragedy. In the end he sits in his wrecked apartment, defeated by the technology he thought he mastered. Now he is just another victim of it. In the end the film is not so much a thriller as a character study. In 'Enemy of the State' (1998) Harry Caul, as embodied by Gene Hackman reappears as Brill, still the great technician, but older and wiser. 'Enemy of the State' has much more action and is faster paced, but 'The Conversation' remains the more memorable movie and it has to be amongst Francis Coppola's finest work. He wrote as well as directed, and although the plot is not complicated he manages, with Gene Hackman, to make Harry Caul completely believable. The dream sequences are a little cute (lots of swirling mist), and I'm still not sure whether the blood in the toilet bowl is real or imagined (surely a four star hotel in San Francisco has plumbing that doesn't go into reverse ? in my experience the USA has the best bathrooms in the world), but this movie was a real breakthrough in cinema technique. Music and sounds are blended seamlessly and become as important to the picture as the actors.A few years later in 'Nashville' Robert Altman used multi-channel sound to great effect, though it was confusing at times. Coppola has since become more conservative in his approach to films - 'The Rainmaker' (1997) for example. Wealth seems to do that to people but Coppola can feel legitimately proud of this earlier effort, which, incidentally, cost only US$1.6 million in 1973 dollars ? about $10 million in 2002.</fullReview>

The pace would be much faster. There would be more sex, and it would be more explicit. All the subtlety and nuance would be lost. Watching this film today is heart-wrenching. We've lost so much. Harry Caul is arguably the greatest role of Gene Hackman's career. Part of the reason for this has to do with Francis Ford Coppola. In this film, Coppola subordinates every element of the film to Harry's character. Everything that is going on is designed to not just explain and reinforce what kind of man Harry is, but to actually, as closely as possible, give us his experiences. The film forces us, through repetition, to listen to the titular conversation in the same way that Harry does. The film's very slow pace allows for the meticulousness of the character to be fully explored and understood by the audience. Harry constructs a barrier between himself and all the other characters in the film. In the same way, the film constructs that barrier between the viewer and those characters. They are superficial characters, for all we see of them, and we never get even a peek at the underlying substance of any of them. Again, this puts in not only in a position to understand and empathize with Harry, this puts us as directly as possible in Harry's position. Harry is paranoid (or rather, becomes paranoid), and through the brilliant, gradual development of this aspect of his character, and the gradual development of the film's plot, the audience becomes paranoid right along with him. This film needs to be seen many times. Having seen it three or four times, there are still lots of elements of this that I haven't come to grips with. But when you are watching it, it is immediately apparent that you are watching something from a bygone era in film-making. No one seems to have the courage, anymore, to make films like this. I'd much rather see a film which cuts corners on plot to create room for character than the other way around. I cherish this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Coppola directs a master piece of subtle, tense, every day life drama with a conflicted (and young!) Gene Hackman playing a high-tech eavesdropper recording a crucial and potentially lethal conversation of two young people in the middle of Union Square in 1974.Hackman is superb, Coppola has just the right touch, and we get to see Harrison Ford one year after Graffiti and 3 years before Star Wars. OK, for the 80's crowd, that's TEN years before Indiana Jones.Must see, and surprisingly tense considering the slow pace. Great soundtrack...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not a film critic, so the insightful comments of others here are best read if you're looking for artistic commentary etc. What I do know is that The Conversation is an excellent suspense film. Hackman is great as Caul... a brilliant performance from one of the best actors of our time. And it's always entertaining to see Harrison Ford in his younger days. An excellent suspense film... it might be a bit slow for the Playstation 2 generation, though a short attention span is no excuse for disliking this film.Bottom line: it's easy to see why this film was nominated for the Best Picture Oscar in 1974, losing out only to Coppola's other great film that year, The Godfather II.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Coppola's smaller films which still manages to create a big impression.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***Some minor plot spoilers***A first class effort from the mid-70's golden age of cinema. The film is a psychological/political thriller, with Hackman an obsessive bugging expert, assigned to record a young couples conversation. He becomes personally involved in the situation when he thinks the couple are in danger, with his recording putting them in further jeopardy.The premise and execution of the main plot are both excellent - even the technical elements of the bugging become enthralling as the tapes are played back and forth to draw out more and more audible dialogue. The eventual plot solution, with its irony and implications, is superb and the final scene with Hackman alone in his flat is a defining moment from 70's movie-making.'The Conversation' has its faults though, which prevent it from being a classic. The mid-section of the film loses momentum, with Hackman's character, so carefully built-up and defined early on, acting implausibly and even downright dumb - from being a lonely but strong, obsessive man, he crosses the fine boundary to being rather sad and loses some of the audiences empathy. The dream sequence, while not totally plot destroying, is still clumsy and pointless.Despite these annoyances, the film as a whole is greater than the sum of its parts - there are similarities to Antonioni's 'Blow-Up'(1966) in themes, but also quality. The structure of the film probably puts too much emphasis on Hackman's character, but the overall effect is strong and whilst not one of the best films of the 70's, it is still an important offering. Coppola shows his usual mixture of brilliant and frustrating elements and the film is understandably one which has more critical than popular acclaim.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pivotal Seventies masterpiece...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coppola had been treading the boards in the Sixties, and when he got his biggest break directing 'The Godfather', he pretty much was on an incredible role. Working on that previous film was a major strain on Coppola, and his follow up movie, 'The Conversation' is a more subdued creation. But it is, in my opinion, a much more disturbing and haunting film, helped enormously by David Shire's solo jazz-piano score, although his two 'Godfather' films are slightly better works of cinema. But 'The Conversation' is an astonishing film, a landmark in American personal film making in the 1970s. The style of photography (by Bill Butler) is amazing, with slow, delibrate pans (like a surveillance camera) that really makes you focus on all the ingenius touches the film is filled with. The ever-brilliant Gene Hackman gives a riveting performance as Harry Caul, "the best bugger in the south-west!", a 'bugger' is, of course, a surveillance expert, and Caul IS the best. The initial premise of the the film, is that a 'conversation' between a man and woman is recorded on audio tape by Caul and his colleagues, Caul doesn't know why he was asked to record the couple, all he wants is a "nice FAT recording", he distances himself from the personal aspects of his work, and closes off ALL outside contact in his own life. His apartment door is heavily secured, and when he finds a birthday present in his LOCKED apartment, he flips-out and tells the landlord (who sent the present) to stay out of business. Throughout the film, Harry tries to decipher the conversation, and get a mix that will be of as high-quality as possible, but there is something sinister about THIS recording......What follows is a piece of cinema brilliance.'The Conversation' is a slightly over-looked film, it is not a 'cult' film, but it is overshadowed by Coppola's mafia epics and the awesome, 'Apocalypse Now', but don't be denied - get a copy of 'The Conversation' on DVD, it comes with a 1974 'making of featurette', trailer, and best of all - 2 audio commentaries, the first is by Coppola, and the second is by sound editor, Walter Murch, who excelled himself on this film, and went on to 'invent' the precursor to Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.--Mac--</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you exhibit patience with the slow moving, yet extremely intriguing story, you will be rewarded with a great ending as well as fabulous performances and direction. The subject matter is one that our society wonders about whenever we see a movie like this. Can they listen to us? Do they listen to us? The film feeds off of that while at the same time providing multi-dimensional characters. This is the epitome of Francis Ford Coppola's obsession, evident in most of his films in the 1970's, with the separation of business and personal. The inability to segregate one's personal morals or interests and their business or professional duties. The conflict being mainly within the character himself. If you enjoyed Enemy of the State, The Conversation is the undeclared pre-quel, but do not expect a rock and roll fast moving espionage thriller movie like Enemy.This is a definite "Should see" movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Conversation" by Francis Ford Coppola is a terrific movie. This one man, Henry Caul, is regarded as the best surveillance man in the country and he is hired to record the conversations between two people. He just records the conversation because that is what he is payed to do. But the longer he holds on to the tapes the more flashbacks he has to a case that he did where his information lead to two murders. This movie is full of suspense that just builds right up to the end until the movie abruptly ends. The end of the movie still leaves you with some unanswered questions but it makes the movie all that much more mysterious. This movie was absolutely terrific even though I never heard of it before I saw it and most other people don't know about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When American Film was at a Crossroad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Conversation" is a highly complex film that defies synopsis or explanation. It's a film made by three artists at their peak: Coppola, writer-director; Hackman, the lead; and David Shire, who wrote the score. Together, they express the art of film, in every scene and in every frame. Their collaboration is seamless and effortless and gigantic. They give and take, scream and whisper what every film should be. A man, Harry Caul, is a wire-tap technician "pre-eminent in his field", seemingly in control of his life, but suffering constantly under that delusion at the hands of those lesser people around him.His painful, deliberate steps to stay private, unknown by anyone professionally or personally, physically or emotionally, are violated at every turn. By his landlady, Mrs. D'Vangellista, who manages to circumvent Caul's expensive and sophisticated security system to deliver a cheap bottle of wine inside his apartment door. How? We never do find out. He even tells her: "I don't have anything personal. Nothing personal except my keys!" A competitor, William P. Moran, is nothing but a cheap salesman who steals ideas from everyone in the business. His interest is money and his only craft is making it. Most insultingly to Caul, Moran manages to record Harry's most intimate and personal moment in the film. Caul is bewildered, confused and starts to unravel. In the last sequence of the picture, Harry is bugged in his apartment by the client and driven to distraction and ultimately, capitulation when he can't find the bug.Perception and reality. Who's really in control of their life, and what can they do about it? The world is a brutal place where emotional and physical violations happen day after day, month after month, year after year, forcing the people who live in it to slowly, gradually and quietly ... give up."The Conversation" represents the zenith of American film, because when it was released in January 1974, American Film asked and explored this question constantly. It was a time when all things seemed possible. Real, actual emotions were explored, analyzed, conveyed and felt. Characters were complex and ambivalent and frustratingly human in their inability to control outcomes. Plot drove ideas, not action. There were no endings, the camera just stopped rolling, and the characters continued to live their lives off the screen. At that moment, American films were looking at us, not the other way around; seeing who we were and what we thought and how we felt. They were our conscience and asked difficult, sometimes painful questions about our lives. They made us think. They made us better. But "The Conversation" is also a painful analogy for what happened to American Film. Like Harry Caul, it too was confident, in control of its own art, aware of its strengths, seemingly without equal. And then slowly, inevitably, criminally, it got violated. Cheapened and assaulted and ultimately, destroyed. Destroyed by the very same people who hired Harry Caul, in fact. It turns out it was all about the money. It's always about the money.The very last scene in the film completes the analogy. It's a simple shot. A shot of Harry Caul, alone on his apartment. The victim. Look at that scene and cry. Cry for what might have been.</fullReview>

And while the movie may be a tad slow and Hackman may be a little annoying at times, to me, this movie is a minor triumph, a real gem. I find it amazing that Coppola wrote and directed this while under studio pressure to deliver Godfather 2. Because watching the patient build-up, observing Harry Caul the conflicted-Catholic in action personally and professionally, getting sold on the con, leaving the movie open-ended...you'd think he had all the time in the world to craft the movie.

His surveillance operator had no life of his own, which is exactly why he drives himself crazy over what should be a routine conversation. Coppola lets the viewer figure out what's going on, unlike many movies today that hit you over the head with details. It also holds up very well for its time.

		<fullReview>The Conversation is yet another great film that goes to Coppola's credit. Gene Hackman gives a brilliant performance as Harry Caul, the paranoid snoop who is given a job to record a couple's conversation in a crowded square. The film opens with an elaborate sequence of Harry Caul and his crew recording this conversation which remains as the center of the plot for the rest of the film. Coppola masterfully switches back and forth from an intruiguing mystery, to an in depth character study. The film plays like a thriller but is a story of this man's coming to his senses, and taking responsibility for his work. He realizes that the tapes he has recorded could lead to the murdering of two people. His initial principal of his work is that he shouldn't care about what the people are talking about, he shouldn't care at all. However, he does become involved and becomes responsible. The film also includes a lot about surveillance witch adds authenticity to the picture. It's compelling all the way through. The plot twists and becomes broader and broader. Good guys turn out to be bad guys, Harry Caul may have witnessed a murder in the hotel or he may have been having a psychotic episode. None of it is an absolute, and it could be viewed in different ways. It has an atmospheric piano score, and all of the supporting parts are well played. One of the best films of the seventies.</fullReview>

The plot is driven by the main character's curiosity, not action scenes or gratuitous violence. The Conversation is for people who can follow a plot. Watch it from the beginning for full effect, or you might go away wondering what the whole thing was about.

The film, which revolves around the recording of a mysterious conversation by surveillance expert Harry Caul (an always-incredible Gene Hackman), builds gradually, so that when the traumatic climax arrives, we are almost stunned at the effect. From the brilliant opening shot to that unforgettable final scene, Coppola explores his world with understatement, artistry and a level of psychological subtlety that is highly unusual in American films. What is more, the film is remarkably prescient in its exploration of themes which continue to haunt us today. A real classic. Definitely among the very best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A New Level of Morality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the late sixties, foreign film maker's began to influence American cinema in a remarkable way. Directors began to pretend like they had a camera in a corner of the room and they were filming real events. They attempted to make everything look as real as possible. "Bullitt" and "Mash" are two excellent examples of this. This new realism became a perfect style for thrillers. Why? Hitchcock taught that the key to suspense was to have a bomb ready to blow up but not let the audience know when it will explode. Realism is a perfect style to bring about this sort of suspense because there are all these seemingly unimportant events heard and seen, and the audience knows that they've got to pay attention because at any moment something important is going to happen. When the surprise or shock occurs, wow. Realism engages the audience in a powerful way, because they are required to pay more attention. More is contributed by the audience and so the audience feels like they've earned the payoff.By the early seventies this became a popular style and really the only appropriate way for Francis Ford Coppola to choose in making his unknown masterpiece, "The Conversation." The style matches the theme. It's as if we are spying on Harry Caul as he spies on others.This film was made in the days of Watergate and it is falsely assumed that Coppola was making some sort of commentary on it. He had plans for this movie far before Watergate. The movie uses a conversation as it's center, but it's not really about it. It's not even about the wrongness of eaves dropping.The film surpasses it's subject and plot to express a far deeper theme and this is brought about by the development of Gene Hackman's character, and of Harry's character arc. Harry Caul is a man of principle, religiousness, and morality. His job is to listen to other people, but he doesn't treat his job like a peeping tom. He doesn't care what they say. He doesn't pay attention to what they say. It's not personal. It's business. And he's the best in his business.Until one day he actually listens to one of his recorded conversations. Suddenly he realizes that his work gives others the motivation to do far more evil things than eavesdropping. He begins to suspect that murder is in the plan for his subjects of study.This is a film about a man who begins to connect with his society and consequently reaches a new level of morality. He discovers that life isn't just about keeping your own nose clean but about keeping others' noses clean as well. He begins to make this step when he asks his coworker to not take the Lord's name in vain. As he decides whether to give the tapes to his employer Harry realizes that to empower others with the opportunity to do wrong is almost as immoral as doing the wrong himself.Style and theme work hand in hand in this brilliant film.Oh, and one last point. There is a scene in this film, so shocking in what it shows and what it infers that I just about fell out of my seat. It's clearly one of the greatest scenes in film history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Conversation" Speaks Volumes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For aspiring filmmakers seeking tips how to make a simple, yet complicated movie, rent Francis Ford Coppola's The Conversation. It is an intricate thriller that ironically juxtapositions how a man who watches for a living can live a life in a world that's suddenly watching him.THE PLOT: Gene Hackman portrays Harry Caul; a paranoid, isolated man who is infamous in the world of free-lance surveillance, but a nobody in the world he survails. Harry has been hired to spy on two people under `The Director's' employment. Once the job is complete, Harry goes to claim payment for his services from `The Director,' but is greeted by his assistant; played with villainous glee by Harrison Ford. Harry declines payment and delivery of the conversation until `The Director' can pay in person. Ford warns Harry to be careful, prompting Harry to wonder what's really on those tapes. The plot thickens when Harry sees those he recorded working in `The Director's' office. Harry listens to the tapes and hears what one may interpret as a plan for murder. Having his work harming others in the past, Harry vows not to let it happen again. It's a race against time as Harry tries to spy on those who are spying on him.THE GOOD: Everything. Coming off The Godfather, Coppola writes and directs a technically efficient thriller. From the `Big Brother is watching' opening zoom to the voyeuristic, "hiding in the corner" wide angles, Coppola maintains a constant under surveillance tone.Distorted sounds echoing over the soundtrack evoke a feeling of being watched.Hackman goes against type with a subtle, yet compelling, portrayal of Caul. Harry's paranoia comes through what he does, not what he says. He quizzes one's motive forgetting him a birthday present. He even spies on his girl, Teri Garr, for loving him more than he loves himself. The plot and Harry work as one to deliver an unpredictable twist ending that leads to an even more tragic denouement for Harry. The Conversation is one of the few films in which the plot is the twist, which serves for more than just shock value.THE BAD: The film ends.Just `watching' The Conversation is a cinematic injustice. There is more than meets the eye and the ear in this film. It requires one to recognize the symbolism in order to decipher what it is we need to hear from what we think we heard.</fullReview>

From the first few minutes, the film crept its way across the screen, but its leisurely pace felt fine with me and it seemed very appropriate for the story and the character development. i would contend, though, that this film is more about Harry Caul than about the conversation in question, recorded, dissected, and reprocessed sonically throughout the film. To me, the better film characters are those whose personalities, values, fears, and ambiguities are lifelike and specific, and THE CONVERSATION does this for Harry Caul like few films from today do for their characters. i could identify with Harry's guilt and his need for privacy. This vintage 1970s film is masterfully done and highly recommended, even for younger fans like myself (age 26) who would like to see some modern classics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the things that was so refreshing about this film was how its use of music was more subtle compared to films now that overwhelm you with overly-dramatic music. Gene Hackman's acting was perfect because he took a minimal approach. He didn't have to be obvious or forthright to give us a sense of his character. The inherent irony of his character is that he makes his living by intruding into people's private lives, even though he himself is so fiercely protective of his own. It does resemble "Blow Up," in that in both films the protagonists witness a situation, for which they ultimately have no control over the outcome or the consequences. It's a haunting film that accomplishes a lot by not over-reaching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Blowup", Anyone?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hardly anybody I talk about this picture with notes its strong resemblence to Antonioni's _Blowup_, tweaked to suit Coppola's interest. Much like Leone's take on _Yojimbo_ in _A Fistfull of Dollars_, it manages to be altogether homage and nicely original at once. Like _Blowup_, the pace is slow and the action driven by character and a fine-grained story. But frankly, Coppola is working to his (largely unacknowledged) strength here in wresting strong performances from a large ensemble to the end of just getting a good story told -- when he does that (as in this, _The Godfather_, _The Rainmaker_ and a few others) and eschews fancy sets and overly symbolic storylines (_One From the Heart_ and _Apocalypse Now_) he can produce elegant, beautifully-crafted work.</fullReview>

Hackman has the performance of his career as Harry Caul, a disturbed, professional wire tapper. I liked the way Coppola weaves the characters around Caul, such as his girlfriend (Terri Garr), co worker (Cazale), etc. A slow paced thriller, but that's what drives the movie.

		<fullReview>Few movies have been more successful at exploring the dark side of the human psyche than The Conversation. Francis Ford Coppola, in the director's chair, does a superb job of keeping the suspense level high, and Gene Hackman gives a performance of incredible depth; we truly believe that Caul is sinking into madness trying to unravel the depths of the seemingly innocent conversation he recorded. How Hackman was passed over at Oscar time is utterly beyond me.</fullReview>

That same year came "The Godfather Part II." But the Academy had enough sense not to discriminate and smartly nominated both films for best picture.

		<fullReview>The Conversation is a movie about a surveillance expert. That's an interesting subject matter and if you like seeing movies that are different than this is right up your alley. It is not a movie for the mainstream audience though. It's a bit too slow and uneventful. Nothing major happens, although the small details and direction are very good. The story is about this one conversation that we see being recorded in the beginning and hear over and over again throughout the film. Each time we hear it, we learn more about it. That idea is pretty cool. I liked the movie, but I don't think it's exciting enough for most people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw this, I knew Francis Coppola and Gene Hackman were both doing great work at the time (as in, Godfather, French Connection). But The Conversation was better, much better, than I expected.It seems like right then was the window in American film history where such a movie could be made: "small," tight, careful, playfully even daringly misleading, amazing to watch, and crushing when it needs to be.A very natural style, too, that reminds me of John Cassavetes's movies. It lets the actors and the characters shine.In fact I had so much fun watching Hackman as Harry, the story trapped me but good and left me wounded and helpless. You don't want his life but &lt;shiver&gt; it becomes yours. Very, very good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have probably seen "The Conversation" at least 20 times (I have a lot of free-time). Obviously, this film is a personal investment, but I didn't always feel this way. The first time I saw Coppola's opus, it was right around the advent of MTV, somewhere in the early-to-mid-80's. I was already taken in by the fast-paced, video revolution. Hollywood was also affected, as it began churning out films with the BIG-BAM-BOOM mentality ("Top Gun" and "Flashdance" come to mind), and suddenly, movies slowly started to suck. I'm not covering any new terrain here. It's a rote debate that MTV, though in many ways a significant contribution, has screwed a whole generation out of embracing films that take their time. Films that are patient. Not boring. Patient. The first time I saw "The Conversation," I don't think I even sat through the entire film. Too many distractions, I had to catch the world premiere video of Men Without Hats. A few years later, after my Uncle Don trashed the family t.v., I managed to see Coppola's film again at a friend's house. This time, somehow, I stuck with it. And this time, I was rewarded with a profound experience. "The Conversation" is blessed by the performance of Gene Hackman, a man normally known for his virile portrayals as Popeye Doyle, Lex Luthor, and Little Bill. Here, as Harry Caul, he's an awkward, tortured surveillance expert (a metaphor for "artist") who falls from grace for taking pride in his soul-killing work. I love the way this film examines every pore of this man's painful life, and how his work ethic and guilt have taken its toll. Coppola was at his peak here. I know that the majority of the AMC audience doesn't want to sit down and take in every nuance. It's work. But there's a pay-off if one sticks with this stark, horrifying film. It doesn't get any better than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coppola's best film, and one of the best films ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Francis Ford Coppola's The Conversation was the movie that the director made between the first and second installation in the Godfather Saga. That said, this film is nothing like those two epics. It has none of the sweep and grandeur of those films, and suffers not one iota for it. This film is an exquisitely crafted character study. The character is Harry Caul, a brilliant eaves dropper, the best surveillance guy in the country. But he is troubled by the consequences of his past jobs, with these concerns and feelings of guilt brought to a head with his new job. This film is really about accountability, in an almost Biblical sense, with Harry having to face, eventually the consequences of his "sins." The film is clearly an indictment of voyeurism, and drives that concept home all the more poignantly by drawing attention to the act of moviegoing itself as a form of voyeurism. We are made to feel as if we are snooping on Harry Caul, intruding in his life. And we are meant, in some ways, to feel responsible for some of the events that transpire. A powerful, haunting, brilliant film from a brilliant director. Gene Hackmen is amazing as Harry Caul.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cappola has made some of the best and frankly worst films in America but this is his masterpiece. Reputed by many to be bleak and sombre, I find it very funny throughout, it's memorably horrific ending excepted. It's a very perceptive examination of a man unable to shake off his own Catholicism by obsessing with precision and technology, instead finding himself sucked into guilt, confession and ultimately an unattainable absolution. He cannot bring himself to break his statue of the virgin Mary until the very last where he finds it piquantly empty. He wants the young couple in the park to succeed in their love affair as he is unable to find a similar loving union in his own life.It is puzzling that Hackman was not even nominated for his intricate and subtle performance as the ridiculous and repellent Caul who even spies on his own girlfriend and steadfastly refuses to take responsibility for the fruits of his own labour. Notice his body language as he constantly tries to turn away from whoever engages him in conversation. Other funny moments include his reaction to his girlfriend unexpectedly breaking out into the song on his tape and a priceless bit when he goes to deliver the tape to his client and keeps glancing at a cleaner's industrial floor shiner as if it contains a hidden bug. Coppola supports the performance with some telling shots such as Caul suddenly stepping behind a screen that blurs his image while others are trying to pry his secrets from him after the conference.The editing, especially the sound department, is masterly as Caul painstakingly tries to piece together the tape, his own personal demons blinding him to the fact that technology is a tool that can deceive. Ultimately, although the tape becomes crystal clear, Caul hears only what he wants to hear, rendering it useless. The sadly departed John Cazale gives his usual excellent support as another everyman and proves why one film magazine got more enquires about him than any other actor a few years back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dark gift from the 70's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching the Conversation makes one realize how much US film-making has changed since the 70's, particularly when you compare it to Enemy of the State, the 1998 Will Smith vehicle. Both movies deal about the threatening aspects of a society obsessed by surveillance. In both movies, Gene Hackman plays the role of a top professional surveillance man, possibly the same character. The 1998 movie is fast, thrilling, violent, colorful. The Conversation is slow, relatively calm and uneventful (only the last scenes are violent and a little gory) and the cinematography is ice-cold. Enemy of the State stars an energetic, young, handsome, positive black hero (with a loving family). The Conversation hero is a tedious, 40ish, moderately sexy, unsympathetic white man, unable to develop normal relationships with people. The 1998 movie involves a large scale conspiracy, while the 1974 one deals with an intimate one. The 1998 movie is formulaic and follows the usual `wrongfully accused man' pattern. The 1974 movie has a complex plot and characters who actually interact with each other. Enemy of the State is fun to watch, plays with the modern viewer's knowledge of movie clichés, and it delivers two hours of good entertainment. The Conversation is less fun to watch, a little self-conscious, but it certainly leaves the hero, and most spectators, in a state of shock.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie shows you that you SHOULD be paranoid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How strange it was to watch this movie after seeing Hackman's role in the more recent "Enemy of the State," where Hackman again plays an alienated, crabby, and justifiably paranoid spy. And no wonder, he seems perfect for the part. Hackman's Harry Caul can be rude, forceful and thoroughly unpleasant without seeming really threatening or dangerous. He's nasty, but he's vulnerable. He's human. I feel like I've met this guy.Harry is a surveillance expert who has recently completed a masterpiece of spy-craft, the taping of an enigmatic conversation that took place in the middle of a crowded city park (Union Square, San Francisco). The powers that be express an unexpected amount of interest in the tape, the contents of which make little sense to Harry or anyone else who hears it. Against his better judgement, and even against his will, Harry pieces together the conversation's meaning. The process is tense and suspenseful, with plot twists worthy of Hitchcock.One of my favorite things about this movie is the way Harry will find a clue here, a hint there - and then we watch as Harry recalls some snippet of the conversation, this time finding new meanings and ominous new subtexts. We come to understand the conversation piece by piece, as Harry does. Too many modern "suspense" movies spill the beans early on, in favor of climatic action sequences. There is none of that here - this movie could almost be classified as a mystery. All is explained at the end of the film, but that IS the end. There are no silly showdowns.Along the way, we get a taste of just how many ways there are of spying on and prying into the lives of unsuspecting people. Harry's arsenal of gadgetry and trickery is enough to make the viewer a little paranoid even in the 1990s, 20 years later. And the real spies have had those 20 years to invent new tricks. Yikes.If you like suspense movies and don't think they require car chases or guns, this is a must-see.</fullReview>

I must say that Harry did some incredibly stupid things for the 'best surveillance' pro. The whole point of the movie was that he could not let the content of the tapes get out. So what does he do? He leaves them lying on the reels for others to listen or steal.Overall, you must have patience to watch this movie. There are no shoot-outs or chase scenes. Dialogue is pretty sparse. The movie is more about mood and build-up, and giving the audience pieces but changing it around in the end. Good flick but not as visually stunning as Apoc.

		<fullReview>Francis Ford Coppola's first picture after The Godfather Part II, 'The Conversation' is a character study in the true sense of the word. A smallish picture set in Coppola's stomping grounds of San Francisco, this film features a superior group of character actors, notably Gene Hackman, John Cazale, Robert Duvall, Alan Garfield (who's always great), Frederick Forrest, and a bit part by Harrison Ford.This film came about at a time when the general public was somewhat under informed as to the widening use of surveillance techniques in non-government applications, and presents a dark portrait of a man with limited purview who knowingly stretches himself far beyond his own capability. This film asks a lot of questions, leaving many of the answers to your own interpretation or ponderance.I am not onto this film with the fervor or superlatives of many, but I do like it, and recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Comparing Coppola's "The Godfather, Part II" and "The Conversation" is an exercise in futility: they are both powerful, thought-provoking dramas, both among the top films of the 1970s. They are also as different from each other as two films can be.But I feel closer to "The Conversation" on a personal level, for a number of reasons. For one, it's the kind of movie I can watch over and over again, whereas I can't do the same with "The Godfather, Part II". Its length just does not warrant frequent, repeat viewings. Moreover, "The Conversation" features an unconventional but sympathetic hero, done under by The System and The Unknown--who hasn't felt like that? Michael Corleone is definitely one of the best-known characters in the cinema, but to call him a hero would be too simple, and does not sum up an audience's response towards him. It would be like calling Hamlet "the good guy." Finally, "The Conversation" is the kind of motion picture that feels like a discovery when one sees it, due to the fact that it's mostly unknown to audiences--who hasn't heard of the Godfather franchise? If George Lucas had directed "The Godfather", there would have been action figures.Both films are towering achievements, extraordinary on every level, but "The Conversation" has the edge. It's more profound, and (as with all films are that depend almost entirely on performances) is a more difficult movie to make. Given that, it's a better film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Conversation" is a film that conveys privacy, paranoia, and obsession in universal ways which do not seem dated at all when seen nearly 25 years after its release. A quarter century later, and this taut, puzzling film is still engaging, bleak but powerful. Harry Caul's perfunctory devotion to his work draws comparisons to the photographer played by David Hemmings in "Blowup", although the two men are hardly relatable socially. For Harry is a lonely man, abnegating himself love and respect. Even though his accomplishments are large, he modestly presents himself in shy ways that further alienate him from society. In 1974, in the twilight of Watergate, and the dawn of home security, came a movie dealing thematically with self-security. Harry is insecure, yet ardent in his work, so that when he is pushed to consider saving someone's life, he is blocked by doubts of his own self-worth. When he arrives at the hotel, he is not merely doing his job, he is attempting to prove himself personally. Yet both Harry and the audience are surprised by the film's ironic conclusion. A marvellous film made in Francis Ford Coppola's heyday. A must see for anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Almost everyone who has some sort of knowledge about film will talk with revere about Francis Ford Coppola's God Father's or be quick to say "I love the smell of napalm in the morning" when asked about Apocalypse Now. But many will stare blankly when you ask have you seen The Conversation. This small move based in San Francisco is about a surveillance expert who is tasked so spy on a young couple and record their conversation as they take a walk around Union Square. Harry Caul (Gene Hackman), the surveillance expert hired for the job, is a paranoid man on a normal day. He doesn't let anyone in his apartment and talks to clients only from pay phones. However, his mental limits are tested when he thinks that murder is being planned in his newest case. This film is superbly written and directed by Coppola. It begs the viewer to watch it multiple times in order to grasp every last detail. It has great performances from John Cazale, Cindy Williams, Frederic Forrest, and a young Harrison Ford. Gene Hackman leads this group with one of his best performances in film. The Conversation is a film that should the first thing mentioned when talking about Francis Ford Coppola. It may not have the grand scale of the the Godfathers or the backdrop of Vietnam in Apocalypse, but it is arguably Coppola's best. Upon every re-watch of this film you always see something you missed the last viewing. It is truly a masterpiece in every sense of the word. And those who missed it should make it a priority to make it seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Deliberately methodical and slowly paced, "The Conversation" will appeal to viewers intent on solving a compelling mystery along with the film's protagonist, Harry Caul (Gene Hackman). Others will find it excruciatingly slow and as some writers on this board have complained, dismiss it out of hand as a bore and waste of time. Personally, I got caught up in Harry's world of surveillance and intrigue, and was mis-directed along with him on the subjects of his surveillance (Cindy Williams and Frederic Forrest). In that respect, director Coppola successfully lures us into a world of shadow and duplicity, with a touch of paranoia that's eminently palpable. Harry himself is wound up tighter than any recording reel he uses to tape his subjects, and he keeps his personal life a closely guarded secret even to those closest to him, if the word 'close' could even be used in respect to his relationships. There are times in the film when Harry lapses into paranoid delusion, with a vision of a murder being committed and watching as blood wells up from a hotel room toilet. For all of the prominence he's achieved in the surveillance world, this particular assignment reveals that Harry is not in control, a career left in the same state of shambles as the apartment he wrecks seeking the tools of his own trade.</fullReview>

It is a long, slow, single-character study, (with said character acting grossly out-of-character at key times), that takes three times longer to tell than is necessary (but hey, look at the cinematography), and it leaves many answers to important questions up to "viewer interpretation." There are also people who like "evidence" presented in a film to not magically alter itself. Imagine that a film repeatedly (and I mean, repeatedly) shows a rock engraved with the word "Desert" - but at the end of the movie, shows that very same untouched rock reading "Dessert." One could argue that, yes, that is a "twist" and that said twist makes you rethink things. But it also makes you feel cheated. Well, at least this film has Gene Hackman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surveillance isn't what is cracked up to be...literally.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In between the first two chapters of THE GODFATHER, Francis Ford Coppola masterfully directs this paranoia thriller that ranks as among the best films of the New Hollywood era. Also, it has become one of my favorite movies of all time.Gene Hackman plays Harry Caul, a guilt-ridden surveillance expert who discovers something impossibility true; a sinister plot involving murder while recording a young couple's (Frederick "Chef" Forrest and Cindy "Shirley" Williams) conversation in the park. Without giving away plot details, I will only give a brief synopsis for anyone who hasn't seen the movie yet.Hackman gives a tremendous performance as a man not only putting his career on the line, but also his privacy as well. Other standout performances include John Cazale (you will be missed) as skeptical former assistant Stan who sells out Caul for the oafishly, flamboyant Bernie Moran played by Allen Garfield. Harrison Ford is also terrific as the Director's slimy assistant Martin Stett. However, the one actor who really shines is Michael Higgins giving a brief, but memorable turn as the ex-cop-turned-fellow surveillance expert Paul.Everything about THE CONVERSATION is downright brilliant from the opening shot of San Francisco's Union Square to David Shire's haunting piano score. But the real honor would go to Walter Murch for his contribution to the film's groundbreaking sound design. While the recording plays throughout the movie, the viewer becomes the observer and quickly gets involved in the film. Therefore, it becomes important to listen rather than watch the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Post-Watergate Film And Timeless Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Albert Einstein once said,"It has become appallingly obvious that our technology has exceeded our humanity.". I think that fully explains Francis Ford Coppola's movie,The Conversation. It was a post-Watergate film that gives insight into how the role of technology have affected human existence. The movie is a psychological thriller film written, produced and directed by Francis Ford Coppola that stars Gene Hackman together with John Cazale, Allen Garfield, Cindy Williams,Frederic Forrest,Harrison Ford and Robert Duvall.The plot revolves around Sound surveillance expert Harry Caul,who is hired to track a young couple by taping their conversation as they walk through San Francisco's crowded Union Square. Knowing full well how technology can invade privacy, Harry obsessively keeps to himself, separating business from his personal life, even refusing to discuss what he does or where he lives with his girlfriend, Amy. Harry's work starts to trouble him, however, as he comes to believe that the conversation he pieced together reveals a plot by the mysterious client that hired him to murder the couple. After he allows himself to be seduced by a call girl, who then steals the tapes, Harry is all the more convinced that a killing will occur, and he can no longer separate his job from his conscience. The movie's atmosphere of paranoia and suspicion, combined with its obsessive loner antihero, made it prototypical of the darker films in the future. It also provided a great insight on the role of technology and its disastrous effects when used for the wrong purpose and placed into the wrong hands.Finally,aside from the examination of conscience and guilt of a person who has devout religious convictions.Director Francis Ford Coppola, cinematographer Bill Butler, and Oscar- nominated sound editor Walter Murch did a wonderful job of conveying the narrative through Harry's aural and visual experience.Also worthy of praise is the performance of Gene Hackman and John Cazale.Overall,The Conversation is one great film the fits not only the post- Watergate era but also about the role of technology in both an individual and the society in general.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guilt, lies and audiotape</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harry Caul (Gene Hackman) is a lone wolf-type who spends his hours sifting through other people's conversations threw video and audio surveillance. While his work has given him acclaim, he has become increasingly secretive and paranoid. Hired to record a conversation between a couple in the park, Harry becomes anxious over their fate and suspicious of his employer.The script for The Conversation reads like an Euripides tragedy. Exchanges are skewed, things are taken out of context and the omnipotent powers that be, maneuver their invisible hand. In the middle of it all a quiet, well meaning guy is left with a crisis of conscience and a heavy heart.Francis Ford Coppola made this quiet little film between the two Godfathers, creating nothing short of a minimalist masterpiece. The hallmark plotting is deliberate and the interior shots are often colorful yet stark and lonely. Even when Harry travels to a surveillance convention, the scene becomes alienating, helping us better connect with Harry as he ventures further down the rabbit hole.Shot mostly in San Francisco, the director doesn't sacrifice the cities rich history and culture as he gives the audience a virtual tour, most of which is lost however in an engrossing storyline. Coppola knows how to make an insightful film worthy of discussion, additionally however, he does what I think is a cinematic oddity; he builds a consensus in his audience based on emotions of the protagonist. Like in Apocalypse Now, you may not believe in the director's social or political point but you can definitely relate to his richly drawn characters even as they are put in extraordinary situations.While he has become iconic for his portrayal of no-nonsense characters, Hackman's Harry Caul has an unexpected vulnerability that intrigues. Like many of the actors who share the screen with him, the audience wants to be let in to his closed inner-self and like any good actor, everything Hackman says he does so without speaking.Communication is the major theme, and in this film, the protagonist must deal with the encroachment of technology in day to day life and how it can either enrich us or destroy us. The ethics of surveillance has become more and more topical with each passing generation and this movie has become less of a period piece and more of a cautionary tale. First and foremost however, The Conversation is a quiet, close and personal movie about a man unsnarling his life, his ethics and his relationships, trying to free himself from the guilt he possesses.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impressive Existentialist Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was compelled to join the IMDb users so I could comment on this excellent film by Coppola at his 1974 peak when he made his 2 best films. It pains me to see comments by those who cannot understand what good film is and is not; so I just wanted to set the record straight. The conversation is an important film in both content and form for many reasons and I provide two specific reasons: The historical context and the existential dilemma faced by Caul in the story is thoughtful social commentary. As Caul violates the privacy rights of individuals for profit motive he finds that his "passive actions" have actually contributed to murder in the past and may do so again. He experiences an awareness and existential angst which parallels the collective American shock resulting from Watergate and the exposure of illegal survalence practices used by Nixon and co. for political gain.The film is shot and edited eloquently supporting the development, rhythm and themes of the literal narrative. The visual nutritive built by Copela following the survalence (voyeuristic) theme which repeats time and time again revealing more meaning each time it is "played back" until, ultimately, we understand the true meaning of the conversation.I hope my comment helps to establish to readers the importance of this film and Copelas contribution to the art. Those who believe this film is unworthy of praise and serious consideration know nothing about film as an art form.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie The Conversation was made in 1974 and was both written and directed by one of the most famous directors in history Francis Ford Coppola. The basic plot for this movie was the main character Harry Caul played by Gene Hackman who was a paranoid and personally-secretive surveillance expert who then has a crisis of conscience when he suspects that a couple he is spying on will be murdered. This movie is considered to be one of the top suspense films of all times and was nominated for three Oscar's.I really enjoyed watching this movie and really got a broad sense of how incredible Coppola's work really is. After seeing "The Godfather" and "The Godfather 2" you get to see a different side of Coppola's work. It's like he is looking into the mind of the audience because it feels like every pause or silence in the movie is so perfectly timed and it's exactly what the audience thrives on in this sort of suspense movie.In the beginning few minutes where we see the couple talking but don't hear what they are saying. I think this is brilliant because as the audiences were trying to hear and see what there saying and it's almost sort of a little tease or torture that we don't know what they say in the beginning. But then it's almost like a gift when we find out what they say all that anticipation finally bursts into joy when we find out what the couple had been saying. The movie can be deceiving we hear these repeated phrases repeated over and over until we start questioning ourselves just like Harry was doing to himself. I enjoyed this movie immensely and would definitely put it on my top 10 favorite movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spellbinding Story is Undoubtedly One of Coppola's Best...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movies like BLOW-UP, and its American remake, BLOW OUT, were great, moving stories of visual and audio mystery and reality. What are the characters really seeing or hearing? THE CONVERSATION is similar in many ways, one being the main character who is so entrenched and consumed by what he does, it overtakes him. What makes this film so much better is the way it feels. There is gloom and despair in the air and Gene Hackman turns in the performance of his career as "Harry Caul", the best 'sound bugger' on the west coast, who has no home phone, hates extra sets of keys, and dislikes swearing. He creates such an original character and Coppola stages such an original and shocking story, the film is a perfect blend of character study, plot, and atmosphere. "Harry" comes to the realization that his work indirectly hurts people and this no longer bodes well to him.The film is slow and almost dream-like in appearance. There is even a dream sequence that is so powerful and nightmarish, it stays with you. Nothing Coppola did before (THE GODFATHER, wrote PATTON) could prepare you for such an original and unclassifiable movie. 1974 was quite a year for the great filmmaker, with CONVERSATION and GODFATHER PART II both up for Best Picture. No doubt THE CONVERSATION is better, just completely out of left field. The apt title relates to the job Hackman and his assistants are working on as the movie starts. Cindy Williams and Frederic Forest (Chef from APOCALYPSE NOW) are circling a courtyard in San Francisco, discussing a supposed infidelic relationship. They may even be in great danger. A mysterious "director" of an unknown corporation wants the dialogue of their "conversation" and Hackman begins to have second thoughts about the situation.Coppola sets up the viewer with such subtle effectiveness, you don't even realize it. Hackman's character is so good at what he does, he brings his work home and wonders how his landlady was able to leave him a birthday card without a key. He is so distraught, he leaves himself open to the same indirect pain and suffering his brilliant recording work sometimes causes. His world is small and lonely (his best friend is his sax) and you find that there is an industry behind Hackman's technical work. His studio lab is where the "conversation" is dissected and, depending on how attentive you are, Coppola builds to a riveting and surprising finale. "Harry Caul" may be the 'best bugger' on the west coast, but he is human and cracks begin to show.Look at the cast. If this film was made today, the cost would be staggering considering the star power. (Harrison Ford, Robert Duvall, Teri Garr, to name a few) The late John Cazale turns in another good performance as Hackman's pesky assistant who is never sure how "Harry" does what he does. Even Ford's early performance is good. He comes off as creepy, almost villainous. What a fantastic film from some amazing talent. It is severely overlooked on 'best of' lists and deserves a wider release on video and DVD. Hopefully, Mr. Coppola would consider remastering this classic and re-releasing it theatrically in small art houses. Unforgettable !RATING: 10 OF 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A self indulgent mess - SPOILERS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was recommended this movie on the Amazon Marketplace. It was rated extremely highly, and I wondered why I had never heard of it. I watched it two weeks later and discovered why.LOTS OF SPOILERS: YOU ARE WARNEDA surveillance expert(Hackman)is on a case protecting two people who he believes are in danger of being killed. He records them using an adapted "state of the art" 70's cassette recorder. Amazing. Unfortunately, the actual conversation he records is of no interest or significance whatsoever. But that still doesn't stop him playing it back 13 times to the detriment of the now 'bored stiff' viewers. Wandering around the warehouse he keeps all his futuristic equipment(for the 1970's) mumbling to himself anxiously..........anyway!Cue(suspenseful music in the last 15 minutes). Is there any suspense? No, of course not. Harry books himself into a hotel that is beside the alleged victims and tries to listen to whats going on next door. He then goes up to his directors office - who he finds dead . He died in a car accident. He then trashes his flat because he is so frustrated by the fact that he was bugged himself. Depressed Harry then plays his saxaphone. THE ENDI have never seen Hackman in such a dull role, in such a self indulgent film. Francis is basically worshiping the "new" concept of bugging which was intriguing (especially round about the time of President Nixons scandal). I don't know why Francis Ford Coppolla didn't make a slightly faster paced movie, with more dialogue of interesting substance and an evolving plot which gripped the viewers concentration from the off-set. It is such a shame and such a wasted opportunity considering the high-caliber budget, director and cast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching this movie for the first time, I kept believing that the film should have Narration. Not knowing what the film was about, just knowing that it was a Coppola film and being a fan, I should watch it. For the first hour of the film, you don't know who "Harry" is. With this, a Narration of Harry's journey into his investigation would have better explained to the viewer who he is and what he is up to. After watching the film, closer and closer to the end, you understand why there isn't narration. This adds to the thriller element that the Conversation has. After investigating who Harry is, you are then choosing whether or not you agree with his path into questioning his line of work. An in deep look at the life and struggle of a professional "bugger." Once you find out the truth of the Conversation, you begin to see the irony involved in Harry's profession and find out what a great mystery movie this is. If you've seen the Godfather, check this one out next. It's not like anything else Coppola has directed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that remains fascinating and original to this day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Conversation was a smaller scale, more personal film from director Francis Ford Coppola, made at a time when it seemed like he could do no wrong. This was a project dear to his heart, a film that wanted to make for years. It took its inspiration from Michelangelo Antonioni's film Blow-Up (1966) which, amazingly for an art film, had a genius thriller idea at its core. This idea was about a man photographing a couple in a park, only to discover when developing the film that he may have been witness to a murder. Seeing as this was an Antonioni film though, his preoccupations were about higher brow things than mere suspense mechanics and he used this idea as a springboard to examine ideas about perception versus truth. Coppola also looks at this, but does so in by way of a paranoid thriller, and sees this idea through in a much straighter manner. In his film, there is again a man and a woman in a public place but his time they are not being photographed but recorded by sound surveillance experts. Once the resulting conversation is reconstructed by the chief technician he becomes certain that he has uncovered a murder plot.Opening immediately with the conversation of the young couple wandering around a busy city square, it's a bravura opening that takes a somewhat experimental approach, in mixing sound and visuals in disarming ways. What we hear does not always correspond with what we are seeing; the effect of this is somewhat intriguing. Gene Hackman plays the central character Harry Caul with underplayed brilliance. He is a man whose expertise is used to invade other people's privacy, yet he obsessively guards his own. His job has made him hopelessly paranoid and distrustful of everyone. His work had led to deaths in a previous high profile assignment and this past history has contributed to his guilty conscience and has shaped his perception of the events he dissects in the conversation. It's consequently a thriller very much in the psychological end of the spectrum yet it also fits into the paranoid side of the genre too, which was in keeping with many other American movies of the time, many of which were influenced by the events of Watergate. In fact, The Conversation's focus on audio tapes was something that would later become integral to that scandal and lead to the ultimate downfall of Richard Nixon, so this is a film very much in touch with the troubling American landscape of its time. It's a highly re-watchable film too, with the film taking a whole different perspective once you know the ending. In fact, the ending remains quite ambiguous and the events in the film can ultimately be interpreted in different ways. It remains to this day a mysterious, strange and quite brilliant movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 70's, Coppola's Golden Age</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"We'll be listening to you."I can't think of another director who dominated a decade in the same way that Francis Ford Coppola did during the 70's. Beginning with The Godfather, following it up with its sequel and this film in 1974, and finally closing the decade with the ambitious Apocalypse Now. Each one of these films can be considered among the best of all time, and unfortunately due to the success of The Godfather sequel, The Conversation is often left out of the conversation. I wouldn't rank this one so high up, but I can see its appeal and the fact that the film is as relevant (if not even more) today as it was 40 years ago. Both Coppola and Hackman have each declared that this is their personal favorite movie out of the ones they've worked in, and that just proves how much passion was put into this project. The Conversation works best as a character study of a paranoid and devoted surveillance expert who is so absorbed in his profession that he shuts everyone out of his life. His life is one of contrasts, because even though he is the best at what he does, he is easily a victim as well (it's easy to spy on this spy), he is conflicted about putting other lives in danger with his work (he's haunted about the murder of three individuals as a result of one of his most successful surveillance operations) , but at the same time he is proud of his work and accomplishments. He is considered by his peers to be the best bugger, but ironically he is so concerned about someone spying on him that he shuts everyone out despite the fact that he really has nothing to hide. He lives a persecuted life because that's how far his paranoia has gone, but that doesn't mean he's good at keeping people out, because in several instances we see how easily he's fooled. The focus is entirely on Gene Hackman's character so don't go into this one expecting an edge of your seat thriller. The film opens with an extended long shot of a park in San Francisco full of people as the camera slowly begins focusing on a couple walking in circles around the plaza although we can't quite make out what they are saying. There is a surveillance team following them around with microphones, but it's hard to distinguish what they are saying from all the noise. This isn't an issue for Harry Caul (Gene Hackman) who has developed his own technology that allows him to filter out the noise by combining the three separate microphones that his team was using and piecing together the conversation. He is a bit disturbed with what he has recorded and begins having doubts about giving the tape to the person who hired him for the job (referred to as the Director). Harry keeps to himself and acts all secretive, not even allowing his closest assistant, Stan (John Cazale), to know what is disturbing him. When he finally decides to turn in the tapes, he is greeted by the Director's assistant, Martin (Harrison Ford), who says the Director is away on a Business trip. Since he had specifically said to turn in the tapes directly to him Harry decides to return home with the tapes despite Martin's protest. He begins to feel followed and this only intensifies Harry's fears about getting the couple in trouble. At a surveillance convention that takes place soon after, we discover that Harry is a respected man in his line of work although no one knows much about his personal life. The performances in this film are great, especially Gene Hackman who delivers one of the best roles of his career. He downplays the paranoia and delivers it in a very subtle manner. Despite not having much screen time John Cazale, Allen Garfield, and Harrison Ford each deliver solid secondary performances. The film's atmospheric tone is set by the grainy camera work and the outstanding jazzy score which help build the tension. However this being a character study, it relies entirely on Hackman's performance. The theme of surveillance also continues to resonate today after the ongoing scandals with Snowden's claims and the increasing advances in technology. The Conversation is a wonderful film that continues to grow on me the more I think of it. It wasn't the haunting thriller I was expecting to see, but it did surprise me at how well crafted the story was and how it centered on this character that is full of ironies and contrasts. The film ends on a brilliant note as well which just goes on to prove that The Conversation belongs to be considered amongst Coppola's best work. It's a shame that after such a brilliant decade, Coppola has never seemed to come close to what he did in those four films. Thanks to the 70's his work will be hard to equal by any director so he still deserves to be considered as one of the best of our generation. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Conversation has over the years been elevated as a great conspiracy thriller, something Francis Coppola managed to knock up in between The Godfather II and The Great Gatsby.Gene Hackman gives a nuanced performance as a paranoid loner who is a devout Catholic, plays the saxophone and keeps his work to himself, even his co-worker is kept at a distance and not told what he is exactly listening to.He is a legend in the field of covert surveillance but he suffers guilt from the tragic consequences of his work in the past and yet he is also careless as a rival manages to bug him by way of a pen given to him at a convention.In his latest assignment he has recorded a conversation of two people walking around in Union Square, a feat that he is proud of. However as he listens further to the conversation we hear fragments of them talking but we miss the beats and stresses of the words. Are the couple plotting or being plotted against.Harrison Ford and Robert Duvall make small appearances as members of the corporation who have hired Hackman for the job but Hackman feels that lives are in danger and is getting increasingly paranoid and delusional.The film is a slow burner but not as dull as the similar themed Blow Up. The Conversation jolts you with its visions and unravelling of its mystery but it is still a minor piece even though its forms part of the group of mid 1970s conspiracy thrillers which includes The Parallax View, Three days of the condor, All the President's men. The reason being that although it has attracted a cult following and critical praise, it just feels to slow and low beat, almost as Coppola wanted to contrast with the grandeur of the Godfather films.</fullReview>

Because of this technique, we can feel his loneliness and suspicion. He does a wiretapping and he does not show his real feelings. The technique makes us think of his feelings implicitly.In addition, although he does a wiretapping, he is picked up calls by someone too. He believes only what he looks but it is not enough. There are many sides in the world but most people do not notice it. This problem is involved with the Watergate. Before it happened, people did not think that someone listen what they said secretly. This film makes them have wariness about wiretapping.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Francis Ford Coppola's The Conversation is a classic crime movie with a perfect storyline to an Alfred Hitchcock movie, which tells the story of a paranoid, and secretive surveillance expert (played wonderfully by Gene Hackman) who has a crisis of conscience when he suspects that a couple he is spying on gets murdered, instead of that the couple are the 2 culprits that end up planning a murder. Producer, Director Francis Ford Coppola uses that same Hitchcock directorial style just like William Friedkin did for The French Connection. The movie also has a lot of other great cast members such as John Cazale, a very young Harrison Ford, and Teri Garr. What i saw from this movie is that it was a true classic movie that I personally think that all movie lovers will enjoy it while being kept in suspense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of the best films of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Image, acting, atmosphere, direction, music and especially sound all gel in this masterpiece outing from Coppola.Harry Caul, surveillance expert, is a practicing Catholic and so needs no help in being guilty, but a previous job that ended in a family's murder means he has plenty to feel guilty about, even without his religion. He tries to shut it out playing jazz, with minimalist living, and keeping colleagues and women at a distance. However, a job recording a young couple for a jealous, powerful husband means long-suppressed memories rear their head, and Harry's coveted control starts to crumble.Hackman is flawless as the tormented but vulnerable eavesdropper. John Cazale as the long-suffering Stan is the perfect foil for Harry, all curiosity and bonhomie, perfectly designed to rub Harry up the wrong way. Sound, as befits the story, is intricately designed, and it is fitting that the shock ending twists on a sound beat. Editing and camera-work are also up to spec, a bloody hand smeared on a veranda divider providing a moment of visceral shock. The surveillance-style camera-work, always catching up with the action a beat too late, is a bold choice that unsettles the audience, keying them into Harry's state of mind. It is a trope most often remarked upon in the last scene, Harry playing sax mournfully in his wrecked apartment as the camera pans, but the style permeates the whole film.As distinctive, prickly and geeky as Harry is, he is an everyman figure, trying to do the right thing against more powerful forces, racked with regret and grateful for what seems to be, at first glance, a second chance. His journey into self-inflicted torment is both localised and epic.Coppola is rightly proud of this film, championing it over his more showy, celebrated outings. He notes that he only got to make the film as a reward for the success of The Godfather. A script like this would be harder still to finance today. A great film to watch in its own right, and to view in contrast with current offerings as an interrogation of how much progress, if any, we have made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-crafted, but mostly dull</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movies are intended to be entertaining. To me this movie (for the most part) was not. Many scenes went well beyond the point of my toleration, even if they turned out being absolutely necessary to get the viewer in a certain frame of mind and portray the characters in a certain way. The director does a very good job of letting us know just how dull of a guy Gene Hackman plays in this movie, and thus makes the movie on the average incredibly dull. While upon seeing the ending everything falls into place, it just isn't particularly entertaining on the way there. It does eventually leave you with a lot to think about, but a modern action thriller this is most certainly not. The plot seems to follow along the same course for most of the movie, with things going not entirely predictably, but nothing much interesting happens until the ending hits like a load of bricks and makes you re-evaluate most of what you watched. While a good purely psychological thriller, it's just not easy for most modern audiences to get into.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful acting all around</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, let me mention that I feel this has to be one of Gene Hackman's best roles. I remember reading he mentioned this was his least favorite role, as he plays a character completely opposite of who he is in real life. That is true acting, when you can play a person completely different from yourself, and he does it so well. His character of Harry is extremely reclusive, easily offended by others' remarks and actions, manically insecure, and is too much into his work to take life a little less seriously.John Cazale and Teri Garr play characters who show that they want Harry to open up, and finally get to the point where they are fed up and can't take his reclusiveness anymore. Harry then regrets his actions towards them, and appears he wants to make amends with both. We never find out if he does open up more with them, but he probably doesn't.But it's Allen Garfield's role as Bernie which really makes this movie for me. Bernie is as slimy as they come. He steals, cheats, lies, and does his best to make others around him feel small. He can't stand being #2 to Harry. He is just as insecure as Harry, but in different ways. Harry is afraid to reveal his feelings, whereas Bernie demands respect for his so-called expertise.I think Bernie is the scariest person in the movie, because of what he is capable of doing, and the fact that everyone knows it. Bernie would stop at nothing to get his cheese. And Garfield plays this role beautifully; he doesn't look intimidating or menacing, but you can see inside that Bernie wants you to go down, so he can step on you and brag about it later.In fact the acting all around in this movie is wonderful, and it does make a good thriller. The only flaw with the movie is that is has aged badly over the years, so it might not connect with a younger audience as much as it would with a Nixonian era audience like me.Also it is tough to differentiate between Harry's dreams and reality, but that helps make this movie good; asking what really happened in real time. The ending of the movie is great: it's funny, sad, and disturbing to witness schizophrenia put to its extreme.Frankly this movie is not for everyone, especially those Hackman fans who are looking for a French Connection-ish performance. It isn't there. There is no violence or sex or vulgar language to speak of. It's not an action picture, no chase scenes. Though it takes place in San Francisco, there is very little scenic footage.The movie is more of a study of human nature, how some people are, how others react to it, and what it all can lead to. And also the movie plot itself is quite true-to-life; everyone who sees this movie knows this stuff goes on, even today, as it did in the early '70s.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Conversation" directed by Francis Ford Coppola is his masterpiece in terms of originality. Using the skills he learned over the two Godfather movies, Coppola hones in on an evocative, psychological thriller that has the hypnotism of "Vertigo" and the shock factor of "Psycho". But past the homage, this is entirely Coppola's own.Set in 1974 about surveillance and suspicions, it's appropriate to recall the Watergate scandal. Former President Nixon was notorious for wiretapping conversations to gain a political advantage. The same sort of tactic was used by the reporters who exposed Watergate, and then Nixon resigned. I'm not talking politics. I'm talking about how Coppola's script raises awareness about phone tapping, eavesdropping, surveillance and espionage. I suppose that "The Conversation" could have been set in any decade, but that it's the 70s makes the story particularly influential.The plot is a mystery but the story is a character study. Harry Caul makes his living as a surveillance expert, but outside of work, it's not much of a living. He's over 40, lives in a quaint but lonely apartment in San Francisco, prefers his own gadgets over the ones on the market and sacrifices a possible relationship all for his work. One day he hears something over a tape recording that raises his hairs.There's no denying Caul's a professional, as are his colleagues. They profit off of defaming and humiliating public officials through their savvy surveillance. This is a business where lies are exposed but the ones pulling the veil walk away with heavier wallets. But this does not necessitate a clean conscience. Unlike his peers, Caul has a guilty conscience. In New York City, 1968, his surveillance expertise caused the deaths of three people. The press called it a homicide, knots were tied and people walked away rich. Caul was one of them.Not wanting to repeat that accident, Caul starts to distrust everyone around him after hearing the new tape. Caul is cautioned not to interfere; surveillance work should be objective. But Caul gets personal. "I'm not afraid of death," Caul says. "But I am afraid of murder." He refuses to speak to anybody and demands to see his employer in person, whom he fears is a tyrannical figure that will upend his young wife. The mystery is handled consummately, like "Double Indemnity" from a different perspective. Up until the earth-shattering climax, Coppola had me guessing the whole way.It's important to remember the very end of the movie, after the mystery, which reminds us that we're watching a character study. Too often the murder mystery genre has static protagonists whose only goal is to solve the case, from A to Z. Not here. Caul, alone in his apartment with his tenor sax as his only solace, reaches new levels of paranoia. Is he being watched? Will there be repercussions? The consequences both literally and symbolically test Caul's faith."The Conversation" is a thoughtful character study wrapped in a murder mystery. It is a triumph of story, sight and sound. It lost Best Picture to "The Godfather Part II", also directed by Coppola. That may have been the obvious win but not the most deserved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coppola's underrated paranoia thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harry Caul works as a voyeuristic surveillance expert no matter who the client or who he's spying on. He doesn't trust anybody with his secrets and is very paranoid. One day he records a conversation between two young lovers on tape that contains the phrase "He'd kill us if he got the chance." This sends Harry on a moral dilemma of whether to give the tapes to his current client or relive the past.Gene Hackman gives a great low key performance as the cold and paranoid Harry. John Cazale is great as Harry's partner. Teri Garr before "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" has a small role as Harry's cheerful and curious girlfriend. Harrison Ford is good in an early yet dark role before Star Wars and Indiana Jones. And Robert Duval has a small role as Harry's client."The Conversation" is not just a great thriller but a great study of paranoia and use of technology to secretly spy on other people without their knowledge which is still relevant in todays technology enhanced world. Admittedly the movie is very slow and has little to no action but the use of atmosphere, music, great acting and great camera-work and editing make this one of Coppola's great yet overlooked movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Cupolla drama on the dilemma of morality!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Conversation (1974) is Francis Ford Copolla's drama that chronicles the ethical dilemma of a sound surveillance expert, Harry Caul. Copolla presents Caul as a character who is ridden by a sense of guilt that he can't seem to get rid of. The guild is brought about by a surveillance assignment he did years ago that led to the death of several people. Caul tries to get rid of this guilt by convincing himself that he is not responsible for why someone asks for surveillance recordings or what is done as a result of those recordings. He tells himself that his only concern is getting good surveillance recordings for whomever hired him. Anything beyond that is not is concern or his responsibility. He tells his partner, Stan, in the opening scene of the movie, "I don't care what their talking about, all I want is a nice fat recording." However, he cannot get rid of the guilt that ways him down. He is constantly paranoid of people knowing too much about him. He tries to live a secret life and remain withdrawn from all other people. Caul faces a moral dilemma when he starts to believe that his latest recording will again lead to several people's death. He is disturbed by the knowledge of someone's impending doom and he can;t get away from the feeling that he is responsible to do something. The viewer watches as Caul struggles with a sense of moral responsibility. He tries to justify not doing something by reminded himself that he bears no liability for what is done as a result of his recordings, but he can't purge the deep notion that he must do something to prevent the foreseeable crime. Copolla presents Caul's moral dilemma without judging whether he should take action or not. Does Caul have a moral responsibility to prevent a crime from happening, even if he is not legally responsible? Is Caul allowed to separate his work from how people use it? These are judgments that Copolla allows the viewer to make. But before the viewer can answer these questions, he or she must answer the question of why Caul can't rid himself of a moral responsibility for how his surveillance is used. Is it business ethics, or societal pressure? (Caul will not lose his job or be legally prosecuted if he doesn't do anything). Or is it that Caul has some deep-seeded sense that calls him to prevent murder? If this is the case, who or what has given Caul this sense? Caul is responsible to something higher than society or humanity. He is haunted by this fact, and he tries desperately to escape it. But try as he might, Caul cannot escape this moral sense throughout the movie.Copolla's gripping drama should force the viewer to ask these questions about him or herself and humanity and general. Do we have a nagging moral sense, outside of societal or legal pressure? And if we do, why do we have it and where does it come from?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even if the 70's cinematography often leaves a lot to be desired, the silver screen back then was however graced with real actors, whose talent made up for all the flaws in directorial style and technique. I believe Gene Hackman is one of those actors. If "The Conversation" is a memorable film, it's not only because it's one of the first to address issues that have become stringent in recent years, but also because of Hackman's interpretation. This is a psychological story, an interesting character study, and the movie's themes are now more relevant than ever. Some scenes are too long, and the movie tends to drag a lot, but let's just say that the final scene has such humor and irony, that it's worth watching "The Conversation" for that alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing Drama/Thriller Of Alienated Surveillance Specialist Cracking Up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harry Caul is an expert wiretapper, hired to record an unusual conversation between two people in a crowded plaza. Perplexed by the meaning of the discussion, and haunted by a tragedy from his past, Harry becomes increasingly anxious about the job and the people who hired him. What should he do ?I don't really enjoy this film very much, but I think that's kind of the point. It's confusing, uncomfortable and features a protagonist who's almost impossible to like, but it's also very memorable and stylish. When I first saw it in my youth I was very disappointed, because I had seen and loved The Godfather and The French Connection and it was very different from those. Seen now, I recognise it as Coppola and Hackman both stretching themselves creatively and artistically. The style is very European, all static interiors and minimal editing, whilst the protagonist is cold, impotent and self-absorbed; a man who shuts himself away from people for fear of getting hurt, and despite his insistence on disaffected professionalism can't help but be drawn into the lives of the people he's tasked with recording. By never trusting anyone he gradually spirals down into insecurity and madness. It's a brilliant albeit difficult performance from Hackman, and is well supported by a fine cast of the Coppola/Lucas seventies troupe - Ford in particular is fabulous in the staring villain part, and Duvall appears unbilled. The movie frustrates me in some areas though - it works much better as a character crack-up story than as a thriller. Whilst the ending is quite neat (Harry's concerns are completely misplaced), it's not really explained very well (is Ford in on the deal ?) and the bloody toilet sequence is especially confusing. For someone who's supposed to be the best in the business Harry makes some amateurish mistakes, and the oft-repeated conversation itself doesn't really hold my attention. I think the film straddles the drama/thriller line too much, whereas equivalent full-blown horror screamers like Les Diaboliques or Repulsion really score. The film is also inextricably linked with the Nixon-era bugging politics, which date it slightly, although Hackman explores the nature of that profession with rich detail. There is also a terrific little score by David Shire, featuring an irresistibly haunting jazz piano main theme that seems to sum up the uneasiness of the story perfectly. The editing by Richard Chew (Star Wars) is terrific, and there is great sound design by longtime Coppola collaborator Walter Murch, who also supervised the excellent 2000 stereo remix of the film. Trivia - the story Harry tells in his dream about suffering from polio and nearly drowning in the tub actually happened to Coppola. One of the director's most acclaimed films (it won the 1974 Palme D'Or at Cannes), but in my view not quite one of his best. A nervous cult classic though, which would make a great triple-bill sandwiched between Blowup and Blow Out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Troubled conscience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problems of conscience of a man whose job should by its own nature bring lots of them to any virtuous human being. Harry Caul (role played by Gene Hackman) is the best expert around town in surveillance, bugging and phone tapping on behalf of public authorities and private individuals. That surveillance may have tragic consequences like it happened already when the results of a previous surveillance by him had caused two deaths. He becomes obsessed with that and it makes him to get involved personally in his current surveillance of two young lovers in the interest of some powerful Director; he now tries to avoid any further tragic consequences of his findings. The movie is directed with the well known Coppola's skill but the character of Harry Caul as an introvert displaying a somewhat odd behaviour, is not very convincing. The story develops itself around of the above mentioned problems of conscience that place him sometimes into several troubles in terms of facts and deeds. The end of the movie is rather inconclusive seeming that the results of the surveillance led to something opposite of what Caul had feared. The outcome is not very elucidative and the final scenes seem to stress mainly the fact that Caul has got real neurotic problems. We may therefore conclude about this movie with two traditional popular proverbs: much cry and little wool and the mountain delivered a mouse.</fullReview>

The tension in this movie builds at a deliberately slow pace, giving it more punch as it builds.The writing and directing is complimented by the superb and muted performance of Gene Hackman. Hackman plays it cerebrally quite, giving us a subtle, nuanced performance, which might be mistaken as being stiff, but it is wonderful.

		<shortDescription>Youth Without Youth? Wait, no. It's a good Coppola movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remember when Francis Ford Coppola was a great filmmaker? Co-Writer of Patton, Director of two good Godfathers. Then he made Apocalypse Now and lost his mind. It's a real shame, because from 1970 to '79 the man could make a movie. One of his films from that era that rarely gets brought up in conversation is his 1974 film..."The Conversation." This overlooked, well-made gem deserves better. True fans of Coppola's work will know that The Conversation was nominated for Best Picture in 1974, right up against The Godfather Part II. Impressive? Considering it was right smack in the middle of the American New Wave, and the Academy Awards actually had some legitimate films? Yeah it's impressive. The Conversation stars Gene Hackman as a surveillance expert Harry Caul who hears a disturbing tid-bit of information over his radio. This information is constantly being called into question due to the fact that Caul spends most of his time listening in on our private exchanges. Being confined to a small space and hearing everybody's secrets is enough to make the most rational man paranoid. This paranoia causes his personal life to suffer and alienates others around him. He becomes more and more obsessed with surveillance. While the film on the surface works as an examination on human psychology, it is most impressive because of it's running political commentary. With the NSA wiretapping scandals and worries about national security, the Conversation is apt as well as relevant to our current political environment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are some works of art that are obviously derivative of others, and obviously inferior, because they simply ape the earlier work, tweak a few minor things, and try to pass off their theft as 'homage'. The Conversation (1974), written and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, is not one of those minor works. It has a manifest endebtedness to Michelangelo Antonioni's brilliant 1966 film, Blowup, yet it does not merely ape that film's existential dilemma of an accidental photograph possibly cluing its lead character into murder. Instead, The Conversation probes far more deeply into its lead character Harry Caul (Gene Hackman) and his life, to see what might cause a man to misinterpret reality to suit his own psychic needs.Another major difference is that the tale in Blowup is one that is wholly accidental, whereas the story The Conversation is built upon is an outgrowth of the deliberate and paid for actions of Caul, the leading West Coast surveillance expert, who has been hired by the mysterious Director (Robert Duvall) of a giant corporation to spy on his wife Ann (Cindy Williams) and her lover Mark (Frederick Forrest). The film opens, around Christmastime, with Caul and his entourage tailing and listening in to the conversation of the two lovers as they stroll in Union Square, an open air park in downtown San Francisco. The fragmented bits of conversation he pieces together only later, and comes to feel that the couple is being set up for murder by his employer. The opening zoom down from a sniper's eye level, focuses on a mime (Robert Shields) who is annoying people in the square. Eventually he sidles up to and mimics Caul, who walks away. The opening scene was filmed by Haskell Wexler, and the rest of the film by Bill Butler, who took over after Wexler and Coppola had a falling out.It is a shame that in the nearly thirty years since the 1970s, Coppola has never made a film that comes close to the power of his films from that era. Despite its debt to Blowup, The Conversation is a far more realistic and multi-layered film. That does not mean it's better nor worse than Blowup, just not a ripoff. It is far more internalized, even if a little less subjective, than the earlier film. This seeming disconnect between the objective and that witnessed by the audience only deepens the desire to rewatch the film. Especially great is the fact that the film's lead is the sort of character other films ignore, to focus on one of the players in the love triangle, or perhaps Martin Stett. Caul is a functionary, an apparatchik- yet he's real, and his struggle is every bit as interesting as the 'sexier characters'. Yet Coppola heeds Juvenal's query from his sixth Satire: 'Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?' ('Who watches the watchmen?') There are many watchers in this film, yet the final watcher is the audience, and what they watch is greatness, simple in its complexity.The Conversation is a great, simple, and small film, never too long at an hour and fifty-three minutes, and it may be Coppola's best. It was very timely, considering the milieu of Watergate, but the idea came to him in 1967. It started filming in late 1972, and wrapped shortly before Watergate came to light, yet it has been lost between the three other titanic films he made in the 1970s: The Godfather, The Godfather, Part II, and Apocalypse Now. Whereas those three films were operatic, this film is a chamber piece, and apropos of that, the piano only soundtrack by Coppola's brother in law David Shire, so reminiscent of Erik Satie piano pieces, is perfect, for, as Coppola says in his commentary, the piano is a lonely instrument; lonely as Harry Caul, or an unanswered question.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Writer-director Francis Ford Coppolla's cleverly conceived yet simple thriller has some quality entertainment value that includes a tense build up and a crafty twist. Sadly though, it lacks a classy denouement.Gene Hackman is perfectly cast and in top form as Harry, a surveillance expert who is troubled by the fact that his work can sometimes place innocent people at risk. The latest assignment he has taken on involves a young couple who may be in danger of death because of the conversation Harry has recorded. Coppolla develops his story with care, brilliantly using "The Conversation" as the pivotal piece, much like the revered McGuff in Hitchcock films. The twist is timed to perfection, and it is only the rather flat, though very realistic ending, that is slightly disappointing.Supporting Hackman's fine turn is a strong cast led by John Cazale, Allen Garfield, Frederic Forrest, Cindy Williams and Harrison Ford. All give solid showings, especially Forrest and Williams who are most convincing as the couple that have "The Conversation".Bill Butler's photography is serviceable, while editors Walter Murch and Richard Chew help raise the tension. There's also some enjoyable music from David Shire and some expert sound work that managed to garner an Oscar nomination. Also nominated for best screenplay and best film for 1974.Wednesday, September 18, 1996 - T.V.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>major combination</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What makes Francis Ford Coppola's "The Conversation" (released the same year as "The Godfather Part 2") especially impressive is the combination of things that the movie constitutes. One important aspect is that in the '70s, there were released many movies involving suspicion of the government - "The Parallax View", "Three Days of the Condor", "All the President's Men" and "Capricorn One" - resulting from the Vietnam War, government spying on citizens, and Watergate. Therefore, this story of a surveillance expert (Gene Hackman) having a crisis of conscience was particularly relevant, especially nowadays with the current surveillance scandal.As for the more lowbrow aspect, the casting of Cindy Williams and Harrison Ford seems like advice from Coppola's buddy George Lucas (who cast them in "American Graffiti" the previous year); or maybe that's just conjecture. But no matter what the case, this is certainly a movie that I recommend. In times like these, movies dealing with these topics become practically a requisite for the survival of democracy.Also starring Teri Garr and Frederic Forrest.</fullReview>

Thats perfect, such a geek, but what great taste in Jazz. Seen it a hundred a times and still love it, such a classic. Terry Garr is still a fox, but back then - pretty amazing lady.

		<shortDescription>The Conversation and Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scott Greenan New American Cinema March 24, 2006 The ConversationThe Conversation, starring Gene Hackman, is obviously directly influenced by the recent Watergate scandal of the time. Certain aspects such as the scandal, the hotel, and the tapes were all reflections of the current government situation. However, I also found this film to be similar to Alfred Hitchcock movies from the previous two decades. Frenzied music, camera angles, and even plot development seemed to reflect this 70's conspiracy film. Hackman plays Harry Caul, a surveillance expert whose paranoid conspiracy theories have prevented him from living a happy, normal life. His character seemed to resemble that of James Stewart's character (Jeffries) in Rear Window (1954). Stewart uses his camera lens to spy on his neighbors and creates, what seems like, a crazy conspiracy of a murder. One line from Rear Window stands out as prevalent to both films: "We've become a race of Peeping Toms." Similarly, Vertigo (1958), also filmed in San Francisco, stars James Stewart in a role quite similar to that of Hackman. Stewart plays "Scottie," a retired private investigator. Despite the technological developments throughout the next twenty years, he uses true investigative skills and seems to fall in love with the woman that he is following. Similarly, I saw Hackman's character to be in love with the target of his surveillance. He made love to a woman while listening to her voice, her picture flashing in his eyes. When she is tied in with the murder of her husband in the end, we almost feel the same emotion of disappointment that Hackman feels. He wanted to defend her and yet, he played as an integral part in the murder of her husband. In the end, his paranoia has only worsened, tearing up the floorboards and wallpaper searching for bugs. Hitchcock was the master of suspense and thriller movies, sometimes bordering on horror. Movies such as The Man Who Knew Too Much show his interest in conspiracy. Certain shots were a gentle reminder to his inspiration. The bird's eye view, for instance, in the opening of The Conversation is very Hitchcockian (Psycho and Vertigo). The bloodied bathroom is an obvious reference to Psycho (1960). Like Norman Bates, Hackman drills a hole in the hotel bathroom to spy on its occupants. This comparison to Hitchcockian film is only a mere reflection on the theme of the conspiracy/thriller genre. Throughout American history, it is amazing to find that these films may begin to reflect society. The ways in which they were shot, camera angles, and visual themes or symbols all play as an integral part of the film-making process. Hackman's character became a filmmaker, himself, in some aspects. Many of the same features were present; he uses cameras and the recording devices to capture voices and background noises, editing the films to make them sound perfect, and finally handing the finished product to "the Director" alone. Like Hitchcock movies, The Conversation leaves its audience with a warning. Someone is always watching or listening through hotel peepholes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Minor but great Coppola film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coppola made this film amidst the 2 Godfather films. It is amazingly low key for all the pomp that he put into his other films around this time. Hackman is excellent in a very subtle performance. Although he says little throughout the film, you know what's going through his mind. Also, a very strong screen presence by Harrison Ford gives you an indication of his stellar career to come. What I liked most about this film is the attention to the little details. The DVD commentary mentions that all the electronic equipment is accurate down to the nuts and bolts. You are able to grasp what a menace the 'big brother' of electronic surveillance can do to a society. Also, by casting then relative unknowns, it gives a sense of realism. There are very few obvious "Hollywood" composed shots. The film has a mystery that makes you think, and explores territory that hasn't been explored already. (Hackman's re-visits this role in the overblown "Enemy of the State"). It's very impressive for Coppola to show such restraint, and this movie would not succeed as it does if there were any normal conventions used.I give it a 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was really good-suspenseful, involved plot, interesting cast(look! Han Solo! look! Shirley Feeney!look! Lex Luthor!look! the blonde from Oh God! and Mr. Mom!)big name director, timely Watergate-ish plot...I am still impressed by the whole package. What a quiet, bleak, cold film this one is. And paranoid, too. You have a few twists and turns which keep you guessing as Gene Hackman guesses, and time to wonder just who is leading on whom.Personally I liked this very much, and am reminded of how many great films came out in '74-this, Godfather II, Longest Yard, Death Wish, Lenny, Papillon....some great work here. Some have said that Coppola outdid Hitchcock with this-to which I say-NOT! Hitchcock would have ground some humour, cold and quirky a brand though it may have been-into this, which Coppola simply couldn't. Plus Hitchcock would have cast someone with more oomph to be Hack's girlfriend then 30 year old Teri Garr, who was always more of a 'gal next door' type than anything else....But by all means, see this one. Plex sometimes runs it, it grows on ya and is a fine pairing with Enemy of the State, where Hack basically re-hashes his character and the film co. tosses in more $$$ budget-wise.This one gets a ***1/2 outta ****, of course check it out.</fullReview>

An internal barometer seems to be telling you that it ain't right. Perhapes the production may have gone over budget and needed a quick end.

		<fullReview>Fine craftsmanship in this movie, excellent acting, razor-sharp script. One of my favorites.Yes, the first half is slow. The movie is as much about Harry Caul as about what happens to the young couple. And, you might notice the way the camera pans mechanically, right to left, left to right, right to left, just like a surveillance camera, in the last few seconds of the film. Perhaps this is meant to suggest that we ourselves have been voyeurs, snooping on Harry. I expect that 99% of the time, snooping is just a matter of waiting for something to happen; is this why the movie is slow in the beginning?Harry Caul epitomizes the nerd who is very good at handling machines but abysmal at dealing with people. This is shown clearly time after time in the movie, which also makes clear that technical knowledge alone isn't enough in the real world--that grave mistakes can result if human motives and emotions are not considered as well.</fullReview>

He begins to suspect they will be murdered and doesn't know what to do.An early film by Francis Ford Coppola. It's been praised to the high heavens by critics since it came out and was even nominated for three Academy Awards. Why? It's a terrible film! It moves at a snails pace and basically goes nowhere. I was fighting to stay awake through this one. Any point it might have been trying to make is totally lost to mind-numbing tedium. Hackman was a great actor but this is easily one of his worst performances. He's constantly blank-faced and boring. It is kind of fun to see Cindy Williams and Harrison Ford so young and good-looking but they're no reason to sit through this. An incredibly dull and ultimately pointless film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rented this movie due to the high rating (8.2 as of this writing) and with names like Hackman, Coppola, Cindy Williams, Teri Garr and a very young Harrison Ford, it sounded like a great film. Well, if you think that, you'd be wrong.**** CAUTION - MILD SPOILER *****The twist at the end was a nice thought but it comes too late and seems terribly manufactured as part of the audio tape (that we've heard at least a dozen times by then) suddenly has stress on a different word in a sentence. They had to do this or anyone would have figured out the ending the FIRST time they heard it. The technology hardly seems cutting edge (this is a 1974 film) and Hackman's character is bizarre based on 30 year pro in the surveillance business that suddenly has a conscience over a conversation that to most would be a routine "couple having an affair" situation.I kept believing that Coppola had something great in store, but it never came about. Possibly if they had given us more about his involvement with a previous case where his work had cost people their lives, (which is briefly touched on but not flushed out very well) it would have made us feel some empathy for his character, but to me he just came off as socially inept and paranoid. The only real question he left for me was why did he not take action in the hotel, instead of turning up the TV and freaking out.Hackman gets a much better character in a similar role in "Enemy of the State". Rent that and I'll bet you'll enjoy it much more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Idea Gone Wrong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read elsewhere that Coppola himself abandoned the film in the latter half of production for the greener pastures of Godfather II. But perhaps Coppola saw that this film, despite it's strong cast and fascinating premise, never really gets going. It is a film that clearly seeks to differentiate itself from "classic Hollywood cinema". But unlike many low-budget independent films, this one also seems to abandon all sense of a logical narrative. I do not intend any offense to the people that rate this film so highly, but I believe it may be a case of "different = great". It is always refreshing to see a film that does not submit to the pitfalls and cliches of typical Hollywood fare. But personally, I require that such a film must also have some semblence of a plot and be (perish the thought!) intellectually interesting AND entertaining. The only mental challenge The Conversation presents is trying to figure out why people consider it a classic. The fact that the producer must "cheat" with the sound of the conversation at the end of the film in order to even begin to make sense of what the viewer has been seeing represents a last-ditch desperate effort to save the narrative. I don't buy it. I walk away from this film wondering why I wasted the last two hours of my life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointingly indistinct in plot, character, and style, and in marked contrast to Coppola's other films from the 1970s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gene Hackman's Harry Caul is the rock star of the private surveillance industry, the envy of his peers, the hero exposer of scandals at the highest levels. That's a needless premise, and after it is introduced relatively deep into the film it does the story harm. At the beginning, Caul is interesting enough as an excessively-reserved man balancing an espionage career against his moral discomfort with the job. His character comes further into focus as we see how his guilt and obsession over his work makes intimate relationships, and even casual acquaintanceships like that between a landlord and a tenant, virtually impossible. Caul's personality is not conveyed in not the most subtle or original ways: a trip to a confessional booth is involved, and tossed-off memories of childhood traumas, both of which are overfamiliar, quick and dirty methods for getting to the bottom of a character's psyche. But in spy dramas stock characters have a long and fine history, and the real stars are often plot and atmosphere. The problems with "The Conversation" really begin, then, when Caul is built up as an expert in the field, but proves less savvy than the audience despite having access to the same information. No George Smiley is he; although he, like Smiley, is well-respected in his field, and though both characters have blind spots in their personal lives, Caul exhibits a very un-Smiley-like fecklessness in virtually everything he does. The plot twists remarkably little and elevates to disappointingly low stakes, yet Caul consistently proves to be no match for the crime thriller playbook's oldest tricks. Admittedly, that's part of the idea: he's become so damaged by his work that he's falling apart, but because the movie only spans the final stage of what must have been a long descent, Caul is remote and the story seems incomplete. The climactic scenes seem to belong to a different movie entirely, one chiefly concerned with psychology and the reliability of perception, and while this turn may deflect attention from a relatively weak story, it again highlights the flimsiness of the central character and how little there is to know about him. By contrast, other Coppola movies from the same decade, namely The Godfather films and Apocalypse Now, benefit from richly detailed scripts and powerful personalities. Coppola's directorial style is also weaker in this film than in the others, as for example in the almost embarrassing reliance on horror-movie techniques in a key scene in a bathroom.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's make something clear: neither "The Conversation" nor "one from the heart" are true masterpieces; but I really think that Mr. Coppola was beyond reproach after filming the two first parts of "The Godfather" and "Apocalyose Now" in 5 years. So, what if the quality of "The conversation" is not high enough? Gene Hackman plays a detective with some guilt feelings and devoured by paranoia. The movie fluctuates between the drama and the thriller, but it doesn't really hook the audience (that's my opinion, at least). I'm not saying "The conversation" is a bad movie, or a boring one, it's just that it would have worked better as a thriller with a more dynamic rhythm.*My rate: 7/10</fullReview>

The mystery as it slowly unfolds is captivating. I was ready to give this film an 8 out of 10.Unfortunately, somewhere around the trade show, the film gets bogged down and goes nowhere. It won't spoil the plot for me just to say I found the ending very unsatisfying. Now normally, an unsatisfying ending kills a movie for me. But this time the rest of the film was so good I'll put The Conversation merely into the so-so category.Who should see this film:-- Arty people only.

Too much time is spent focusing on the main character Harry's (Hackman) problems, e.g. his paranoia and loneliness. While character depth is all very nice, it was much more exciting when we saw Harry trying to put all the pieces of the conversation he heard together. And how the more he understood and discovered, the deeper and deeper he sank into trouble.This film was good for it's time (especially after the Watergate scandal, a mere coincidence), but suits a faster-paced script without an Italian director trying and failing miserably to be the next Fellini (Coppola should've put even more boring scenes for that!). I reckon James Cameron could do a better job today, just as long as he doesn't cast Arnie as the main lead!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>****SPOILERS**** Having been involved in bugging people for years in the surveillance business Harry Caul, Gene Hackman, has tried to detach himself from his job on snooping into other peoples business by trying to keep what he does at far away from himself as possible. Hired to do a job for the Director, Robert Duvall, in San Francisco Harry and his assistant Stan, John Cazale, have Ann &amp; Mark, Cindy Williams &amp; Fredrick Forrest, staked out with a number of bugging devices as well as men on the scene in this park picking up everything that the couple says.This assignment is no big deal for Harry since he's done far bigger jobs over the years making him the #1 bugger on the west coast if not the entire country or even the world. What we at the time don't know, and are soon to find out, is that Harry has a very guilty conscience coupled with his being a very serious and observant Catholic about an event that has been burning up insides him. Harry pulled off an almost impossible spying job, that made him the legend in the spying business that he is now back in the summer of 1968 a job that cost the lives of three innocent people.Checking out the tapes on Ann and her husband Mark Harry picks up, after cleaning out the background noises, Mark saying " he'll kill us if he got the chance" and goes into a panic. Harry feels that he's somehow setting up the two to be murdered by the Director. With him already guilt-ridden over the deaths of the three people that he somehow involved in his surveillance job back in 1968 this, the possible murder of Ann &amp; Mark, is too much for Harry's guilt-ridden soul to bare and he starts to do everything he can to stop it; not giving over the surveillance tapes to the Director's stooge the snooty and arrogant, which makes Harry all that more determined not to to give him the tapes, Martin Stett (Harrison Ford).Statt under orders from the Director to get the tapes, which Harry is to be paid $15,000.00 for, has Harry followed where his cover is easily discovered, the arrogant jerk doesn't even bother to put on a disguise, by a very observant Harry. Stett finally get's to Harry, by using someone else, at a party for fellow snooper at his loft, where Harry has all his tapes and equipment. Having invited top New York bugger Bernie Moran, Alen Garfield, who's very jealous of Harry for being the top man in the bugging business with him a very distance second and one of his lady friends Meredith, Elizabeth MacRae, Harry is at first made to look like a fool, by Bernie having him bugged without knowing it. Things got even worse with Meredith bedding Harry down in his loft as she induced Harry to spend the night with her, after everyone else left, not because Harry is so sexy and debonair but that Meredith is secretly working for the Director. As Harry is in dreamland Meredith slips out of his place with the very important tapes of Ann and Mark that Harry had hidden there.With no choice left to him Harry goes to see the Director the next day to pick up his fee for the tapes but he still has this bug up his a** about what the Director has in store for Ann &amp; Mark. Knowing where their staying,a hotel in the city, which was on the tapes he gave the director Harry checks into a room next to theirs and bugs it to keep in touch with what's to happen to them and if something bad does, which Harry suspects, he can come riding to their rescue.It turned that Harry was in a way right, but half-a** backwards right, about Ann &amp; Mark and the Director. After going through a number of wild and paranoid induced hallucinations Harry finally came to his senses with the knowledge that there indeed was a murder in the works in all this but it wasn't exactly what he thought it would be with both the victims, or victim, and the murderer, or murderers, in this whole mind-numbing scenario being in reverse!Harry now completely out of it knowing that the murder, that he so desperately tried to prevent, was actually made possible by his misinterpreting the evidence, thus not being able to stop it, has another death, like the three back in 1968, on his conscience. With the knowledge that he screwed everything up Harry goes back to his almost empty and spartan apartment, after he ripped out everything in it that wasn't bolted or nailed down, and tries to forget his troubles. Mindlessly plopping himself down in a corner, with the only thing that he can now relate too, and playing his beloved saxophone Harry is now disconnected from reality and his conscience. All this involvement with Ann Mark and the Director in regard to, what at first seemed like, a simple surveillance job on the part of Harry had just about driven him over the edge and left him in a state of such sever self-denial. Cut off from the world in order not to be exposed to both any human contact as well as becoming uninvolved in the wiretapping business that he's so good at doing on others, Harry in short has gone totally nuts!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gotta confess something. I'm young. I was born in 1978. I have the 'Generation X movie disease' - the notion that all films made before 1980 are automatically boring crap-ola from Mars.I try not to think this way. I try to overcome it. It's my problem, I'll deal with it.However, this won't stop me spilling my ill-informed, youthful guts about this film. I found this film to be paced in a totally strange way. I warned of spoilers. Here they are, don't read on. The movie uses the first hour to build the storyline and the character of Harry Caul(Gene Hackman). But, to we REALLY need to know so much about him? A lot of the scenes are nothing but character-building, so that we can 'get inside his brain'. His religion and his sax-playing in particular have little or nothing to do with the rest of the film. No foreshadowing here, folks, just filler.And all this filler crams the first half of the movie, so that when the film finally gets started, the murder he witnesses, his discoveries, the discovery that it wasn't actually the girl that was killed - all that actually constitutes the action and the drama in the film - gets crammed into the last half hour.Don't get me wrong. The last part of the movie is in fact very good, on-the-edge-of-your-seat entertainment. But the pre-amble is just so boring. You want to say "Oh for Christ's sake get on with it!", but Caul doesn't like you saying that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"When The Red Red Robin Comes Bob Bob Bobbin' Along"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harry Caul (Gene Hackman), a privately employed surveillance expert, records a seemingly ordinary conversation of a young couple in a public square, in San Francisco. A mysterious man known only as The Director (Robert Duvall) pays Caul in cash for the work. The plot follows Harry Caul as he becomes increasingly convinced that the young couple is in danger.The film's underlying concept is quite simple. But the script expands the premise needlessly to nearly two hours. In that time we learn a lot about Hackman's character, a middle-aged man obsessed with privacy, who likes jazz and plays the saxophone, and has a one-track mind, with his focus on the technical aspects of surveillance. This is a rather geeky movie with lots of references to the technical components of sound electronics.The plot exudes a sense of some unknown menace lurking in the background, much like "All The President's Men" (1976). As a mystery, "The Conversation" thus provides some interest. But the film's very slow pace and the focus on Caul, a dreadfully dull man, to some extent offset the clever premise. Over and over we listen to the couples' conversation, on antiquated reel-to-reel tape, wherein the young woman hums one of the film's opening songs, "When The Red Red Robin Comes Bob Bob Bobbin' Along".Cinematography and production design are fine. The camera, unusually static, functions as something of an automated eavesdropping device, which reinforces the theme of being watched surreptitiously. Some of the dialogue and script action take place off-screen as characters walk out of, or back into, frame. The classical piano background music enlivens the dull plot not at all.With all that old-style surveillance and recording equipment, "The Conversation" seems dated. But the biggest problem is that the story's puzzle solution doesn't require such a long, drawn-out, slow plot, much of which seems like filler, or rather an excuse to showcase the acting skills of Gene Hackman. To its credit, the film does have a lot to say thematically about issues of privacy and responsibility.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Conversation is quite interesting. Though clearly riffing on Europe's 'Blowup,' it is suited very well to the decade and culture in which it was made. It has many similarities to 'Blow-Up' that have been previously noted, but it also has a key piece of info whose misperception results in logical 'noise,' and then a twist. Most of the earmarks of film-modernity are being explored here: the long take, the entry into a world of specialized knowledge, the character study, conspicuous technique which toys with the neutral narratives of earlier decades.The movie is off and running with two or three interesting elements that the movie will meditate on for the rest of it's running time. A solitudinous no-man who prefers to be lost in a crowd, a camera that is slightly independent of the characters, and the scouring of an audio recording to summon up corresponding visuals for re-inspection.I much prefer this to Coppola's more grandiose crowd-pleasers. I appreciate the effort and achievement of the Godfather and Apocalypse Now but those films don't really speak to me. The photography is particularly good. Though I agree with Vincent Canby that a poor dream sequence underscores how much better the rest of the movie is. Both Blow-Up and The Conversation implicate Depalma again as a hack who merely borrows entire movies from better directors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An overly monotonous and slow-paced film that does not really do much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Conversation is one of those classic films that just doesn't work for me. It's monotonous, slow-paced, and barely amounts to much. Harry Caul (Gene Hackman) is a surveillance expert who runs his own company in San Francisco and is a very private man. He is cautious with everything, especially with his personal relationships. He is put up to the task of recording a conversation between two couples in a square and becomes overly obsessive with the conversation which is gradually explained as to why throughout the film. It gets obnoxious real quick. For well-over an hour of the film, you'll be obnoxiously watching Caul obsess of the conversation, and don't worry, they'll show that conversation over and over again. It's annoying. Really annoying. The movie has themes that are interesting from the aspects of wire tapping (which can easily relate to our post 9/11 world), Caul's religion, and his eventual personal conflict we found out about much later into the film. The issue is that most of these themes rarely go beyond a surface level in my mind. And the personal conflict to the character is revealed way too late into the film and by that point, I already didn't care much at all for the character. He isn't interesting at all. He is quite boring in nearly every way because he isn't really developed, he is somewhat subtly but isn't enough for me to care about this man who is essentially breaking down from his obsession. Hackman's performance is sufficient enough but it's more in the lack of development.My issue is that this movie could have been so much more. By the end of the film where questions finally get answered, I could care less. It was much too late for me to care about what was going on in the film by the last 20 minutes, did they expect me to? Because I sure didn't. The movie just got old real quick, pretty much by the 40 minute mark I was already fairly frustrated with the film. I wanted to be patient, I was expecting it to be a slow build by the 20-30 minute mark but it never went anywhere. It wasn't like Vertigo where the slow build up is so worth it in nearly every single way. Overall, I was just frustrated by this movie, as the themes it laid out where potentially interesting but executed poorly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I always read a few pages of reviews before I watch a film. Like many, I watched this one because I liked the cast, especially Gene Hackman. He gives a good performance and the plot was intriguing. But for me the story was just never developed into a worthwhile movie. It starts out slow and never seems to gather any speed.Francis Coppola's direction was decent but not one of his better efforts. The best part of the movie was watching Hackman's paranoia get the best of him. I am sure he enjoyed tearing up his apartment but even this did not lend any substance to the story. One would have to be beyond paranoia into full blown psychosis to do something like that.While Hackman is and will always be considered a great actor. This is a film that I am sure he even looks back with disdain. If you are a fan like me, then pass this one on by.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a fan of Cappola, I have to admit that it's the worst film that he has made until now. Long time boring scenes, not fluent story, repeating conversations got me bored and it forced my patience to stop watching.According to the story, a telephone technician is good at listening the conversations between people on phone or in real life. So, he uses this skill as a job in other words he is a professional. Like always he comes to an agreement with a boss of company. But this time our hero suspects "The Conversation" that a man and a woman made. These people are the people who are followed by our hero. He studies to solve the cipher in "The Conversation".The film's end is very amazing and of course I won't talk about it here. I just say that if affairs turn into obsessions, a man's life could become unbearable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everybody says this is a key movie of the '70's, but to me it seems somewhat ahead of its time. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola right after The Godfather Part 1, it paves the way for the likes of M. Night Shyamaylan...I would seriously not be surprised if M. Night grew up on this movie. It reminds me of Taxi Driver too, in a way, in its tone of communicating the state of being on the fringe of society (complete with jazz too...how about that). Gene Hackman plays a professional wiretapper who is paid by a mysterious figure to record a conversation between a man and a woman, knowing nothing about them. When he starts to put the pieces together he finds he has knotted issues about involvement with the people. This movie deals directly with the morality of voyeurism, individualism and involvement. We know nothing about the main character, but in a dream scene we catch a glimpse of the demons of his childhood and his inclination to death. There is also a sideways glance at the closet skeletons of his professional career. A motel scene close to the end becomes outright surrealistic, and an unexpected twist at the end combined with his search for a bug that is never found, leaves him alone with his saxophone, playing a solo melody for the first time. Beautifully artistic direction by Coppola. My main problem with this movie is Gene Hackman...his character is full of possibility, an exercise in loneliness, but the man screwed it up, because he is a third-rate actor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Overrated Movie Of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find this film to be one of the most absurdly overrated pieces of garbage of all time. I realize that this movie is highly revered by pseudo intellectual film students that are obsessed with cinematography and anything that has the name "Coppola" attached to it. But for those of us that are NOT elitist film snob wannabe's - a film that has fancy camera angles and the names Coppola and Hackman attached to it does not qualify it as solid entertainment. All the innovative cinematography in the world can't polish this turd. I know this hurts many of you that had some egomaniacal film professor brainwash you into believing this is a "thinking man's masterpiece",?..but wake up and see this movie for what it is.For starters this film moves at the pace of constipation. I can't ever remember seeing a film that develops at such a horribly boring pace. To make matters worse, the repetition is painful. Harry Caul's paranoid nature is repeatedly beaten into our heads like we viewer's are far too stupid to ever recognize paranoia. Beyond the repeated establishment of his paranoia - the bulk of the film's first 70 minutes is spent watching Harry Caul turn various knobs in effort to dial in clearer dialog on his surveillance tapes, rewinding the tapes over and over again, while listening to the same bits of the conversation over and over again. We get it Coppola,??we heard the conversation the first 400 times Hackman played it! If this movie was edited at a pace that didn't put people to sleep, it would have been about 30-40 minutes long and had completely equal impact without losing any relevance.Then there is the foolish contradiction within Hackman's character. He was so paranoid that no one knew where he lived and he wouldn't even give out his phone number. Even his girlfriend (that he supposedly loved) had no clue where he lived, what his phone number was or even what he did for a living. Yet Hackman had no problem letting his one night stand into his world,?..letting her sleep over in his surveillance lair, among his top secret homemade equipment and precious surveillance tapes?!?!?!? He won't let anyone in his apartment with his jazz records and saxophone, but he'll consent to a party in his top secret work space?!?!?! A party with guests that are made up of his snooping competition and various people he doesn't even know?!?!?! He won't tell the woman he loves where he lives, what his phone number is or what he does for a living ? yet he will let a woman he just met alone with his precious surveillance tapes and homemade, top secret surveillance equipment while he sleeps?!?!?! Then in the end of the movie Hackman destroys his apartment while looking for a planted bug,?doing tens of thousands of dollars worth of damage in a rented apartment. How about renting a new apartment (he had a landlord that violates his privacy anyway)?!?!?! Or better yet, how about NOT having any incriminating conversations in the apartment?!?!?! No one knows where he lived and no one had his phone number ? how hard would of it been to save the incriminating conversations for when he was outside his apartment walls?!?!?! I mean come on ? the contradictions in Hackman's character were absurd! This pathetic, ponderous film does have an unexpected twist ending, but even that is accomplished through the use of a cheesy diversionary tactic. The repeated "we're not hurting anybody" line of the conversation is a lame smoke &amp; mirrors way of throwing the viewers off the film's ending. It's the obvious fact that you are "hurting somebody" when you are planning to murder them that makes Coppola's diversionary tactic so incredibly lame. "We aren't hurting anybody, we aren't hurting anybody ? We are just going to kill my husband",??..LAME! And by the way - how do you make a bloody suffocation look like a car accident? Yes I realize it was 1974, but autopsy was plenty sophisticated at that time, death by suffocation would have been quite evident (suffocation is elementary in an autopsy diagnosis). On top of that you are dealing with a wife of a prominent, wealthy man. She stood a lot to gain by her husband's death, so potential foul play would have been closely examined. Death by suffocation undetected,.......bloody body removed from a big city hotel without suspicion or recognition,.......body then planted into a believable car accident in a big, highly populated city - and no one the wiser. Yea, that's realistic - about as believable as Mission Impossible or Die-hard.Yes, I suppose that if you are a pompous, self righteous, big headed film student - the cinematography might be enough to entertain you. But I personally could care less about the impressive cinematography if the framework it is applied to is essentially worthless ? you end up with nothing more than a polished turd. I don't care about pretty colors on a canvas if the painting itself is novice and uninteresting. Nor do I have an interest in listening to the greatest musician on earth if the song being performed sucks (and I am a musician). Virtuosity is pointless if it is only displayed within a context that is impossible to appreciate.Comparing this movie to the brilliance of "The Godfather I &amp; II" or "Apocalypse Now" is absolutely criminal.</fullReview>

I can't say I'm very pretentious about movies, I like all kinds of them, classic or artistic movies too. I simply cannot remember any other occasion I have had such a boring time watching something. I DO remember a lot of stuff-probably because everything went on so slooooow, and that tape- OMG, after one hour I was sure I'll be dreaming it for a month. How many times was it repeated after all???? Not integraly, OK, but still, some parts just kept on going again and again with pauses of 10 min between... I did like the atmosphere, old technology stuff, things in the house, music- really fine- but that was abut it. By the time something happened- I was almost asleep. Then, waiting full of hope for some development of the plot...again long, long pauses of nearly nothing...I mean I'm not an action freak, have no problems with listening to conversations, for that matter- but that thing was repeated so many times I thought it was some kind of coded language. Then when I realised it's just about some moral choice Gene Hckman must make...that's the point I've turned the DVD off and went to have a cold shower.I don't know the ending, I might have lost some great unforeseen stuff- I just hardly can imagine anything capable to compensate me for that boredom this movie has caused me.</fullReview>

The end result is boredom, lots of it, the only saving grace to some of the incredibly self indulgent boring and flat scenes is that they are from a distinct period and interesting only from a museum perspective of a glimpse into the past. This is a great movie, however the pace plods and plods and not a lot happens. You really have to be in the mood to let this unfold in it's own self indulgent artsy fartsy plodding super slow way.

		<shortDescription>The Conversation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Francis Ford Coppola (The Godfather, Part II; Apocalypse Now), I may have tried the first few minutes of this film and probably not understood it, and I had heard it was very popular, and I had to watch it as it featured in the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die book. Basically in San Francisco lives devout Catholic, jazz music loving and saxophone playing Harry Caul (BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Gene Hackman), who also owns and operates a surveillance business with his highly professional equipment to capture sound. In his personal and professional life he is highly private and solitary, and this does concern his partner Stan (The Godfather's John Cazale) who feels left out of the work done by the business. Harry is so private he never lets anyone else into his apartment, and he does not have a telephone and calls all his clients from pay phones, this is to keep control of what is going on around him. His and Stan's latest assignment is to record, to anyone else normal, a conversation between a male/female couple meeting each other in Union Square, which is very crowded and noisy. The client, known only as "the director", wants them to take photographs and record all audio from the closely observed conversation, and give them only to him in exchange for payment. Listening to every word in the every word of the pair, Ann (Cindy Williams) and Mark (Frederic Forrest), Harry believes that they are in danger, from the circumstances of the director's assistant Martin Stett (Harrison Ford). He does not normally become attached to any of the words that people on his recordings say, but he has become concerned since the deaths of three people as a result from his previous audio recordings from another job. Harry has to decide whether or not to hand over the recordings, and photos, to the director, and whether or not he could save the couple who always meet in the same place, using the information he has collected. He eventually meets The Director (Robert Duvall) in person, and he decides to follow Ann and Mark to a hotel, and he tries to listen in on their discussions with any surveillance technique available to him, and it turns out that it was in fact a murder they were talking about committing. In the end Harry discovers that because of his work his apartment has been bugged, and he frantically searches for listening devices, removing floorboards and tearing up the walls, and after failing to find one all he can do is sit alone and play his saxophone. Also starring Allen Garfield as Bernie Moran, Michael Higgins as Paul, Elizabeth MacRae as Meredith and Teri Garr as Amy. Hackman gives an excellent performance as the obsessive character as the loner with surveillance expertise, the supporting actors such as Ford and Duvall do well with their time as well, the rewinding and forwarding of the conversation of the title is fascinating with the sound being broken down and edited to hear every word and grip you to see what Hackman does next, and the surreal paranoia and high observation themes make for fantastic plot line, it is a very clever psychological thriller. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Picture for Coppola, Best Sound and Best Writing, Original Screenplay for Coppola, it won the BAFTA for Best Film Editing and Best Sound Track, and it was nominated for Best Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay.
