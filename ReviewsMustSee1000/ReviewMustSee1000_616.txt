		<shortDescription>Everyone should watch it if they have the chance, but don't expect to go away smiling.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow. I just watched The Brave. Before I saw it, I knew that it was the only film which Johnny Depp has directed. After seeing it, I can add 'unfortunately' to the beginning of the fact. In every film that he's been in, nevermind the quality of the film itself, Johnny Depp has always given a wonderful performance. As a director, he's no different. The Brave is truly outstanding. How to describe the film? It's impossibly really. All I can say is...wow. Every actor is great. It's hard to get good child actors, but here it had been done. Johnny Depp is fantastic as usual, the wife is brilliant too. I don't think that there is a single performance that I would criticise. With the film, I did something that I've never done before - I didn't move for the last 10 or 20 minutes, and when it was over, I just sat through the credits completely in shock, crying. I even stayed in front of the DVD menu for a while afterwards, completely still. How anyone can call this film 'boring' is beyond me. Heartbreaking, uncomfortable, yes, but it is far from boring. Everyone should watch The Brave if they have the chance, but don't expect to go away smiling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I expected this movie to be a real "stinker" based on comments I had seen. But I was pleasantly surprised to see how good a movie it is. It is a powerful story about desperate people and should have received more attention and respect than it did. The movie could use some work in places, but it deserves to be released.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this movie on DVD. As soon as I finished watching, I felt I had to see it again.The thought of being killed for money may sound bizarre, but in this movie, it's very realistic.The movie caught the mindset of a man about to be sacrified very well and you could feel the intensity. It neither condemned nor aprove his decision. But his actions all made sense, so we sympathize but not pity him.Johnny Depp played the role so well, he was able to convince us that he was just doing his best to help his beloved family.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful movie. Depp is an excellent director andactor.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the first glance one could believe that "The Brave" is an action movie: a desperate man enters in the wrong place and he has to run away in order to keep himself alive. For those who love the adventures and action movies this one could be the prefect beginning for another one. Instead, the film moves into the philosophical reflection of meaning of life and death. The story is about love and struggling against fatality.Depp gives us a beautiful movie that shows an excellent director: the photography is wonderful, the first sequence is hallucinant; the only regret is that it remembers Jarmush's "Dead Man".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>slow, sad film about poverty and braveness; respectable first-time directing work by Depp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had read an article in a waiting room Entertainment Weekly while getting a punctured tire repaired, an article about unreleased (or little-released) films and albums by big-name directors and artists. An internet search indicates this was "Buried Treasure" by Tim Carvell in issue # 795, December 3, 2004. One of them was this film, unreleased in the US, but available on DVD in the UK. Happily I own a region-free player that does PAL-NTSC conversion (I wish they would abolish regional encoding!), and the DVD on the UK Amazon site was relatively cheap, so I ordered it.I'm surprised to see that the author of the novel this film was adapted from was the author of the Fletch series! This is entirely different.Johnny Depp plays a native American living with his wife, son, and daughter in a small trailer in a shantytown next to a garbage dump in the desert. Days seem to be spent mostly sleeping. He goes to town to apply for a job a man in a bar told him about. He goes to a pretty shady place, and we learn what the job is (reading the DVD box would tell you the same thing): to be tortured and killed (presumably on film) for $50,000. He's given some money up front (at least a couple thousand, not sure how much), and a week before he has to come back to do the job. Evidently in the book he's only offered $30,000 and given $200 up front!He goes back home, and doesn't do much initially, but then tries bonding more with his family, who he'd grown apart from while drinking. He spends the money on things that delight his kids, but seem pretty frivolous. His wife is worried he's robbed a store or done something else that will get him put in jail again. He hopes the money will help his family move up in life, and it comes at an opportune time, since the shantytown is due to be demolished.It's a bit longer than I think it need be, about two hours. However, it is well directed. I think Johnny Depp did a good job with it.Marlon Brando's role is pretty small. He'd worked with Depp before in Don Juan DeMarco (1995), quite a different movie than this one! Iggy Pop, who worked on the soundtrack has a short cameo as a man at a fiesta eating a giant drumstick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once again Johnny Depp proves to us what a great talent he is, not only with his acting, but directing as well. His long time career and affiliation with such talented directors shows.This movie had me mesmerized. It's beginning so quiet and the outcome leaving me in tears. The photography was beautiful leaving me feel that although the people were extremely poor, they had what they needed because they had each other. The sacrifice that Rafael makes is beyond love, beyond money.It struck me while watching the scene between Marlon Brando and Johnny Depp that Johnny is the young Brando. The scene so intense the two actors on the same level. Wow.Johnny Depp has once again outdone himself and I will look forward to whatever else he has to offer us whether it be acting or directing. This is a must see for any Depp fan and more to the point, any movie fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The plot itself is so bizarre that it might well be real. Rafael´s love for his family is greater than his fear of dying.There is hardly a more difficult decision to make.Despite his clearly showing conflict,he seems to have decided to do it from the start. Despite the doubts he is facing from his wife due to his previous imprisonment, he follows it through and takes care of everything before he follows the trail to his doom. A true brave in a true drama with a very sensitive ending.</fullReview>

Please be aware this movie had the most sensual scene between a man and his wife I have ever seen and I doubt anyone will ever top it.Anyone who does not understand or appreciate what Depp was attempting to depict is shallow and/or dense. Excellent movie! I feel "The Brave" deserves the respect of the American movie public.

		<fullReview>I thought this was an excellent movie! Johnny Depp plays an indian who has a wife and two children living in poverty. The only way he sees out for his family is to sell himself to Marlon Brando so he can see what a painful death looks like. So for $50,000, Rafael (Depp) agrees to be Brando's guinea pig. In his last week with his family, Rafael learns to live again and love his family. At the end of the week, he has to go back to this warehouse, where he knows he will be killed. The most interesting segment of the movie is the meeting between Rafael and the priest who he asks help from in making sure his family gets the money after he's gone. It becomes a moral dilemma for the priest and yet in the end, the priest comes through for Rafael. This is a movie not to be watched without tissues!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An opportunity missed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Given that "The Brave" was based on a novel with a fascinating but disturbing concept, it could and should have been an excellent movie. Depp's direction is competent, the acting overall is good, but the film is overlong and poorly structured. The opening sequences give no hint whatever of what is to follow, and even the Brando character's payment of $50,000 in cash tells the viewer little. Is Depp supposed to come back in a week and carry out a contract killing? Who knows? Who cares? The closure was well handled, and the film would have been weakened if it had gone on to show the main character's suffering and death. But the film would have benefited from a brief glimpse at the very start, or at least an intimation, of what would happen at the end. It's not surprising that many viewers found the film boring. The pace is desperately slow, and much of the film has one itching to press the fast-forward button.</fullReview>

Most boring movie ever. We wanted to turn it off, but my friend said that it had a good ending. He lied. Afterwards we decided to give him a couple of punches for this terrible movie, and it was the last time he decides which movie we'll see.

		<shortDescription>Depp's one foray as writer/director/actor has not, understandably, been repeated. A movie that strives for depth and profundity but fails.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is really a very weak movie. The script is poor, the music sounds like a contribution from a mate of Johnny's and the direction is weak. Depp is really very unconvincing playing a Native American who has lived a hard, down-and-out life of poverty and failure (too well-spoken for a start) and his acting looks especially thin in the brief scene with Marlon Brando who seems to remind us what real acting is, although Brando's contribution (along with Marshall Bell's) is not enough to save this film. The only compelling scenes are the ones with Bell and Brando with the rest appearing as weak filler which fails to properly establish mood, depth or content or hold the attention. The main faults are with Depp's acting (very shallow, altogether unconvincing and invoking little sympathy from this viewer), the characterization, the realization of the story and the direction. Perhaps most crucially, the story itself reaches for profundity but is pretty contemptible - if Raphael really loved his children he wouldn't be throwing away his life for some short-term bucks, thereby robbing them of the lifelong love and support of their father and increasing the likelihood of permanent disadvantage and psychological damage. The film does not explore this side of the situation and seems to infer some sort of deeper meaning and selflessness in his act (i.e., he is the "brave one", as well as the Native American "Brave" - the puerile turgidity of this pun suggests the facile nature of the film). The plot also toys with ideas that are insufficiently explored or developed, tacked on, pointless or implausible: for example, the last-minute conversion to Native American spiritualism, which seems to go nowhere, mean nothing and develop nothing; there is the lunacy of giving up his life so his children can have the money to get out of the hole they're in and then spending much of it on a trashy fun park and a big party (perhaps intended to demonstrate the protagonist's generosity and good-heartedness but in a way that robs his gesture of value and meaning); there is the question of how the priest is supposed to ensure Raphael's family get the money from such vicious types as the film depicts; and the priest's sudden change from fury at the protagonist's fatal decision to a sort of stymied resignation and his ultimate failure to try and stop him on the day, which really makes little sense in light of his character and previous actions. There is certainly social comment here but it's pretty ham-fisted. The Native Americans live in a garbage dump (not so subtle symbolism) and the film generally suggests the corner that the poor (especially poor non-whites) are backed into and the lack of regard for their lives by those with money and power. However, this too seems pretty thin, obvious and half-baked (try watching a Ken Loach or Mike Leigh film Johnny). Furthermore, by making two such louche and mysterious characters the villains in this social commentary, Depp does not point the finger of culpability in a very suggestive direction. In the final wash-up, it just doesn't explore the choice he makes with any real depth or profundity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Depp and Brando are arresting to watch in this modern day adaptation of Dr. Faustus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Brave (1997), starring Johnny Depp and Marlon Brando, serves to be an absorbing work of cinema for the intelligent audience. A modern take on Dr Faustus, The Brave presents the heart-wrenching tale of a poverty-stricken American Indian family of four (father, mother, and two children) living in a small trailer next to a garbage dump. The father, who is only recently released from the jail, is offered the chance to star as a victim in a snuff film--a motion picture genre that depicts the actual murder of a person or people without the aid of special effects. He quickly realizes that he is worthless to his family alive. On the contrary, if he accepts the offer then his family will be paid a sum of US$50,000. After accepting the advance, he is granted a week's time to be with his family before fulfilling the terms of the agreement. Johnny Depp not only directs the film but also co-writes the screenplay in collaboration with his brother. The movie features some of the most haunting scenes ever filmed in cinema, which allow the viewers to reflect on their own lives. And the real beauty of the movie is that the violence is only implicit (those on the look out out for excesses of sex and violence might be disappointed). The Brave highlights in the most poignant manner the perpetual plight of the American natives residing in the US, something that Marlon Brando vociferously raised his voice against at several junctures in his career (he even refused to accept the Best Actor Oscar for his role in The Godfather). The movie features just one scene between Brando and Depp, but that scene is magical in so many ways. First, Brando's speech on life, death and sacrifice is mesmerizing to say the least. Second, Depp's facial expressions remind the viewer of the Brando of old. Third, it's one of Brando's final few screen presences... every second of his screen-time is worth cherishing. Fourth, the fact that the two characters are eternally connected despite having very little in common. The movie's improvisation on Dr. Faustus is worth appreciating: here the protagonist is willing to give away his life (as oppose to his soul) for a gain that's purely pecuniary in nature (as oppose to knowledge). It pretty much sums up the modern society's preference for money over knowledge. Another facet that makes the movie important and appealing is that despite being a Hollywood product, it has a strong indie feel associated with it. The credit for which should go to the Depp brothers. The arresting performances from Brando and Depp lift the movie above mediocrity despite its weak direction and average performances from the support cast. So, if you are looking for something different and thought-provoking to break your daily routine of watching banal, mindless Hollywood-like films then The Brave will surely succeed in titillating your senses.For more, please visit:http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is depressing and unpleasant. You've got be very brave to watch this movie beginning to end.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by, co-written by and starring Johnny Depp, this movie is not for the faint of heart, but the brave few who can stand this movie. That's if you can find it. This movie is rare and hard to find in the states. Since Depp was deeply upset at the negative reviews received from the American critics attending an otherwise successful screening at the Cannes Film Festival. As a result he has refused to show the film in the United States. This movie is too gloomy and hard to watch in my opinion. It just a film that commit suicide by having a protagonist didn't even went out fighting or anything. It seems to me that he had several ways to get out of the deal in the end of the movie. Johnny Depp starts as Raphael, a Native American man who love his wife and family, but in desperate for a job and money living in a cycle of poverty environment. Rather than trying to exit his environment, acknowledge his barriers like his criminal record and dealt with his alcoholism. He doesn't try set realistic goals to get his family on the right track, but instead seek the easy way out by cowardly commit suicide in the oddest way, by having himself kill for a snuff film. This movie isn't uplifting, entertaining, or have some type of positive message. It's just a depression film of a man who lost all hope and agrees to participate in a snuff film trading his life for a large sum of money so that his wife and two kids can lead a decent life. He strikes a deal with McCarthy (Marlon Brando) and has one week to live. Since Raphael often absent presence in the life of his wife and children, he tries his best to make the time with them as great as possible. Imminent death affords Depp the chance to finally be a responsible father and husband and enjoy what left of his life. The story sprang from a 1991 novel by Gregory McDonald, best known as the man behind the long-running, lighthearted comedy 'Fletch' series. Many details were changed in the film version from the novel with the same name. I think the movie might have gone over a bit better if it had stuck closer to the source material. The movie even has a lot of missing scenes in some DVD versions out there. In a bootleg version of the film. The bad guy created a stigmata by driving a stake through his hand, just in case anyone in the audience misses the parallels between Raphael and Jesus. The main different was that the film tries too hard to makes Raphael look like a post-modern Jesus archetype, by having him sacrificing himself for his family, but he actually ended up looking like a loser doing it. Jesus didn't commit suicide because he was depress, alcoholic, and trying to earn money through that way. Jesus was sentenced by a court to die, Jesus purpose was to redeem humanity, while Raphael just gives up and lets the bad guys just kill him for no cause besides trusting a snuff filmmaker to provide his family after his death. Who knew that trusting snuff filmmakers is better than trusting, I don't know, your family. In no way toward the end of the film, does the bad guys get punish for their crimes, nor does he take steps to fight for his life. For having second billing Marlon Brando is barely in this film, sadly. Most of his scenes are just him rambling about life and death. Honestly, I didn't get what he was blathering on about but I'm pretty sure he or his henchmen Larry (Marshall Bell) barely explains the snuff film. The DVD box cover explains it more than the film. There is a scene, where the sadistic henchman Larry talks more about pooping while threating Raphael to keep to his promise to McCarthy. Are we supposed to take these bad guys serious? The movie goes a great lengths to be a smart film. I do like all the symbolisms examples like the face with the question mark, the way he is looking at his family while the background get dark, tribal drums playing over a long pan from imposing, oppressively sun baked mountains, etc. There were some really odd scenes like a man who runs around in what appears to be a giant hamster wheel and spends quality time fondling a goat that doesn't help the story. While it's beautifully photographed; it should have use the time to shines more on the immense poverty that thousands of Native Americans continue to face and how they can overcome it. Rather, we get a very slow paced story of death. If the audience knows if he will die in the end, and then why watch this film. What was the point of it all? Is it that when your wife and kids need you the most, it's okay if you volunteer to get tortured and killed for a snuff movie? It's pure nonsense to think that anyone would behave like Raphael do. It's totally unreal. Sorry, but the story is rather far-fetched. I think his family would rather have a father, than money. Overall: People, who advocate this movie, may say that the movie is about how much a man is willing to do in order to save his family. But he doesn't save his family, he gets himself killed for fast money. The Brave? I think this movie should be renamed, the Coward. Rafael took the coward way out. He could have lived and took the challenge of beginning a new life with his family. He chose to sacrifice himself to please evil man's desire. There is nothing beautiful about this mess.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I agree with those that say, that this is a good story. It's like a Twilight Zone episode. In the beginning, one is intrigued and guessing what will happen but then that breaks down, and it doesn't seem to be fantasy anymore. It just seems like we don't really believe in the story or the characters anymore. Why would any of them act like that? Seriously, I really think Rod Serling could have gotten some great stuff out of this, apparently, Hostel-like story and setup. The subject of snuff-movies is an epic theme, but this way of telling the story is just so weak that we lose interest. Still it is a lot more interesting than the average movie, and clearly Johhny Depp is a talented director but he should really have thought some more about creating some excitement in this story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Think of many underrated movies out there. "Chaplin", with Robert Downey Jr. Martin Scorscese's "Kundun". Kevin Smith's "Chasing Amy". Or Troy Duffy's "Boondock Saints"."The Brave", based on the novel by Gregory McDonald, is among them. Why the critics at Cannes... canned this film, I will never understand. This film should have been released in the United States, and everywhere else around the world, for it is a sensitive drama that truly shows what an artist Johnny Depp is.Raphael's (or is it Rafael? I'm not sure) love for his family compels him to sign on to star in a 'snuff movie'. For those not in the know, it means he will be killed on camera for money. He hopes this money will be enough to bring his family out of poverty. He takes care of everything in his life before following the trail to his doom.For a first-time director, Johnny Depp does a better job than many big-time directors (Michael Bay? Are you paying attention?). The score by Iggy Pop also helps the film move along. And it's gripping finale outshines other classic endings, like "Planet of the Apes" or "The Sixth Sense".This is easily among my Top 100 Movies of all-time. It's far better than many classic movies and current films around. So if the reason behind its unfair dismissal by film critics is justified, then show me the flaws. Because I can't find any.10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice try, Johnny! But not enough...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For anyone who's followed Johnny Depp's career it was pretty interesting to watch his first movie as a film director. The story he chose dealt with an Indian-Mexican-whatever (it's not very precise) that's gonna make a big sacrifice for his family. What kind of sacrifice? Well, you'll have to watch "The Brave" to know it, 'cause thats the movie's main secret. They're poor, they live in a place that looks like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre farm... Everything's so tough. One of Depp's biggest mistakes was not to give a normal personality to any of the characters. They're all so eccentric, they're all freaks, and that makes the story a little bit unbelievable. He shouldn't had played the main character, because he looks more like a "cock-rocker" than like a wretched Indian native. Besides, the script has no rhythm at all, and it's quite irregular. In short: "The brave" is not as bad as all the critics think, and we have to thank Depp for trying to make a different cinema, so influenced by his friends Jarmusch or Kusturica. But he's not Jarmusch, he's a great actor, not a director. Anyway, this was his first try... Let's give him a break. *My rate: 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brave, The (1997) * (out of 4) Johnny Depp's directorial debut is a film I've been dying to see since I first heard about it back around 1996. In the film Depp plays an American Indian who can't get a job due to being a drunk and this doesn't leave much of a future for his wife and two children. Somehow he is introduced to a man (Marlon Brando) who offers his $50,000 to be tortured and killed in a snuff film. With no other future in site the man takes the job. There's been all sorts of reasons why this film was never released in America. I've heard stories of Depp being mad at American critics who trashed the film in Cannes and I've heard the storyline was just too depressing for release here. I think the real reason is that the film is simply a piece of junk. Since Depp was director, star and co-writer he certainly has to take the majority of the blame. The film has a terrific storyline but he doesn't do a thing with it and in the end the film is simply a mess. Everyone delivers their lines at such a slow and drawn out way that had they sped it up just 1% then I'm sure the film would have lost an hour of its running time. The performances are also dull and that includes Brando. I might sound like George here but this film has gotten a lot of great reviews from fans but to me it sounds like people love this film just because it has a foreign, non-Hollywood feel to it. Add in the fact that he didn't get released and they seem to be hailing this as some sort of masterpiece that "normal folks" can't "get". I think Depp is an incredibly talented guy but you wouldn't know it by watching this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Vincent Gallo with "Brown Bunny" Marlin Brando with "One-Eyed Jacks" Dennis Hopper with "The Last Movie" Jack Nicholson with " Drive, He Said" Tim Carey with "The World's Greatest Sinner" Ed Norton with "Keeping the Faith" Jodie Foster with "Little Man Tate" Kevin Spacey with "Albino Alligator"All of these are similar actors who make huge mistakes in misunderstanding cinematic vision. All of these choose to act from the inside out, so they don't understand how to build a long form composition from a visual vocabulary. You can start many places in building a film, but rarely does it work to start with a inner performance. (Rarely, "Bunny" worked because he had those two clever twists at the end that restructured what went before.)Sean Penn, alone in this class knows what to do. His "The Pledge" is one of the purest performance experiences I know, together with his similar collaboration with Woody Allen in "Sweet and Lowdown." In both those, the director knew how to shrinkwrap the cinema around the performance because the single performances (Nicholson, Penn respectively) were not of a character, but a range of characters.If this weren't Depp, it wouldn't be so amazing that it lacks imagination. That's because time and time again Depp as an actor shows that he understands a creative director's cinematic structure and how he fits in. And not just one type of approach; he has collaborated with a wide variety of visions from the synthetic to the abstract, through folded and flat, annotated and straight. And gosh, take a look at the sets. They were designed with such amazing richness and possibilities by an eastern European creative team that understands circus. And then not leveraged in the slightest by Depp.Much has been made of Brando's manner through his career, especially the notion that he needs a strong director who will force not only a deep performance, but will indicate the slots for him to fill in the greater composition. I'm not sure about that; I see him trying amazing things even when in otherwise lazy movies.Brando and Depp were friends and had worked together before. Its unsettling that Brando's work here seems unintegrated with anything else in the project, not even the world of Depp's character.I hate to agree with the conventional wisdom that this is a poor film, an unsuccessful Jesus parable. I come to these primarily to get another window into the soul of a valued actor. Some of his performances have mattered to me, and I believe no actor can be rich without being a rich person.Well, he may be rich, but he lacks a rich compositor's eye.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Promising, Implausible and then Mediocre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On behalf of the movie-going public with at least a shred of intelligence, I would like to thank Johnny Depp for making this his one-and-only directing effort. What could have been a powerful story was ruined by totally implausible actions on behalf of several characters. Depp's character decides to spend the money paid for his life on a sort of shanty-town fun park, for example, rather than taking down Brando's character and his flunky, and then fleeing somewhere with the cash. Brando was almost painful to watch, it's horrible to see an old actor past his prime. Perhaps it would have been useful to stop trying to make a point and start thinking about what characters would really do. Also, the actions of the priest seem totally wrong. Watch the movie and I'm sure you will agree. The ending was similarly silly, and the only thing making this movie remotely watchable was Johnny Depp's performance. I'll give him, the man can act, though he should leave directing to someone, ANYONE, else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, Bad, Ugly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*CONTAINS SPOILERS*First the good. The Brave, written and directed by Johnny Depp, had its moments. Somewhere among all the long, unnecessary diversions, beat the heart of a truly meaningful movie; the core conflict of which is the same as Death of a Salesman: What does a man do when he thinks he's worth more dead than alive? That the movie actually grappled with this question is to its credit.Now the bad. What the heck was going on with all the bizarre characters in the garbage dump village? Terry Gilliam influence? The two main aspects of this movie (the core conflict and the secondary characters) didn't fit together at all. Editing about 20 minutes out of the garbage dump village sequences would've been addition by subtraction, IMHO. More screen time for Brando would've helped, too. Finally, the ugly. This movie made me want to take a bath. Depp wears essentially the same clothes throughout the week-long time frame (he does change shirts once). Hot, sweaty, no running water...I guess that added to the atmosphere of why he wanted to get his family out. The Brave has to be in contention for the least amount of greenery on film ever. Other than the one neighbor's grass garden, there is hardly another living plant anywhere. Special kudos to Iggy Pop for the excellent scoring. Fantastic music throughout; very spare and earthy: tribal drums, wooden flutes, etc. I'm going to seek out the soundtrack.Final score: 6/10. Depp's direction was good, I thought. The love scene b/n his character and the wife felt real; even more so because "it" happened only once. But, the central conflict: accepting money to be killed for entertainment, could've been explored more deeply. I didn't even understand that was the deal until the 90-minute mark when Depp confesses to the priest. More focus, less weirdness...but all in all not a bad flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When this came on Tasmanian television, (oh yes) I did have some misgivings about staying up late to watch it. Then the "directed by Johnny Depp" came on and I thought....boy if Brando wasn't in this I am off to bed. But I sat up, watched it, and it one of those films that stays with you. The horror and the torture come later, and it is awful to think of this brave young man subjecting himself to these monsters, but that is the lure of the story I guess. Perfect casting by Depp, cant argue with the direction or the story. It's bleak but somehow beautiful at the same time. Yes it shows the best and worst of humanity. Not something to watch with the family on a movie night, but it does deserve an audience...you will not enjoy it but you will remember it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Miniature Disneyland</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an artist Johnny Depp has long been known for having occasionally quirky film projects, some have gotten good critical acclaim and some have even gained great public acclaim, the Pirates Of The Caribbean series have had enormous commercial success. But with The Brave he came up a cropper as the film comes across as terribly self indulgent.It was an interesting idea, a man so desperate and feeling so useless and alienated from society that the best thing he can do for himself is offer his body for sacrifice. Now there isn't an insurance company in the world who would finance something like what Depp has in mind. He needs some up front money.Which comes in the large form of Marlon Brando who in a 15 minute scene with Depp offers $50,000.00 in cash to be the victim in a snuff film. Now that's something that requires a lot of up front money.After which Depp starts to spread it around among friends and family and the best part of the film is his re-creation of a miniature Disneyland type park in the trailer park where his American Indian family reside. One of his relatives Luis Guzman suspects that Depp's new found largess comes from some criminal activity. Let's just say that Guzman forces many issues.The setting of the American Indian reservation was a good choice as the poverty in many of those reservations is a well documented fact. No place better than that could show desperation and lack of options. Depp has a minor criminal record. I've seen how that has locked people out from jobs who aren't Indians.Sad to say that Johnny Depp overplayed this film though. It goes down in his work legacy as a noble experiment that sadly misfired.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Depp's Directorial Debut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Johnny Depp is one of the finest actors of Hollywood and I appreciate his attempt in directing. However, the final outcome of 'The Brave' is halfbaked. The film itself is quite boring with only a few notable sequences. The plot feels contrived, even though there's hardly anything going on most of the time. The cinematography is good in places. The dialogues are ineffective. Given the limited budget, the film does look slightly poor on the technical side but this is a very minor flaw. The music is pleasant to the ears but the use of it could have been toned down for more effect. The acting is very stagy. Marlon Brando fails to convince. Depp isn't bad but this is nowhere near any of his best works. There is good chemistry between him and Elpidia Carrillo. He has chosen a difficult story to direct but he does succeed in a few parts. He tries to use subtlety but ends up doing too much of it and as a result it's ineffective. Perhaps it would have been a wiser choice to direct something a little lighter and simpler.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fantastic showing of an amazing talent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A while ago i was looking through my on-line rental list and i got recommended a film i had not heard of before called The Brave,the only details i could find is that it stars and was directed an co-written by Johnny Depp.So i picked it to rent,and i was very pleased to see that this is a fantastic film,and its a real shame that Depp has not directed again: The Plot: Depp plays an American Indian named Raphael,Raphael finds out the very run-down area where he and his family live,is going to get bulldozed over soon,so Raphael-who has a very "troubled" past,feels he has to do everything he can to get enough money so his family can move from the area.He goes to a old ware-house,where he is told he could get $50,000 for being in a snuff film (that will show him getting tortured and killed)Raphael accepts the offer,hes then told he has one week to sort everything in his life out,before he is murdered.But when a drug dealer hears about this,he tells Raphel that he will kill his wife and kids when he dies.So Raphel decides to take action..View on the Film: The person i must highlight is Johnny Depp.While Depp is known for doing very loud characters,he does a very different turn here.Here he seems to be a very somber person,and thought he is flawed- you do feel sympathy for him.Depp also does a great job at at showing someone who feels that death is tied to his legs.As a director Depp shows that if this was not sadly the only film he did,the he would be really special.The film has a very "elegiant" feel,that can proudly be put next to the films of Terrrnce Malick.He also does well when a part in the film that involves violence (thankfully not the Snuff film) he makes sure its not seen as a gore-hound and that you understand why Raphel is taking this action,and he does a very classy love-making scene,that puts most directors to shame.Final view on the Film: A truly amazing film,thats extremely under-rated,with fantastic acting and directing from Depp.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Brave Deserves No Fair...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I begin to think no actor should be allowed to direct a movie he or she appears in or writes or co-writes, except perhaps for Kenneth Branagh and even then only if it's Shakespeare..."The Brave" had for me an extremely unpleasant aftertaste. It's a ham-handed bummer of a story, right enough---oooooh, allegory! An Indian family living in a garbage dump picking over the trash, wow, that means they're like, you know, the castoffs of American society, how DEEP is Depp---heavvvvy, man...Much as I like and admire Johnny Depp, and however valid his points may be, as I watched this film unfold at a pace that would make glaciers seem like Secretariat, I found myself totally unable to suspend my disbelief that (a) the character of Rafael would agree to be snuffed for money to save his family, (b) that he'd squander most of the payoff on a sort of garbage-dump fun fair for the kiddies, and (c) that he wouldn't just blow away the go-between and the Marlon Brando characters, take the money and his family and go live in a suburb of Baltimore or somewhere.But Johnny Depp is certainly worth watching, and he does some nice stuff. Brando? Just appalled me...what a wreck. Absolutely, painfully unwatchable. The young actors who play Rafael's kids are gorgeous and unaffected, and the omnipresent Floyd Red Crow Westerman is always a hoot.Oh yes, Clarence Williams III as Father Link! Well, again with the suspension of disbelief: no priest in his right mind would let even a nonparishioner go off to blithely allow himself to be slaughtered. Not only is it a sin, it's also, duh, a crime...So, for me not so much the believing any of these characters thing. The script jerked me around and never paid off really, the pacing was interminable (reminded me of somebody's UCLA student film), and all in all it seemed like just the sort of pretentious, half-baked art-swill that would earn itself a prize at some preening filmfest.And it left me with an annoyed, unsettled feeling after watching it that required yet another viewing of "Pirates of the Caribbean" to counteract. Or maybe "Chocolat."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>heavy-handed morality play</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a great concept...and what a mediocre movie showcasing it. Johnny Depp plays a man who agrees to be tortured and murdered for a $50,000 settlement to his family. I suppose I should've been aware of it sooner, but about halfway through I knew the movie would show little, if any, of the actual torture/murder (and I was right). Unfortunately, "The Brave" suffers from an overlong running time and a plodding pace, as well as unnecessary bursts of comic relief from a caricatured supporting cast. Other characterizations are erratic and underdeveloped. The best scenes belong to Marlon Brando (as the wheelchair-bound man who "hires" Depp) and Clearance Williams III (who shares a very powerful confessional scene with Depp), both of whom are given precious little screen time. "The Brave" is a sometimes-compelling morality play with a brooding mood, yet unbalanced and seldom rising above average.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>White male creepy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an altogether creepy replication of the inner states of mind that perpetuate themselves in class society. The notion that one should submit to all sorts of violent and humiliating forms of inner degradation which rob you of your life in order to support your family is experienced, in conventional society, as "the reality principle". The vulgar, self-indulgent and pointless, political, power-trip sadism of the bosses -- who are significantly, in this movie, decadent and repulsive, old, rich white men -- is reproduced with force. But then, it's a familiar scene to anyone familiar with certain religious doctrines: the father gives the son the power to do a miracle or two during his last days; but demands the ultimate sacrifice to pay for the "sins" of humanity, this time, not on a cross; but a medieval appearing torture chair, looking very much like a tool from some forgotten Inquisition. Indeed, the seller must pay the price of the sale, even it that seller is a miserable wage-slave trying to create a little temporary happiness in a garbage strewn world, gone to the dogs.The problem with this movie is that it makes you feel more than a bit ill inside and out. You know, at some level, that a parent's sacrificial lamb-like suicide for their child will not help to give their kids a life but will emotionally destroy the next generation and on ad infinitum, by leaving most of humanity with internal psychological scar and legacy which is masochism.Depp plays a Native American in the movie, a brave so to speak. And, he does have courage. He faces death at the hands of his employer. But, in this reviewer's opinion, this brave should have seen a better ending--with the death of the employer, not the implied death of the wage-slave; for in taking that path, a brave only ensures that the poor will always be with us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See it for Brando's five minutes (magic), but as a whole it fails.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very mixed-up movie, which just doesn't come off at the end. Its an unusual, dark, story about a man who decides to sell his life to a strange man (played by Brando in a very moving, electric five minute cameo, the only real reason to see this movie - its about twenty minutes in) in exchange for a sum of money which will be used to give shanty-town-dwelling family a better life. The people at Cannes, or some such film festival, went for it and gave it a prize - but i'm not so sure i agree. It takes risks, by being weird and unconventional, but it does so in an empty way. It sacrifices having a real emotional centre, and most of it simply doesn't follow. The character-motivations do not all link up. Like, if Depp's character gave his life for this money, why does he p*** it away on a widescreen TV and other niknaks which may make the audience go "wow, that's what money buys" but in terms of practicality for the poor girls who have to miss out on an education and a good home, i didn't think it made sense at all. I think Johnny Depp is a class act, a superb actor, made all the more great for the fact that he's not scared to play parts far removed from himself, and indulge in imitation and mimickry, something method actors are shy of, because there is little room to identify and feel your character, because the character is so different from yourself (how do you go about "feeling" the part of an invention with scissors for hands? Or Errol Flynn-cum-Keith Richards, or J.M Barrie? First, you have to be a sort of master-actor!). Having said all that, he's not especially good in this film. I think he was distracted by the worries of directing. Orson Welles' performances suffered for the same reasons in his Othello, Stranger and Lady from Shanghai. Its a tricky thing, directing yourself, and even a great director like Welles needed the perfect environment to be able to do it (such as Kane, Falstaff). With due respect to Johnny, and i think he knows it because he hasn't directed again, this should be his only directorial effort, like One Eyed Jacks for Brando.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pompous pseudo-brave film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everything in "The Brave" is somehow false. Slow storytelling and strained dramatisation with zero motivation for audience to care for characters is an awful combination. It's brave message about the status of native American minority is lost with a stupid plot of sacrificing oneself in a snuff film.If you watch only the first half an hour of "The Brave", you may be satisfied to see something thematic in hollowness of characters and in the situations they are introduced to audience. Even the short discussion with Marlon Brando is almost tolerable if you keep thinking this is just meta-criticism against conventions of film realism.Only if you keep on watching... and you see the director (Johnny Depp) concentrating to his own character (Raphael) as a victim AND as a hero, you begin to see that there's another level of ethnic exploitation in these kind of indie films.In a proper drama the characters are used to enhance each others qualities. With main actor also directing all attention is focused to his character, but mr Depp is not able to express what's happening inside his character during the oppressive and violent situations.A stout, withdrawn character of an Indian with criminal background is a good choice for a director-actor who is used to do simple caricatures in Burton-fantasies - and even this is too much for mr Depp. Admittedly he is much more comfortable presenting ethnic antihero in "The Lone Ranger" than recycling an ethnic hero making ethnic love in ethnic sunset with an ethnic beauty (Elpidia Carrillo). YAWN! "The Brave" is so far the only long feature film Johnny Depp has directed and I truly hope it will also be the last one.</fullReview>

There was not a word spoken for so much of the beginning of the movie, but we already had a sense of the character emerging before us, and the desperation he was facing.I watched the impending doom of the finale with such a heavy heart. A husband and father who had remained incredibly distant to those close to him ... (probably due to the desperation of the circumstances, and his feeling that he could not be there for them without providing) become so intensely sensitive and present to them, only to face the ironic and inevitable choice he had made to protect them. The plight of these disadvantaged people was immensely painful, yet the joy they got from the simple things was so touching.The scenery, whilst not pretty by any means, only added to the depression and desperation. The soundtrack was perfect in all scenes, and the ending scene was just as it should have been ...Mr Depp ... your talent is boundless ... and you should not shy away from producing, directing and writing - simply because of some who obviously could not see the big picture of this simply understated movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Depp reaches an excellent metaphor of the economic system in which we live. The main issue: the exchange of a human life for money; the exchange of happiness for plastic items; the exchange of a beloved one for some material security; the opportunism of those who see in the human needs, an opportunity of profit, are poetically powerful and striking on this film. Beyond the ethnic level of the film, which might be a bit overrepresented and idealized, this is a great film. No wonder that some people in the USA are still not prepared for such a challenging artistic an philosophical confrontation with the reality of their own culture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i find it extremely saddening this movie has not been shown in the united states, though i understand johnny depp's refusal to show it due to negative reviews. in my humble opinion it must take a seriously incompetent critic to say anything bad about this movie. i feel truly fortunate to have seen it while vacationing in europe, even though the movie is so profoundly disturbing...like a great piece of art that touches you in the deepest places and leaves you feeling bewildered... johnny depp is at the top of my list - i always enjoy seeing his performances. his magnetism, charisma and "just something so different about him" stretch far beyond of what any other actors possess - well, at least in my book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Depp try's his hand at directing and makes a solid if strange film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considering this was Johnny Depp's directorial debut you have to cut the movie some slack. I didn't know what to think going into this movie i'm somewhat of a Depp fan and him playing an Indian with a death wish sounded interesting to me, so i bought a 0 region DVD (plays anywhere) off ebay since you can't get this movie in the states. It starts kind of slowly and doesn't explain itself in the beginning and when it ended i really wished the film was about a half an hour longer (i wanted to see what would happen next) but overall i thought it was a pretty good if flawed movie. Depp acts just as good as he always does, and Marlon Brando in a very very short but important role is about as good as you would hope considering his lack of roles in the last decade of his life. Iggy pop's music is great unlike Neil Young's in Depp's Indian related film from 1996, Dead Man. I gave the film an 8 but that rating is slightly inflated because i have to give Depp credit for trying out the director's chair in a violent and very different movie. If you're a big Depp fan or like strange movies, you might want to consider checking this one out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I regret that this movie was never released in the U.S.; I had to buy a Korean release to get to see it. But, it was SO worth it! The movie is very moving - a great work by Johnny Depp. Those of us who have always appreciated Johnny for his unique vision on the world as brought to life in so many of his characters will revel in Rafael. The work as Director is superb, especially as a first effort. The score and cinematography are sublime....this is one of those that got away...and was (sadly) missed by many. But, as Johnny said in the special features interview, whether the movie is well-received or not well-received, it is totally "his movie, and no one can take that away from him." Bravo! Well-done, Johnny!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>apart from questions that have become clichés but which no one cares to answer, -such as "why should native Americans live in reservations when the whole land have belonged to them more than it did to others"- the movie questions how much you can sacrifice in the name of significant others, or even thoughts and beliefs, for those things that you believe are your truths. a sad, sad movie.. it has a very cruel and touching end. it is so merciless that it moves you and grows in you. it does not seek to gain recognition and attention through emotional appeal.. it just tells you what happens.. it is for them to tell and for you to figure out what's between the lines, so why not do a little brainstorming and have your share?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie because I loved the premise. I still do, but unfortunately the execution was poor. I felt like this movie was released before it was ready, that it still needed further refinement. It has several scenes that do nothing to meaningfully develop the plot or characters, and one or two plot lines that go nowhere. I liked the character of Johnny Depp's ex-partner in crime, but I didn't see the point of the plot thread involving him. Also, the movie progresses at a snail's pace. Ostensibly, the movie chronicles a week in the protagonist's life. It must be the longest week anyone has ever lived! This movie should have been at least a half-hour shorter. I can think of at least half a dozen scenes that could have been painlessly dumped. And the ending felt like a cop-out.The movie was atmospheric, which I liked. It's unfortunate Johnny Depp didn't spend more time polishing this movie, because it had potential.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well as a BIG Depp fan I was eager to sit down and watch my brand spanking new copy of The Brave.We all know that Johnny is prone to some interesting and outlandish roles full of moody shots and long silences however this film, that Depp himself directed, goes one step too far.The film plot develops at snail pace and by the time something notable happens I was really past caring. The problem for this film is that from the initial opener, setting the scene of a potentially exciting story, to the climatic ending you have to watch an hour of lethargic deep and meaningful nonsense in the middle which is neither deep nor meaningful.Depp appears to almost play a parody of his own broody persona becoming an annoying caricature of himself at best.I believe that JD is an awesome performer and has great integrity as an actor which has been displayed many times by his choice of roles. However this film also makes it evident that it is perhaps best if Johnny leaves the direction to others to ensure we see the best of him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's a lot of actors directing films these days. Maybe it's because they get payed so much? However this is not like those films usually are: theatrical and focusing on acting. Depp seems more interested in the atmosphere and landscapes. He tries to make a real movie, a low budget indie film, and I think that's quite sympathetic. The film's not a masterpiece, but it has it's moments. I'm glad I saw it.But what's wrong with men really? It seems like an awfully old fashioned idea that their main task is to "provide for their family". Even with sacrificing their own lives? And that's "brave"?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Interesting, Original Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A down-on-his-luck American Indian (Johnny Depp) recently released from jail is offered the chance to "star" as the victim of a snuff film...I should first say that I watched the Korean important version, which has over 20 minutes cut from the full version. I am unclear how much difference this makes, but it does seem to create a minor continuity problem here or there. I would gladly watch it again in the full version just to see what I missed.This film captured the 1990s. The darkness, the nihilism. Surely not everyone approached the 90s this way, but industrial music was at its peak, and films like "Seven" and the works of Tim Burton were at the forefront of popular culture...Casting Johnny Depp as an Indian was debatable, of course, as he only vaguely looks the part. But he does bring a certain star power to the film that probably gets it noticed by more people this way. And if Marlon Brando could be Mexican in "Viva Zapata", why can Depp not be Indian here? (In fairness, his great-grandmother was Cherokee, so it is not completely a fabrication... just mostly.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>years ago i met with the producers of THE BRAVE as the possibilty of being the costume designer in the early stages of getting the film together. i had already been sent the script to read which i always prefer to do before meeting for an interview. when i sat down to discuss the film and its very disturbing subject they said that johnny depp was interested in playing the lead.at the time of this interview there had not yet been a director attached.i remember asking then why they felt the need to make this film.the script i read was very different from the finished film.in the original draft when depp's character meets the man doing the hiring, which in the film is brando, there was a very long disturbing discription as to what they were going to do to him once tied to that chair, which is prominently displayed in the film. it was a told in graphic detail , step by step, as to the torture . it is to depp's credit that as the director he deleted this. on the whole the film is beautifully made , very well acted , but i must ask , why were there so many shots with peoples heads cut off in long shots. it was so well shot in general that these moments where the composition faltered was very disappointing. i kept changing the format from wide screen to all the other choices my tv has to offer and in all formats heads went off the top of the screen. very sloppy for such a well made film. depp certainly has a gift as a director but needs to find a new camera operator should he ever direct another film. i was very impressed by the work in general ,it was better than i had expected.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Dr Faustus" with an American Indian twist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Brave" is a film based on an interesting variation of the Dr Faustus theme of selling your soul for immediate gain--in this case, pecuniary gain for an American Indian living off a garbage dump.Obviously Mr Brando would find the American Indian's social and political plight close to his heart. Depp, the director, makes the social statement in a heavy handed way--the sun scorching on a pile of rubbish that seems to be last frontier for the American native living in the US at the end of the twentieth century. It is a hard life, and "the Brave" knows that he cannot have a bright future for his two kids and wife living in a ramshackle caravan. Yet the modern "Brave" looks wistfully at new houses being built for those have the money from the bus he takes to town and makes a "brave" decision to sell his soul/body.This is not a film one would expect Hollywood to make. It has a thorough "independent" flavor to it. The brothers Depp who wrote the story are probably looking at parallels to the American Indian psyche over centuries: honesty (the Brave keeps his word), family values (the Brave gives his life for the sake of his family), strong religiosity (he trusts the Christian priest and gives him the responsibility of ensuring the family gets the money, suggestions of crucifixion, etc.). This is what the Brando character with tears in his eyes recognizes in the Brave.This is a clean film--no gratuitous violence or sex abound. Instead you are provided some interesting reflective statements on life, death and sacrifice with lucre as the underpinning force. It is an honest film that reminds you of "Billy Jack" minus the sex and violence.What makes the film weak is the direction. I was amused to see the priest with his sacramental vestments on the street watching Depp the actor proceed on his final journey. Depp the director seems to love adopting cinematic statements that were popular in the Sixties and Seventies, e.g., the final journey, the closed warehouse with lifts to heaven/hell, etc. Johnny Depp is good as an actor, but he is out of his depth as a director. What is creditable is the music by Iggy Pop and co., which blends with the film's philosophy. The performances are about average (Luis Guzman, Frederick Forrest, Elpida Corrillo) and even the kids look real. Brando and Depp are, of course, a delight to watch.I wonder why Depp made this film. Was it just because his brother wrote the story? Does he identify with the American Indian? Is he religious? Or was the story important for Depp at a difficult period in his life? Actor Richard Burton chose to direct "Dr Faustus" with himself in the main role. The effort was great drama which few appreciated. But then Depp is not in the same league as Burton.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an allegory. It is (not yet) so that the rich needs the poor in order to prepare themselves for death, allthough Canetti in his book "Masse und Macht" does make a point of the survivor experiencing intensed life in the presence of the death of others. It is not so in general or in often observed cases. It is maybe more so tomorrow than today....(well maybe you get what I'm driving at - if not, you will not understand the rest anyway). So, let's pretend it's just an allegory and not the reinstitution of the master being buried with all his slaves. As allegory it functions perfectly: If the poor does not do anything about the rich and continues battling each other in hope of getting rich themselves instead of siding with each other against the common enemy (united we stand and divided we get it up the...)then they can expect allmost anything from guys who think it's OK that they have or own a million times more than their fellow men, the allegory here being that the only interest the rich have in the poor is what use they can make of them for their own purposes - the poor, with a purpose of their own, do not exist for the rich, who, of course, don't care about 's-t' like that.</fullReview>

The scene of the room where Johnny is to be killed the music contains sounds of an actually pig having its throat cut. The pig squeals with the sound of true death. it is disturbing.

		<fullReview>THE BRAVE (3 outta 5 stars) Bear in mind that this review is based on an incomplete version of the film which was missing 25 minutes in the middle. However, I doubt that those 25 minutes will affect my rating much anyway... so here goes. Johnny Depp plays a down-on-his-luck Native American/Mexican (yes, it is a bit of a stretch... but just go with it) who makes a deal with an eccentric movie producer to star in a "snuff film". Depp gets some money in advance and gets one last week to spend with his family before the movie starts shooting. They live on the outer edges of a huge garbage dump. Raphael (Depp) figures that the money he makes from doing the film will be enough for his family to move away and find themselves a real home. To explain his newfound wealth, Depp tells the rest of the town that he got a new warehouse job but they wonder why he is so reluctant to help anybody else get on there. It's a very slow-paced movie and never got released in North America. (It is currently only available as an import... many of which, apparently, have a 25 minute section missing in the middle. Honestly, if I hadn't noticed that the film was only 91 minutes long instead of the promised 118 and gone to investigate some IMDb threads I would never have noticed scenes were missing. The movie still seems to flow well... even though it does seem too short.) Nice try by Depp (who also directed) but the movie doesn't quite have the power of the novel it was adapted from.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes thoughts and ideas are not well or incompletely expressed, and this is what, in my opinion, happened to Johny Depp when he made this film. Personally I believe that Depp, as the director and main actor of the film, wanted to reflect the living conditions of the American Indians, their problems and difficulties, and the way they must solve them. However, the plot does not convince everyone about a solution of a suicide in a film shot. Perhaps other ways of looking for solutions, also risky, should have been a better proposal and more believable to everyone. However, the film showed some morale of the Indians in confrontation with Christian believes. Justice should be always compatible with religion. If this goes the other way around, in such a case it would be better not follow it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers! Heard about the 'trickle down effect', which is the capitalist only defense for their system. It means, that when the rich get rich enough for not knowing what to do with their money, they will have to spend some of it on the poor and so prosperity will come to the poor as well. In other words: We, the poor, should stand patiently aside and wait for the rich to get rich enough, so that they, between farts, can think of letting us take care of some petty cash they do not need. This kind of action from the side of the poor, is not advisable, if you look on this film correctly. You see, the rich will always find something to spend their money on besides the poor and should they ever get the idea to do so anyway, then they could do like the character of Marlon Brando in this film - letting the poor get killed in front of them in exchange for money given to the relatives of the poor. This is of course a 'trickle down effect' but maybe not a 'trickle down effect' that can be sold to the poor without some risk.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As tasteful as the pictures come along, the movie lacks suspense and action almost totally. The main plot is revealed practically at the beginning, without any further or in-depth explanation, and once set on this theme, the movie evolves around the consequences of the hero's initial decision. Live conditions of the slum-inhabitants sometimes seem presented pretty superficially, and several scenes ("six flags" in one night, by one man, on a disposal site in the desert) simply seem ridiculous. Overall, I found that the movie failed to mediate the probably intended pathetic mood and just left me hoping for an original end to wake me up, which never came.</fullReview>
