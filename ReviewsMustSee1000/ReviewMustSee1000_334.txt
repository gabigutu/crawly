		<shortDescription>The real Hoffa and the reel Hoffa</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Riddle Hoffa was probably one of the most enigmatic union leaders in this history of our country. As an important labor organizer during the over the road trucker strikes in the 1930s, he accomplished many things that made possible the emergence of the Teamsters Union as a major political force for several decades afterward. At the same time, he fell into a trap that bedevils many a fighter who perceives her/himself as a "people's champion"- he convinced himself that he had to fight fire with fire, and in the end, it devoured him. Secondly, Hoffa did not have the money, the support or the political sophistication of a Robert Kennedy. This'll finish you in the United States. Despite all our bombast about law and order, the country loves its shady political characters charming and slick, or the medicine show man, witness: Clinton, Reagan, Bush. The awkward and openly coarse need not apply, witness Nixon, Hoffa, Lott. David Mamet understands that, and that's why his version of Hoffa's life works. Mamet's Hoffa knows the Kennedy family built their fortune out of rum running to a large extent, and he sees no difference between their corruption and his own compromises. At least, Hoffa tells himself, his own deals with the devil serve something larger then his immediate family, they serve the membership of the union. And this was very true, which is why a fair number of Teamsters still swear by the name Jimmy Hoffa. Nicholson's snide asides to his "betters" completely captures the class war basis that motivated the actual man's actions. Anyone who has been through an actual labor dispute and has been witness to the patronizing communications that come through a company eager to crush a union effort knows full well what fired up Jimmy Hoffa, even as we turn aside from the path he took.The film succeeds because De Vito, Nicholson and Mamet understand what pushed the labor movement forward, and they understand its contradictions. Most important, they understand why those contradictions overwhelmed a man as gifted as Jimmy Hoffa, and this is what makes it better then your average Hollywood drama about labor. Hoffa is a film about working class attitude that gets beneath the usual dismissals of working class concerns, and as such, deserves respect. The powers that be have every legend about their leadership. It's time the working class was allowed legends about its own once again, provided we understand that they are legends, and therefore laden with much myth. The very real larger then life qualities of Jimmy Hoffa, however, make this a film worth more then one critical glance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this was a great film, and I stress the word "film" because so many people are critical of "Hoffa" due to its lack of total historical accuracy. Its a movie based on a historical figure ,not a historical biography. Creative license was used to portray a man that while corrupt, was necessary for the American labor movement at that time. Many people owe Jimmy Hoffa a great deal of gratitude for the advancements he made for the "Working Man". This is often lost today because Jimmy Hoffa ultimately went down, and as we all know Americans love a winner. Danny Devito and Jack Nicholson were great. The DVD is well worth its price and contains some great extras, including some actual footage of Jimmy Hoffa and Robert Kennedy at the hearings in the late 50's. 9 out of 10 .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should This Have Been Made?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While it is one of Nicholson's most challenging roles, as a viewer you find yourself more attached to director and co-star DeVito, who practically sunk every penny he owned into the making of this film. While the film did garner some Golden Globe nominations, altogether the film was a commercial and personal flop for all involved. The problem may have been that the world was not ready for this story. Nicholson is quite good as Hoffa, but one almost ignores the performance when you think of the personal attachment director DeVito had to the project. It is quite unfortunate because DeVito is interesting in a rare dramatic role. David Mamet did write a fine script and there is fine support from J.T.Walsh, Robert Prosky and Armand Assante.In ten years, this film will be a classic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Performance, Mediocre Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All too often Jack Nicholson just coasts and plays his stock character. Sometimes it's boring, occasionally it's insulting, but in "Hoffa" Nicholson puts aside the sneer and the leer and delivers a knockout performance. Although he doesn't really look that much like the Teamster boss, Nicholson captures the man's aura perfectly. It's more than just nailing the vocal rhythms and inflections or mastering Hoffa's body language, you feel Nicholson is conveying the inner man as well. This is truly a multi-dimensional interpretation and it's absolutely stunning.Unfortunately, the film is an inadequate showcase for Nicholson's talents. The story begins in 1975 on what presumably was the last day of Hoffa's life as he and his pal Bobby Ciaro (Danny DeVito) wait for some people to show up for a meeting at a Michigan roadhouse. They wait a long time which allows Bobby to recall many incidents in Hoffa's extraordinary career as a union organizer.There are two problems with this. First Bobby, who's supposed to be something of an enforcer, is never credible. Although he's nearly always in view, he never seems to belong. Perhaps that's because he's entirely a creation of screenwriter David Mamet. Barely adequate as a story-telling device, Bobby's unfortunate insertion gives rise to the inevitable, more serious question: how much of this story is true?If you accept Mamet's interpretation, Hoffa was a victim of a trusted associate, the Government, and the Mob, but foremost a hero because he fought for the working man. Fair enough. But when you watch "Hoffa" you don't really get a clear sense of why all this was so. Motivations are largely absent. The flashbacks pass by but you feel these are merely sketches or outlines, often presented without clear context. Some are believable, others seem to be mere speculation, still others, such as the scenes with Robert Prosky or the enormous riot sequence, implausible. Was Prosky's character real? Did so many people actually die? Ask Bobby, because in many ways it's as much his story as Hoffa's; but as we know, Bobby is pure fiction. Mamet has been quoted as saying audiences look more for drama than for information. Fine, and who'd want to see Ken Burns' take on the Teamsters. But "Hoffa", for all its huffing and puffing, lacks the drama of Paul Schrader's "Blue Collar" or the better Mob pictures. Recommended solely for Nicholson's performance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would guess that many people find Jack Nicholson as satisfying as I do because, like Cary Grant, he always seems to play an only slightly refracted version of the same character. Those leaping eyebrows, like twin Mount Raniers on his forehead. That toothy grin, sardonic and sadistic. Here, though, he gives all that up and becomes a different and highly energetic Jimmy Hoffa. His lips are tucked in, his head held back emphasizing the folds in his neck, and he wears an almost constant scowl. His voice too lacks the expected sleazy glissandos of the Nicholson School of Elocution. His speech is clipped, fast, and full of working-class grammar. ("All these rumors are unsubstantuated!") He does a great job as Jimmy Hoffa. And Danny DeVito is great as always, playing Hoffa's old-time buddy, Bobby Ciaro, a clown with a potential for deadly seriousness. Nicholson and DeVito grew up in the same town -- Neptune, New Jersey -- at about the same time and have known each other for years. DeVito claimed to have dated Nicholson's sister. It's pleasing to see the two of them working together.In some ways, though, the whole may be less than the sum of its parts. The story is a bit like that of "The Godfather" but without the Mafia mystique. Hoffa starts out good but then -- well, what? Does he go bad? If so, the movie does as good a job of hiding exactly what he did as Hoffa himself did. There is a scene in which he seems to agree to lend money from the Teamster's Pension Fund to "a known Italian." But the scene takes place during a faux deer hunt and is played for laughs. While D'Allesandro (Armand Assante) and Hoffa argue over the terms of the loan, a deer walks up unexpectedly and is ignored by everyone until, finally, DeVito uncorks his automatic and blasts it. When the shots sound everyone hits the dirt. The scene is amusing but it's distracting too. What WAS that agreement, exactly? Is it illegal for the President of a labor union to lend money to someone else at a profit? Hoffa claims not. And who argues with him but Robert Kennedy, played very unsympathetically as an elitist snot who never worked in his life and is just trying to make a name for himself by bringing Hoffa to court. Hoffa, eventually is convicted and goes to jail. But it is never made clear exactly what he was convicted of. Lending money to an Italian? Nicholson plays Hoffa pretty straight. He's not a particularly nice guy but he's clever in the way that an alley cat is clever. (Mamet's dialog stays on track.) Yet the director, DeVito, gives him the almost same kind of sentimental treatment that Don Corleone got. I am happy, though, that the movie spared us scenes in which Hoffa's wife sobs and complains that he's so often away from home that she hardly knows him anymore. (Thanks again, Mamet.) There is a fictional but still unnerving assassination scene at the end. Hoffa and DeVito's bodies are dumped atop one another in the back seat of their car. The car is driven up the ramp of a waiting truck and the truck zooms off down the highway towards its unknown destination. Elegiac music swells on the sound track. The image of the back of the truck recedes and dwindles until it disappears down the highway, a setting sun hovering just overhead.Did Hoffa really deserve this Viking's funeral? I don't know. The movie left me with a lot of unanswered questions, none of them about the performances. A viewer can't help wondering where Hoffa is now. Part of a building somewhere, or an automobile? Or a truck?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant characterization, underrated by critics at the time of release</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Possibly Jack Nicholson was showing up nominated at to many award shows at this time and he was due for a put down.The movie seemed to be overlooked or not reviewed very well at the time of release. I thought his "Hoffa" was a memorable portrayal of a complex and contradictory personality. Having been around during Hoffa's reign as head of the Teamsters, as well as being a Teamster back then myself, Nicholson's potrayal was uncanny in it's grasp of Hoffa's style and personality. Nicholson seemed to get in Hoffa's skin for this role as George C. Scott did for Patton. As a matter of fact I think the analogy is accurate. Both Patton and Hoffa were contoversial, larger the life characters with a lot of flaws and a lot of attributes. Both actors were highly skilled and balanced in their potrayals.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have no interest in the life of Jimmy Hoffa, and I am predisposed to disliking the man even before the first frame of Hoffa is run. But I do watch, knowing the film is from a very good David Mamet script, knowing that I want to be convinced that Jack Nicholson is one of our great actors, and knowing that Danny DeVito is a very serious filmmaker--that I will see his heart and soul in the film.I am not disappointed, and I still care, not at all about James Hoffa, the man.Jack Nicholson is one of our great actors, and regardless of all his extra curricular activities, he is a committed and serious craftsman, and his portrayal of James Hoffa is fine craftsmanship.The story of Hoffa itself may be the least interesting component of the film. The production design is beautiful-a perfect compliment to the words of Mamet delivered by a painstakingly perfect cast.Should you have the opportunity to view the deluxe laserdisk with the Danny Devito commentary and extra production materials you will be treated.Not a film for everyone, but I liked it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great film about a great man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actually knew a guy whose uncle would have coffee with Hoffa regularly in Chicago and they were good friends so this movie is very near and dear to me. Hoffa did for organized labor what Martin Luther King Jr. did for civil rights. He pioneered it, organized it, led it and ultimately died for it. Jack Nicholson is dynamite. He really looks like Jimmy Hoffa and he's got him down pat. You feel empathy for him, what he has to go thru, and the constant, devastating betrayals that occur throughout his life by the Mob and the Teamsters. Danny DeVito is good and you feel sorry for him almost as much as you respect him and even fear him. He's tough, brash, competent and a good shot with a .45 Auto and he loves Hoffa. That is evident early on and doesn't leave you. This movie was made not as a factual piece but more of a testament to his movement and his struggle to fight for his men and get them what they deserve. The ending is very poignant and endearing almost to a fault. If you are interested in finding out what really happened to Hoffa read Contract Killer by William Hoffman and Lake Headley it goes into great detail about his final hours, who killed him and most importantly why. The message is simple. What you love can kill you and most men who sacrifice all for a cause end up becoming martyrs to it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well above mediocre, but contains inaccuracies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Nicholson stars as controversial former Teamsters boss Jimmy Hoffa who disappeared in 1975 from a suburban Detroit diner's parking lot where he was to meet Anthony Provenzano, a reputed New Jersey mobster known as "Tony Pro."Danny DeVito directs the entertaining Hoffa, which is told mostly in flashbacks to "the good old days," but some glaring inconsistencies plague the film.Firstly, there's DeVito's character: Bobby Ciaro, who is doggedly loyal to Hoffa. While played masterfully, Ciaro is ficticious; he's most likely an amalgamation of several real-life characters.Secondly, the diner scenes where Ciaro is talking to the young truck driver whose rig has broken down. The trucker is having no luck getting his rig repaired until Ciaro intervenes. The trucker is grateful of course, but Ciaro deflects the gratitude to his boss, Hoffa. When the trucker learns that Hoffa himself is sitting in a Cadillac in the parking lot, the trucker is insistent that he thank the former union boss personally. The trucker shoots and kills Hoffa and Ciaro, who tries to defend his boss and friend.Thirdly, after the shooting a truck pulls up and the Cadillac is driven into the trailer and whisked away. This contradicts fact in two key areas: (1) Only James Riddle Hoffa was reported as disappeared; (2) Hoffa was driving a Pontiac Grand Prix, which was found parked in the lot.Despite those key flaws, the movie's saving grace is the top-notch acting. Nicholson has Hoffa down pat, right down to his convincing nasally voice and mannerisms. I do not know if Hoffa himself ever said them himself, but two Nicholson quotes stand out:"Mr. Hoffa, you gonna organize the cops?" "That's nothing! One of these days I'm gonna organize the crooks!""I'm gonna do what I gotta do!"Hoffa, seen by some as an opportunist is played as a hero who justified his less- than-legal actions while Teamsters president as benefiting the working men and women he represents. Hoffa clearly loved the Teamsters. Nonetheless, he was sent to prison in 1967 (his sentence was later commuted by then-US president Richard Nixon,) but many saw the conviction as a case of politicians framing a hero of the working man. One scene, where Hoffa and Ciaro are being transported to the prison and are cheered by a long line of supportive truck drivers exemplifies this.Still, it's a very good film that suffers from writers taking license with fact. However, I can easily recommend it due to Nicholson and DeVitos' powerful performances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Danny DeVito directs and co-stars with Jack Nicholson in Hoffa. DeVito had high hopes for the film and felt that not only would it be a commercial success but a critical one with awards for cinematography, production design and acting.The film failed at the box office and did not garner the awards expected. The reason because the film is a honourable failure. There is a script by David Mamet and although there are some great production values its not consistent. There is a great scene where Hoffa is talking to some people in a corridor of a building with big windows. Through the windows you can see a courtyard with a market going on with people going about in period costume. In a costume drama, many other people because of the budgetary concerns would had done it just in a walled corridor.However you have scenes where its obviously done in a film set and some scenes are obviously staged such as the hunting scene.The biggest problem is the film does not address the audience outside of the USA who have little or no idea of who Hoffa was. I heard about him as a college student mainly to do with the fact that this a notorious Union leader who is now supporting some bridge under a highway!During the initial scenes when DeVito's character who is a composite of several real life persons first meets Hoffa, I had no idea when the meeting took place. In the 1930s or 40s or the 50s? When Hoffa takes over the Teamster union and wants some people fired, why exactly did he want this? Who were this people that he wanted fired? As we do not know this people do we care? What exactly did Hoffa do wrong for him to be imprisoned? Getting a shady Italian-American to make money for you via some loans is not illegal surely at that time unless it was actual money laundering. Wikipedia tells me that it was fraud, jury tampering and bribery. The film is called Hoffa yet we know so little about him after viewing the film.The film is told in flashbacks as Hoffa waits for a meeting in a parking lot of a diner. Again we are not told of the time period of this setting which should be the mid 1970s as that is when he disappeared although the ending in this film leave little doubt what happens to Hoffa.Its a well constructed film of a man that divides America but DeVito the director needed Mamet to put more detailed in the script so we have a better idea of who Hoffa was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent biopic of a famous, forgotten American</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't care that the ending was fictional, because it was poetically correct. The life of Hoffa was poetical in its intensity, and the burning righteousness of the man comes through in this picture. Nicholson plays Hoffa excellently on his own terms, conveying the fearlessness of the man and his complex relationship to the mobsters who cashed in on his enormous pension fund by taking legal loans that Hoffa didn't skim. The climax of the story is genuinely tragic as Hoffa is persecuted by Bobby Kennedy, thrown in prison, and murdered by the mob when he gets out and tries to get his union, the Teamsters, back under his control. The motivation of Hoffa drives this picture and its a scandal that the film apparently never made a profit, presumably because of prejudice against unions in the mass-media. Hats off to Danny De Vito for putting up the money for this picture and for directing it and co- starring. His depiction of Hoffa's little lifelong under-man is fine. Altogether a high-minded and grand picture that held my attention for the duration, and moved me at the end. More American movies like this would help their cause no end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ship is sinking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this bitter, dark but effectively powerful film, legendary Teamsters Union President James Riddle (Jimmy) Hoffa is the centerfold. Bobby Ciaro (DeVito, also the director) is a fictional character who acts as Hoffa's goffer throughout the film, refusing to co-operate with the authorities when so-asked, calling various mafiosi on his behalf, and generally acting as his mouthpiece. We see Hoffa as a dominant figure, a lion, a leader. But these are deceptive subliminal messages, since the whole film is seen from a plexi-glass viewpoint. In fact, so icy is DeVito's direction, that when a riot breaks out at the very beginning, we watch from a bird's eye view as the little ant-like labourers clash with the police. It is insulting to the intelligence, and takes much away from the depth of the film, rendering it rather picturesque but unexplained. In fact, the entire film is like a museum piece behind velvet ropes, that can only be gazed at from a distance, but cannot be felt or examined closer -- as closer examination would reveal the plotholes and irrationalities of the storyline in the first place. Hoffa is generally treated as an American hero, the little guy who stood up for all the other little guys, the man who went to prison because the cruel Attorney General Kennedy (aptly performed by Kevin Anderson) would not allow him to skim a few bucks out of the pension fund for the Union he ran. Indeed, Hoffa did go to prison in real-life, and was pardoned by President Nixon, but the stipulation in the pardon was one which seemed to slip under Hoffa's nose. This, and his general trouble-stirring attitude (with Nicholson effortlessly portrays, sometimes even looking like a mirror-image of the real-life counterpart) would lead to his demise and mysterious disappearance in 1975. Perhaps had DeVito gone more into the life of the man, more into why he had the ambitions he did (there is absolutely no explanation for his being the president, in fact, he just seems to recruit labourers from various locals and then all of a sudden he is Mr. Universe), and why he was careless enough to make shady dealings with the Mob. In fact, nearly all of the story is mafia-backed but all of the credit is placed on Jimmy's shoulders. It is simply a waste of Nicholson's stellar performance.5.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In spite of a very accurate impersonation by Jack Nicholsen, this film is a failure because it completely whitewashes what a cretinous character the real James Hoffa was.Jimma Hoffa was charismatic, but he was also completely corrupt and played one of the biggest roles in allowing organized crime to take over one of the largest unions in the United States, and by doing so, bilking thousands of honest, hardworking people of pay and benefits.Read a history of Hoffa and you'll see a man who did everything he could to eliminate owner-operator truckers as a means of controlling all truckers. He wanted all drivers under the powerful fist of the union. You'll also see a predator who schemed to take over many existing enterprises by getting a foot in the door, striking, taking over and then allowing one or more of his thugs to exact tribute (often under their wife's name) in return for good labor relations.These are just a few examples of the corruption forced upon honest businesses by Hoffa and his criminal associates. Read history to know the real man, see the film to see a nice impersonation and a BS history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I purchased a new copy of this movie from a seller who listed it on one of the internet "for sale" sites; I had checked with my library and also with the video rental store in my area and neither one had the movie available. I had just finished reading the 400+ page book, "Hoffa," by Arthur A. Sloane, Ph.D. Mr. Sloan's book told both the good and the bad about Jimmy Hoffa. I learned by reading the book that Jimmy Hoffa typically worked 16-hour days, six and sometimes seven days a week. I also learned that Jimmy Hoffa neither smoked, drank liquor or ever cheated on his wife. The movie realistically portrayed Jimmy Hoffa as doing his utmost for his Teamster members. The movie also realistically portrayed that the two paramount concerns that Jimmy Hoffa had were for his family and for the rank-and-file members of his union.In my opinion, Jimmy Hoffa's downfall was that he chose to associate himself with organized crime, which in the end cost him his life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To me, there are 3 things wrong with this film, although they don't make it a bad film...more an incomplete film.1. At best, it's a 2-dimensional portrait of the man. An extra 7-10 minutes early in the film could have given us a better understanding of what in his youth made him the scrappy, feisty man he became.2. Did he have a family life? You'd hardly know it. We see his wife occasionally, but with only one scene of any value. Same for his children...almost nonexistent. A few more minutes could have completed the character sketch.3. I'm no fan of Bobby Kennedy, but the portrayal of Kennedy here by Kevin Anderson seemed downright childish to me.Having said that, there's a lot of good things about this film. The first, perhaps, being Danny DeVito's strong portrayal of Hoffa's chief aide over much of a lifetime (although the character is fictional). A strong theme of the film is loyalty, and DeVito portrays that extremely well.As to Jack Nicholson's performance as Hoffa, it's difficult for me to rate. I am old enough to remember Jimmy Hoffa, and I see glimpses of Hoffa in Nicholson's performance. But that's always a problem in biographical films of people we actually remember. We can look at Don Ameche's performance as Alexander Graham Bell and accept it rather readily because we don't personally remember Bell. But some of us remember Hoffa, and it would be a mistake for Nicholson to do an "impression" of Hoffa, because it would be widely criticized. So, he does an admirable job of not letting an impression get in the way of the story.DeVito also directed this film, and I have to give him credit for the deft manner in which he handled flashbacks. Generally I think that flashbacks are overused in many films. Here the technique worked very well with very smooth transitions.Of course we don't really know how Hoffa died and disappeared, but the ending of this film is an intriguing and nifty explanation. Very well done.If you want to get a sense of Jimmy Hoffa the labor leader, this film will accomplish that. If you want a sense of the whole man, you'll be a bit disappointed. But, the film is an admirable effort.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film based on the story of legendary union figure Jimmy Hoffa (played here by Jack Nicholson).Can I first say this was strange casting for Bobby Kennedy? It just seems like someone doing a very poor Kennedy impersonation, not a serious attempt to really capture him. Which is unfortunate, given how central his role is. (This film, more than anything, seems to be Hoffa versus Kennedy.) The Nicholson casting is not perfect, either, because it is hard to hide his distinctive voice... but I think he pulls it off ,and the makeup helps.The Hoffa story is a fascinating one, and one that deserves to be explored on film again. This was 1992, and I write this in 2015. In the past two decades, more memoirs have been written, more government documents released... we need another biopic, and maybe a really serious documentary?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>grand epic, big performance and heavy-handed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1975, Jimmy Hoffa (Jack Nicholson) and his lieutenant Bobby Ciaro (Danny DeVito) are nervously waiting in a parking lot. The movie flashes back to their first meeting on the side of the road. Hoffa convinces Ciaro to join the Teamster. Ciaro loses his job and joins Hoffa. With their strike failing, Hoffa makes a deal with the Mafia. D'Allesandro (Armand Assante) becomes his close mob ally. Hoffa rises to be the president of the Teamster all the while battling all comers. Robert F. Kennedy hounds him as RFK becomes Attorney General.Danny DeVito brings a lot of epic into the movie. It's a grand costume drama. He brings a lot of visual style. It looks like he threw a lot onto the screen. Some of it is the big performance from Jack Nicholson. He's really the deciding factor on whether to like this movie or not. I can certainly see both sides of the argument. On the one hand, it's an impressive big performance. On the other hand, he's doing only one note. I think it could be improved if they get rid of the make-up. Let Nicholson embody the role. Give him back his facial expressions. It keeps the audience from truly connecting with the character. The general public doesn't know what Hoffa looks like anyways.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trucks or Threats? ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Life made him famous, but death turned him into a legend. If it weren't for his mysterious disappearance probably due to his connections with the mob, it's doubtful that Jimmy Hoffa, the leader of the most powerful union would have been such a deeply rooted figure in American pop-culture. This posthumous place among the unsolved mysteries of the last century was begging for a movie adaptation, and Danny DeVito's turned into quite an interesting biopic, but strangely enough, it says a lot about the man without saying that much. At the end of the film, I knew some of his achievements, but the motives, the traumas, the obsessions, what makes a character fascinating, were still a mystery. This is not to belittle the film's educational value, but I don't think such a complex public figure can be understood if we don't even have some quick glimpses about his past, his background and his family. It's as if Danny DeVito sticked with the public image of Hoffa and didn't give us enough to hook our hearts on outside the Teamster business, which is a pity because Jack Nicholson made the character and gave him such an aura that it genuinely made me curious about the man. Yet, nothing is shared except what he tells his friends, the mob, the journalists, and Bobby Kennedy. I was begging for an intimate moment with his wife, not because "behind every great men, there's a woman" but because men do confess to their wives, share with them the off-the-record stuff, but "Hoffa" is not in the same caliber than, say, Oliver Stone's "Nixon", which is about a no less controversial figure. And I guess I wasn't surprised because I saw the wife in the middle of the film but because she was showed while she was useless plot-wise.On the other hand, the film tackles its subject in a very serious and entertaining way that I'm asking myself if DeVito or the screenwriters did have enough material to approach the privacy of Hoffa, maybe they didn't, or maybe they had but they didn't have enough time. The film is more trying to answer to the question of Hoffa's whacking than the typical rise and fall, it's more about the way he became an instrument of the mob with a pragmatic view on the ends- justifies-the mean theory, but we never see how effective they are for the Teamsters. I learned more about the rights and the struggle of truck drivers from the underrated film-noir "They Drive by Night" or the thriller "Wages of Fear" than "Hoffa", which is saying a lot because it had to be about trucks too, Ebert said that DeVito showed a man who was all about trucks, he talked and breathed 'truck', well how about showing these trucks in the first place? The film fails providing insights on the character by focusing too much on the controversy; it doesn't help to get enough perspective. Imagine if "Nixon" was only about the Watergate, you wouldn't have known about Nixon AND the Watergate either, DeVito's film lacked focus and scope.It's interesting that the film was made in 1992, the same year than another and better biopic, Spike Lee's "Malcolm X", the film is three-hour long but takes you from the roots of the leader, when he was a small-time crook to his rise as one charismatic orator. In "Hoffa", we never see him driving a truck, nourishing his heart with socialist ideas and revolting against the system. From the beginning, he's like a politician haranguing the comrades. I take it from granted than what he say is true, but it's not about belief, but empathy, the film is not about making Hoffa a good or a bad guy, but letting the viewer figuring out. If he was bad enough (in the "practical" meaning) to stick with the gangsters when he became powerful, it would be interesting to see how he started as an idealistic man, and it would make the corruption of his morality more interesting. That's what great biopics are about: evolutions, and never in "Hoffa", do we feel that the guy is changing, in bad or good, it doesn't matter, but there's no dynamics whatsoever.And again, it's a pity because the performances are good, I can't believe Nicholson got a Razzie nomination for this, granted it wasn't the best of his career, but he did bring some energy and passion in the character. But what lacked was a structure, a right choice of episodes that would tell us something about a controversial figure. The film is two-hour and fifteen minutes long, I wouldn't have minded it being much longer if it could enlighten me on the private face of Jimmy Hoffa, we're talking about a character played by Nicholson, who's got a great chemistry with his real-life friend Danny DeVito, the film had the potential, the ambition, probably the budget, the writing was good, but the storytelling not so.Still, for what it is, it's not wasted time, and the film has a solid consistency in it, and at least, it does something that almost redeems the flaws I mentioned: it ends with the best scene, the most memorable one. In terms of shock and emotion, even though we know the story of Jimmy Hoffa, we don't see the ending coming, and it did left me puzzled and shocked when I saw it for the first time. The film needed more moments like this, but all in all, it's a solid drama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this was a great film, and I stress the word "film" because so many people are critical of "Hoffa" due to its lack of total historical accuracy. Its a movie based on a historical figure ,not a historical biography. Creative license was used to portray a man that while corrupt, was necessary for the American labor movement at that time. Many people owe Jimmy Hoffa a great deal of gratitude for the advancements he made for the "Working Man". This is often lost today because Jimmy Hoffa ultimately went down, and as we all know Americans love a winner. Danny Devito and Jack Nicholson were great. The DVD is well worth its price and contains some great extras, including some actual footage of Jimmy Hoffa and Robert Kennedy at the hearings in the late 50's. 9 out of 10 .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting telling of a fascinating story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It couldn't be easy to make a film about a man whose story has no ending. But Danny DeVito and David Mamet tackle just that story in Hoffa, a biopic about the legendary union leader Jimmy Hoffa. The film chronicle's Hoffa's beginnings and his eventual rise to fame and power in the International Brotherhood of Teamsters union, a union which eventually became the largest union in the United States. It leads all the way up to Hoffa's disappearance in 1975. The truth behind his disappearance is a mystery, but the film provides its own theory on what might have happened. Jimmy Hoffa was arguably one of the most interesting men in America during his glory days and Hoffa does a decent job at telling that story.The film is uniquely told through the eyes of Hoffa's best friend, Bobby Ciaro who is played by Danny DeVito, who also directs the film in his sometimes straightforward, sometimes offbeat style. Telling the story like this makes for an interesting narrative and gives the film a unique sense of style, telling the story of one man through the eyes of another. But what Hoffa really tries to accomplish is just telling the story. It focuses on getting all the details right and every important aspect of the story out there for all to see. What the film lacks is a lot of emotion or passion towards the subject matter. It's an exciting film and plenty enticing, but it isn't a robust dramatic telling of the life of Jimmy Hoffa. This is more of a well made documentary on Hoffa's life than a biopic.But don't get me wrong. Hoffa does the best it can from a purely storytelling aspect. The story is there and it is alive. It isn't always the most exciting adventure and it drags considerably at times. But it is a high quality film in specific aspects, namely acting and writing. It goes without saying but Jack Nicholson's acting is incredible and David Mamet's writing is superb. These are things that we've come to expect from these two gentlemen and Hoffa shows that they care about anything and everything they do. Danny DeVito also does a fine job in his role and the relationship between him and Nicholson is believable and compelling. Mamet's dialogue drives the film home and gives it its slick tongue and witty cadence. The film stands out in these aspects, but as a summation of all its parts it is nothing more than an interesting little look into the life of Jimmy Hoffa that we can enjoy as an informational piece, rather than a film.I enjoyed Hoffa but it is another of the many films I see that I wouldn't plan on seeing again. It makes for a good one time watch because now I know more about Jimmy Hoffa and the fascinating story that surrounds him. It's always fun to watch Nicholson act his head off and Mamet write himself to death, and Hoffa certainly delivers these things. It doesn't go much further than that, and it doesn't end up doing much more than hold my attention for a little more than two hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Skillful Work of Fiction, Rooted in Fact, Devised with Ingenuity and a Dependable Viewpoint</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Written with callous virtuosity by Mamet, directed with garishly vintage technique by DeVito, this hugely underrated, passionate, powerful film not only portrays Hoffa with the enhanced corporal magnitude of Nicholson, who gives a massive thrust of a performance, but it also reshuffles the ladder of American heroes as it's recognized nowadays. Several may be uneasily startled: This stylistic take on the life and mysterious disappearance of the Teamsters Union leader views Robert Kennedy as seen by Hoffa: a bellyaching Harvard-educated well-to-do, frantic for exposure, prepared to use evenhanded ways and biased to catch Hoffa, no equal at all for Hoffa in their incensed altercations.In the context of most commercial movies, which insist on explaining too much or repeating the obvious, Hoffa remains a reasonably detached consideration of the career of a man whose ties to the Mafia not only cost the rank-and-file teamsters millions but also set a pattern for corruption that tainted the entire labor movement. It's a quintessentially American story, for only here did Big Labor become a big business to rival Big Business.DeVito and the Great Character Development Skeptic neither romanticizie him or try to explore Hoffa outside his own mechanical justification that you have to do it to others before they do it you. Without commentary, in very broad strokes, they authenticate Hoffa's advancement from minor reformer to big-time shark, power-dealer and mob friend.The movie opens as the edgy, dog-tired Jimmy, convoyed by his committed odd-job guy, conjured character Bobby, waits in a Cadillac in a Detroit cafeteria lot for a rendezvous with an abiding Mafia accomplice. The reminiscences that are the bulk of the film aren't Jimmy's, but the indulgent, diligent Bobby's. He worries about Jimmy's state of affairs, remembering their first meeting in the Depressed 1930s when, one night on the road, Jimmy invited himself into his truck and tried to enlist him for the teamsters. Jimmy was then something of an optimist. As the hours drone on in the lot, Bobby sequentially recalls his way through Jimmy's career.While Bobby's remembrance is tender, this captivating, hazy biopic sees all coolly. This gives this forgotten '90s drama an indignantly cynical tone that is generally uncommon in American movies. It compels us to decide for ourselves, something that can be infinitely puzzling as well as gratifying. The film proposes there are occasions when one must reason for oneself. It doesn't pose as a docudrama or anything close. It's a skillful work of fiction, rooted in fact, devised with ingenuity and a dependable viewpoint.DeVito's direction is crammed with overstated kinesics that appear wholeheartedly consistent with Bobby's exceedingly highlighted reminiscences of life with Jimmy. There are numerous striking overhead shots, whether it's a scene of Jimmy incarcerated or a panoramic view of union men wrestling scabs. Simultaneously, DeVito knows when to use close-ups, that is, to divulge character instead of to intersperse dialogue. When the director shows a recalled explosion and fire, they have the massive scope of something recounted in an anecdote told late at night in a favorite dive.It comes as a surprise, about midway through, to learn that the Teamsters head has a wife and daughter. They appear during a crowd scene. But this film about Jimmy Hoffa has no time to show him meeting his wife, dating her, marrying her, finding their dream house, having a kid. That's about as it should be.Does the movie grant that Jimmy was an instrument of organized crime? Not by any means. Nor does it quite maintain that Hoffa would take any advantage he could get, anywhere he could, to systematize the drivers and press-gang the bosses. He was a union realist, but what makes this movie so beguiling is that we can never entirely peep the romanticism that should be in there somewhere, no glow of internal principle. Something murky must be driving him on a lonesome, ruthless revenge.Nicholson is an actor who can echo virtually anything in his face. His intense, volcanic performance is so good as Hoffa because he betrays virtually nothing. When we first see him, the corporal embellishments are striking. He's filled with spite, not optimism. He organizes for the same reason other guys get in bar fights, because it discharges the intense stresses within.The production is plentiful with period particulars, consecutively in an enduring procession. The truckers' world distinguishes with the world of control occupied by the insiders: The Old World sophistication of the Mafia sociables, for instance, or the rooms where dominant government men dwell. The movie makes its implicit case for union organizing simply by complementing the cabs and roadstops of the drivers with the world of opportunity.This is an inspired and vibrant piece, but is that sufficient? It sharply divided critics, but for me it is. Others will have valid protests to the ways the film works. This genuinely absorbing piece reveals DeVito as a sincere filmmaker. He extracts the core guise and pitch for this material. Not every director would've been self-assured enough to purely show us Jimmy Hoffa rather than narrating all about him. This is a movie that finds its impact between the lines, in what is unstated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mythic Narration</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Danny DeVito's elegant masterwork film "Hoffa" tells an important story about America. Mr. DeVito's film is a Midrash, a riff, an interpretation of the life of union organizer and leader James R. "Jimmy" Hoffa. The narration unfolds richly through David Mamet's screenplay, excellent performances by the players including most of all Jack Nicholson and Mr. DeVito. By the way, J. T. Walsh shines again here.Cinematography by Stephen Burum and editing by Lynzee Klingman and Ronald Roose exfoliate the intricate production design by Ida Random and other production details. The people working on this film are all top notch.As I indicated, the film is not historical but interpretative. The narration is deliberately ambiguous and tensive, open to varying responses just like Mr. Hoffa himself. Still, I understand criticism of the film for its historical and even narrative flaws, but this is a mythic work, which has its place and serves a good purpose. In a way, it is a counter myth to those about John F. Kennedy and his brother Robert.For production design, acting, cinematography, editing, production values, and acting, Mr. DeVito's work deserves a solid ten. That does not mean the history is complete or accurate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I had seen Hoffa I was aware of the Union leader mainly for his disappearance and the jokes made about his last resting spot. My dad had always considered Hoffa a hero simply because he didn't buckle under to the big boys he fought them. Hoffa The movie captures the Essence of James R Hoffa perfectly. This is Nicholson's Finest role forget the Joker in Batman or Jack Torrence in THE SHINING. This is pure acting 100% You cannot tell where Hoffa the part and Nicholson the actor leave off. The movie moves from Flashbacks to Hoffa's last day on Earth and it makes you wonder about What happened to him. During the flashbacks we See Hoffa slowly emerging as a force within the Teamsters Union slowly gathering influence and power from the ranks of the working man. The Film fits the various Eras portrayed perfectly. It's like looking thru a window. The Corruption of Hoffa if you can call it that is slow and gradual and Hoffa's War With Bobby Kennedy is simply fantastic film making Devito didn't want to spoil the scene with words so he used the actual Hoffa Kennedy exchanges word by word word for word. And Nicholson must've studied that footage intently as he captures Hoffa's Every movement and even his eyes down to the rapid movements that Hoffa did. Devito knows his stuff and Proves it here. Great Film that deserves to be remembered as a true original CLASSIC! Just like the original James R. Hoffa a original classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hoffa is a surprising film which from time to time arises to keep alive the memory of the late Teamster president. Told in flash back form, the film ably describes the dramatic rise and fall of the popular labor leader. Indeed, with Nickleson's portrayal the viewer is convinced of the confrontational life of the man who became synonymous with the International union. Re-enacting the turbulent rise of Hoffa, viewers are treated to the fabulous talents of some of the giants of the silver screen. Few could argue that Jack Nicholson as James R. 'Jimmy' Hoffa is nothing short of magical. In addition there is Danny DeVito who as Bobby Ciaro, in my opinion steals the show. Further enriching the cast is Armand Assante as Carol D'Allesandro, the mob boss who assured Jimmy's rise to power and then later is suspect in the teamster's mysterious disappearance. J.T. Walsh is excellent as Frank Fitzsimmons. The dramatic film superbly encapsulates the early violent trials, successful triumphs and eventual tragedy of the great, but troubled teamster president. ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Hoffa" is a story about the rise and fall of Teamster leader James "Jimmy" Hoffa (Jack Nicholson) as told by his loyal associate Bobby Ciaro (Danny DeVito).Hoffa organized Teamsters from the Great Depression to 1975. The greatest force driving the labor movement, Hoffa recruited members by " jumping" trucks, organizing meetings, setting up pickets, and even sabotaging businesses. Hoffa fought fire with fire, and his tactics and attitude gained him respect and support. Unfortunately, this would also contribute to his fall. Hoffa began dealing with the Mafia and investing union funds in their businesses. Concern over the size, the violence of the movement, and hatred of Hoffa lead U.S. Attorney General Robert Kennedy (Kevin Anderson) to attempt to convict him of embezzling union funds. Hoffa humiliated the Kennedy family during the hearings. By 1959 Kennedy guided Congress in passing union limiting legislation, and Hoffa was successfully imprisoned under the new laws. After his release, Hoffa would meet with the Mafia in an attempt to regain control of the Teamsters. This would be the last time Jimmy Hoffa was ever seen. Written by David Mamet and directed by Danny DeVito, the film drives home the absolute determination and dedication Jimmy Hoffa put into the labor movement. He lives and breathes union. His eyes are filled with vengeance, not optimism. Willing to do business with the Mafia to advance the cause, Hoffa believes he is doing nothing more than the politicians who are trying to stop him. His cause is for a whole class of people, not just his family. The director doesn't get into the Kennedy family issues except as they pertain to Hoffa. Little mention is made of their corruption or involvement with the Mafia, as this would have been a distraction from the driven Hoffa portrayal. The movie spans from the early 1930s to 1975. The special affects, makeup, and settings were excellent. The clothes, cars, guns, cigarettes, and makeup smoothly transitioned the forty year time frame. Jack Nicholson's portrayal of Jimmy Hoffa was awesome: the viewer could feel the rage and determination Hoffa felt.The exclusion of other historical events revolving around his disappearance, and the speculative ending was disappointing, and leaves the viewer with an inaccurate depiction of his disappearance. In reality, Jimmy Hoffa's body has never been located, and he is only presumed dead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Directed and co-produced by Danny DeVito; this is a stern and brass knuckle look at the legendary Union boss James R. Hoffa, who disappeared in 1975. Jimmy Hoffa(Jack Nicholson) to many was a natural born leader. Many say he helped only himself as head of a very large and strong teamsters union. Albeit Hoffa remained devout to his cause and did not back down in his heated meetings with Robert Kennedy(Kevin Anderson). Danny DeVito gave himself the role of Hoffa's right hand man Bobby Ciaro.This may be Nicholson at his finest. DeVito also is outstanding in a meaty role. In support as Hoffa cronies are: J.T. Walsh, John C. Reilly and John P. Ryan. Armand Assante is powerful in the role of Carol D'Allesandro a 'big money' man in association with the crafty union leader.

Hoffa's Line, "I didn't make one dime off the Union's Money...All I did was make money for their Pension Fund, is that so bad?", is as close to the Truth as anyone knows. A Tainted Public Figure, except to Labor, Jimmy R, Hoffa became a Man of Mythic Status in His Own Lifetime and Disappeared without a trace.But, Hoffa, has Never Disappeared from the Thoughts of the Working Man and this Movie makes that case in a Noble Effort, if Not a Complete Biography.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big-Budget Mainstream Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film's production values are great. Visuals look good with attention to detail in sets, costumes, and makeup. Frame composition and especially lighting create a pleasing, artistic effect. Viewers get a real sense of the American rust belt with its snowy landscape, bleak urban factories, and put-upon laborers during the film's rough and tumble social era spanning four decades, from the 1930s to the 1970s.The problem here is the script concept. Though some viewers, for various reasons, will want to watch a film about Jimmy Hoffa, most potential viewers, I suspect, will opt out. A presumed biography of an American labor leader and his worker rights movement from decades ago will be perceived, rightly so, as a cinematic textbook, dry and uninteresting.The David Mamet screenplay isn't even factual. The chain-smoking Bobby Ciaro (Danny DeVito) is an invention, as is the "Young Kid". The plot begins outside a diner called the "Roadhouse"; in fact, the real-life diner was the "Red Fox Restaurant". Other elements about the film's ending also are fictional. The script leaves out Hoffa's threat to kill JFK, which is part of the historical record. Indeed, the script is semi-biographical and somewhat sanitized. And with the huge amount of dialogue, some of which is political speechifying, the story is at times boring.This is a big-budget, extravagant film with an enormous cast of extras, lots of built sets, some of which are huge. The number of speaking roles also is huge. Big-name stars telegraph to viewers that the film has the blessings of mainstream Hollywood. Acting generally is good. With stiff body movements, squinting eyes, and inner passion, Jack Nicholson gives a fine performance as Hoffa. About midway through, Kevin Anderson nails the role of Robert Kennedy.The enormity of the film effort is impressive; yet it also conveys an impression of cinematic self-importance. But the most basic problem is that the central character has largely faded into history, apart from the mystery of his disappearance. In the twenty-first century, Jimmy Hoffa is so very ... retro.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When one views "Hoffa", whether one is familiar or not with the history of the real person himself, one will find this film either one of two ways: either it's a pretty good movie, or they'll find it as a flawed and mediocre film. From my personal point-of-view, "Hoffa" is a pretty good movie. It's flawed in many regards, but it is a little bit underrated and unacclaimed. Whatever the case, Jack Nicholson was most certainly not worthy of getting a nomination at the Razzie Awards for Worst Actor. Not only does Nicholson bear a pretty close physical resemblance to the Teamsters legendary figure Jimmy R. Hoffa, but he also pulls of a very incredible performance. Not as good as some of his others, and maybe not Oscar-worthy, but not a bad performance at all.Nicholson portrays Jimmy Hoffa with amazing detail. He gives us the impression that the real Hoffa was daring, a little bit crazy, willing to take huge risks, and above all, self-confident. Which indeed, he was. I myself am not too familiar with the real story of Jimmy Hoffa, so I don't know if the film is entirely historically accurate, but I can tell that Hoffa had some kind of enormous impact, at least similar to what's on the film, in order to lead to his famous disappearance, which unavoidably, is also presented before us on the screen in this film in what many believe could have happened.One thing I do know is inaccurate is the fictional character of Bobby Ciaro, who is portrayed by director Danny DeVito. Some have criticized the film for concentrating too much on DeVito's character and not enough on Nicholson's. In my opinion, however, it works out just fine. The film is a flashback on how this imaginary character met Jimmy Hoffa, became friends with him, and turned from once hating the man, to coming to worship him and respect him as did all members of the teamsters. What I did feel was flawed with the character of Bobby Ciaro is how he was the real central part of the story and his place really didn't work out in the ending of the film, which I will not explain in this review.The first couple of minutes of the film sets the kind of the style that the entire movie will follow. Before long, characters are dropping F-bombs and if I am correct, the F-bomb was dropped a total of 153 times in the entire. There is plenty of other swearing and this might be considered offensive by some people, but I felt it was necessary to develop this vision of the tough times that the teamsters lived in.So while "Hoffa" is in no way a perfect movie, it is a film that should be acclaimed and spoken of more than it is. It has substance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally, Hoffa gets credit where credit is due. It is sad that when people think of Hoffa the first thing they think of is the mafia. This movie finally shows that Hoffa was truly a great man and did so much for the working class. Without Hoffa, the benefits that we take for granted would have never existed. I praise the makers of this movie for trying to break the stigma of Hoffa and make him out to be the great man that he truly was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Ah, what a wonderful movie"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As "Hoffa" opens, the forcibly retired president of the Teamsters and his right hand man are cooling their heels, sitting in a car in the parking lot of a roadside diner, waiting for a man they have agreed to meet to arrive. It is 1975, but as the two friends wonder what's keeping their prospective guest, the grayish hair atop their heads grows darker and we are transported back to their first meeting when the young Hoffa bums a ride with a young trucker in the hope of convincing him to join his union. The trucker isn't interested, but after the frustrated Hoffa broadcasts the news that he was a guest in the trucker's cab, he's earned an enemy who holds him responsible for his sudden unemployment. The animosity doesn't last long, however, and when Hoffa rises to the presidency of this "brotherhood" of working men, he has an admiring friend at his side. Admiring is the way to describe actor-director DeVito's two-hour plus biography of the doomed Jimmy Hoffa, played, with a toupee and some heavy makeup, by Jack Nicholson. Even as Hoffa cuts a deal with the Mafia, and describes Senator Robert F. Kennedy in words that could never be repeated here, DeVito's camera dwells on Nicholson's Hoffa as if to say, "Ah, what a wonderful man!" I can't say I agree with DeVito's flattering opinion of the man whose disappearance in 1975 remains a mystery, but as I watched "Hoffa," I was tempted to say, "Ah, what a wonderful movie." Slammed by most critics with language almost as profane as the dialogue in David Mamet's screenplay, this is a movie from which I expected little, but which I thoroughly enjoyed. "Hoffa" is exciting, beautifully photographed (the cinematography earned an Oscar nomination), and exceptionally well-written. DeVito the actor is a little less credible than DeVito the director, but as James R. Hoffa, Nicholson sheds his usual persona and takes on a truly challenging role for a change. His Hoffa--dedicated to the cause of the working man and protecting their interests at all costs--rings true throughout. DeVito, on the other hand, gives a one-note performance. When not pushing people around, he's at Hoffa's side with his mouth hanging open as if in awe. DeVito is obviously in awe of what one can do with a camera. There are crane shots aplenty, and even a tip of the hat to the "hall of mirrors" sequence in Orson Welles' "The Lady from Shanghai." His self-indulgent tendency to show-off is distracting at times, but not enough to damage an otherwise terrific film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not great, but a good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't the slightest bit interested in the subject matter, but I had nothing to do and, surprise, this is a good movie. The screenplay plays a large part, as David Mamet is never guilty of melodrama, and this could have been a gung-ho kind of movie. It isn't. Jummy Hoffa wasn't a 'nice guy' and Jack Nicholson plays him that way. Well-balanced treatment with a real sense of the times, from around the 40s to the 70s. If you like Mamet, you'll love this one, but _don't_ watch the edited-for-TV version. You'll be wondering what's going on half the time because all the 'f***s' are replaced. When you're not laughing, you'll be rewinding to see what, exactly, they were trying to say.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Good Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jimmy Hoffa so majestically and colorfully played by Jack Nicholson is his one more triumph. The way Nicholson plays the role differs from all his roles performed before and after Hoffa. Therefore, the film for me represents a huge interest first of all because of Nicholson's unique performance. Jack's hero is very imposing, self-confident and overbearing. Once again he has confirmed that he's one of the best movie actors of all time.No doubt, such acting wouldn't be possible if not Denny DeVito's skilful directing. His refined taste, wide scope and talent, and excellent understanding of a film production process is apparent in this, as well as in his other films. This makes Denny DeVito, in my opinion, one of the most distinguished persons in contemporary American movie industry.Was Hoffa in real that like? I don't know, and I don't think it's important. I've learned about teamsters and their Union, about America of that period, and the film itself is interesting and masterly made. I think that's more then sufficient.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>high epic propensity, lots of "foul" language, and a classic Nicholson in a movie (unfortunately) slight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hoffa needs a director that has a vision that knocks you on your ass, much like the man at the center of the film himself. Danny De Vito takes the directorial reins in a style that is, frankly, emptily flashy. He moved on from doing dark comedies into the realm of the dramatic bio-pic, and boy does he love high flying camera movements, ones that pirouette and move like Hoffa is the biggest cheese to ever cheese. He brings forth a story of a man that isn't told entirely A to Z, but skips around in getting a slight portrait. He's not a bad director, which is to say he doesn't make it at all unwatchable. But the inherent flaw to point here is more-so in a lack of the proverbial "umph".David Mamet's script could also be pointed at for Hoffa offering a road-map of historical attractions- some of which might have not even happened- but his strengths could be elevated with a master at the helm. Hoffa calls for it, with his personality with the edge of a man who takes no s*** from anyone, and even when wrong has a sort of glow about him one can't shake. But Hoffa is fascinating because it is, inherently, fascinating stuff, no matter how simple the direction gets as a mainstream Hollywood effort. Here's a man who can't be pegged down because he's not, in a way, a well-rounded kind of character. He riles up workers into a union, and rallies them for a glorious cause to get what they want. Then he makes a back-door deal with the mob to get in on pension loans, and defends to the end that what he's got is legit when under investigation by RFK. He believes in "justice" before the law, and there's never a tear shed for anyone. Hoffa should be a very simplistic character, easy to peg in the scope of history as a (not quite obvious) question mark end.But there's so much that Nicholson brings to him that he's hard to shake off as a this-is-what-you-get character. With Nicholson there's the physicality, where he goes through the kind of barking and yelling and cursing and yelling and, ultimately, self-preserved ego that somehow makes Hoffa more human than the character would be played any other way. Even in scenes that feel like the most conventional of biographical stories, like the verbatim hearing between him and Kennedy, there's a lot to look for under those quintessential eyebrows and the layers of make-up. He has something that one wants to guess that he's thinking, or has in mind when he's going off on someone, or in talking with his second in command Bobby (DeVito himself, also very good in a role that, in his own right, requires just as much skill as his star to act out as a common man put in a unique position). Just a squint or a furrow can get a new angle in a scene, which helps since he has to put on such a bigger-than-life persona. I'm reminded of the best of Cagney here.Shame then that he can't quite bring up the picture to greatness. It's a rousing, handsomely made picture, and I'm sure the filmmakers wouldn't have it any other way. When one sees the big epic battle with the teamsters, the workers, with bodies going blow by blow and the music pounding and rising like a storm, it's easy to get involved in the action. It's got the production values to go however it wants. But there's something missing to it making it a classic, as opposed to just a good, above-average TV movie (yes, I used the vehement description). It goes without saying the dialog is almost as filthy as another Mamet project from 92, Glengarry Glen Ross (matter fact it's fitting both films have practically all men in the casts). However there's something too clean and lean to the direction. It sounds as though I can't criticize it well enough, but... it's depth, basically. We're given facts, speculation (i.e. the ending), and bombastic personalities. But in the end, it's still the factor of Nicholson that makes it a bit more special that it would be otherwise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm halfway through a biography about Jimmy Hoffa but couldn't wait to finish it before the chance to watch this bio-pic arose. I will still finish the book as I wasn't completely taken with this ambitious and sometimes imaginative film.My problem with it was principally the construction. While I accept the premise of grafting on an ending to resolve the mystery of Hoffa's last movements, the audience manipulation involved, which sees violence erupt from an unexpected source and dissolve into a Peckinpah-ish slow motion "dance of death", and repeated returns to the, in truth, less than compulsive build-up to the climax, only serves to slow down the momentum of the film. In addition, the lack of any definite kind of date-marking of events also served to confuse as the narrative jumps forward in time giving little indication of the time-spans involved.Danny DeVito's direction has some imaginative, if occasionally derivative, flourishes but for all that Hoffa is undoubtedly an interesting character, I felt the film dragged along until the final quarter. I would also take issue with the portrayal of Hoffa himself as it seemed to me the writing and direction wanted to significantly whitewash his shady dealings, especially the violence and other dirty tricks he orchestrated and employed for his own ends. I get that he may have been a hero to his members, but it almost seems that the film doesn't think he should have gone to jail at all. In addition, his celebrated encounters with his nemesis Bobby Kennedy fizzle out almost as quickly as they're introduced and as for the depiction of a family life to add some depth to his character, well, there was very little of that too.As for the acting, I'm no fan of the over-actor supreme Jack Nicholson, but he certainly looks the part, although, as ever, you can see him going through the gears for a big scene, usually involving him screaming the "F" word ad nauseum. De Vito himself does okay as his best bud who refuses to sell him out and JT Walsh performs well as the one-time lackey now leader, who does.While a watchable effort, I felt this movie overdid the questionable respect its title character was due right down to the lush, omnipresent orchestral score which I felt all told amounted to far too soft a treatment of such a contentious individual.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hoffa, starring Jack Nicholson as James Riddle Hoffa (the long time missing Teamsters boss) shows Nicholoson at closely his best. This accredited actor has always been prone to drama, and the creation of it, and Hoffa proves to be no different. Combined with Bobby Ciaro (Danny Devito) we see a reflection on the life of the Teamster boss and the events that have been anticipated to lead to his disappearance in 1975. It is through the fictional character of Ciaro that we can begin to get a feel of Hoffa's true self, moreover the close resemblance of Nicholoson to Hoffa adds an even more enjoyed likeness between movie and real life. I strongly urge all those who are history buffs (like myself) to see this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What makes me recommend seeing this film is the mesmerizing performance by Nicholson as Jimmy Hoffa. Every once in a great while an actor will come up with a performance so complete he becomes the character. Performances such as Michael Douglas as Gordon Gekko or George C. Scott as Patton should not be missed. Nicholson's portrayal of Hoffa qualifies as one of the great character roles in the history of Hollywood. The story probably confuses more than it clarifies the history of the Teamsters and Hoffa. It certainly portrays Hoffa as a righteous crusader for the working man, in reality he was far more concerned with his own aggrandizement than anything else. The script is fairly uninspired and Danny DeVito is more annoying than interesting as Hoffa's right hand man, but Nicholson saves this film by the sheer force of his performance. How he wasn't even nominated for an Oscar is beyond me, but then again the Academy doesn't know anything about movies anyway. Put aside your cynicism for two hours and witness a great actor at work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this film a long time ago and I thought it was a pretty good movie. Jack Nicholson is once again a natural and Danny Devito did okay for this film. He wasn't that great but he did pretty well. The best thing about this film is the Cinematography by Stephen H. Burum. He didn't maverick camera work here in this film and he truly deserved that Oscar nomination. He is my favorite; my favorite Cinematographer is Robert Richardson. I bet that some people got offended because of the rapid-fire profanity. You see, David Mamet is a very good playwright. Most of the films that he writes often has pervasive language like this one Hoffa, Glengarry Glen Ross and American Buffalo. This film Hoffa is the story about the rise and fall of Jimmy Hoffa and his bad times when he went to prison for fraud to his disappearance in 1975. It gets people thinking: Did Jimmy Hoffa get kidnapped or did he get murdered. Nicholson's performance could have earned an Oscar nomination. Anyway, if you love Jack Nicholson then you can probably see this film.</fullReview>

Many of the scenes were filmed on built cardboard sets which was very obvious throughout and looked shockingly bad. Danny De Vito's character was completely fictional and seemed to have been placed in the movie due to his own admiration for Jimmy Hoffa.

This last fact led to the movie being shut out by the establishment, because it was too accurate for the Feds! The claim that the film took too much literary license is a farce.

		<shortDescription>A Pleasant Surprise By Danny De Vito</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I went to see "Hoffa", I was rather negatively predisposed: Since I am not an American, I had never even heard of Jimmy Hoffa before and his story didn't sound very exciting. Even worse, Danny De Vito's role as a director was not very promising. If it wasn't that David Mammet had written the script, and Jack Nicholson had the lead role, I would never be motivated to go and see the movie.Fortunately, I was totally wrong on both counts, namely "Hoffa"'s story and De Vito's direction. Let us start with the story, first: The movie portrays us the life of a charismatic yet controversial Teamster leader, Jimmy Hoffa (Nicholson), who transformed the labor union movement in the late 60s. We follow him through the eyes of his close friend and associate Bobby Ciaro (De Vito), while he does not hesitate to do anything, including collaborating with the organized crime, in order to get his goals achieved. Although the film stops short of accusing him of personally profiting from these acts (a theory that I read in an IMDb forum which could well be quite true), it nonetheless gives us the impression of a man ready to use unorthodox and unscrupulous methods to achieve his great ambitions. All in all, it is a quite interesting story, where an always grand Jack Nicholson shows his great acting talent.And now let us get to the second point which is Danny De Vito's direction. To be honest, I was never really impressed by the man as an actor, and even in this film his acting contribution is limited, in my opinion. So imagine my surprise when I found out that De Vito has excellent directing skills: "Hoffa" is directed very artfully, with clever scene transitions, good character portrayals, and a very good tempo despite the frequent flash-backs. In fact, the fact that De Vito could come up with such a good direction was a really pleasant surprise, and it is a pity that he hasn't pursued this path much further.Overall rating 7/10.</fullReview>

I admit that I can't verify the movie's accuracy - especially the end - but this look at Teamsters Pres. Jimmy Hoffa (Jack Nicholson, doing a good job as always) is worth seeing, if only as a look at history. A particularly blood-freezing scene is when the thugs attack the workers. Equally good as Nicholson is director Danny DeVito as Hoffa's assistant Bobby Ciaro.So, it's not the best movie for either man, but still worth seeing. It's weird to imagine Bobby Kennedy going after Hoffa like that. Also starring Armand Assante, J.T. Walsh, John C. Reilly, Frank Whaley, Robert Prosky, Richard Schiff, a cameo by Tim Burton, and even Jack Nicholson's daughter Jennifer in a brief appearance.</fullReview>

However, I thought I would mention that David Newman's score is decent and he has created one of the greatest themes in motion picture music history. I didn't see Hoffa when it first came out, so I didn't know that it was used as the movie music for the early trailers of Quiz Show and several other really good movies. But after years of hunting down that piece of music, I'm happy to report that the Hoffa theme is the original music for a bunch of trailers. It is awe-inspiring, about the only thing awe-inspiring in this movie. I think the first review here hits all of the marks about the drama on screen or lack of drama on screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jack Nicholson - false nose firmly in place - chews the scenery from one end of this overblown, pseudo-epic biography of the controversial boss of the Teamster Union to the other. The fact I substituted the word 'controversial' for 'corrupt but well-meaning' in the preceding sentence says volumes about the abject failure of this film. Was he corrupt? Certainly. Was he well-meaning? I dunno. In fact, I left this film knowing surprising little about Hoffa - a great failing considering the length of this borathon. Screenwriter David Mamet served up tough talk instead insight while director Danny Devito floundered haplessly. Some directors were born to direct epics. Trust me, Devito isn't one of them. The rule of thumb for this film is: The more people crammed into a scene, the worse it turned out. Some of the action sequences are nothing short of incomprehensible; you can't tell who was one who's side. Fortunately, you didn't care one way or another. In the end, what annoyed me most about the film was Devito's hubris. He gave his fictional character all of the sex scenes, and boy oh boy the ladies seemed to love him. Who cares? Why did we need to see that? Couldn't the audience instead see how Jimmy Hoffa related to women - not his fictional sidekick. That might have given him a well-needed touch of humanity. Speaking of the Hoffa character, Nicholson's performance is strictly one note. His make-up, however, wasn't bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jack Nicholson and Danny DeVito are both fine actors, and Jimmy Hoffa surely led a life fascinating enough to have made a very interesting movie, but somehow even with strong leads and an interesting subject the end result just doesn't work.Nicholson was all right as Hoffa - but no more than all right. He seemed to be forcing the role a bit in places. DeVito (who also directed, with mixed results I thought) was passable as Hoffa's right hand man Bobby Ciaro, but - to me at least - just didn't really suit the part very well.The movie is constructed as a series of flashbacks. We find at the start that Hoffa and Ciaro are waiting outside a diner for - well, someone. It's never really defined who they're waiting for, but Hoffa gets progressively agitated as time progresses and this someone doesn't show up. Meanwhile, Ciaro reminisces about his past experiences with Hoffa - from their first meeting, through the years of union organizing, fights with the Kennedy administration, encounters with organized crime, imprisonment, etc. The flashbacks left me empty. They tended to raise important subjects, but then never really seemed to have specific conclusions. Overall, I thought the movie was poorly constructed and quite disappointing as a result.In a biographical movie such as this one, one of two things should happen: either you should feel you know the title character by the time it's over, or you have the desire to get to know him. Neither happened for me in this. Jimmy Hoffa is a character I can just as soon do without.2/10</fullReview>

It's like your watching this great historically accurate movie and then all-of-a-sudden it cuts to a scene of DeVito getting laid by some beautiful woman. I mean how does that even fit into the story, except to boost DeVito's ego? I don't know about you, but I don't want to see DeVito's promiscuous fantasies being acted out in an otherwise good movie just because he has the ability to write his own part. If you're gonna be writing the script for your own character and the greatest thing you can think of is gratuitously getting your character laid by lots of different women throughout the movie? Uugggh- gross! Am I the only one that was bothered by this? Is there some historical reason that his character was actually based on a person who needed to be portrayed in that way?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Was Jimmy Hoffa the Ultimate Mamet Hero?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Mamet's script for Hoffa doesn't go overboard to tryconvincing us that James R. Hoffa was a saint. It becomes clearvery quickly, though, that the Chicago-born Mamet feels a certainkinship with the Teamster Leader and as a result, Mamet's Hoffahas more than a certain kinship with many of Mamet's theatricalanti-heroes. Jimmy Hoffa is, simply put, a working man. He's adedicated, passionate, corrupt, manly man. He's full of bluster andego and talk. If he landed in the world of Glengarry Glen Ross orAmerican Buffalo, he would be right at home. That being said,Mamet's Hoffa probably deserved a better home than the moviethat Mamet actually wrote and Danny DeVito directed. Despite atypically committed performance by Jack Nicholson, Hoffa fallsapart because there's nothing to hold it together. It's like aconnect-the-dot puzzle that nobody bothered to connect. You kindaknow what it's supposed to be, but you're taking a lot of faith.The movie follows Hoffa (Nicholson) and his composite of a bestfriend Bobby (Danny DeVito) from Jimmy's earliest days recruitingtruckers on the side of the road. We go from strike to rally toTeamster election and Jimmy picks up a variety of friends andsupporters whose actual relationship to the man remain vague.Hoffa seems to have a wife. He seems to have made connectionsto the mob. He seems to have had an antagonistic relationshipwith Bobby Kennedy. Unfortunately, I knew all of these thingsbecause I knew them coming in and having seen the movie, Ihonestly know no more now than I did when I started. Hoffa makesit clear that Jimmy was corrupt but that he was always corrupt inservice of the working man. I guess I just wanted more than that.Mamet's script just bounces around and makes it impossible todifferentiate between the real people and the composites createdto move the plot along. This isn't really a movie about history.And the director, DeVito sometimes seems to recognize that thefilm is unhinged from true history. Several outdoor scenes makeno effort to hide the fact that they seem to have been shot indoorson a soundstage. He instead plays up the almost surrealisticorange sunsets or preternaturally starry skies. Had this been hismethodology for the whole movie, perhaps it would have beeninteresting. He could have played the entire Hoffa story as alegend, as a tall tale, like Paul Bunyan or Pecos Bill. But othertimes, he seems to be going for a realistic portrait of a historicalfigure and it just doesn't work. DeVito's direction has a confusingover-reliance on overhead shots, which try as I might I just couldn'tunderstand.The film is structured in a series of only slightly motivatedflashbacks recounted on what may be the last day of Hoffa's life.The transitions in and out of the flashbacks are more than a littleclunky and draw more attention to just how arbitrary the wholeventure is. While most members of the audience may be able toguess what's going to happen in the "present" sequences, theymay be at a total loss to explain why things keep going back tovarious points in the past. Once again, there's just nothing holdingthis together.Nicholson's performance is really the only reason to watch Hoffa,and even that's just because you can tell he's trying so hard. HisChicago accent frequently wavers in intensity, but the character isalways thinking and always attacking and it's fun to watch (thoughyou wish the movie didn't need to be 2:20 long). DeVito's part isunderwritten and it's not the actor's best work. And nobody in therest of the cast really stands out. DeVito even manages to get abland performance from the usually excellent J.T. Walsh (R.I.P.).**Final Tiny Spoiler**The final mistake in Hoffa, and the mistake that destroys the moviefor me, is that the ending makes a totally uninteresting speculationon the mysterious disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa. It's better toleave a mystery than to provide such a anti-climactic resolution. I'dgive Hoffa a 5/10 entirely for Nicholson and for Stephen Burum'shandsome cinematography.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was good. I am heavily into movies that are adaptations of either real life(THIS, JFK, FIDEL,etc)or books(Thomas Harris', marvel comics). For my money, those are the best. I just found it a little funny that two BATMAN villains, and old friends from "One flew over the cukoos nest" reunited for this serious real story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a superficial portrayal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this film a little disappointing in that the portrayal of Hoffa seems to be superficial and with little depth. The film makes poor use of Jack Nicholson's talent.Also, if the film pretends to be an account of Hoffa's life then it should have been much more factual. It is fine if some aspects of a film like this are fictional but it would have been better to closely align it with actual research.The direction and visual effects are unimpressive. They seem gimmicky as if those who created them were trying to copy the genius of Orson Welles but without the genius or attention to detail.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When there is no hero, and no love story, why make the movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I freely admit I have not even finished watching this movie on DVD before reviewing it.I know what happened to Hoffa, so I haven't been gripping the edge of my seat. In fact, I have not been gripping it since I started to watch this in fits and starts since last night.I have an excuse. I live in Tunis, where there is not much action, and the TV is terrible so I buy a lot of films on DVDs. If it's English and has a big name star, I'll buy it.But what in the name of whatever was the reason for making this film? No one believes Hoffa was a saint. And they made up the deVito character. Hoffa's jibes at Bobby Kennedy, his uselessness and the family's history as rum-runners is good, but we knew that.I like it that there can be films giving the other side to the dominance of capitalism in the States, but this does not do this.Anyway, movies are meant to entertain, to move, to help you identify with a hero, to tell a story of success towards a goal, to show a great love story...If I had been watching this film in a cinema all the way back in the early 90s with even the best love object of my life, I would have said about 45 mins through, 'I'm off to the pub, luv', and I am sure she would have followed me.I suppose in those days if you had Nicholson and Mamet, you had a success.But no.And if you'll excuse me, because it is raining very heavily outside and anyway it is close to curfew at 10pm because of our recent revolution, I will pour a very large whisky and cringe through however many minutes are left.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top-Notch Performances Save This One</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Hoffa" is a somewhat strange movie that tries hard, but its subject matter is hard to really focus on. The life and possible last moments of Jimmy Hoffa (Jack Nicholson) are shown with flashbacks that are sometimes fast and sometimes as slow as a snail. Danny DeVito's direction is above-average and so is David Mamet's over-achieving screenplay. However, the performers from a top-notch cast save "Hoffa". Nicholson is super as usual. DeVito always comes through when he's teamed with Nicholson. The same is true for the late J.T. Walsh. Armand Assante, Robert Prosky, John C. Reilly, and Frank Whaley all do well in limited action. Not a great movie, but still an interesting commentary. 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A vicious film about unionism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hoffa is a film with two distinguished actors: Nicholson and DeVito. However, it is also a propaganda film of a rather vicious composition, with greatly reduces its quality. It tries to portray Jimmy Hoffa, one of the contemporary leading American union leaders. This is done in such a downgrading way, which is not substantiated by evidence, that it must be painful to all those who valued the man. In addition it implies that unions are interwoven with organized crime. It is hard to understand what motivated DeVito to direct and produce this film. Is it the desire to shock and provoke? Union busting? I don't know all the details (who does?), but imagine that Hoffa was an exceptional and controversial personality. In fact Stallone made a similar film "FIST" based on the life of Hoffa, which is much more sympathetic and nevertheless tactfully abstains from using Hoffas name. Let us first look at the facts, that emerge from the film Hoffa. Jimmy Hoffa started as a local union official with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, a union of Transport personnel. He advocated a confronting method of collective bargaining, including an aggressive attitude of picket lines (which probably fitted the trade). In this way he succeeded in realizing results for the workers, although he also disregarded the orders of the national union board. There were also defeats. One time he lead a demonstration against a railway company, that employed a large bunch of thugs (private security?), who beat several of the demonstrators to death. Eventually he was elected president of the Teamsters. In the mean time a senatorial committee under the chairmanship of Robert kennedy accused him of having connections with communists and the mafia (a rather funny combination - but it is of coarse true that political figures can be affiliated with crime). Later Hoffa was accused of abusing the pension fund of the Teamsters, and convicted. However, the evidence is not really conclusive. Any way, after five years Hoffa was freed on parole. Shortly afterwards, he mysteriously disappeared. These appear to be the facts. Now the fictional (dramatized) additions of DeVito: at the start Nicholson (playing Hoffa) lighted the warehouse of a rebellious employer. Hoffa made a deal with the mafia, allowing them to rob the cargo of Teamster trucks. Hoffa managed the pension fund of the Teamsters together with the mafia. After his release from prison Hoffa wanted to regain power of the Teamsters and tried to murder one of its leaders. DeVito knows (so he tells us) that Hoffa was actually liquidated by his "former mafia mates". If for some reason you really truly hate unions, this is the film for you. Otherwise I recommend you to shun this portrayal. If you are just interested in collective bargaining or even sympathize with unionism, there are definitely more informative and realistic accounts. Try Salt of the Earth, Norma Rae, Bread and Roses, Harlan County War, Matewan, Man of Iron. Or take a look at the other films about social action, that I have reviewed here on IMDb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Makes Me Question History</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Danny DiVitto, Jack Nicholson and a slick production design are the main positive contributors to this work. The story itself does make one ponder history, in that it attempts to make one rethink the world, as remembered by survivors of that era.While some still stand tall and proud and proclaim Hoffa as having been the greatest champion of working Americans ever to walk the land, others still believe he stole millions from the pension and welfare funds of those American workers he represented.Was he the victim of conniving teamsters, gangsters, and government agents? or was he his own worst enemy? I guess we'll never really know, but one thing is sure: The saying, "Gone as Hoffa," still applies today and probably will for at least two decades more.All in all? It's not suitable for Friday/Saturday/Family viewing and should be watched only if you're a dedicated Nicholson fan, DiVitto fan, or an American History buff.It rates a 5.6/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved every second of every minute of this movie. This is definitely a must see for all you people who just love movies with an actual story. Truly a masterpiece, no doubts. It was so good, I can't even begin to find the words to explain it to it's well deserved gratification. If you saw it once go see it again, if you haven't already. And if you already saw it more than once...Hell, who could blame ya!? It was excellent, and as a matter of fact, I think I just might go watch it again....for the twentieth time. Go see it and enjoy it, I promise it won't be that hard to enjoy. It's well worth it, NO! IT'S FAR BEYOND WELL WORTH IT!!! Trust me. Oh yeah...I forgot to mention that it's based on a true story of James Riddle Hoffa's accurences, no lies! It's actually true, SO GO SEE IT, ASAP!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overblown</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is watchable, thanks to great production design. Jack Nicholson is very good in the title role. The movie does a good job in places about how Jimmy Hoffa rose and eventually fell. However, the film has too much affection for Jimmy Hoffa. Despite what director Danny DeVito says on his DVD commentary, Jimmy Hoffa was a criminal who deserved to go to jail. Hoffa didn't care anything about the law and believed in the end justifies the means. That way of thinking ended up costing him his life. But you would never know that by watching this movie. Yes, Hoffa was beneficial to the American Labor movement, but the film glosses over his faults. Even Robert Kennedy can't seem to stand up to him. His connections to the mob are only vaguely hinted at. The movie is told in annoying flashbacks where we are not sure what is going on. A better movie about this historical figure is necessary.</fullReview>
