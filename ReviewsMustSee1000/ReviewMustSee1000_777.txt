		<shortDescription>Breathtaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To call this film well-acted is like calling "Citizen Kane" a nice movie and Alfred Hitchcock an "okay" director. William Wyler was known for eliciting excellent performances from his actors (he's responsible for them receiving a record 14 Oscars in acting; more than twice as many as any other director) and in "The Heiress" he's in top form. This movie should be played in every acting class ever taught to show the brilliance of subtlety and range of expressions possible when one is conveying a character's inner emotions.Olivia De Havilland is a beautiful woman, but you believe she's an ungainly bundle of shy awkwardness in the role of Catherine Sloper. And her transformation to a cruel wounded creature is perfectly believable. And Ralph Richardson as Dr. Sloper and Miriam Hopkins as Aunt Lavinia are letter perfect beside her. Sir Ralph (at least, I THINK he was knighted) can do more with stillness and a flick of an eyebrow than any actor I've ever seen (including Brando, Penn and any other method actor you care to toss into the mix). He was robbed at the Oscars.Montgomery Clift was beautiful and seductive and, except for a couple of moments where he seemed too 1950s instead of 1850s, just right for the part. He almost holds his own with Sir Ralph when they meet to discuss him marrying Catherine, but he did do better work in "A Place In The Sun" and "From Here To Eternity."Wyler's simplicity and grace in directing only enhanced the story. The use of mirrors to deepen emotional content (as in when Dr. Sloper, now ill, goes to his office after getting the cold shoulder from Catherine) is stunning. So is his willingness to let a scene play out rather than force along the pacing of the moment, as so many directors do, today (as in when Catherine offers to help her father rewrite his will).There are no easy answers in this movie. You can think Dr. Sloper is right about Morris and only wants to protect his daughter, or you can see his actions as those of a vindictive man who blames her for the death of his beloved wife (in childbirth). Morris could be a fortune hunter, or he could be a man who does care for Catherine, in his own way, and would make her happy. Or all of the above. The whole movie is so beautifully composed, it's breathtaking. A definite must see for anyone who appreciates great stories well-told.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding Henry James Adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Certainly among the finest literary adaptations, "The Heiress" was based on Henry James's novel, "Washington Square" and features arguably Olivia de Havilland's finest screen performance. Morris Townsend , a handsome young man with ambiguous motives pursues Catherine Sloper, a plain spinster, who is slightly past marriageable age and possesses limited social skills. The young woman, who is the heiress of the title, is vulnerable prey for a penniless fortune hunter.However, Montgomery Clift plays Townsend in an enigmatic manner, and viewers can debate his true intentions. Catherine's father, played by Ralph Richardson, and her Aunt Lavinia, played by Miriam Hopkins, take opposite sides in Townsend's pursuit of Catherine. Although both her father and her aunt appear to see through the handsome suitor, Aunt Lavinia is practical and sensitive to her niece's emotional needs, and she counsels compromise in pursuit of happiness, if only fleeting. However, Catherine's father is unyielding and essentially unloving in his opposition to the match. Throughout, Dr. Sloper compares his daughter's virtues to those of his late wife, and Catherine comes up lacking in every quality that he values. Sloper threatens to disinherit his daughter if she marries the suitor.Montgomery Clift may appear shallow and transparent to some, but in essence those are the traits of his character. While Morris is slick and obviously fawning, he is not intelligent enough to be totally deceptive. Only someone as naive and needy as Olivia could fail to grasp that Morris may want something more than her love. Olivia de Havilland transcends her other performances and skillfully and convincingly evolves from a shy, introverted girl into a strong, vengeful woman. De Havilland has often portrayed women who appear genteel and soft on the outside, but whose hearts and backbones can harden into pure steel (e.g. Gone with the Wind; Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte), and Catherine Sloper is the finest of those roles. With able support from Richardson and Hopkins, Clift and de Havilland make the most of an outstanding screenplay, which was adapted from a stage play. William Wyler directs with a sure hand, and the atmospheric cinematography captures 19th century New York life. Period films are often unraveled by their hairstyles, which generally owe more to the year in which the film was made rather than that in which the story is set. However, even the coiffures excel in "The Heiress." De Havilland's hair looks authentic 19th century and underscores Wyler's fastidious attention to detail.With an award-winning de Havilland performance, a handsome Montgomery Clift on the brink of stardom, and an engrossing Henry James story, "The Heiress" is one of the finest films of the 1940's. Without qualification, the film holds up to and merits repeat viewings if only to better argue the underlying motives of Clift and the fateful decision that de Havilland has to make.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic Film, fantastic Olivia!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film about 10 years ago and have never forgotten it. Why it is not available on DVD - I just don't understand it.Olivia de Havilland is heart-breaking as the woman who is so badly treated by her suitors and her father. I felt the portrayal of her father and the cruel way he treats her was so well played out and you could see how her soul is slowly being crushed. I was so amazed and touched by the film, I went and got the book it is based on, Henry James' Washington Square. It was superb but nothing will make me forget the look on Olivia De Havilland's face at the end of the movie where you can see her features harden and all her youthful sweetness is gone. Brilliant film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant superb astonishing movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had the pleasure to watch again "The Heiress" 1949 movie tonight, and it is absolutely brilliant! ; what a gem! the script, the directing, set designs, lighting, but above all the acting, are all extraordinary. The performances by the three main characters are simply superb. Olivia De Haviland is utterly convincing in her transition from a, not so young, unwanted and unloved woman, into 3 different phases of her personality as the plot unfolds ; all her acting is beautiful. Montgomery Cliff delivers a great performance and mastery at portraying deceit with a charming smile. Ralph Richardson commands respect and holds an air of definite authority as Catherine's father. His aristocratic demeanor is also very well portrayed for a prominent New York gentleman of the late 1800's. The human tragedy of miscommunication between beings unfolds with impeccable timing. The film by today standards may be considered as slow, but underneath is found a study of characters that runs very deeply. The contrast between the real Love and the pretense is striking. You cannot help but feel sorry for the way the characters are held captives to a set of stiff conventions and untold feelings. A human tragedy at its best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Master" in WASHINGTON SQUARE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Because he so identified with England in his last thirty years (and even became a British citizen during World War I) people tend to forget that Henry James was an American - as American as his celebrated psychologist/philosopher brother William (the "good" James Boys, as opposed to their non-relatives Frank and Jesse), and his fellow Gilded Age novelists Sam Clemens/"Mark Twain" and William Dean Howells. His early writings, including "The American", "The Portait Of A Lady", and "The Europeans" were written while he was an American citizen. His later classics, "The Spoils Of Poynton", "What Maisie Knew", "The Ambassadors", "The Golden Bowl", and "The Wings Of The Dove", were written when he resided in England. The novels he wrote through 1897 ("What Maissie Knew" being the last of these) were short and controlled in terms of descriptions. But his final set of novels (beginning with "The Ambassadors")had a more flowery writing, as James struggled to find "le mot juste" in every description. Many like this, but I find it a peculiar failure. It takes him three pages of description in "The Wings Of The Dove" to show Mily Theale is looking down from an Alpine peak to the valley thousands of feet below."Washington Square" was written in the late 1870s, and was based on an anecdote James heard about a fortune hunter who tried to move in on one of James' neighbors in Manhattan. The neighbor, when a young woman, was wealthy and and would be wealthier when her father died (she was an only child). The father did not think highly of the daughter's choice of boyfriend, and a war of wills between the two men left the young woman scarred. James took the story and fleshed it out.One has to recall that while ultimately this is based on James' great novel, the film proper is based on the dramatization by the Goetzs. So there are changes (one of which I will mention later). But the basic confrontation between the father and the suitor remains true. On stage the father was played by Basil Rathbone, and in his memoirs ("In And Out Of Character"), Rathbone makes a case that Dr. Sloper (his role) was not the villain in the novel - it was Sloper who was trying to protect his naive daughter Catherine from the clutches of fortune hunting suitor Morris Townshend. It's a nice argument, and one can believe that Rathbone/Sloper was less villainous than Morris. But his desire to protect Catherine does not prevent his cold and aloof treatment of her - he has little respect for her personality. This is tied to the Doctor's constant mourning of his wife (Catherine's perfect mother). It enables Dr. Sloper to compare and belittle his daughter.The Goetz play and screenplay show (as does the novel) that the battle of wills between the two men only hurts poor, simple Catherine. There are only two major changes from the novel. First, in the novel Dr. Sloper does not discover how his contempt for his child loses her love. He only sees that Catherine will not see reason about what a loser Morris is. So he does disinherit her (she only has her mother's fortune of $10,000.00 a year, not her father's additional $20,000.00). Secondly, when Morris does return in the end in the novel, years have passed, and he is a querulous fat man. The dramatic high point when Catherine locks the door of the house on Morris is not in the novel.Olivia De Haviland's performance as Catherine is among her most sympathetic and satisfying ones, as she tries to navigate between two egotists, and manages to avoid a shipwreck that neither would totally disapprove of for their own selfish reasons). Her second Oscar was deserved. Ralph Richardson's Sloper is a curious combination of cultured gentleman, egotist, and caring father, who only realizes what his behavior costs him when he is dying and it is too late. Montgomery Clift's Morris is a clever scoundrel, able to hide his fortune-hunting tricks behind a mask of care and seeming devotion to Catherine. Only when he learns that she has broken with her father does Morris show his true colors - suggesting that a reconciliation may still be possible. Finally there is Miriam Hopkins as Aunt Penniman, a talkative blood relative who does have a sense of reality and romance in her - she does try to make a case with Dr. Sloper that he accept Morris for Catherine's emotional happiness, but Sloper rejects the idea because he distrusts Morris so much. These four performances dominate the film, and make it a wonderful, enriching experience - as only "the Master's" best writings usually are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Her father had broken its spring . . ."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of my favorite movies, based on one of my favorite books. Henry James sitting in the audience would have been proud of this insightful filming of his novel, "Washington Square," because the film retains so much of the subtlety of his own writing. Usually, Hollywood eliminates any of the subtlety of a great author's voice (see the recent remake of "Washington Square" if you want to see a real Hollywoodization of a novel ? it actually depicts a young Catherine peeing her pants in public ? an inane "Animal House"-type Hollywood requirement that degrading a woman by showing her peeing is an erotic boost for any movie). But "The Heiress" is pure James. Olivia de Havilland is perfect as James' unlikely heroine, going from an awkward gawky girl eager to please her beloved father, to a simple, loving young woman who steadfastly stands by her lover, to an embittered middle-aged woman who understands that, as Henry James says, "the great facts of her career were that Morris Townsend had trifled with her affection, and that her father had broken its spring." If you liked this movie, read the novel. Listen to James' descriptions of Catherine and her father and see if this isn't exactly what Ralph Richardson and Olivia deHavilland portrayed: "Doctor Sloper would have liked to be proud of his daughter; but there was nothing to be proud of in poor Catherine." "Love demands certain things as a right; but Catherine had no sense of her rights; she had only a consciousness of immense and unexpected favors." " 'She is so soft, so simple-minded, she would be such an easy victim! A bad husband would have remarkable facilities for making her miserable; for she would have neither the intelligence nor the resolution to get the better of him.' " "She was conscious of no aptitude for organized resentment." "In reality, she was the softest creature in the world.""She had been so humble in her youth that she could now afford to have a little pride . . . Poor Catherine's dignity was not aggressive; it never sat in state; but if you pushed far enough you could find it. Her father had pushed very far."Clifton Fadiman, in his introduction to "Washington Square," says that the novel's moral is: "to be right is not enough. Dr. Sloper is 'right'; he is right about the character of Townsend, he is right about his own character, he is right about the character of Catherine. But because he can offer only the insufficient truth of irony where the sufficient truth of love is required, he partly ruins his daughter's life, and lives out his own in spiritual poverty."Dr. Sloper's contemptuous "rightness," penetrating and accurate as it is, is no substitute for the kindness and love his adoring daughter craves from him. In "The Rainmaker," a great Katharine Hepburn movie, also about a plain woman seeking love, only this time with a loving father, the character of Hepburn's father sums up this moral that "to be right is not enough" when he says to his self-righteous son: "Noah, you're so full of what's right that you can't see what's good!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If I could choose one word to describe this film, it would be "masterpiece"...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Along with THE PRISONER OF ZENDA (1937), PHANTOM OF THE OPERA (1943), and PETER IBBETSON (1935), this is one of my favorite films set in the 19th Century. It's a truly excellent film that won tremendous critical acclaim upon its release but was a box office failure in comparison to the enormous success of Paramount's other film of 1949, SAMSON AND DELILAH. Whereas Hedy Lamarr's magnificent beauty and screen presence were the only redeeming features of SAMSON AND DELILAH, THE HEIRESS is a dramatic masterpiece and a film that has withstood the test of time. Its star, Olivia de Havilland, went home with a deserving second Best Actress Oscar for her outstanding performance as Catherine Sloper, the naive and plain title character.The direction, acting, casting, writing, production values, and music score of this film are perfect. I have no complaints whatsoever on any of these departments. However, others have criticized these departments of the film and I would like to point some of these criticisms out. Some have remarked that Montgomery Clift's performance as Morris Townsend is "too modern," especially in his speech. I found his performance authentic to the period?how else would a charming 19th Century New York gentleman act, let alone a crafty fortune hunter? Others have also criticized the film as a "melodramatic soap opera." This film is a breath of fresh air amongst the vast crowd of heavily melodramatic films that were a trademark of 1940s cinema?the sincere performances are subtle and underplayed here, as is the Oscar-winning Aaron Copland music score which rarely reaches the level of "melodramatic musical cue" throughout the film. Due to the film's level of excellence, the film is timeless and could be viewed comfortably amongst many members of today's generation despite its meticulous black-and-white cinematography by Leo Tover. I have seen this landmark film three times so far and it improves with each viewing?I am also ready to buy the upcoming DVD of the film in early 2007. Although I'm not a huge fan of William Wyler's other films, including the hokey "British" wartime melodrama MRS. MINIVER (1942), THE HEIRESS is one of the few films of his that belongs on my shelf sometime soon.Although this is generally a thinking person's film, the story is simple and I suppose all of us could relate to Catherine Sloper in a way. All of us have faced the dominating, somewhat emotionally abusive presence of our parent(s) at some point in our lives, especially when the parent(s) disapproves of the new friend or intended future spouse we have discovered. However, Catherine's father (Ralph Richardson) proves right in a shocking revelation here. As with Catherine, I can't help but despise Dr. Sloper despite his correct views on Morris Townsend.Next to the wholly convincing performance of Olivia de Havilland, my favorite element of the film is the haunting music score by Aaron Copland. It's a tragic yet beautiful score that stirs the emotions in all the right places in the film. As I may have said before, the score is used sparingly and rarely reaches a sentimental level.In short, this marvelous film is a timeless masterpiece. And who could not forget the ambiguous and abrupt ending?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Catherine Under-rated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this film many times and each time draw a new facet from the Catherine - Dr Austin Sloper - Moris Townsend non-love triangle. But it is my opinion after all these years that everybody underrates Catherine. Many children grow up in the shadow of an esteemed parent whose legend reaches near mythical proportions. Certainly that's Catherine's misfortune. While her mother was not a world famous starlet, she was worshiped by Dr Austin Sloper and even rambling air-headed Aunt Pennyman cautions Dr Austin that he has elevated Catherine's mother to near Goddess stature to which no woman dare compare.Yet in spite of his open wound constantly gnawing at him whenever Catherine cannot ascend to her mother's level, Dr Austin sees himself as a pure rationalist, one who even contrives to control his own death and the security of Catherine's fortune thereafter.But here's how everyone underrates Catherine: everyone looks at the hard lesson she's dealt without excusing her youthful inexperience and almost no one sees how she's able in the ante-bellum period to be an independent woman, to run a household, give commands to subordinates including the interfering Aunt Pennyman and interact with Maid Moriah (called Maria in the credits but consistently pronounced Moriah in the film) taking charge without talking down to her. Her true voice comes out in the foiled elopement but it is her father's voice: rationality and command.Her father was waiting in vain for her mother reincarnate.She is her father's daughter, without the musical talent of her mother or her mother's sociability (then called gaiety in times spoken of.) Catherine even inherited her surgeon father's talent for stitch-work which is put to embroidery.The costuming and music is fantastic. The love song though composed for this film sounds like a tune from the ante-bellum era.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Multi-layered masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is often said that when something seems too good to be true, it probably is. That may be so, but there are exceptions to every rule. THE HEIRESS is certainly cause for exception.This film carries with it an emotional power that is unequaled by so many films in the history of American cinema. There really are no bad roles in this film, and all of the supporting players turn in good performances with what they are given. Miriam Hopkins and Montgomery Clift give tremendously adept performances as Aunt Penniman and Morris, but the film is carried to completely different heights by Olivia de Havilland and Ralph Richardson.As Catherine walks up the stairs after being abandoned by Morris, it is wholly possible for the viewer to feel the weight of her pain and the burden of her struggle. It almost seems like the staircase is interminable, and that she will never make it to the top. When Catherine fumbles around for her dance card, nervous and excited due to Morris' attentiveness, one might be able to sense her giddiness, and want to reach through the screen and assist her. So real and so palpable is de Havilland's performance, that even her most seasoned fan can watch this film and completely forget that he is watching Olivia de Havilland; this film is about Catherine Sloper, and she is the only one de Havilland presents from the opening frame to the end credits.Ralph Richardson gives a performance of equal magnitude in his portrayal of Dr. Austin Sloper. Richardson creates a rather believable, rather human duality in the character of Dr. Sloper -- after countless viewings of this film, I am still not completely sure if he is more guided by love ("I don't want to disinherit my only child!") or spite ("Only I know what I lost when she died...and what I got in her place."). Richardson tackles each facet of the character with great integrity, never once wavering in his skill and performance. On a technical note, this film is fascinating for director William Wyler's use of space. When several people are conversing in one area, he does not always have them relating to each other all on one level. In the bon voyage scene, for example, Dr. Sloper stands nearest to the camera, gazing away from the action happening to his left. The viewer then has the opportunity to see Morris and Catherine's tender parting moment, Sloper's disgusted reaction, and Aunt Penniman's giddy/uncertain response. Numerous things occur simultaneously, just as they would in a real-life situation. The multiple layers of action allow even someone who has seen the film countless times to spot something new and different with each viewing. Further, Wyler's use of mirrors and lamp light is stunning as well, and serve to set the mood in a rather large, rather empty (physically and emotionally) mid 19th century home.I have said so much already, and I know I could say much more in praise of this film if I allowed myself. Suffice it to say, this film is a must-see for all classic film fans, and even for people who don't know they are. It is certainly one of the finest in Hollywood history, and I am confident it will be discussed for many years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Triumph for two great stars.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no doubt that "The Heiress" was a triumph for two great stars - Olivia de Havilland and Ralph Richardson. Made over 50 years ago, this film is still extremely watchable, and the performances stand up as good as anything today. de Havilland's Oscar was well and truly warranted, as this is an acting achievement which covers every range of emotion from innocence to cruelty in an amazing way. As the plain daughter of a very bitter man, she is able to convey the frustrations, hurt and bitter revenge in a way that is completely believable - just a stunning characterization. As the unfeeling father Ralph Richardson shows his class, and warranted Best Supporting Actor recognition. Montgomery Clift was miscast to a certain degree, but under William Wyler's direction, he got through Okay. But truly, the film belongs to the two headliners alone.</fullReview>

The beautiful de Havilland, made to look plain and dull, is quite good in her Oscar-winning title role. Also fine are Clift as the gold digger and Hopkins as de Havilland's understanding aunt. However, the best performance is given by Richardson as the cold, domineering father who wants to protect his daughter but also despises her meek existence. Brown, who plays the maid, looks like a young Grace Kelly. The cinematography is excellent and there's a fine score by Copland.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine adaptation of an excellent play, with a subtle and precise view of human nature worthy of Henry James</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Catherine (Olivia de Havilland) is a thoroughly ordinary girl with one thing commend her?her money. That's the view of her father (Ralph Richardson), who believes he is cruel only to be kind. He takes a dim view of the handsome and charming man (Montgomery Clift) who courts her. Surely this idler's only possible motive for proposing marriage is to get her money. Catherine's aunt (Miriam Hopkins) may agree, but believes the two should marry anyway. Catherine is deeply in love, but her fiancé will forever change her view of herself, of her father and of human nature as a whole.William Wyler directs Augustus and Ruth Goetz's adaptation of their own play, suggested by Henry James's "Washington Square," and it's a fine job by all. We rarely see such a subtle and precise view of people, presented in a way that allows us to draw our own conclusions about them. Is the father villainous and cruel? Is the fiancé a fortune hunter? Do we approve or disapprove of Catherine's decisions throughout the film? We're not told what to think.De Havilland is fine at conveying the various shades of her many-faceted character. Richardson is excellent, making the most of his mellifluous voice and superb manners. Clift is good, though his diction is lazier than that of his co-stars'. I find Clift smug and unappealing, which doesn't detract from this particular character. Miriam Hopkins, a former leading lady, aged into character parts, gives a performance rich in detail and humor. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>She had the last laugh!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As far as film adaptations from a theater piece go, this film achieves what other, perhaps more important plays, fail to do. The transfer to the screen seems seamless, and that's no easy task.William Wyler was at the top of his profession when he undertook the direction of this work, written by Augustus and Ruth Goetz, loosely based on Henry James' "Washington Square".Mr. Wyler could not have asked for a better cast than the one assembled here. Olivia de Havilland, as Catherine, was made to look plain in order to make this shy woman, dominated by a tyrant father, into a compelling figure. Pairing her opposite Montgomery Cliff, who was perhaps one of the most handsome actors of the time, makes the viewer realize about the intentions this suitor had for the homely, but rich woman. He doesn't elicit our sympathy.Olivia de Havilland is perfect as Catherine. Her father, the doctor, played by Ralph Richardson, adds prestige to the film. Mr. Richardson was one of England's best actors; he shines in the movie.It is ironic that at the end, Catherine has the last laugh. She is able to get her own revenge from the callous man who comes back thinking that she would take him back. Good riddance to him!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The pains of love last all of your life---10/10.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The pains of love last all of your life---10/10.Many people have stated that the only false note in this movie was in the casting of Montgomery Clift as Morris Townsend. I don't subscribe to this thought. The only false note, and it's not really a false note, that I can take away from this film is in trying to believe that Catherine Sloper (Olivia De Havilland) isn't a beautiful woman. Yes, I know she's made to look very plain and awkward in comparison to the other women in town (most notably at the ballroom dance), but Catherine comes off refreshingly human while also maintaining a very subtle and innocent beauty. Catherine may be awkward outside of her own environment (doing embroidery at home), but with the right positive reinforcement (either from her Father or from a lover) she could be more like the perfect woman, her mother. That's why it becomes a source of frustration for Catherine that her father, Dr. Austin Sloper (Ralph Richardson) is constantly belittling her character by judging her through his vision of the ideal woman, his deceased wife, throughout the film. Does he think he's protecting her from the obvious and eventual pain of rejection she would feel? Or is he in fact, just protecting her financial inheritance? In any case, Catherine has never been able to exorcise the ghostly perfected image of her deceased mother that her father keeps alive and warm by treating Catherine so coldly. Although Catherine's father is a real bastard, you get the feeling that he is trying to do the best thing for her, in his own way.One thing is certain; the performance put in by Ralph Richardson is nothing short of breathtaking. With Olivia and Ralph putting in such incredible performances, it's no wonder that Montgomery gets overlooked. Just remember, this was Montgomery Clift's third film and he was still capable of keeping step with two very seasoned actors. While it's true that at times Montgomery Clift invokes an acting style that falls somewhere outside the time of the character, he never loses step with the scene, or with the other actors.One of the most touching scenes in the film occurs when Morris is playing a song for Catherine on the piano. Morris speaks the words of the song directly to Catherine, seducing her while at the same time prophetically outlining both his and her fate, "The joys of love, they last but a short time, the pains of love last all of your life".Although it may be difficult for the viewer to figure what Morris' intentions are with Catherine, Dr. Sloper has an idea that Morris is looking somewhere beyond love. His distrust of Morris stems from the idea that not only is Morris a likely gold digger, but that he actually doesn't love his daughter at all. Dr. Sloper cannot imagine that anyone could love his daughter for who she is. It is this belief that will ultimately be his own cross to bear during his dying days.By the end of the film, the transformation of Catherine from a shy and awkward girl to a hardened and abrasive woman is eye opening. Where there once was a girl who hoped against hope for a midnight carriage elopement to arrive, there became a woman who had lost all hope for happiness and love while embroidering an alphabet sign made of yarn. Although Catherine has a moment when her lost love flickers anew upon Morris' return, she quickly regains an inner strength, and cunningly deceives Morris in return by leading him to believe they could rekindle their lost love. Catherine requests that Morris get them that long lost midnight carriage so they can finally get married. As Morris walks out of the Sloper house, Catherine requests that the maid shut and bolt the door. Catherine sits back down to finish her embroidery. As she cuts the last bit of yarn from the embroidery, she has effectively severed herself from Morris altogether. As if that scene wasn't emphasis enough, we get to see Morris' reaction to being locked out. It turns out to be the biggest emotional wallop of the film. Just as the Paramount logo starts to come into frame we see Morris pounding his fists onto the front door through the fading film, trying desperately to be heard, to prolong the movie, anything just to get back inside the house. The wonderful musical score by Aaron Copland swells up loudly to drown out the pounding of Morris' fists as he pounds away silently in time with the music. 10/10.Clark Richards</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who could forget Olivia de Havilland as the daughter of an emotional possessive father who suspects her lover as abusive and would use her for her money. She falls so completely and blindly in love with Montgomery Clift that when he returns to her, she like her father turns against him in the manner "she learned from the master". I'll never forget that line she made, and she says it with so much hurt and anguish, which probably won her the Academy Award. Fantastic acting, and superb direction!. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We are the rightful heirs of this gem of a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a lavish history of films we are fortunate enough to have in this country. And I count "The Heiress" as one of the best. Combine a wonderfully told story with a masterful director (William Wyler), and add to that superb cast, and you have the formula for a masterpiece as we do here.Olivia de Havilland gives the performance of her life as Catherine Sloper, the socially awkward and homely daughter of surgeon Dr. Sloper (played by Ralph Richardson). She brings such a strong performance as her character evolves from a timid, shy and innocent young lady to a hardened, disappointed and bitter woman. I don't know that I have ever seen an actress give such a convincing evolution, before or since. She truly earned her Oscar win for Best Actress. Richardson also delivers a believable performance as the ruthless father that is extremely disappointed in his daughter, and never fails to let her know it. At the same time, there is a hint of fatherly love below the surface trying to protect his daughter from what he perceives is a fortune hunter in the suitor of Montgomery Clift's character, Morris Townsend.The photography in the film is amazing as it conveys the deep emotions in the film so adequately. You feel Catherine's loneliness and awkwardness, and the scenes involving the elopement, and later the final rejection, are quite hauntingly portrayed.One of my favorite lines in movies is from this film when Catherine's Aunt tells her "Can you be so cruel?" to which Catherine coldly replies "Yes, I can be very cruel. I have been taught by masters." This is a film you will want to see multiple times to uncover all the layers and details of the very deep and tragic story of "The Heiress".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Heiress has to be one of the greatest movies ever made. There is nothing about it that I would change. The cast is perfect. Montgomery Clift is so wonderful as Morris Townsend. His physical beauty makes it easy to understand how someone as gauche as Catherine Sloper could overcome her shyness and respond to him. Olivia de Havilland is almost too good looking to be the unattractive Miss Sloper, however her great acting overcomes her beauty, and the viewer readily accepts her in the part. Ralph Richardson is perfect as Dr. Sloper. With his disdain for his daughter and his idealization of her dead mother, it is easy to see how his attitude has frozen his daughter in her insecurity about everything that she does. Miriam Hopkins is the perfect airhead social climber who does have affection for her niece, but becomes so wrapped up in the overall romance of the situation that she doesn't act in the best interests of her niece but in the best interests of the romantic drama that is unfolding around her. In her biography, Edith Head talks about researching and designing the clothes for this movie. Certainly the costumes greatly enhance Olivia de Havilland's ability to play this part and be accepted as the plain and graceless Catherine Sloper. A great movie that shouldn't be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Heiress Bites Back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>William Wyler directed the Henry James adaptation of the short story, "Washington Square" with musical score by Aaron Copeland and starring Oliva de Havilland as Catherine Sloper, Ralph Richardson, Dr. Sloper her father, Montgomery Clift, the fortune hunter Morris Townsend, and Mirriam Hopkins, Aunt Livenia. Set in mid-century New York, it is a character study of Catherine, a guileless, plain, dull, and enormously wealthy only daughter of Dr. Slocum, a widower. Catherine has been raised without a mother, who in Dr. Slocum's memory was perfection. Unlike her mother however, Catherine is an embarrassment as she is sans social graces, and incapable of achieving a respectable marriage to any man of her social class and wealth. Her only talent according to Dr. Slocum is she "embrodiers neatly." Meeting the handsome Morris Townsend at a family affair, Catherine is enchanted with the smooth, attentive, and socially clever but penniless young man. He is too good to be true and they quickly initiate a whirlwind courtship that culminates in Dr. Slocum refusing to allow Catherine to marry Morris, and taking her to Europe to forget him. On their return, Catherine secretly meets Townsend who has been charming Aunt Livenia in the Slocum house while the family was abroad, and she facilitates the couple's secret rendezvous and plans to elope without the consent of Dr. Slocum. Threatening to disinherit Catherine from her enormous fortune on his death, Slocum cruelly informs his innocent daughter that her intended is only marrying her for her money for she has nothing else to offer any man. The truth of her father's disdain and the opportunity to break away from him by carrying out a secret elopement the night of their return from Europe spurs Catherine to agree to Morris' plans. Blindly, she informs Morris that her father will cut her off with only a third of the expected amount of her inheritance, but they will live on love and she will make him a devoted, faithful, and comfortable home. At this news and unaware to Catherine, Morris promises to return at midnight but instead deserts her. Leaving her waiting for him in the parlor, the wizened Catherine is shattered, bereft, but with her respectability intact. The resolution of Morris' actions and Catherine's newly found mature "voice" takes on the true Henry James twist with the finest third act of the film left for the return of Morris to Catherine's parlor. Wyler uses the manners and architecture of the 19th century upper class parlor to the full extent through the formal interior settings, panel doors, furniture, and expectations of the kinds of infringements that Morris has enacted on Catherine in subtle ways. When he leaves his gloves on the front hall table, Dr. Slocum is aware of Townsend's intention to move in to his home over his objections through courtship of Catherine. Later, Morris leaves an empty brandy cordial, cigar wrapper, and use of the private library of Dr. Slocum's home during the family's absence, an act that was akin to dogs scent marking their territory. Instead of taking his leave from a serious father/daughter discussion between Dr. Slocum and Catherine over the objections to Morris' proposal for Catherine's hand, Townsend manipulates Catherine's unwitting interjections on his behalf to her father, and allows a woman to fight his battle instead of doing the manly and correct thing.Catherine, unaware of these signs and their meanings until her abandonment, stages her own revenge on the duplicitous, greedy suitor presenting him with his wedding gift that she's kept over the many years, and then orders the door bolted, closing the heavy brocade parlor drapes, and turning off the lights at Morris' second elopement scheme. As a lamp's light marks her movements up the staircase through a transom window and to the intimate family bedrooms upstairs, Morris is shut out from Catherine's heart, money, and the house he'd brazenly announced to Aunt Penniman was his "home." It is a masterful scene that is one of the most chilling in film history.Oliva de Havilland won an Oscar for this performance which is matched by the exceptional performances of Ralph Richardson, Montgomery Clift and score of Aaron Copeland. Subtle, nuanced, and deliberate, de Havilland changes on screen from plain Jane to mature, confident and attractive simply through her voice, hair, and posture. It is a gesture that did not rely on gaining weight and shedding it for the role, nor allowing herself to don prosthetics which today's actresses rely. Instead, de Havilland's tenor of voice is audibly heard to deepen and lower signaling her new maturity in one scene between Catherine and Morris as they plan their forbidden elopement. Miss it, and you will have overlooked one of the most subtle acting performances captured on film. Worth viewing and an excellent addition to classic collections of great films, Wyler's The Heiress is a significant film to announce the entrance of the post-War American woman to film audiences.</fullReview>

And the movie (as, presumably, the play did) emphasizes and draws out the unusual, painful relationship between father and daughter, making the story even more compelling and interesting than as depicted in the book. The doctor isn't simply looking out for the best interests of his daughter, he actually despises her. Ralph Richardson gives one of the best performances ever captured on screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific melding of story, acting, and directing--a gem!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Heiress (1949)Another gem from William Wyler. This is the director of so many sparkling, flawless interpersonal dramas it's hard to believe he isn't lionized alongside more famous greats. The problem (as he admits in interviews) is he had no real style of his own. And yet, as the years go by, his "style" begins to clarify a little. Watch "The Little Foxes" or "Detective Story" or this one, "The Heiress," and you'll see an astonishing, complex handling of a small group of people with visual clarity and emotional finesse.There is no overacting here, and no photographic flourishes to make you gasp. There are no murky shadows or gunfights or even ranting and raving. No excess. What you have here is terrific writing (thanks in part to Henry James who wrote the source story, Washington Square) and terrific acting.The three leads are all first rate actors, surely. Montgomery Clift a young and rising star, Olivia de Havilland already famous for earlier roles (including a supporting one in "Gone with the Wind"), and the terrific stage actor Ralph Richardson, who received an Oscar nomination for his role. It is de Haviland who is the heiress of the title, and she does tend to steal the show with a performance that you would think would tip into campy excess but which just veers this side of danger and makes you feel for her scene after scene. And she took the Best Actress award for it.A good director manages to bring the best from the actors, which Wyler clearly does. But he also finds ways to make those performances jump out of the film reality into the movie theater. His fluid, expert way of moving actors around one another, of having them trade positions or look this way or that as they deliver some intensely subtle comeback line, is really astonishing. And easy to miss, I think, if you just get absorbed in the plot. So watch it all.The story itself is pretty chilling and oddly dramatic (dramatic for Henry James, not for Wyler, who likes a kind of soap opera drama within all his focused restraint). The heiress (de Havilland) is being pursued by a fortune hunting and rather handsome man (Clift) and she doesn't realize his love isn't for real. But the father, with his slightly cruel superiority, sees it all and tries to subtly maneuver his daughter to safety. The result is a lot of heartbreak and surprising twists of motivation.By the end almost anything can happen, within this upper class world of manners and appropriate reactions, and de Havilland rises to the challenge. It's worth seeing how. Terrific stuff from the golden age of the silver screen, for sure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Triumph of Craft</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Heiress" is that most difficult of cinematic challenges: the filmed stage play.Some filmed plays succeed: "Harvey," "Dial M for Murder," "Wait Until Dark," "Long Day's Journey into Night." Some don't: "The Bad Seed," "Bells Are Ringing," "Damn Yankees." "The Heiress" presents particular problems in that it was produced for the stage in 1947 and embodies all the classical construction of the "well written" play. Both the play and film were written, masterfully, by Ruth and Augustus Goetz.Director William Wyler, that genius, "opened up" the play JUST enough, unobtrusively and plausibly, to make a true film out of a drawing room drama.The actors are superb. The lighting and cinematography add depth and emotion.But it's the Goetzs' script that ensures "The Heiress" its place in stage and cinema history.Not "showy," as Tennessee Williams was already becoming after his brilliant "Glass Menagerie," nor fraught with his "titanic" and increasingly drug-addled overwrought emotions and histrionics in "Streetcar Named Desire", "Orpheus Descending", and "Suddenly, Last Summer", "The Heiress" is set in the previous century, the late 1800's, and embodies an earlier theatrical tradition, though written in the late 1940s."The Heiress" is entirely dialogue-based and depends wholly on words rather than Williams-esque "nervous breakdowns" and then-"perverse" sexual undertones for its power (and its stellar performances of that dialogue).The era of its period social setting demands emotional repression, graceful self-containment and surface noblesse oblige, which make the seemingly quiet emotional whiplashes so ultimately devastating.The script is so brilliant and the characters so perfectly (and economically) delineated that, on repeated viewings, there is NO "bad guy"! Everybody's motives and character-arcs are clearly understandable and justified.Nothing and nobody is cut-and-dried or predictable, which makes each character all too human and, finally, haunting.Everybody loves each other . . . everybody hurts each other . . . in little ways that subtly, inexorably, build to a shattering climax.Both on stage and screen, "The Heiress" is truly a remarkable achievement of craft.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All Is Not Well in Washington Square</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A handsome, icy film adaptation of Henry James's novel "Washington Square." Olivia de Havilland is a far cry from Melanie Wilkes as Catherine Sloper, a socially awkward ugly duckling who becomes the target of a gold digger, the dashing Morris Townsend (Montgomery Clift), who loves the idea of Catherine's inheritance more than he loves her. Catherine's father, imperiously played by Ralph Richardson, is horrible to Catherine, always comparing her to his late wife and finding her lacking, but he does feel a protective instinct for her and sees Morris for what he is. When her father threatens to disinherit her if she moves forward with marrying Morris, Morris himself takes to the hills, leaving Catherine jilted and devastated. Scorned one too many times, she becomes a bitter, hollowed out shell of her former self and displays a cold cruelty that rivals her father's."The Heiress" is masterfully directed by William Wyler, and it's surprisingly suspenseful. The acting is superb from everyone: de Havilland, Clift, Richardson (who can reduce someone to a shriveled husk with the raise of an eyebrow), and Miriam Hopkins, in the role of Catherine's romantic and not-so-very-practical aunt. My only quibble with the film is its abrupt ending that stops short. I wasn't ready for it, and expected the story to go further. In a way, though, that's a compliment, because it's basically saying that I didn't want the movie to end.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"To have such a dull girl disgrace his name"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are two sides to every great piece of acting. The way it is performed, and the way it is presented. It's a rarely acknowledged and little understood facet of film-making, but a truly excellent performance is to some degree a collaboration between the actor and the director.In the Heiress, we see Olivia de Havilland in what is probably her finest work. De Havilland's entry into motion pictures was not especially auspicious. Her earliest roles required little other than that she look simple and pretty, more often than not as the supplicant object of Errol Flynn's affections. However, unlike many leading ladies in such a position, she emerged as a serious and talented dramatic actress. The Heiress still presents her with quite a challenge though. For a start, she is playing a woman ten or twelve years younger than herself. This is achieved not so much by the makeup department, but by de Havilland's capturing of the mannerisms of a flighty youngster. She conveys Catherine's awkward shyness not just through facial expressions and vocal delivery, but in every move and gesture she makes, even the way she dances. But the role also poses difficulties in that the character develops considerably, toughens up and has her heart hardened. Again, de Havilland rises to the challenge to give a sharp but convincing portrayal of Catherine exchanging her naiveté for cynicism.So many top class players have been sold short by their directors. The best directors will not allow you to notice this, but much of how we perceive a good performance is in how our attention is drawn to it, how long the takes are held for, and which aspect of a performance we see. William Wyler, director of the Heiress, was among the best and also the boldest. One of the things that is great about Wyler is that he is fully willing to show the story entirely from the woman's point of view ? something not all male directors seem capable of. Wyler makes it clear that this is not the story of a penniless chancer who seeks the hand of a rich woman, or an ageing doctor who is torn over disinheriting his daughter. This is Catherine's story, and the audience must feel it from her point of view.How does Wyler make this clear? Very simply, by making de Havilland the almost constant the centre of attention. Some directors will put us in a character's shoes with lots of point-of-view shots, but Wyler is cleverer than that. In many of the earliest shots, we see Catherine physically overshadowed by people around her, talking over her and acting as if she weren't there. Wyler shows this, but through his framing, keeping de Havilland clear at the centre even though others are in the foreground, he keeps us focused on her face. He makes us see not only that she is in this situation, but also how she feels about it. In many of the shots of her talking to Montgomery Clift, the camera stays at his back, rarely changing angle. This keeps him as a physical presence whose face we never see, and focuses us entirely on her reactions. You see, Wyler recognises not only that it is important to notice certain things, but also that it could be a distraction to see others. By only catching occasional glimpses of Clift's handsomeness and never dwelling on his expressions, we remain in line with Catherine's idealistic conception of him.Like twinkling satellites around de Havilland's stellar performance, the Heiress also features a fine supporting cast. Montgomery Clift gives a graciously low-key performance, making no attempt to steal the limelight, only to appear credible (and attractive). Ralph Richardson is restrained and naturalistic, but still shows the decorum and imperiousness that marks his more theatrical roles (and, by the way, if you are stuck for a way to describe his beard, Wyler's apparent instruction to the makeup team was "It must be round, but square"). Miriam Hopkins for once gives a decent dramatic performance ? a nice change for someone who normally only fitted into the ethereal exaggeration of comedies and musicals, but faltered in anything more substantial.The only thing I would like to have seen different about the Heiress would be for the producers have stuck to some of their original casting choices, and had Basil Rathbone as Doctor Sloper, and Errol Flynn (!) as Morris. Not that I have anything against Richardson or Clift, but it would have been great fun to have seen the old hero-heroine-villain dynamic of Captain Blood and Adventures of Robin Hood reunited in these very different circumstances. And I'm sure under the direction of William Wyler Rathbone and Flynn would have turned in very worthy performances, quite possibly the best of their career. And so long as they were opposite Olivia de Havilland ? who is truly irreplaceable in this role ? the drama could not suffer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Can't Praise this film highly enough! (contains spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Heiress is the poignant 1949 film which won Olivia de Havilland a well deserved Oscar for Best Actress. Based on the book "Washington Square" the story is set in the 1840s, focusing on Catherine (de Havilland), a timid naive woman who happens to have an inheritance of $10,000 a year from her mother, and $20,000 a year after her father's death. Ralph Richardson also gives an outstanding performance here as the father who holds her up to the standard of her late mother. His view of her not measuring up is one thing that keeps her down. Montgomery Clift plays Morris, the man who courts her. She falls in love with him, while he's more in love with her money, though she doesn't suspect his alterior motive until it's too late. Throughout we get sharp witted dialogue, sometimes leaving us subtle between-the-lines clues. For instance when Morris echoes Catherine's thought that when alone with her Aunt Lavinia he is more eloquent (this implies Lavinia told him of her similar thoughts). And when in Paris she tells her father that her Aunt's letter gives a first hand account of Paris (implying her Aunt has been talking to Morris). Her father finally tells her how worthless he feels she is, but for her inheritance, so she then puts all her faith in Morris. They set the time for him to come and take her away to elope, fueling her romantic fantasies of the relationship and she tells him of her falling out with (and apparent disinheritance from) her father, then goes to pack. The scenes that follow are some of the most moving and disturbing ever set to film. As she waits for Morris with elated anticipation, her Aunt tells her of her belief in Morris' money motive. Catherine denies this: "Morris will love me, where others did not." After the set time for his arrival comes and goes it dawns on her what has happened and she breaks down. In the morning she is completely transformed, older, bitter, and drained as she slowly drags her suitcases back up the long dark stairway. For the rest of the film she "finds her voice" as her father says, a lower toned, darker, disillusioned, and bitter voice. And her father and Morris both find that hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.Another Oscar went to Aaron Copland for the excellent film score. If you know the song "I Can't Help Falling in Love", you'll notice it's a rip off of this score. Overall one of the top 5 films of the 1940s.One extra note: I wonder what she means at the end by "I shall never do another" embroidery. Could it be that when Morris gets his due, she will then be free and no longer need pass time embroidering. Maybe start to live alittle? I plan to read the book for more insight on that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Four character studies and one of the greatest single performances of filmdom</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the few 10+ movies on my list of thousands. Everything about the film is excellent. The script, based on the Goetz's play, based on the Henry James novel, is tops. The technical aspects are first-rate. And the performances ? well, each of the four main characters seems to have been made for his or her respective role in "The Heiress." And one ? Olivia de Havilland, gives, in my estimation, one of the greatest performances in the history of movies. In watching this film again, I was aware that de Havilland seemed to mesmerize me. In the IMDb quotes section of her biography, de Havilland says that she preferred the parts of good girls because they are more challenging and difficult to play than are those of bad girls. Serious roles of the types of characters de Havilland has played, with varying temperaments, characteristics and personalities, surely are the more demanding. And de Havilland plays them to perfection. In just a few minutes into "The Heiress," I began to think about the quality of acting, and how superb de Havilland was in her role. "The Heiress" is rewarding in another way. It's one of the few films I know of that has several mini-stories that are all developed very well. I think this is rare for a movie. Films that have subplots or main characters often fail to develop them to full satisfaction. But consider the four stories here. We know the main one, of this shy, demure, very decent and plain young woman, Catherine Sloper. We watch the changes in her character. Near the end, she tells Morris Townsend that she had forgiven him. We believe it, because she is honest and is now a wiser person from her experience and years. She would be forgiving rather than be a driven person without peace. As a wiser person, she immediately sees through Townsend's amorous moves the second time. But instead of an act of revenge (she forgave him, and doesn't lie), she decides to teach Townsend a lesson with a clear message that he is out of her life forever. She can't do that by talking or argument against his sweet flattery. Would he ever learn his lesson any other way than through total humiliation at being stood up by her? As the light fades from behind her bolted door, reality sinks in for Townsend. He has lost in his scheme to lie his way into wealth and a life of comfort.Montgomery Clift is ideal for the Townsend role, the second character study. The viewer knows right away that he's a gold digger. We mistrust him by what we have seen and heard before he enters the scene. Catherine's father, Dr. Sloper, has warned us about such people. And, in Catherine herself, we see a plain, not very attractive young woman. So, when Townsend appears to ask her for a dance, we suspect him right away. And when he opens his mouth with his flattery, sweet talk and politically correct language of the day, we know he's not to be believed or trusted. Clift plays his part to perfection. Yet, with all the signals we get, we're still never absolutely sure about him until he abandons Catherine after she tells him she won't get her father's inheritance.Ralph Richardson plays Dr. Sloper to a tee. His character is a little more complicated and we don't see all of him until Catherine does. He has the usual concern and hopes for his daughter. But he is more wary because she hasn't picked up social skills or done well in most endeavors; and because she is not attractive. Still, he's her father, and we know he must love his daughter and want to see to it that she's taken care of in life. As the movie progresses, Dr. Sloper makes a couple of denigrating comparisons of Catherine to her mother. We can understand a threat of cutting off her inheritance ? that's always a legitimate hammer to ward off gold diggers. But finally, Catherine and we see some actual disdain for her by her father. He had carefully masked his lack of love for his own daughter, by his parental concern for the welfare of this otherwise plain person. The fourth character developed beautifully in this film is that of Aunt Penniman. Miriam Hopkins does great justice to the role. At first, she seems a bit scatterbrained. Besides the flightiness of aunts in these types of dramas that seems to be the norm, Aunt Penniman has a genuine love for her niece. She means well and wants happiness for her niece. She says one line to her brother, the doctor, that causes him to stop to think. So what if Townsend would squander Catherine's money, so long as she is happy? Then the aunt becomes a willing confidant of Townsend. In the end, she seems to be shallow after all, when she can't understand Catherine's final rebuff of the dishonest, scheming suitor. What an excellent movie! Never does it lead to a low mood or spirits. Rather, it's a wonderful story that wraps its pages and celluloid around viewers and pulls us in. We like Catherine. We feel a little sorry for her. But we respect and care and hope for her. We want all to work out well for her, in spite of all the sham and dishonesty that builds around her. And so it happens. Watch for the ever-so-slight upturn of the lips on de Havilland's face as she turns down the lamp and heads off to her room content with the outcome of the day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film for grownups</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Superlative version of the James novel sharpens and refines the book. Olivia, always a fine actress, gives one of her defining performances revealing the many layers of Catherine during her evolution from doormat to bruised and wary but empowered woman. Clift gives a sly performance, his natural beauty aiding in the belief that he could be a rake living off his looks. Sir Ralph Richardson is simply great as the thoughtlessly cruel father, hinting that in his own obtuse way he has no understanding of what he thinks of as protecting his daughter is actually crippling her and his malice towards her something he doesn't comprehend. Miriam Hopkins is perfectly cast as the flighty Aunt Penniman her fluttery gestures making her seem more vapid than she really is. Selena Royale is also fine as the other sister even though in a smaller role, she, Miriam and Richardson share a fantastic scene that clarifies the relationship of the entire family and his inability to see beyond his own view point no matter the cost. All their superior work would be for naught though were it not for Wylers sure handed direction that keeps the sometimes heavy dramatics feeling personal and involving.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a tour de force for Olivia de Havilland as she plays Catherine Sloper, the pathetically mousy daughter of a wealthy doctor (Ralph Richardson) in 19th century New York. Catherine has grown up with her father telling her how clumsy and unattractive she is compared to her late mother, so when a dashing, though penniless, young man (Montgomery Clift) comes to call, she falls head over heels. Big mistake.De Havilland rightly won Best Actress of 1950, for her stunning portrayal of the meek and frightened girl who, older and wiser, becomes a steely and confident woman. Everything about her changes in the transformation, from her posture to her voice, and above all, her inner bearing. She's unforgettable. Richardson is also superb as the cruel father and Clift is perfectly cast as the oily suitor.The magnificent gowns and detailed sets capture the period beautifully and the literate script overflows with memorable lines about harm done in the name of love. This is a very satisfying movie that can be enjoyed again. and again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Heiress is directed by William Wyler, is based on the novel by Henry James and stars Olivia De Havilland, Montgomery Clift and Ralph Richardson.This adaptation of Henry James novel Washington Square,is nothing less than a masterpiece.Filled with subtle but powerful performances this is a haunting story of psychological cruelty and a deeply moving love story. Olivia De Havilland won a well deserved Oscar for her unforgettable portrayal of a jilted and emotionally broken woman.It's 1849 and in the wealthy city block Washington Square young,shy and dreadfully plain Catherine Sloper(Olivia de Havilland)is the dutiful and deeply undervalued daughter of the respected Dr.Austin Sloper(Ralph Richardson).Austin bullies her emotionally and is forever putting her down and telling her to be more like her beautiful dead mother.Because of this she is dreadfully shy and dislikes social occasions.It falls to her kindly,romantic and highly excitable aunt Lavinia Penniman(Miriam Hopkins)to try and get her married.At an engagement party for her cousin,Catherine meets the handsome Morris Townsend(Montgomery Clift)he is attentive to her and for the first time in her life she falls in love.Dr.Sloper objects to their plans for marriage on the grounds that he believes Morris to be after Catherines thirty thousand dollar fortune.After many struggles Morris abandons Catherine.Once this happens Catherine transforms into a hardened and cold woman who refuses to have anything to do with love and now feels all compliments directed towards her are false or jokes.One of the most unforgettable portrayals of the effects of psychological cruelty ever put onto either paper or film.The Heiress is an experience which once seen you'll never forget.A special mention must go to Edith Head's costumes and Aaron Copeland's Oscar winning score.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant Wyler with an equally brilliant de Havilland</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After years of waiting to see this film, I finally saw it yesterday! Excellent film with Olivia de Havilland giving a stunning performance as spinster and heiress Catherine Sloper (though I still think she was even better in The Snake Pit). Ralph Richardson is also brilliant as her cold, cruel father, and Montgomery Clift...well, you shouldn't trust Morris Townsend for a second, but when he looks LIKE THAT, you can forgive him anything! Let's not forget Miriam Hopkins who is also very good. Wyler has directed many of my favourite films, and he gets an intelligent screenplay from James' famous novel to work with here. The film actually deviates and, in my opinion, improves on the original source material, strengthening Catherine's character and her actions in the pivotal final scene. Just a marvellous experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dowdy spinster Catherine Sloper is stuck in a rut, she is often made to feel useless by her almost tyrannical father, and her life is ambling along in uneventful boredom. Potential gentleman suitors steer well clear of her, such is her unease with the social graces of the day. Then one day at a society ball she is lavished with attention from Morris Townsend, could this be love? Or is he merely after her inheritance? An inheritance her father will take away from her should she progress further with the shifty Townsend.A novel written by Henry James {Washington Square}, and a successful Broadway play by Ruth &amp; Augustus Goetz {responsible for the film's wonderful ending}, The Heiress adapts perfectly to the big screen due to the almost peerless work from all involved in the adaptation. Olivia de Havilland is sensational as Catherine, the tale is about Catharine's transition from put upon victim into a mature, rational wise woman, and de Haviland double deals from the top of the pack, and with one particular look towards the end, she may just own the title of worlds best icy stare. Ralph Richardson plays the father brilliantly, fusing a trio of character traits with wonderful results, and William Wyler's direction is right on the money, it's no surprise to learn that de Havilland requested Wyler for the project, for she must surely have known that he was the man to bring out such a majestic two fold performance.Montgomery Clift gives a rather more safe than great performance as Townsend, perhaps at times too aware that de Havilland and Richardson were shining bright on set, Clift none the less is one of those actors who's average shows were still better than some of his so called peers best. Major bonus here is the score from Aaron Copland, jaunty in earlier sections then swirling like a poetic menace in the final third; simply beautiful. Tales of bad feeling on the set can be found in various sources, with both Richardson &amp; Clift showing disdain for de Havilland's acting ability. But one only has to view the film now to see that the off screen tensions lifted de Havilland to another acting level, well, also helped by the gifted hands of one William Wyler of course.A smashing, dramatic, and engrossing picture, The Heiress is a must see for those looking for artistic deftness, with an ending that is a fittingly memorable piece of class. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is one of the most perfectly cast I have ever seen. Montgomery Clift is great and Ralph Richardson gives a fantastic performance, as a father that just can't love and feel proud of his daughter. Usually, such actors would dominate and steal every scene if the leading actress, in this case, was not Olivia de Havilland, in what is certainly one of the best performances I have seen in my life by an actor or actress. It's impressive to see Catherine Sloper's changes throughout the movie. A very good script also, adapted from Henry James's "Washington Square", with interesting and complex characters. A remarkable movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Revenge is a Dish Best Eaten Cold</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Olivia de Havilland was a terrific actress whose looks worked against her in her early career. Starting in the movies as a teenager, she was so beautiful that Warner Bros usually used her as arm candy for the leading man (Errol Flynn as often as not). It was not until she was a grown woman approaching thirty that her talent came to the forefront in a number of memorable pictures.THE HEIRESS, for which she won her second Academy Award as best actress, is not only her finest performance but the best film in which she appeared. Directed by William Wyler and based on the stage play by Ruth and Augustus Goetz, which was in turn an adaptation of the Henry James novel WASHINGTON SQUARE, this is an acute character study that demonstrates that the right thing may not always be the most loving thing.De Havilland plays Catherine Sloper, the only daughter of a distinguished New York doctor (played with waspish dignity by the great Ralph Richardson). When we first see her it is something of a shock. I don't know how the makeup and lighting people did it, but they managed to make de Havilland sufficiently plain to play the character as she was originally written.Plain and socially awkward, Catherine is also held in contempt by her father. He reveres the memory of his dead wife, who died giving birth to Catherine, and compares the girl relentlessly and unfavorably to her charming mother. Catherine absorbs the occasional barb from her father, but she is a dutiful daughter and never contradicts him.Also in the house is Catherine's widowed Aunt Lavinia Penniman, a silly and romantic creature played to a fare-thee-well by the great Miriam Hopkins.Enter Morris Townsend (Montgomery Clift). Catherine attends a party with her aunt one evening, and after an extremely uncomfortable scene in which a dancing partner abandons her, she finds herself introduced to Morris, a beautiful young man who wastes no time in establishing an intimacy for which Catherine is as unprepared as she is unable (unwilling?) to resist.She falls in love with him almost immediately, and he declares his love for her. Dr Sloper, however, is skeptical of this young man, a penniless drifter whose only assets are that he comes from a good family and his smooth and eloquent tongue; in short, he is very ingratiating, even charming, but the doctor is not impressed.He invites Morris to dinner, and judges and condemns him as soon as the meal is over. The young man is obviously a fortune hunter; Dr Sloper even goes so far as to have a talk with Morris's sister, who confirms his suspicions. Sort of. She is reluctant to speak ill of her brother, but the doctor draws his own conclusion.Montgomery Clift, as Morris, has perhaps the most difficult role in the film, and he brings it off beautifully. In his early scenes with Catherine, we see him through her eyes, and we are taken with his charm. It is only later that we see him for what he is, and it happens when Catherine is away on a trip to Europe with her father.Upon their return, Dr Sloper discovers signs that Morris has been in the house, and since Catherine's intention to marry the young man have not changed, they have a showdown in which the father tells the daughter cruelly that the only thing she has to offer is her money.The worst part is he turns out to be right. Catherine, devastated by her father's contempt, disinherits herself by getting Morris to agree to an immediate elopement. Unfortunately, she lets it slip to Morris that she is giving up her inheritance, and he deserts her.Morris's desertion is a catalyst for Catherine. She finds a backbone and a tongue for the first time, and she uses them on her father, accusing him (correctly) of not loving her and of cheating her of her one chance of some happiness.Dr Sloper is ill, and unable to withstand her onslaught of accusations, but he makes a halfhearted threat to alter his will. She takes him up on it, and getting out pen and paper, starts writing. But he can't go through with it. When he dies, Catherine is sitting alone in the park across the street; she won't go to him in his last hour, telling the housemaid that it is too late.Some years pass and Catherine, who has become a woman with poise and dignity, is living peacefully in the same house with her aunt, who comes home one evening and announces that Morris is not only back in town, but wants to see Catherine. In fact, Aunt Penniman has brought him home with her and he is right outside. Appalled, Catherine initially tells her aunt to say that she is not at home, but then upon hearing his voice, tells him to come in.He claims to still be in love with her. Catherine does not believe him for a second, but she gets him to agree to an elopement, then locks him out of the house, and out of her life, forever.Filmed in crisp and beautiful black-and-white, this stark drama, played without a trace of sentimentality, was de Havilland's crowning achievement. She was never as good as she is here, and she would never again have a film so worthy of her considerable talents.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Drawingroom Drama at its Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>&#x200e;What a fascinating study in sheer frustration. Dad (Richardson) wants a daughter (de Havilland) who equals his compelling late wife. What he gets instead is a dull, plain-faced wall- flower. Meanwhile, daughter just wants to please Dad, but inevitably falls short, to say nothing of her romantic hopes. Then, of course, there's Morris (Clift), the suitor, all plans to marry up to Easy Street, but ultimately too oily and heartless, by half. Moreover, that very last frame is unlike any other of the time. Normally, old Hollywood left audiences on a note of obvious uplift, not on a banging door. But I guess if you think about it, his frustration amounts to an odd type of uplift.What a triumph of old Hollywood. De Havilland richly deserved her Oscar. (Watch her eyes for a text in nuanced acting.) That transition from repressed plain Jane to cruel, hard-eyed woman is especially demanding. But de Havilland brings it off with finesse, carrying the audience with her. Then there's Richardson's unfeeling Dad, proving that upper-class refinement is no guarantee of upper-class fine feeling. His clipped tongue and icy intelligence are almost scary. Clift too, really rates. He's all oily charm and perfect manners, much prettier than his conquest and never once betraying his true feelings.It's hard to think of a more damning indictment of Victorian era male-dominance than Henry James's source novel. Poor Catherine wants nothing more than to please-- someone, anyone. Yet she gets passed around at the dance like an unwanted Kleenex Then when handsome Morris enters, she can hardly believe it. Of course, Dad's right all along about the fortune-hunter, but what really convinces him is not the cad himself, but Catherine's plainness and dullness. He even tells her so. No wonder she turns hard and sour, her personality permanently warped. This upshot alone could produce a hundred feminist tracts.Okay, the pace is slow, but never drags, thanks to a well-constructed screenplay and an astute director (Wyler). The characters remain richly developed, fascinating in their interplay; at the same time, each scene adds to the story development. This is classic Hollywood at its most thoughtful and skilled. After all, drawingroom dramas must sink or swim on their own. There is no lovely scenery to distract, nor fast action to excite, nor cliff-hangers to end with. And if there's a better drawingroom drama than this one, I haven't seen it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Story of an oppressive Father and his tyranny over his socially-awkward daughter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I agree with the review written by "Jemmytee". The best part of this movie is that fact that there are no easy answers. I've watched it a dozen times and I still question some of the characters' sincerity and motives -- especially those of Dr. Sloper and Morris.Catherine's Father is obdurate in his opinion of Morris' character and, therefore, utterly against the union of Morris and his daughter. In one rushed scene, Dr. Sloper's sister (or sister-in-law), a minor character, warns him to tread carefully. He could prevent the marriage on the grounds that Morris might be reckless with the family fortune BUT Morris might do very well with it and secure happiness for his awkward, sad daughter. These interesting points-of-view, which feel almost casually thrown into the mix, create a deftly handled portrayal of family dynamics and the fragility of the father/daughter relationship.This movie appears simple - but it is astounding in its subtle complexities!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Compelling story of a shy wallflower</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Olivia DeHavilland's portrayal of a shy, unloved wallflower made this one of the best movies I have ever seen. Her Oscar was well earned in this role.This is a review of the entire movie and thus contains spoilers. Do not read further unless you want to know the full details of the movie, plot and ending.Catherine's father, Dr Austin Sloper, is a well-respected physician, circa 1849. Catherine is unmarried, perhaps in her latter 20's and dotes on her father.Unbeknownst to Catherine, her father often comments to family and friends, how he lost his beautiful, talented, graceful, beloved wife (presumably during childbirth) and was left with an unmarriageable, plain, clumsy, dull-witted and untalented daughter whose only recognized attribute was embroidery.Aunt Lavinia agrees to stay at her brother's request, to help her niece overcome her shyness and become more sociable. Lavinia, a recent widow, bubbles with chatty enthusiasm and gullibility.They attend an engagement party for Catherine's cousin. Lavinia keeps introducing Catherine to young men and encouraging them to dance with her. They quickly escape after just one dance with Catherine who is clumsy and lacking in any social graces. Morris Townsend (played by Montgomery Cliff) is the exception.Morris has just returned from a trip to Europe, funded by a small, depleted inheritance. He's living with his widowed sister and her children with no means of support and expends no effort toward seeking a job of any kind. He acts immediately smitten with Catherine and quickly pursues courting her. Within just a few days, he proposes marriage to Catherine who immediately agrees. Her father is convinced his daughter has no beauty or grace or desirability that would attract any man. He believes his daughter's only marriageable attribute is her $10,000 per year inheritance and upon his death, she would be earning $30,000 per year; a considerable sum of money for 1849.The audience is uncertain as to the truth behind Morris's declaration of love. Catherine is certainly happy and Aunt Lavinia is blind to his motives. It's presumed the father's contempt is so jaded that he cannot see her as being marriageable to anyone. The doctor invites the sister of Morris to meet his daughter. Although Morris's sister initially upholds her brother's honor, once she meets Catherine, she drops the defense and makes a hasty departure. With his suspicions confirmed, the doctor confronts Morris and accuses him of being a shiftless cad seeking to fulfill his lazy ambitions with her inheritance.Catherine hears the very end of the discourse and rushes to persuade her father that Morris truly loves her and declares she has promised to marry him regardless. Dr Sloper challenges Morris to postpone the marriage for 6 months while he takes his daughter with him to Europe in the hope that she will change her mind.(According to other editorials, at Olivia's request, the writers softened the behavior and attitude of the character of Morris Townsend in the film version. Since I never cared for Montgomery Cliff, I felt the role of a cad suited him quite well.) During their absence, gullible, interfering Aunt Lavinia has entertained Morris every evening at the Doctor's home as he enjoyed drinking brandy and smoking his cigars, using Lavinia as a conduit to maintain constant influence over Catherine.Upon their early return home, Morris employs Lavinia in his plot to elope, but remains hidden to avoid a confrontation. The doctor discovers the empty brandy glass and cigar ashes and realizes Morris has been using his home as his private club and demands to know if he is also "sleeping in his bed." Catherine gets into a confrontation with her father where she finally understands he believes her only appeal to any man would be her annual $10K income. He declares his intention to leave his annual $20K estate to his clinic rather than leave it to her under the influence of Morris. She is devastated to learn of her father's contempt for her total lack of redeeming values and realizes her father has never loved her. She insists she will be happy to marry the cad even if he is after her money.Catherine insists that they elope immediately and tells Morris that she is never coming back home. Morris knows this means she will never get her father's estate. Morris is supposed to bring a carriage to pick up Catherine after everyone has gone to bed.Lavinia finds her niece packed and waiting and is initially happy when she learns they are eloping. But when Catherine tells her she is never returning, Lavinia asks if Morris knows about this, then laments that she should have waited until after the marriage to disclose she intended to disinherit herself. Catherine, is shocked to discover her Aunt also believes that Morris could only want her for her money but Lavinia still believes Morris could make Catherine happy.They wait, but by dawn, she realizes he is not coming. Lavinia makes noble excuses for Morris.The shy Catherine, now becomes hard and bitter. Morris borrowed money and ran off to California. Her father is dying. He is proud the marriage is canceled even though she was deserted. They quarrel over her not wanting his inheritance but he does not change it. Catherine hates him and does not speak to her father and he dies a few days later.Years later, Lavinia has brought Morris home. He professes his love and insists they should get married as planned. She tells Morris to come back for her with a carriage.Lavinia is thrilled but Catherine tells her Morris was full of the same lies and greed. Lavinia accuses Catherine of being cruel. Catherine asks how she could say such a thing after having stayed with her that night.The door is bolted and Morris is left, banging on the door calling her name over and over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor Little Rich Girl</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Olivia de Havilland gives a stunning performance as a shy, socially awkward young woman named Catherine, who stands to gain a fortune when her father dies. This forthcoming inheritance may, or may not, be the motive for the affection shown to her by a handsome young man named Morris (Montgomery Clift), whose proper manners and self-confidence are effusive. Catherine's father (well played by Ralph Richardson), a man gifted with great insight into people but a person who also has a cruel tongue, acknowledges Morris' charm and social grace, but is nevertheless suspicious.The most engaging angle to the story is the change that comes over Catherine, as the plot moves along. This character arc provides de Havilland with a terrific chance to excel as an actress ... and she does.With its stage play origin, "The Heiress" has lots of dialogue, and most scenes occur indoors. Production design and costumes trend Victorian, consistent with the style of the era in which the story is set. Not surprisingly then, the story bleeds proper manners, dignity, and class respectability. The B&amp;W cinematography is quite good, as is the casting and overall acting. But the score is nondescript and bland.I didn't much care for the antiquated setting and the Victorian style. But it's a fine story. And the film is worth watching, mostly for the wonderful performance of Olivia de Havilland, who deservedly won an Oscar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Personal Masterwork of Exemplary Style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>William Wyler's knowing and vindicating drama does not impose a lack of forewarning for the sort of film it becomes but naturally builds. It is the tale of a plain, painfully shy woman, in a remarkable performance by Olivia de Havilland deserving of colossal kudos that may well not quite be fully understood till the film's final frame. Ralph Richardson, an actor who teems with wisdom and assured authority, plays her aloof father who makes no concessions in his expressing his dissatisfaction with his daughter. When she meets the enticing Montgomery Clift, whose performance could be argued to be worthy of the same manner of praise as de Havilland's, she is instantly taken by the interest and kindness with which he smothers her, adoration she so urgently craves from her father.Wyler hits every note with the perfect dynamic in every aspect of the carrying out of this suspicious, slowly swelling, almost living drama, either stylistic or functional. Wyler can be seen through this film, straight into his heart. The reason why his subtle, hidden handling of Augustus Goetz and Henry James's material is without the auto-pilot connection an audience often has with even enormously entertaining films, why The Heiress's every scene virtually speaks to you with passive-aggressive mystery, is because Wyler, in terms of purely emotional familiarity, the thoughts that go through his mind, the personalities with which he can relate, knows the story's themes all too well, and I can see him signing on at the helm of this ruthless work of noninvasive craftsmanship, saying under his breath, "We'll just see whose calls resound unrequited into the shadows of the New York streets."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Heiress (1949): Starring Olivia De Havilland, Ralph Richardson, Montgomery Clift, Miriam Hopkins, Vanessa Brown, Betty Linley, Ray Collins, Mona Freeman, Paul Lees, Selena Royle, Harry Antrim, David Thursby, Russ Conway... Director William Wyler...Based on the novel "Washington Square" by Henry James."Yes, I can be cruel. I was taught by masters".......Director William Wyler was by 1949 an accomplished director and his career was far from over. He had directed Bette Davis in 1938's Jezebel which earned her an Oscar. In 1953, he was to direct Audrey Hepburn in "Roman Holiday" for which she also won an Oscar. Working under the direction of Mr. Wyler could spell success for the principal actors involved in his film. Olivia De Havilland, under the direction of this illustrious director, delivers an incredibly dynamic performance and without a doubt, her best performance in a movie. She walked away with an Oscar in her hand.10 years prior to "The Heiress" , in 1939 Olivia De Havilland appeared as Melanie Hamilton in the epic classic "Gone With The Wind" and had hoped to win the Oscar (Supporting Actress). She lost to Hattie McDaniel but her time finally came, after years of being typecast in insignificant roles in the movies, when she won her first Oscar for a Supporting Role in "To Each His Own" (1946) and she would win another Oscar, this time for Best Actress, for this marvelous film. She portrays Catherine Sloper, the timid and plain daughter of a wealthy doctor (Ralph Richardson). She is wooed by young and handsome Morris Townsend (Montgomery Clift) in 19th century New York City. Dr. Sloper suspects Morris is after his daughter's vast fortune, as she's set to inherit millions after his death and his suspicions are confirmed when he discovers that he has mostly financial interests in mind. At first, she naively believes Morris is in love with her. But after he fails to arrive to elope with her as planned, she begins to have doubts. Her father dies and she inherits his millions but Morris is no where to be found. About a year or two later he returns, and he claims he still loves her and wants to marry her. But by now, Catherine has wised up and become cynical. She is fully aware he is only after her money. She does not fall for his trick this time and has him begging to open the door which she has bolted. The film contains a subtle dramatic power concerning a father and daughter relationship and a woman's transformation from naiveté to bitterness. Olivia De Havilland is a revelation and her acting is beyond reproach. From the change in her voice - the first half of the film she uses a high, girlish voice and the second a darker, lower voice- to the psychological dimensions of her acting- she becomes the character with a strong degree of realism. While Montgomery Clift is not particularly strong in this role nor memorable, his own innocent looks provide the character with a level of complex ambiguity. Perhaps he did love Catherine after all, perhaps not. His charming teen idol looks keeps his ulterior motives and insensitivity from being convincing. On the contrary, cynic Ralph Richardson is superb as Dr. Sloper. Proud, imperious, class-conscious, he comes off as really bad because, right though he is about Morris, he doesn't seem to care about his daughter's happiness. Instead he straight out tells her she can only offer money to a husband because she is not physically attractive or charming. Deeply insulted, Catherine begins to loathe her father and this is enough to split them up as parent and child. She doesn't even see him on his deathbed. The chemistry between Ralph Richardson and Olivia De Havilland is very strong, in fact stronger than Clift and De Havilland's chemistry. Richardson had a long and successful career in British stage and film and at this time he was busy doing Anna Karenina which starred Vivien Leigh. Actress Miriam Hopkins was a veteran actress by this time and a fine "costume drama" actress with great subtlety and strength, though she is only playing a supporting role in this film. Olivia De Havilland was herself only beginning to perform great roles and other fine films were in store for her in the future, including"My Cousin Rachel" in '52 and "Hush, Hush Sweet Charlotte" in '64 . Her career spanned more than 30 years. Director William Wyler did a magnificent job of adapting both a play and the Henry James novel "Washington Square" into this dark, moody film. This is a classic drama with a stinging venom of its own. It is an exquisite example of fine storytelling through film. Hollywood of yesteryear was full of great movies whose dynamics rested on the acting alone and this film is such a one. De Havilland carries this film and proved how great an actress she truly was, after years of not only being under the shadow of her famous sister Joan Crawford but playing insignificant roles, including Errol Flynn's preferred leading lady. The black and white cinematography is fresh and never dull, unlike some awful-looking films earlier in the 40's. By 1949, black/white cinematography had reached a level of sophistication never before seen, even if it would not be until the 50's when color in film was not only common but provided opportunities for cinematographic experiments. The look of this film is a sort of romantic Gothic, a costume drama which focuses on intimate settings and inward psychology. When Catherine sits down to embroider, we can feel her frustration and her fear of spinsterhood. Scenes between herself, her father, Morris and Miriam Hopkin's character is well-written and reveal inner turmoils between characters. Beautiful and talented Olivia De Havilland is mesmerizing in this film and her Oscar is well-deserved. It's possible this was her best role, even if she was terrific in other dramatic films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2003 value of $30,000 per year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I caught "The Heiress" on TCM for the first time early yesterday morning. I thought the movie was excellent with a fabulous screenplay, inspired casting, and superb acting. I'm commenting now because it reminded me how I always amused by 18th and 19th century novelists (Jane Austen comes to mind) whose characters were evaluated by their portfolio incomes (e.g. "Fitzwm. Darcy has 3,000 per year!") Obviously Katherine's current and projected income is of central importance to the plot of this film, and as a private wealth manager I got to wondering "what is the present-day value of a $30,000 income stream?" In the unanimous opinion of the movie's characters, an income of $30,000 would make Katherine an EXTREMELY wealthy lady. I did some research on the Consumer Price Index in the U.S. (we have records dating back to the 1600s, if you can believe!) and determined that an income of $30,000 in 1850 would be equivalent to an income &gt; $703,000 today, which is very handsome indeed but not EXTREMELY wealthy in my book. However, to take this analysis a step further, it would be helpful to know the amount of PRINCIPAL it would take to produce that much income in a given year. Using 4% as a return appropriate for that era, Katherine's fortune would be almost $19,000,000, which does indeed fall into the EXTREMELY rich category! The question of how a physician of Austin's age had accumulated a fortune of that size was never addressed, leaving one to assume that it was inherited...p.s. can you even imagine what that townhouse would be worth now??? fabulous!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of my all time favorite movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that stays in your mind long after its ended. The performance given by Olivia de Havilland is nothing less that brilliant and anyone who's ever been harshly jilted by a past love can certainly cheer her on in the final moments of the movie.There are so many heartbreaking scenes in 'The Heiress'. Many people have mentioned the scene where her father berates her, but another sad moment for me was in the beginning at the dance, where Catharine is dumped by her first dancing partner. Perhaps that's why I kept hoping Montgomery Clift's character really was in love with Catherine--you just wanted her to be happy. The joy in her face when Morris wants to marry her, fills up the entire screen.Could another actress have been cast in the role of Catherine Sloper? Possibly, but I seriously doubt they would have done the superb job that Olivia de Havilland did. For me, the ending was a tad hopeful--the giving away of the cufflinks, the snipping of the thread and the line about never doing another embroidery again made me believe that once she exacted her revenge on Morris, she was ready to move on with her life.A 10/10 film. If it's ever on TCM, I highly recommend it. You won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece by any yardstick...great performances...(Possible spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>William Wyler does a masterful job of directing the complex emotions of Olivia de Havilland, Ralph Richardson and Montgomery Clift in 'The Heiress', as well as exacting a delightful supporting performance from Miriam Hopkins as de Havilland's giddy aunt. De Havilland plays both sides of her character extremely well, making a transition from the shy, submissive and awkward girl of the opening scenes to the hardened awareness of a young woman who understands the duplicity of men's ways after rejection from a suitor and humiliation from a stern and uncompromising father. All of the story leads to the inevitable conclusion with Catherine Sloper, lamp in hand as her lover pounds on the door, slowly ascending the long staircase to her bedroom, enjoying a hollow sort of triumph over the man who deserted her when she was in love. The only false note in the film is struck by Montgomery Clift's interpretation of Morris Townsend--too modern in his speech and open in his emotions to be believable as the fortune hunter. Ralph Richardson is perfection as the stern father and Miriam Hopkins adds the only cheerful bit of business as the Aunt with romantic fancies of her own. But the major achievement is Olivia de Havilland's subtle performance. One New York film critic began his review of the film by stating simply, "Ladies and gentlemen, let us rise to salute a great actress." Indeed, it's easy to see why de Havilland won both the N.Y. Film Critics Award and the Academy Award as Best Actress (her second Oscar) for this one. Her bitter confrontation scene with Ralph Richardson when he tells her, "At last you have found a tongue, but only to say such horrible things to me," is just one of a series of unforgettable acting moments for both of them. This film is a work of art, as is Aaron Copland's Oscar-winning background score adding so much to the mood of the drama. The recent remake called "Washington Square" pales in comparison to this original. De Havilland's most memorable line comes toward the end, when her Aunt questions her decision to reject Clift. "Can you be so cruel?" she asks. "Yes," is the firm answer. "I can be very cruel--I have been taught--by masters."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fortune Is A Woman.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ralph Richardson is a wealthy surgeon living with his daughter, Olivia De Havilland. She is presented as homely and lacking in grace. But de Havilland meets and finds herself courted by a younger man with the classy name of Morris Townsend (sounds like a Senator), played by the sublimely beautiful Montgomery Clift. Clift is better looking than De Havilland and his ardor seems a little excessive, but De Havilland is bewitched by his charm.Man, is she anxious to be loved -- and married! Richardson is a really cold fish, while De Havilland is inspired by her love for Clift. The father of course disapproves of the romance. Despite his elegant WASPY name, Clift is not a man of means.Richardson takes De Havilland on a trip to Europe, hoping that she and Clift will drift away from each other, but it doesn't work. She's determined to get out of the old man's house and live a rhapsodic life with the man of her dreams. And when they return from Europe, Clift is still salivating over the prospect of marriage.Finally Richardson throws his cards face up on the table. She's homely. She's socially clumsy. No one wants her, except for her inheritance, which he intends to deprive her of should she run off without his permission.That's exactly what she proposes to Clift in the court yard in the middle of a driving rain. Let's elope. We'll run off together tonight. Clift eagerly agrees. He'll return for her at nine that night. But then his face drops when she brings up her disinheritance. Au revoir, Olivia. He splits for California, leaving her waiting at the window all night.Years later, after Richardson has passed on and left her all his money, Clift shows up again, swearing that his love for her had never lessened and that he only left town because he didn't want to see her destitute. In other words, he left her flat for her own good. She gets even with him. The last shot of her climbing the stairs with a candle, smiling grimly, is chilling. The end.Henry James in his novel "Washington Square", from which this film is adapted, may have borrowed the frame for his characters from his philosopher brother, William. Richardson and Clift are like two peas in a pod, both "tough-minded" -- shrewd, practical, and unsentimental.Olivia De Havilland and her comforting Aunt Penniman, Miriam Hopkins, are equally "tender-minded" -- trusting, romantic, emotional, generous.Standing back a little from the story, it looks like a salubrious blend of Jane Austen (how can De Havilland get the proper husband?) and Charles Dickens (an impoverished young man seeks entry into the world of the very rich).Nicely done, too. Olivia De Havilland has never given a better dramatic performance. Notice, the morning after she's been deserted by Clift, the way her voice drops into the lower register and becomes flat, toneless, and resolute for the first time. And she's supposed to be unattractive but, despite that repulsive period hair style, she still seems winsome and "nice." Her eyes are big and dark like some nocturnal animal's, maybe a harmless fruit bat. And as a girl Olivia De Havilland attended a tiny, charming Catholic school in Saratoga, California. It's still unobtrusively there, tucked away behind stucco walls, oleander, and live oak, almost as hidden as the spinster's bitterness.Ralph Richardson is in his best form -- stiff upper-lipped, dealing out instructions to the household help and family about the arrangements for his death, forthcoming in a week or so. In full frontal view, his face is almost a perfect ellipse with uninteresting features, his hairline receding, the plane only spoiled here by a modest, pointed beard.I prefer Clift as a brooding, tortured fellow, along the lines of his characters in "A Place in the Sun" or "From Here to Eternity." But, as a matter of fact, his Morris Townsend has a lot in common with his George Eastman in "A Place in the Sun," jealous of social standing and a comfortable income, except that here he's thoroughly cold blooded about it all. He'd rather see the sun rise on a dollar bill than on all the Rocky Mountains in Colorado. Clift and Richardson, the other tough-minded individual, have something in common too. Richardson's got it and Clift wants it, and each knows the other knows. It all puts de Havilland in the position of a soccer ball.Very nicely done -- photography, art direction, and all. Vanessa Brown as the maid with the plump lower lip is cute. I recall seeing her as a seductress in a play on Broadway. What she needed was one of those short black outfits with a dainty white apron and perfunctory cap, like those French maids in cartoons.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A chilling tale of a woman scorned</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1949 William Wyler directed this brilliant and remarkably faithful adaptation of Henry James's classic novel "Washington Square". Using his trademark shadowy cinematography and decidedly murky view of 19th century America, Wyler and star Olivia de Havilland (in her most brilliant, triumphant performance) help bring to life this chilling tale of a woman scorned.It is 1849 New York, and Catherine Sloper is the only child of the fabulously wealthy Dr. Austin Sloper (Ralph Richardson) and heir to a $30,000 a year fortune. Even though Catherine is a gentle person and a good, devoted daughter, she is also plain and shy, which Dr. Sloper takes sadistic delight in pointing out to others. Richardson portrays Dr. Sloper as man of maddening contradictions. He forces his daughter into social situations she wants no part of, but when she does participate, he mocks her efforts behind her back. He labels Catherine as "talent less" even though she is a good embroiderer. We find out that Catherine's mother died giving birth to her daughter, and Dr. Sloper not only blames Catherine for his wife's death, but cruelly compares Catherine to her mother, whom he has romanticized into a grotesquely god-like image. He sees Catherine as awkward, dull and mediocre to his wife's beautiful and gifted visage. One character reprimands Dr. Sloper: "No child can live up to this image you have of your wife! You've idealized that poor dead woman beyond all human recognition!". Catherine's only real friend and supporter is her well-meaning but dizzy Aunt Penniman (Miriam Hopkins).One night Catherine meets Morris Townsend (Montgomery Clift), a handsome and worldly young man who lavishes her with attention at a ball and soon is relentlessly pursuing her, much to Catherine's surprised delight. Dr. Sloper, however suspects Morris of being a fortune hunter and does everything in his power to prove it, from interrogating Morris's sister to taking Catherine to Europe in hopes that the couple will forget each other. Finally, in a most savage and devastating confrontation, Dr. Sloper not only tells Catherine of his suspicions of Morris but unleashes every wretched opinion he has of his poor daughter from the bottom of his cruel heart: "You have one quality that outshines them all... YOUR MONEY!!"Deeply hurt and humiliated, Catherine finds Morris and begs to elope with him, unwisely telling him of her possible disinheritance. At this point we're praying that Dr. Sloper's hateful allegations are incorrect, but sadly, Morris reveals his own brand of cruelty when he doesn't arrive at midnight as promised, jilting Catherine and officially robbing her of her innocence and capability to trust.Catherine's transformation literally happens overnight: she goes from tremulous, emotionally battered young woman to a hardened spinster. De Havilland expertly shows Catherine's character changes not just in speech but in every physical aspect. Her posture is unnaturally rigid, bitterness seeps from her leaden voice, and her beautiful eyes literally lose their sparkle. In a scene that I think is very telling of Catherine's newfound inability to love and be loved is when Caterine's maid Maria compliments Catherine's outfit. Catherine dismisses the sentiment as a plea for a favor, and Maria defensively insists that she said Catherine's outfit was pretty because she meant it. When Morris unexpectedly comes back into Catherine's life, begging for a second chance, she is able to get her well deserved revenge, leading to the film's most famous line: Yes, I can be very cruel. I've been taught by masters.". Many film critics argue over Catherine's behavior at the end, but I for one think that it was entirely justified. Besides, if you had a father like Dr. Sloper and a fiancée like Morris, how do you think you would turn out?The Heiress is a reminder of a time when many movies were treated like plays, where performance mattered just as much, if not more than, box office clout. It's a shock that the character of Dr. Sloper hasn't found a place on a Hollywood's Greatest Villains list. But this movie belongs to Olivia de Havilland. After years of playing sweet and pretty ingénues, she finally got parts she could sink her teeth into in the late '40s. First as the mental patient Virginia in "The Snake Pit" in 1948, and then in "The Heiress", which not only helped her to win her second Oscar, but proved at last she could do more than just be attractive arm candy for Errol Flynn. For those who wish to see the darker side of Olivia de Havilland, then don't miss this haunting classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An "unmarriageble" girl</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Heiress - is an outstanding movie - adaptation of the play by Augustus and Ruth Goetz, based on the novel "Washington Square" by great writer, Henry James, The drama of a young, shy, sweet, open to love, rather plain in her appearance but very rich girl takes place in New York City in the mid-1880s. Olivia de Havilland is excellent as Catherine, the heiress of the title, who fells in love with a very good looking young man Morris Townsend(Montgomery Clift in the role that had propelled him to the stardom), who may or may not be after her extraordinary wealth. Catherine's Father, Dr. Austin Sloper (Ralf Richardson) is protective of his daughter and does not trust Moris sincerely felling in love with awkward Catherine. Dr. Sloper constantly compares his daughter to her late mother. Catherine is nothing like her mother whom the girl never knew but who was everything she was not. De Haviland's Catherine is so sweet and nice, she makes a viewer hope that she had found a true love and would be happy with the man of her dreams even if she is not the prettiest or wittiest girl in the world. Will it really happen? The film was directed by one of the Hollywood's greats, William Wyler and was nominated for eight Oscars including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Black-and-White Cinematography, Best Actress in a Leading Role, Best Actor in a Supporting Role, Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Black-and-White, Best Costume Design, and Best Music Score. Surprisingly, an excellent script which is one of the main reasons of the movie's success was not nominated. The film received four Oscars and deserves them all, especially Ms. de Havilland in one of her very best performances.9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Olivia's Biological Clock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Because of the infamous Code, Hollywood lagged behind the country in a lot of ways, its mode of expression could be positively Victorian. So a novel like Washington Square written by Henry James in 1880 was far from dated material at least in mores and manners.Curiously enough The Heiress the play and film taken from Washington Square has a lot in common with A Free Soul. Because the liberated Norma Shearer in A Free Soul and the repressed Olivia DeHavilland are both interested in sex. Make no mistake, that's what Henry James was writing about here.Olivia comes from quite the dysfunctional family, the Slopers. As Catherine Sloper she's a proper Victorian woman who is brought up in a house with her widowed father Ralph Richardson and his widowed sister Miriam Hopkins. Into all their lives comes Morris Townsend as played by Montgomery Clift.All four roles are very complex and the need for a great player's director in William Wyler is obvious. The Heiress could never have gotten off the ground without him at the helm. DeHavilland lives in the shadow of her late mother to whom no one else can compare in Richardson's eyes. Consequently he withholds any real affection for her though materially she has all she could want.Hopkins is a silly creature in love with love. When Clift starts taking notice of Olivia, she unlike Richardson encourages the relationship. His obvious character deficiencies don't bother her a bit.Like in A Free Soul where Norma Shearer sees sex in Clark Gable, that's what DeHavilland sees in Clift. Even as Richardson graphically demonstrates to one and all what the fortune seeking Clift is about, he misses the point. With no love coming from Richardson, Olivia will take it where she finds it. She's a repressed woman whose biological clock is ticking fast. For this performance Olivia DeHavilland won her second Oscar and one of five the film did win itself.The main competition for The Heiress in 1949 was All The King's Men, between the two of them they captured most of the Oscars that year. Both films still hold very well in today's age and will be viewed for the next millenia.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>probably de Havilland's best performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ms. de Havilland has been one of my favorite actresses for many years. Despite playing in a lot of costume dramas earlier in her career where her role was generally under-written and interchangeable with countless other actresses of the day, she was able to slowly overcome that with better and better scripts. Her most famous role was probably that of Melanie from Gone With The Wind, but The Heiress featured her best overall performance and in every respect this was HER picture. While there were some other good performances around this same period (such as in The Snake Pit and To Each His Own), this film is, in my opinion, her best.De Havilland plays the daughter of a rich but cold man ably played by Ralph Richardson. He coldly reminds her that she isn't particularly pretty or intelligent so she should set her sights on remaining a very rich spinster. However, quite unexpectedly, Montgomery Clift meets her and begins pursuing her in earnest. Richardson sees Clift as a pretty boy adventurer who is only interested in de Havilland for her wealth and coldly tells de Havilland this. Ultimately, he is proved correct but his coldness and nastiness towards his decent daughter awakens the coldest and most hateful side of her personality. What this new and improved(?) version of de Havilland does next is best left for the viewer to find out next, as it would spoil the picture if I told any more of the plot. See it for yourself to see a performance worthy of the Best Actress Oscar it received.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a way, the role of Melanie hurt the career of Olivia de Havilland. Fortunately, she was such a wonderful actress that she was able to overcome the sweetness and light typecasting that her soft beauty and glorious speaking voice nearly condemned her to.The Heiress is one of de Havilland's great achievements, if not her greatest. The film was meticulously cast, with Ralph Richardson as Catherine's father, Miriam Hopkins as her aunt, and of course, the gorgeous Montgomery Clift as that bounder, Morris.This is a beautifully produced and directed film. It's no wonder the plain Catherine falls for Clift, and one can't help being furious with Richardson for denying his daughter a chance at happiness, however fleeting it would have been. How sad that Catherine wasn't more "clever" about Morris, as her aunt says. But life, as it turns out, made Catherine very clever indeed. For all she suffered, one is left with the impression that there is a new life ahead of her. This is a no-miss movie.</fullReview>

When was the last time you saw a movie that not only had a storyline but also had actors who could act, and directors who could direct? No explosions, chase scenes or alien abductions here just class "A" entertainment! Olivia deserved the Oscar portraying such a painfully shy woman past her prime. It's almost torture to watch her be so subservient to her father and Aunt. Life beats her down, which hardens her heart. The ending, which will have everyone cheering isn't the victory she had long sought but it is of her own choosing. "I can be very cruel. For I have been taught by Masters."</fullReview>

It is one of about ten films that my husband and consider to be perfect in every way--not a unnecessary word, movement or scene. Not only perfectly cast, costumed, scored and written, it is mesmerizing and memorable. The nuances of Olivia De Havilland's performance constitute a magnificent lesson in acting. And Sir Ralph Richardson's portrayal of the father is superb--his coldness and pomposity are absolutely palpable. And not to be ignored is the Montgomery Clift portrayal of Morris who leaves one guessing--coward, fool, scoundrel or all of them rolled together! This film rates a 10 in my book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the GREAT classics,that will take it's place among those too few others during the 40s. The movie is set in the 1840s, with an unmarried daughter living with her Physician father, and since she's kind of "homely", doesn't get many gentleman suitors. I don't agree with the previous commentary, about her Father being cruel, he's just being a father looking out for his naive daughters' best interest, because back then,just like today, when these "homeless romeos", see an easy "meal ticket", they will do anything to hop on the "gravy train". And she should have trusted her Father,being a man,knows how men think. Sure he was not the overly affectionate type of man, but what a "Diplomat", in taking her abroad, trying to "cool" her &amp; his heels,a bit. They must have edited the film I saw, because I didn't see any "overt" references being made by her Father except in one scene,comparing her to her Mother. Anyway,she finds out what kind of "gold-digger" Morris is,just like her Father warned.And the climatic ending is SUPERB...!!! This film is definitely a collectors item.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Olivia de Havilland Shines In Her Oscar-winning Portrayal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nominated for eight Oscars and the winner of four, including Best Actress (for Olivia de Havilland), "The Heiress" is an adaptation of the play, which was taken from a novel by Henry James.Ms. de Havilland plays the central character, Catherine Sloper--a socially awkward young woman who is immature and without artifice. Her father, a wealthy doctor, fears that she lacks the skills to find a husband. Suddenly a suitor appears--Morris Townsend played by Montgomery Clift in only his third big screen appearance--and Catherine's father fears that Morris wants her only for her fortune.All of the acting performances in this film are excellent. Ms. de Havilland's is absolutely worthy of the Academy Award. I think such recognition is warranted if the portrayal demonstrates complexity and a believable honesty. I will cite one scene in the film to illustrate this. When Morris professes his love and asks her to marry him, we see Catherine react with many layers of emotion in addition to her child-like naivete. We see her surprised, afraid, excited, timid, and embarrassed within seconds; it is on her face.The dynamic tension of the story comes from the viewer's inability to determine the true intentions of Morris, though eventually his motives become clearer. What makes the story interesting are the changes that occur in Catherine. I would have enjoyed seeing this film in color, but that is a minor complaint for such an excellent film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I really "get" the heiress, perhaps because I identify with her</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seriously, when I was 10 I saw this and said "this is me", and I was right. This is one I never get tired of watching. I am of the opinion it is Wyler's best film and possibly one of the 25 or so greatest American movies of all time. Anyone with me? (You can be against me as well, of course. As Marty Feldman says in "Young Frankenstein," 'Suit yourself. I'm easy.') The story is just electrifying, all because it is so subtle, perhaps, so quiet and reserved in accordance with the period manner. But the depths of pure human viciousness and and cruelty have perhaps never been so incisively displayed. Wyler's camera is at every occasion positioned perfectly, and the production is flawless.DeHavilland got her second Oscar for this, and most deservedly. She's brilliant, in what is probably the best role of her career. Ralph Richardson was nominated for Best Supporting Actor, and was absolutely robbed of the statuette. He is even better than she is, if that's possible. His "Dr. Sloper" is a masterpiece of the acting craft. Forgive me now while I shamelessly spoil the film. I talk in great detail. If you don't want that then do not read on! DeHavilland plays a girl whose mother died in childbirth, and thus she is the only child to Dr. Sloper (Richardson). Sloper is constantly saying things that say, in socially acceptable 19th century terms, that Catherine is an entirely inadequate consolation prize for the wife that he lost to death. Apparently Catherine's mother was a graceful beauty - at least that is Sloper's memory. Catherine is a rather plain dull girl who spends all of her time embroidering, a habit that requires tenacity and accuracy, not imagination or grace.But then one night she goes out to a dance and meets Morris Townsend (Montgomery Clift). What a handsome devil Clift was when he arrived on the Hollywood scene. And that is exactly what he is, a handsome devil. He woos Catherine and gives her the attention and love she has been denied all of her life. Like a person in a lifeboat dying for water, she laps it up.Unfair comparison with her mother or not, Sloper sniffs out Townsend's love of the finer things and inability to get them himself in a heartbeat. He tells Catherine that if she marries him, she will be denied his share of her allowance and inheritance, cutting her allowance by two thirds. In the process the doctor unleashes his low esteem of her in a way that she can no longer retain any belief that he has a father's love of her. He has nothing but contempt for the graceless stupid thing he considers her. You can see the change in attitude towards him on DeHaviland's face. Words are not necessary.Unfortunately, Catherine still believes that Morris loves her, and in their haste to elope she tells him of her father's pulling of the financial rug from underneath their feet. Morris says her father will change his mind. She says with iron resolution, even if he does, she will not. Morris says he will return at midnight with a carriage and they will elope. In the meantime she tells her air headed aunt Lavinia - Hopkins is splendid in this supporting role as she hovers around, by the way - what she has said to Morris. Lavinia's face sinks. Now Catherine sees that even the people who are kind to her have her father's opinion of her. The clock strikes hour after hour until dawn arrives and she realizes Morris is not coming because the money he actually wants to marry is no longer there.Catherine's father dies, and she inherits her money and the house on Washington Square, although they remained unreconciled. Years pass and she is still unwed although more beautiful, a beauty from knowing who she is and no longer willing to lick the boots of those who might be kind to her. She dresses in fashions that she finds becoming, the opinions of others be damned. A cousin who was marrying at the time she met Morris is leaving with her children after a visit. A servant compliments Catherine's dress and then asks for the day off. Catherine points out that what we would call *** kissing is not necessary for her to ask a favor. I read somewhere where this showed that Catherine had become hard, but I say no. Catherine has learned to trade others' compliments for nothing. She holds her ground. Talk is as cheap as monopoly money and she has learned the hard way.The silly Lavinia, always the romantic, comes and makes a supplication for Morris -she has always liked him. If people read romance novels in the 19th century she would have been the type to do so. Morris is at the door. He is back and poorer for his adventures. But this time, although I am sure he is still the fortune hunter, something has changed, and he likes what he sees in this confident woman that acted like a dog without a home just a few years before. She says to come back at midnight and they will be wed.But as Morris returns later and pounds on the door, Catherine coldly dims the lights and marches upstairs to bed. Morris is a ghost of the suitor that never really was, and she is having none of it.Yes, this is a film! For all of us "forever alones" who are only wanted for our favors but not our company Catherine is my hero! Three cheers! And forgive the detailed synopsis that I call a review, but I really couldn't let you know what it feels to be like her without talking about the entire plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A shy, clumsy and insecure young lady still at home, presumably in her early to mid-twenties, is suddenly courted by a handsome young man in Washington Square, New York. But is he interested only in her inheritance? Olivia de Havilland, Montgomery Clift, Miriam Hopkins and Ralph Richardson star in this perfectly executed film, directed by William Wyler, based on a play adaptation of the Henry James novel. What "Shane" is to westerns is "the Heiress" for this genre. Monty could have any girl he wanted, but he has no prospects to speak of, and maybe no respectable young lady would have him. Certainly, no father-in-law would. Easy on the eyes is all good and well says father Ralph, but it doesn't go as far as dependability and resourcefulness. Monty had squandered his own money on living in Paris and now he lives with his sister. Both Olivia and Ralph are exceptional in this movie, Olivia winning a well-deserved Oscar and Ralph should have. He underplayed his role and spoke his lines with direct coldness. Hs treats his daughter terribly, belittling her every chance he gets and comparing her to his deceased wife. She was a bitter disappointment to him and he doesn't hide it. Nothing she does gets his approval or a kind word, except that she embroiders neatly. Miriam Hopkins gives her usually brisk and dotty delivery and Monty gives good support as the unsuitable Morris Townsend. But the scenes with Olivia and Ralph take center stage. Olivia is one of the best actresses Hollywood ever created and you see here her versatility in creating the simple- minded Catherine Sloper and how she copes with what Morris and her father does to her. If you've never seen "The Heiress," you have definitely not seen Olivia de Havilland at her best and you're missing a true movie classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beautifully crafted films like this. Director Wyler moves a stunning cast through an authentic translation of the James novella and play and, remarkably, it doesn't even feel like a "filmed play." The screenplay is deft and true to each character, but it is the acting that really triumphs here. Richardson's doctor is maybe his best film performance; his disdain for Catherine is balanced by his responsibility as a parent, and you get very well how he fails to perceive his own cruelty. Clift delivers the right degree of subtle scheming in Morris, De Havilland maybe overplays just a bit but is still extraordinary (especially as her voice deepens when her rage is expressed), and Hopkins, not in a lead role, is the perfect Aunt Penniman in every way. This is a treasure, pure and simple, and no one who values movies at all can afford to neglect it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of William Wyler's masterpieces, and quite possibly the finest screen adaptation of Henry James' work ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rewatching The Heiress after remembering nothing but great things about it, the film was every bit as brilliant as remembered and even better in fact. It is one of William Wyler's best, in a list that includes Ben-Hur, Roman Holiday and Dodsworth, and while there are some fine film adaptations of Henry James' work, like The Innocents and The Wings of a Dove my vote for the best goes to this, The Heiress.Visually, it looks absolutely beautiful and is rich in atmosphere. The Gothic set design is atmospheric and strikingly handsome (never getting in the way of the characters or the story), the costumes are elegantly evocative, the shadowy lighting adds so much to the atmosphere without making it obvious and The Heiress really does have to be one of the most exquisitely shot films of the late 40s, not only being very easy on the eyes but also very expansive which allows us to really be part of the action and be really engrossed in how all the characters interact with one another. Aaron Copland's haunting Oscar-winning score is some of his best work, and Wyler directs immaculately, his work worthy of winning the Oscar rather than just being nominated.The Heiress is also superbly scripted, with sharp, sometimes cruel but always compellingly realistic, dialogue, the subject matter explored intelligently, poignantly and sometimes chillingly. The story is chillingly intense and also absorbingly intimate, always powerful and never less than interesting, while the characters actually feel like real people (Morris is the least interesting one of the bunch, but only because of how compellingly written Catherine and Dr Sloper are. Wyler is also well-known for drawing out great performances and ensemble work, and not only do we get both here across the board but they're more than great. Olivia de Havilland won her second Oscar for this film, and it was richly deserved, it is a very meaty role with a character transformation from shy to cruel that could have rung false but de Havilland plays the shyness with poignant nuance and the cruelness to spine-chilling effect, by far my favourite performance from her.Montgomery Clift has had more interesting characters in his career, but he plays the role with control and subtlety, even also with an unsettling ambiguity as well. Ralph Richardson, like de Havilland, also delivers his finest screen work in this film, the character's coldness played to perfection. Dr Sloper and Catherine's father/daughter relationship is somewhat the core of the film and is played with brilliant passion by both Richardson and de Havilland. Miriam Hopkins is amusing and charming, but in a way that doesn't jar at all, despite how it sounds in comparison to the story.In conclusion, a brilliant film, one of Wyler's best films and the finest screen adaptation of Henry James with career-best work from de Havilland and Richardson. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A wealthy spinster (Olivia de Havilland) falls for a handsome young man (Montgomery Clift) who may be after her money. Her father (Ralph Richardson) certainly seems to think so. There's a lot more to this one that I don't want to give away. It's a classic from director William Wyler with an amazing performance from Olivia de Havilland. Montgomery Clift and Ralph Richardson are good, as well. Also special mention to Miriam Hopkins, who I thought was fantastic in this. If you're like me, you might be wary of checking this out. I dragged my feet about watching it for years because I figured it would be a dull overrated costume drama. But I was wrong. This is a very engrossing film that keeps your interest the entire time. So if you have the same type of reservations I had before I watched, take a chance on this fine film and I'm sure you will feel it was worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gripping Adaptation of a Broadway Classic Based on a Henry James Novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE HEIRESS is a powerful piece that quite literally grabs the audience by the throat and never lets go. Catherine Sloper (Olivia de Havilland) is a put-upon girl dominated by her father (Ralph Richardson), who falls in love with ne'er-do-well Morris Townsend (Montgomery Clift), but discovers to her cost that Morris, like her father, simply treats her as a convenience. With brilliant deep-focus photography and memorable shots - with Catherine shown either sitting on, going up to or descending stairs - this is a wonderful example of a filmed play. It might seem that Catherine acquires some kind of strength by the end, as she learns how to deal with her father and rebuff Morris; but we wonder whether she has any choice in the matter. Is she just the victim of a patriarichal world, which only values strength and power and rejects softness; to such an extent that she has to become 'mannish' in order to survive? De Havilland's transformation in the film is quite wondrous, but she doesn't provide any answers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Surely one of the best films of its time, stunning in its continuity and intelligence. This is not a tear-jerker, as I think it is too sophisticated for that, yet one can't help but feel the pain and disappointment in both her father and her lover. The point is that by keeping it so witty and sharp, it stands above the crowd of films that bring out the slobbering tissues; and that's admirable.So I can say that I admire the way this film was made, and how the cast kept true to this class; and that I think Ms. DeHaviland proved herself a great actress by this film, and deserved every accolade. Her reaction to her father's cruelty was poignant and reserved, yet full of inner power and emotion. It must have taken a lot of thought on what her reaction should have been, rather than how it could have been.Bravo!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest movies of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There has been so much written about this marvellous film by previous reviewers I will dispense with details re plot etc and simply re affirm my conviction that this is one of the best acted movies of all time, not least of course because the director William Wyler was a genius for bringing out the best in his cast, and they don't come any better than here. If I can find any criticism at all it would be with Montgomery Clift's character, not that he is at all unconvincing but purely because he is up against the almost unbelievable achievements of Olivia de Havilland, Ralph Richardson and Miriam Hopkins all giving performances, seldom, if ever, surpassed in the history of cinema. Add to that, brilliant camera work and an atmosphere that can only be achieved in black and white and you have a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>de Havilland shines in a fine film from Wyler</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>William Wyler's "The Heiress" is an adaptation of the 1947 play of the same name which was, in turn, based on the Henry James novella "Washington Square". In the film, a plain, socially awkward heiress falls in love with a charming young man whose intentions are called into question by the woman's father. Tensions grow as the daughter refuses to yield to her father's wishes.The first thing to be said about this film is that Olivia de Havilland contributes a phenomenal performance. She received a richly deserved Oscar for her heartbreaking portrayal of the shy young woman at the centre of the story. Only slightly less impressive was Ralph Richardson as her shrewd, inflexible father. He, too, was nominated for an Oscar, though he unfortunately didn't win. Rounding out the trio of stars was Montgomery Clift and when Clift delivers only the third best performance of the film you know there's some serious talent on display. Beyond the stars, there's not much worth remarking upon, though the rest of the cast is more than adequate (especially Miriam Hopkins).With this film, William Wyler picked up his seventh of twelve Oscar nominations for directing. That it was well-deserved goes without saying. Meanwhile, the distinctive costumes (by Edith Head) and the attractive art direction resulted in Oscar wins while the cinematography was also recognized with a nomination. Aaron Copland's score took home an Oscar as well but, while I thought it was good, it was a bit too ubiquitous to my taste.In the end, though I found the story's conclusion less captivating than its earlier ambiguities, the film, as a whole, was a satisfying experience. The four Oscars out of eight nominations testify to the film's considerable merit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Olivia Dehaviland shines here as does Ralph Richardson in a story about a rich Doctor father &amp; his daughter who stands to inherit his fortune on his death. He is overly concerned that any man trying to marry his daughter is doing so only for her money.Enter Mongomery Clift as the man with eyes for the daughter &amp; the fortune which comes with her. The father tries everything to stop this marriage from happening as his smitten daughter is ready to run off with him one night. He delays their first try at wedding by taking her on a major trip to Europe. Dad gets sick in Europe so they come home early.Then, dad is extremely cruel to the daughter by telling her she is nothing special. The cold speech sticks. Clift is supposed to show up the night they get back from Europe &amp; take her to elope. Between the speech &amp; the no-show, she becomes a bitter woman. Her father dies at this point.Much later Clift comes back to try again only now she no longer wants to marry him because she thinks he is lying to her about his love. The relationship between the father &amp; daughter &amp; the daughter &amp; her beau becomes like something out of an Alfred Hitchcock film.William Wyler does an excellent job directing this as the visuals &amp; the story are well told. While Wyler is not Hitchcock, he does make use of the camera &amp; the stairway of the house in Washington Square in much the same way that Hitchcock would.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It should be noted that the music for the movie "The Heiress" was composed by Aaron Copland, and at the insistence of William Wyler, the director, the tune "Plaisir d'amour" was inserted over Copland's objections several places in the score Copland objected vehemently but apparently it was too late to do anything about it.(The overture is a good example of this.) Nevertheless, Copland won an Oscar that year for the best film score. The score still stands as a great movie composition. Unfortunately, Copland did not compose many film scores, but those he did are now considered classics. The most well known score was for "The Red Pony". He also composed "Appalachian Spring" for Agnes DeMille's ballet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is film-making at its finest. William Wyler directs Olivia de Havilland and Montgomery Clift in two very excellent performances to steady a disturbingly powerful story of a plain, simple woman Catherine Sloper, who has almost no relationship with her father (Ralph Richardson in a frigid role) due to the untimely death of her mother. Enter Morris Townsend, a dashing, roguish young man just returned from Europe with eyes for Catherine. The father suspects he has eyes only for her enormous fortune and it is this going back and forth that keeps the suspense rolling, making us wonder if the father is right or if Morris really loves her. A true gem of the Golden Age of Hollywood, this is worth watching over and over again. Olivia de Havilland is marvelous and Clift is dynamic. Excellent work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wyler's best. The material, visuals, music, and performances are all fitted together economically, and the film manages to be both subtle and immediate. Wyler and his screenwriters improve on the novel by making Morris more ambiguous and more attractive than James made him. The three leads are terrific, especially de Havilland (it was really her last big movie part). And Miriam Hopkins does something that is very hard to do in a period film: she makes her character look frivolously spontaneous. The Copland score is much better than usual for movie music but it is not overused. This film starts a bit slow, almost like a costume drama, but it has no fat on it and it really builds. The ending packs a punch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on Henry Jame's famous novel "Washington Square", "The Heiress" reach a great level of excellency because the precise direction, the outstanding cast, and the dramatic rhythm of the story. In my view has some reminiscence of other American stories, as "An American tragedy" by Theodor Dreiser, Francis Scott Fitzgerald's "Great Gatsby" or most recently Woody Allen's "Match Point", essentially the tale of a greedy, social climbing, who in the end, lost. Although the pass of the time, even today the film keeps your interest completely. Montgomery Clift composed with mastery a character with certain similarities with the young George Eastman, the role who play himself a couple of years later in "A place in the sun"(1951)film based in Dreiser's novel and directed for George Stevens. Olivia De Havilland made a perfect transition between the candid and clumsy young heiress, and the posterior bitter and severe middle age woman who rejects impassive the supplications of Morris Towsend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Olivia De Havilland is a timid, quiet, plain but sweet young woman who is living in the shadow of her emotionally abusive father. All she wants is to find her place in life and that one great love. Montgomery Clift pretends to be that love but he has hidden, greedy motives which reveal themselves in a cruel way. In learning what love is, De Havilland's character is hit with two cruel blows. One is finding out her father has little regard for her, and the other is learning her special love cares only for the money she inherits.But in these blows, she finally finds a backbone. She stands up to her father and then becomes strong in dealing with this man who deserted her. It is so ironic at the end when Montgomery Clift is pounding at the door, and De Havilland is walking up the stairs. As he watches the light fading away, it is a symbol of his chances of riches fading away also. For De Havilland it is both sad and strengthening..sad because her sweet innocence is gone, but strengthening because she can finally extinguish the love for this callous and thoughtless man.</fullReview>

Her steely eyes, the cries of Morris, her ascending the staircase, plus one of the greatest lines on film " Yes, I can be cruel. I have been taught by masters."

		<fullReview>This movie was really beautiful. In the beginning, Catherine was annoying in her passiveness, but developed into a strong character. Morris was a perfectly deceptive manipulater who left the audience wondering about his true intentions for most of the movie. But what was even better about this movie was the storyline because it broke the mold of Hollywood movies at the time. It had a strong female character as the lead who really thought about how she controlled people by the end and left the ending in a sad manner. As she climbed the stairs in the final scene, darkness was around her and she still had many more "stairs" to climb in life. The ending shows the power of a woman who would end up leading a lonely life. This movie really left the audience thinking about this woman's life and sympathizing with her situation in life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Olivia De Havilland would win her 2nd Oscar in 3 years for 1949's "The Heiress."In this film she sacrificed her beauty to turn in a power-house performance as a woman victimized by her father, a nasty but truthful Ralph Richardson and gold-digger suitor, Morris, played well by Montgomery Clift. Richardson received a well deserved supporting Oscar nomination for his performance.Based on Henry James' "Washington Square," the film tells about Catherine, a plain looking woman, who is courted by Morris. When the two plan to get married, her father balks and in an emotionally charged scene, he warns Catherine that Morris is just out for her money and that if she married him, he would cut her off financially.When he makes good on the threat, Morris never shows up to take Catherine away. The disappointment and hurt on her face are memorable.When her father lies dying, Catherine sits across the street. She still harbors the resentment of being told the truth about her ugly-duckling look.With her father's death, Morris returns and supposedly expresses love for her again. Telling him to come back, the audience must have felt that Catherine is being the biggest fool ever. She has him come back only to extract bitter revenge and retreat to a life, ultimately that of a spinster.A well acted, well-crafted film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Olivia de Haviland at her best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Heiress is far and away in my top 5 favorite classic films, and coming from a complete classic film geek like me that is a high honor (for what it's worth). It is one of those films that if I see it on television I will always watch it, no matter if it's the beginning, middle or end. Olivia de Haviland plays Catherine, a young woman living in New York, who is (by 1890's standards) on a one way road to Spinsterville. She is arguably plain, not remarkably clever or witty, but very sweet and, it turns out, very rich. Unfortunately, her father, Dr. Sloper (Ralph Richardson) kindly reminds her of this almost daily. One night, she meets the dashing Morris Townsend (Montgomery Clift) who surprises everyone, including Catherine, by paying her attention and making his intentions known that he would like to marry her. Her father forbids it, believing that Morris is only after Catherine's money. Catherine is forced to choose between her family and her love, while struggling to believe that Morris wants her for herself and not for what she has.The story is a very basic one; it is the acting that makes this film so superb. Olivia de Haviland won her second Oscar for this role because she was absolutely heart-breaking and exquisite. Her quiet desperation is so painful to experience, yet her character growth is incredibly apparent. Ralph Richardson as her father is reminiscent of George Sanders-type characters; clever, opinionated and brutally honest. While he appears cruel, you know that he is only doing what he feels is best for Catherine. Montgomery Clift is also excellent. This film was made very early in his career and while his acting ability was definitely more polished in later films, he is tremendous in this film and shows raw talent. I also really enjoyed Miriam Hopkins in her supporting role as Aunt Lavinia, a woman who tries to help push the romance along.One thing that has always struck me about this film is how the theme song has the exact same melody as "Can't Help Falling In Love With You" by Elvis. Which makes me wonder if he was a Montgomery Clift fan or Olivia de Havilland devotee. My suggestion is to watch this film, then watch another de Haviland film like "Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte" to get a grasp of her range. Unfortunately this film is not on DVD (yet) but it can be rented and is also shown once in awhile on Turner Classic Movies, so check it out because it is not a movie to be missed.--Shelly</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The greatest movie ever is of course subjective. I love many other movies, but, this is the only one that I could watch at a drop of a hat whether I'm happy, have the blues, whether I'm tired or full of beans, whether the rain in pouring outside or in a middle of a heat wave. Every time I watch it (about 200 times now) I find something new in it. Just in front of Hitchcock (North by Northwest is my second favourite movie) William Wyler is my favourite director.All the cast, supporting, bit parts, etc are excellent. The tension is some scenes is unbelievable and all the characters are doing is just talking.I first watched this movie in 1975 and it still blows me away. A lot of ingredients make a good movie, writing, direction, etc but CASTING in my opinion is the overriding factor, particularly the acting.Yes, de Havilland is a good looking woman but that isn't what lets her down, it's her shyness and feeling of inadequacy that makes her 'undesirable', that's her father's subliminal doing of course, he's never forgiven her as being the cause of his much loved wife's death. It seems she may be her mother's daughter, but ironically her father's too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very fine drama. I can't decide who gives the most overpowering performance, whether it's Olivia de Havilland as Catherine, or Ralph Richardson as Dr. Sloper, her unsympathetic father. One can feel the tug of war going on mentally -- he with his overbearing, disdainful attitude, and she with the apprehensive approach of a frightened fawn unsure of herself in every situation. However, she does mature into a remarkably self-assured woman after life deals her some formidable blows. Tragedy can weaken some but she finds her strength by it.I appreciated the supporting role of Miriam Hopkins, as Lavinia, since she adds a tone of sympathy and understanding, often neutralizing the tense household atmosphere by her constant chatter yet trying to help in her own way.Regrettably, I don't see Montgomery Clift as Morris the fortune hunter, because he comes across as being too subdued and not very impressive in conveying any evil, conniving intentions. As well, I find his style somehow too modern in tone, rather out of sync with the story's time and place.I daydreamed a little about who would possibly fill the role of Morris with more conviction. At first I thought of George Sanders since he usually played the flattering suitor roles with ulterior motives, a ladies' man with finesse, but he might have been too old for the part. Then there was Tyrone Power who could have done the part justice, I've no doubt. And finally I landed on the choice of a youngish Richard Burton, who might have been about 25 years of age then. He certainly had the dramatic presence, diction and intense temperament to fill that role perfectly. ... sigh! ... However, Richard did join forces with Olivia for "My Cousin Rachel" (1952) a haunting drama indeed.I agree that the ending of this "Heiress" movie has one of the most memorable scenes in any film, it creates a lasting impression on the viewer. It's a 10 for me!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Learning From "Masters"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The filming of a staged play often highlights the acting skills of its cast, and "The Heiress" is no exception. Even the minor characters of this movie perform very capably. Unlike other filmed plays, this one has the added benefits of an excellent musical score, lavish costumes, and mood enhancing, darkened interior sets that authenticate the mid-19th century period. In retrospect, the romantic theme song "Plaisir d'Amour" (The Pleasure of Love), contributes a bittersweet, ironic element to a love story that produces nothing but sorrow and misery for all involved.Great pains have been endured to make Ms. de Havilland as plain and even homely as physically possible, mostly by means of a very strange, if not comical, hairdo that oddly drapes across the two corners of her forehead. She plays Catherine Sloper, the socially awkward, only child of wealthy New York doctor, Austin Sloper, played to perfection by Ralph Richardson. Obsessed by the memory of his deceased wife, the doctor never misses the opportunity to compare his dull, boring child to her mother, considered by him and by others to be quite worldly and socially adept. In fact, the doctor seems to derive great pleasure from his constant belittlement of Catherine. Rather than encouraging her in any way, he even ridicules her skill at embroidery, one of the few pleasures in her lackluster life, and he delights in his own derision of the unfortunate woman.For good reason, the doctor becomes suspicious about the intentions of the very charming but ne'er-do-well Morris Townsend (Montgomery Clift), who begins courting his naive, unattractive daughter after squandering away his small inheritance without any future prospects on the horizon other than her projected $30,000 annual income, which is not a paltry sum for the mid-nineteenth century, even if we are talking about Manhattan. As this play is based on the novel "Washington Square" by Henry James, throughout the film, the viewer is forced to exercise some mental effort in determining what the underlying, often concealed truth of the matter is, and Clift's subtle and underplayed performance adds to the deliberate ambiguity. If Clift was dissatisfied with his acting here, as has been reported, he must have been quite a perfectionist. Chill out, dude.As to Catherine, Ms. de Havilland lives up to her Oscar as best actress by so expertly portraying a complicated, multi-dimensional character with many conflicting emotions and responses, an individual who gradually transitions into a very different person by the end of the movie. As much as I love Ginger Rogers, this would have been a very different movie if she were cast as Catherine, a possibility that was once seriously considered by the studio.The performance of Miriam Hopkins as the doctor's socially conscious sister, Lavinia, is also noteworthy. A sign of Lavinia's true snobbishness is evident early in the film when she enthusiastically describes how impressed some passing acquaintances were that her brother lived on prestigious Washington Square. Well, la-dee-dah, Lavinia. While the character of this "merry widow" may be amusing at first, the viewer eventually realizes her destructive manipulation of both Catherine and Morris as her true meddlesome and duplicitous nature is revealed.Aside from the atmospheric costumes, interior sets, and music, see this one for the first-rate acting, directing, and writing, not only of the play's forceful dialogue but of the intelligent, thought-provoking material originally provided by novelist Henry James.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Heiress</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A 4 Oscar winning and 8 nominations total (including BEST DIRECTOR and PICTURE nominations), it's another masterpiece from Hollywood doyen William Wyler, contributing a significant second Oscar of actress in a leading role for Olivia de Havilland. Adapted from a Broadway play with the same title (by Ruth and Augustus Goetz), the story concerns a rite of passage for a young scion to experience a double bolts from the blue by her two beloved men and metamorphose into a cold-hearted rich damsel. The film offers an intensive psychological battle of a young heiress' dueling with both her sullen father (who constantly feel disappointed by her since she could never match her dead mother's immaculate image) and her handsome gold-digger-cum-love-of-interest (a too-pretty-for-her Montgomery Clift). The film never shies away from the daring confrontations of realistic barriers setting against the main characters, and an enticing performance feast could be conceived by all cineastes who enjoy cinematic dramas (myself included), Olivia de Havilland (it's my first film starring her, shame on me for GONE WITH THE WIND 1939), is magnificently polarized in her role before/after the incident of jilted and bereavement, as a thirty-something playing a besotted ingenue, she nails every second of her screen time and a well-deserving Oscar walkover for her (her first Oscar is gained from TO EACH HIS OWN three years before in 1946). Another Oscar- nominated performance is from Ralph Richardson (BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR), a should-have- won elite acting so compelling as to elevate the whole film onto an exhilarating exploit at any rate. Mr. Clift is also recommendable, Miriam Hopkins and Betty Linley are both scene-stealers in their appearance. A big bravo for another Hollywood chef-d'oeuvre from the Golden age!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most excellent story acted out to perfection satisfying all the way through. Parts of it are so tantalizing that you just cant wait to see it again and again. The movie delivers to the emotions and comeuppance portrayed here in this film brings closure to the subject. Listen to the dialog too. It is meaningful, dynamic, purposeful and delivered with expertise no matter whose actors turn it is. One wonders about the seedy greedy needy side of human nature and how when we have pure motives, things will work out for the better. but when we start out to deceive, what a tangled web we weave. This little lesson is presented here. Also, the doctor/father role is outstanding. The man knows his limitations, owns his feelings, is tactfully honest and to the point yet remains distant but noticeable throughout the picture. So much was done with this film that one wonders what ever happened to Hollywood and these formulas? They work for all yet they are far and few between. Olivia, Montgomery and Miriam, take us to the limits of good acting and let me thank you for doing so..Have a snack ready with this movie</fullReview>

Olivia de Havilland is really brilliant as Catherine Sloper, a shy heiress who falls in love with a dashing gigolo, Morris Townsend. Although her father bluntly warns her about Morris' intentions, Catherine ignores him, only to regret it. Montgomery Clift gives one of his best performances as Morris, and Ralph Richardson is great as Catherine's harsh father. This is a movie you definitely won't want to miss.

		<fullReview>"The Heiress" is an incredible example of the acting talents of Olivia De Havilland. Apparently the Acadamy thought so too, because she won an and Acadamy Award for her portrayal of Catherine Sloper. In this film Olivia De Havilland transforms herself into shy, reticent, humble heiress Catherine Sloper. This can't be an easy task when you are the beautiful and talented star Olivia De Havilland. But amazingly she pulls it off and is 100% convincing in her role. Of course no comment on this movie would be complete without mentioning another great acting talent of our time, Montgomery Clift, who more or less is the villain of this story. Montgomery Clift is such a good actor that he makes it easy to hate him towards the end of the film. However, it is difficult to hate him during the rising action of the film as it seems that he is smooth talking the audience along with Olivia De Havilland. And of course the audience falls for it right along with De Havilland's character. Other notable features of this film include Ralph Richardson as the slightly overbearing but still loving father, and the direction of the always amazing William Wyler.</fullReview>

It starts out kind of slow but it really picks up and soon you can't wait to see what happens next. Very great acting by Olivia, she plays the quiet shy girl, which is very sweet and will do any thing. It's amazing after her heart gets broken she becomes so mean.The script is not very predictable so it makes for a great movie. Camera action was very good and so much symbolism. Watch the part where she finishes her tapestry and then cuts the last thread. Symbolism of the very best kind, cutting the last shreds of love to the man that pretends to love her. Your heart will break when you see her alone, but you find courage as she breaks his heart. I kind of wished she would find a new lover, but as we all know to well many hearts are broken and many wishes are wasted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why, oh Why isn't this on DVD ? Possible spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my all time favorite film, admirable for so very many reasons.It refuses to sentimentalize and take copout endings. It takes the position that it is entirely possible for a parent to not love a child and for the relationship to be so poisoned that reconciliation is impossible. In lesser hands there would have been a deathbed reconciliation scene between Catherine and her father. Not here.There are some who criticize Montgomery Clift's performance but I found it marvelous. We see the root of his character when his aunt visited. This is a handsome boy who was raised by widowed aunts, women without men. He learned how to manipulate the emotions of lonely women, how to charm, how to talk his way out of anything, how to be selfish and parasitic. Men who become rats learned very early in life how to manipulate women because they were raised by women who did not set boundaries.I disagree completely with those who argue that Catherine is doomed at the end to a life of loneliness. The catch of it is that when Catherine says to her father, "I cannot imagine him starving me for affection more cruelly than you did", she understood why she had no emotional defenses against Morris. She understood that her neediness made her defenseless. In the years after her father's death, she hides from the world because she is terrified of another smooth talking rat manipulating her neediness. She is, after all, a rich, lonely, woman and there is lots more where Morris came from. So in the end, in confronting Morris she confronts her own emotions. She looks Morris in the face and realizes that she can control her feelings and that she will never be anyone's victim again. She has triumphed over the legacy of her father's emotional abuse and is ready to start living her life.A final point. When I saw the original film I thought that a line was missing at the final scene. Something where Catherine tells Aunt Lavinia to never, ever, take Morris's side again. If you check the play, the line indeed is there, where Catherine warns Aunt Lavinia that if she ever mentions Morris again, she's out on the street. I suppose it was left from the movie to avoid making her seem unsympathetic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I used to think Olivia de Havilland was rather a lightweight actress until I saw this. She is so believable as the pathetically shy and awkward Catherine who undergoes such a transformation of character that by the end of the movie she is barely recognisable as the same person. Ralph Richardson as her father is perfectly cast as someone who cannot stand the sight of his own daughter, one who tries so hard to please him. Our sympathies are with Catherine and we are behind her every step of the way as he starts to take control of her life. Even so, when she finally launches into an attack on her father, the audience is somewhat taken aback at the sharpness of her tongue. The final hammer blow comes when her dying father admits that he does not know how she'll spend his money and she gives the venomous reply with a look of utter bitterness and hate: 'No, you'll never know, will you!' Ouch!! This packs such a punch! Powerful performances all round - especially from Richardson and de Havilland.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 8+ rating is justified, but although I would give this fine film top marks, I cannot because of Montgomery Clift, who is the only false note in this otherwise perfect movie.Olivia De Havilland and Ralph Richardson are outstanding, hitting the right notes in every scene by the way they deliver their lines and their expressions. Clift, however, does not convey the duplicity that the character calls for. His obvious insincerity comes across as mere ambivalence and except for a few scenes, like in the end when he glances around the big house with obvious satisfaction that he will live a grand life, he does not portray the villain and charlatan he actually is but rather just another guy on the make.Still, after all these years, definitely worth watching for the performances of Olivia and Ralph, who are at the top of their acting game.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film, great performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Heiress is a good film which is elevated by the great performance at its heart. Olivia de Havilland turns in what for most any other actress would be the performance of a lifetime but which for her seems almost routine. She's so reliably brilliant that you take it for granted. But in this film it is impossible to overlook her. She's what makes the film work. She's what you'll remember when the film ends. The Heiress has a simple, though compelling, story. There's a lot to like about the film but there are some ups and downs along the way. Not everything works perfectly. It's a film which really needed a top-notch performance from its star to hold it together. And de Havilland delivers beautifully.It's 19th century New York City and de Havilland plays the part of Catherine Sloper, a spinster. Catherine doesn't seem to have much going for her. She's rather plain-looking, almost impossibly awkward socially. She's past the age where she should probably be married by now but the only man in her life is her father. And he thinks very little of her, considers her a profound disappointment. But there is one thing Catherine does have. Money. She already collects a nice little sum from her deceased mother's inheritance and when her wealthy physician father kicks the bucket Catherine will really hit the jackpot. Enter Morris Townsend, a young man who appears out of the blue and sweeps Catherine off her feet, almost instantly proposing marriage. Let it be known that for whatever charm Morris may possess what he doesn't have is a penny to his name. So his interest in Catherine is purely financial right? That certainly is what Catherine's father believes. But Catherine chooses to believe it's true love. Where does the truth lie? There are some serious twists in this tale and some surprises too as this game of love versus money plays itself out.Montgomery Clift plays Morris and he's mostly fine, even if he doesn't quite seem to have his 19th century mannerisms and way of speaking quite down. But while Clift is the leading man so to speak aside from de Havilland the most memorable performance comes from Ralph Richardson in the role of Catherine's father. Dr. Sloper is a jerk and that's about the nicest thing that can be said about him. He holds his daughter in so little regard, constantly pining for the dead wife he lost whom his daughter, in his eyes, could never replace. He's emotionally abusive towards Catherine, to the point it is at times almost uncomfortable to watch as he browbeats this meek woman. You'll really hate this guy and Richardson did a wonderful job bringing this villain to life. But there's the nagging question. What if this miserable old man is right? What if he has to protect Catherine from herself because she's too naive to see the truth? Whether he really cares about protecting her or just about protecting his money is highly debatable but maybe he's doing the right thing even for the wrong reason. Catherine will just have to hold to her hope that charming young Morris is who he professes to be, a man in it for love. For the exceptionally vulnerable Catherine the alternative may well be too much to bear.As the film moves along there's never any doubt that de Havilland is the best thing it has going for it. The shy, awkward, rather weak Catherine we meet in the beginning evolves throughout. By the end Catherine has certainly changed. She's a different woman entirely. And de Havilland traced her character's journey beautifully. The woman from the film's beginning bears so little resemblance to the woman from the film's end but de Havilland is believable every step of the way. She's whatever she has to be in each particular moment and the overall effect is mesmerizing. Her performance is so good it covers up whatever little blemishes the film may have. You have the character of Dr. Sloper who is such a jerk it's often unsettling. You have a story which takes a little while to set itself up and which then has some rather leisurely pacing throughout before it all of a sudden ends rather abruptly. But it's a story which does manage to hold your attention and surprise you along the way too. And at its heart it has that standout performance from a true Hollywood legend. The Heiress is a good film. Perhaps very good even and if that is the case it is de Havilland who makes it so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hollywood in its Golden Age pays tribute to an earlier age of grace, adapting the Henry James novel 'Washington Square' into a well crafted period drama set in the late 19th century, at a time when style and etiquette often masked the more bloodthirsty instincts of human nature. Olivia DeHavilland displays her under-appreciated talents in the title role, portraying an unmarriageable daughter who defies her overprotective father by accepting the attentions of a handsome young suitor who may or may not be a fortune hunter. The ambiguity of his true intentions is played to mannered perfection by Montgomery Clift, blurring the line between sincerity and doubt until every carefully built hope of a happy ending is ruthlessly destroyed. Strong performances and an airtight, literate script make this a memorable motion picture, one that proves how few things are more cruel than society at its most polite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Conflicted father figure steals the show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who is the main antagonist of 'The Heiress'? Is it Dr. Sloper, who continually humiliates his daughter because she can't measure up to his deceased wife but ends up leaving his fortune to her anyway? Or is it Catherine, whose self-esteem growing up, takes a beating at the hands of her father, only to transform herself later on into a calculating independent woman who coldly fails to visit her father on his deathbed and takes revenge on a conniving suitor? Or is it Morris Townsend, the ne'r-do-well who brings a little excitement into the life of the socially backward Catherine but all along is simply after her inheritance? It is precisely these ambiguities that have sparked so much discussion on the internet regarding this flawed but fascinating film classic.Many internet posters consider Dr. Sloper the true villain of the piece. But is he? By the standards of the 21st century, some view him as a classic misogynist. But in terms of when the story is supposed to take place, the 1840s, he's actually a true man of his times. When Catherine brings the fish she's bought from the fish vendor into the house, Dr. Sloper gently reminds her that she's failing to follow the typical class protocol of the time?which is to have the vendor bring the fish into the house. But does he run down the street and thrash the vendor with a cane because the man failed to assist his 'social betters'? The vendor's 'faux pas' along with Catherine's, hardly concerns the good doctor.But there are those who fault Dr. Sloper for being violent on the inside?the way in which he inflicts grave psychological harm to his daughter. He tells his sister, Mrs. Penniman, that he considers Catherine "mediocre" and "lacks poise" but on the other hand, gently reassures her to her face that "she's not a disturbing person". Today, young people who are developmentally disabled are not stigmatized the way they were 160 years ago. They see psychologists or go to special schools. But in 1849, there were no shades of gray when it came to mental health. Those who were considered 'slow' or 'childlike' had to 'sink or swim'. Dr. Sloper's patronizing attitude toward his daughter was a mixture of both contempt and true parental concern. In a sense, Dr. Sloper was a 19th century advocate of today's 'tough love'. He 'expected' his daughter to adjust but when he saw that she didn't have the insight to see through Morris, he didn't forbid her never to see him again?rather, he judiciously suggested a compromise where he took her to Europe, where he was hoping that she might come to her senses.After their return to New York, Dr. Sloper made some hurtful, inappropriate comments to Catherine after she informs her father that she hasn't changed her mind and still intends to marry Morris. He tells her that she has nothing to offer and men will be only be interested in her for her money. Clearly, he's frustrated with her since she can't see through Morris and leaves her with the famous line that her only real talent is her neat embroidery. Catherine's emotional transformation from naive waif to the steel-hearted heiress in a heartbeat is perhaps the least convincing scene in the movie. But hey, that's what melodrama is all about! To confess, I liked Olivia de Haviland in the second half where she's much better at playing a Cruella de Ville than a Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.As for Catherine, it's clear she's depicted as a tragic figure, incorporating all of her father's bad points and becoming even more inflexible than he. When Dr. Sloper is dying, he's even willing to praise her gumption in deciding not to go with Morris. But as he reaches out, Catherine falsely tells her father that she's still in love with Morris, just to get back at him even more. The coup de grace is when she fails to visit her father on his deathbed. I would say a majority of people when they get older, forgive their parents and acknowledge that they tried their best. But not so with the embittered Catherine.Finally there's Morris Townsend whose character was modified to be more benign from the original source material of the play the movie was based on. This was done at the behest of the film's producers, who felt that the public would not accept a romantic leading man such as Montgomery Clift, as a malevolent villain. Morris is the weakest of the three principals, precisely because we find out so little about him. He's a charmer and has a nefarious plan and that's it. And while he deserves his comeuppance when Catherine locks him out of the house, I found the way in which she takes revenge to be rather a dull and unoriginal plan. There needed to be something a little more dramatic and clever for the finale, instead of Montgomery Clift locked out of the house and simply banging incessantly on the door.I would be remiss if I also failed to mention the comic relief of the story?and that's Aunt Lavinia Penniman. She's also an ambiguous character in that she's quite supportive of Catherine but undermines her at the same time due to her support of Townsend. Penniman's problem is she's addicted to romance novels. So it doesn't matter whether Townsend is a scoundrel or not; her need is to live vicariously and have her 'fix' of romance--blinding her to the reality of Townsend's scheme which ultimately contributes to Catherine's heartache, by egging her on into the lion's den. Has Catherine actually turned a new page in her life after taking revenge on Morris? Like so many other scenes in this film, it's ambiguous. But it's really the dynamic father-daughter relationship which makes the film so compelling and has led to so much stimulating discussion about it on the internet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...to all young actresses who want to learn about their job:watch Mrs De Havilland whose performances are close to perfection;an actress who did not think twice when it came to make herself look ugly.And the rest of the cast is admirable too:Monty Clift was perhaps the most gifted actor of his generation and sir Ralph Richardson is equally powerful as the selfish resentful father.How is it possible that there are still "critics" who despise William Wyler,maybe the best story teller of the whole American cinema?His directing is BY NO MEANS academic .Nobody films a ball like Wyler used to do:everybody remembers the fabulous scenes in "Wuthering Heights" , "the letter" and of course "Jezebel".Here he outdoes himself and his filming of these people dancing is a feast for the eye.I also love the way Wyler introduces his male lead.Besides,Clift is so subtle an actor he makes us believe he might not be a fortune-hunter.Another stroke of genius is the use of the stairs .All along the movie,Catherine goes downstairs then upstairs ,till the impressive final sequence.The cast and credits appear on a tapestry which become a picture of the street.A tapestry Catherine will be making during the whole movie too.It represents an ossified society where time stood still .Catherine on her stairs is like a squirrel in a cage.A remake ,called "Washington square" ,was made by A. Holland starring Jennifer Jason-Leigh,Albert Finney,Maggie Smith and Ben Chaplin.Although it cannot hold a candle to the 1949 version,it's worth a watch though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>truly one of the great performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a Henry James fan, and enjoyed both the book "Washington Square" and the 1990s film of the same title starring Jennifer Jason Leigh. It wasn't until I saw "The Heiress," however, that James's story came to life for me. The comment at the top of the page describes her father as "emotionally abusive," but the situation isn't that simple. Her father does love her, and he is right about Morris, and he isn't lying when he makes his devastating comment to Catherine. Labeling him as emotionally abusive isn't necessarily wrong, but it applies late 20th century concepts to a 1940s film based on a late 19th century story. The three primary performances are nuanced and not at all simplistic, allowing us to remain in the tension of ambiguity. De Haviland's performance is probably in my top five performances by an actress in a film.</fullReview>

Montgomery Clift is, in the same measure, the ideal partner. and the entire struggle between two lovers, the splendid end, the great music are virtues who gives to The Heiress a special status. because it is not only a romantic story but chronicle of a profound, fascinating metamorphose . and this is one of motifs to see it. to enjoy it. for the precision of each step on a not easy way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A young naive woman (Olivia de Havilland) falls for a handsome young man (Montgomery Clift) who her emotionally abusive father (Ralph Richardson) suspects is a fortune hunter."The Heiress" received universal critical acclaim and won four Academy Awards. Bosley Crowther said the film "crackles with allusive life and fire in its tender and agonized telling of an extraordinarily characterful tale".Apparently Clift disliked his acting in this film, though I think he comes across just fine. He even learned piano for the part, so clearly he put some effort in. Olivia de Havilland is alright, and her real talent comes out as the story progresses. Ralph Richardson is the most interesting; Basil Rathbone has said he wanted the part, and it does seem that Richardson is acting in a very Rathbone-esque manner. They are practically interchangeable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Henry James' Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Henry James did not write short novels, which are great literature. This picture made in 1949 captures the principal drama of James' novel "Washington Square." It qualifies as fine art. Olivia De Havilland is amazing - an Oscar was surely easy to award. Any character is heavily dependent on her/his director. William Wyler should have gotten an Oscar as well. The ending is so real, not a "Hollywood" ending. It is not "bigger than life." An Oscar-winning performance always involves nuances of expression, beyond what the director can ask for - a twitch of the eye - tremor of muscle which conveys an inner meaning - slight voice inflection. It's all here in De Havilland's performance. Bernard Shaw's "Pygmalion" doesn't quite compare. Shaw would have applauded "The Heiress."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>STUNNINGLY SOLID DRAMA</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you can accept the glowing Olivia De Havilland as plain, you will enjoy this stunningly solid psychological drama. In sensuous black and white it tells of a jealous, dominant father who destroys his unattractive daughter's opportunity to marry a handsome mercenary (Montgomery Clift, so beautiful that suave director William Wyler avoids close-ups of him lest we become too sympathetic to his schemes). Writers Ruth and Augustus Goetz have simplified and somewhat romanticized Henry James' more bitter novel, a good move, since it allows us to judge the characters for ourselves. The shattering conclusion, one of the most memorable in movie history, is entirely their invention. Watch Olivia De Havilland walk away with an Oscar in one long walk upstairs!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie compares very favorably with Washington Square (1997), which is also based on Henry James's story of that name. A great story, great acting - a well-deserved Oscar for de Haviland. But don't miss the music, most of which was written by Aaron Copeland right around the time he wrote Appalachian Spring. It is similar in style to Appalachian Spring, and perhaps slightly inappropriate, if you think of that rural setting while watching a story about New Yorkers. But it works beautifully and enhances the emotional meaning of the scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Soapy good movie that's a great start for Clift fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Possible spoilersIf the movie was made today (and it was remade in a movie I haven't seen, Agnieszka Holland's 1997 film "Washington Square"), it would be hard to get it out of the soap level. But for some reason, maybe because of the time it was made and that it was made in black and white, it works beautifully. The setup is simple: an insecure, but amiable girl (Olivia de Havilland) meets a gorgeous young man (Montgomery Clift), who's interested in her, but for reasons the girl's father deems suspect.The girl's father, Dr. Austin Sloper (Ralph Richardson), tells her that he's not really interested in her but she refuses to believe him. He tells her, somewhat contemptibly, that she has no poise, no grace, no gift for eloquence or quick-wit and that anyone as good-looking as Morris Townsend (Clift) is surely only interested in her money. So he makes her come with him to Europe, in the hopes that by the time she returns she will have forgotten Morris. He's a little cruel, but we can empathize with him: his daughter is just too gullible. He holds high standards for his daughter, indeed he holds her up to the light of his deceased wife.When Austin tells his daughter Catherine plainly that she'd never catch someone like Morris without there being strings attached, she becomes determined to live without her father and his money. She tells Morris and he vows to come back for her later in the night so that the two may elope, and so Catherine waits. And waits. And waits. It's finally when her aunt Lavinia (Miriam Hopkins) tells her that she shouldn't have told Morris of her plans to be independent of her father that Catherine realizes he was right all along.When her father tells her that he may die soon, and that his health troubles are more than a mere congestion, he wants her to take his inheritance. He tries to mend the two's relationship and Catherine becomes enraged, saying that he never loved her and that even if Morris doesn't love her, at least she'll have his good-looks. She'd rather buy love from a husband than spend twenty years not knowing her own father didn't love her.After this, she gets a tongue. It's why de Havilland won an Oscar -- it's a complete change without being two separate performances. A new side shows itself and Catherine grows. When a maid compliments her dress and then asks to go out for a stroll, Catherine snaps back that she need not give her false compliments in order to get something in return. After a long time passes and Catherine's aunt tells her that she's seen Morris in the city and that she's brought him along with her to the house, Catherine at first tells her to say she's not there. Then, as she hears Morris' voice and the camera stays on her face, she invites him in.The ending of the film is almost a feminist one ("The first time he only wanted my money, this time he wants my love, too.") and the last scene is now sort of anti-climactic. It ends a little too soon, I thought. But that's hardly a big complaint. It left me wanting more.The film holds up very well, as many period movies do (it's set "100 years ago" and the film was made in 1949), and it approaches the subject matter in a melodramatic, soap opera-y way. It's all bubbly. (That's a good thing.) Richardson is a refined presence and his scenes with Clift are terrific. The two riff off each other wonderfully. As Catherine, de Havilland is very memorable and her shift in character seems wholly plausible. The real gem of the movie is, I think, Montgomery Clift. His voice and mannerisms seem New York and downright modern. The performance has aged perfectly. (Well, there are a few of those kiss scenes -- "Oh Catherine!" -- that wouldn't happen today, but those are just classic movie isms.)Very well-crafted movie that's recommended, especially for someone, like me, interested in seeing what Clift had to offer.***1/2</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest movie ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The greatest movie ever is of course subjective. I love many other movies, but, this is the only one that I could watch at a drop of a hat whether I'm happy, have the blues, whether I'm tired or full of beans, whether the rain in pouring outside or in a middle of a heat wave.Every time I watch it (about 200 times now) I find something new in it. Just in front of Hitchcock (North by Northwest is my second favourite movie) William Wyler is my favourite director.All the cast, supporting, bit parts, etc are excellent. The tension is some scenes is unbelievable and all the characters are doing is just talking.I first watched this movie in 1975 and it still blows me away. A lot of ingredients make a good movie, writing, direction, etc but CASTING in my opinion is the overriding factor, particularly the acting.Yes, de Havilland is a good looking woman but that isn't what lets her down, it's her shyness and feeling of inadequacy that makes her 'undesirable', that's her father's subliminal doing of course, he's never forgiven her as being the cause of his much loved wife's death. It seems she may be her mother's daughter, but ironically her father's too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>lame ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good acting, enjoyed seeing these particular stars on screen, but the ending is completely lame. The movie ends suddenly, and you realize that you don't know the true motives of any of the three main characters, which is what you've been waiting to find out from the very beginning of the movie. It just stops, and you realize you've wasted a couple of hours of your life. No satisfaction whatsoever, and kind of depressing. The plot focuses on a sheltered girl whose mother has died and whose father is both over-protective and critical. It becomes immediately obvious that his daughter can never live up to the romanticized ideal of his dead wife. His life-affirming sister thankfully moves in and is a positive influence on the young lady, introduces her to society and appreciates her many good qualities. A sudden suitor sweeps the girl off her feet. Rather than be pleased, her father forbids the marriage, insults the boy, ridicules his daughter as unlovable, and insists the suitor is a gold-digger. The rest of the movie is filled with scenes where the main characters' actions could be interpreted in two ways. Not enough information is given to decide whether the father is being wise in his assessment of the suitor or just cruel, whether the girl is naive or has found her true love, whether the aunt is a dimwit or loving mentor, and whether the suitor is a knight in shining armor or a cad. Just when the movie has reached a climax and the audience thinks it will finally see the truth, the movie ends with a bitter, revengeful, no-longer-young lady, a dead father, a disappointed aunt, and a freaked-out suitor banging on the door...and the words "The End" come up on the screen. This movie takes the audience on a ride that ultimately doesn't end. I was left wondering about all of the characters, and feeling very manipulated. To set up such a strong story line with one big question looming throughout the movie, and then not answer that question but just stop the movie, is lame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Heiress</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Oscar and Golden Globe nominated director William Wyler (Wuthering Heights, Mrs. Miniver, Ben-Hur, Funny Girl), this film featuring in the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die book was not one I knew about, especially not any Oscar wins, so I watched it. Basically plain and painfully shy woman Catherine Sloper (Oscar and Golden Globe winning Olivia De Havilland) has her father Dr. Austin Sloper (Oscar nominated Ralph Richardson) constantly disappointed in her and has emotionally detached himself from her. She is immediately taken from attention lavishing upon her from charming Morris Townsend (Montgomery Clift), this attention she longs for from her father, she falls madly in love with the man and they plan to marry, but her father believes the proposal is to steal her inheritance. Catherine's father says he will disinherit her is she marries Morris, but she doesn't care, but she does tell her love interest before any marriage goes ahead, and on the night the procession is to happen she waits for him, but he never comes. She is heartbroken and has a bitter argument with her father a day or so later, but he reveals he is dying, she says that if he wants to change his will for the inheritance if he is worried about her love for Morris she will allow it, but he dies and she inherits the entire estate. Some years later Morris has returned from California, where he failed to make something of himself, he expresses his love for Catherine, saying he only left because she struggled with food and other needs, she pretends to accept his apology and that she still wants to marry, and agrees to return during the night while she packs. Morris does return, but Catherine gets her revenge by ordering the maid to bolt the door, locking him out, he shouts for Catherine and her aunt asks how she can be so cruel, and her response is "I was taught by the masters", the film fades to black as she goes upstairs and he continues pounding on the the door. Also starring Golden Globe nominated Miriam Hopkins as Lavinia Penniman, Vanessa Brown as Maria, Mona Freeman as Marian Almond, Selena Royle as Elizabeth Almond, Ray Collins as Jefferson Almond, Betty Linley as Mrs. Montgomery, Paul Lees as Arthur Townsend, Harry Antrim as Mr. Abeel, Russ Conway as Quintus and David Thursby as Geier. It won the Oscar for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Costume Design and Best Music for Aaron Copland, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography and Best Picture. I will start firstly by saying that I did not pay perhaps the fullest attention I could while watching, and it is probably for that reason I could not agree with the critics giving the film five out of five, but anyway. From what I did watch properly De Havilland deserved her Oscar for being nice and calm and then turning into a cruel rich woman, the supporting cast members all did their parts fine as well, the story was reasonably okay to understand and the costumes were good, I can't say much more than that, but I know it was a most watchable period drama. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dinner For One, Please, James</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Today hardly a season goes by without yet another Henry James adaptation but back in 1949 this was only the third James-sourced film to reach the screen. The first, Berkely Square was back in 1933 with Leslie Howard in the first of several adaptations (and titles) of James' time travel novella. In the mid forties Michael Redgrave adapted The Aspern Papers for the stage and it was filmed in 1947 with Robert Cummings and Agnes Moorehead, which brings us to the James novel, Washington Square which Ruth and Augustus Goetz adapted for the stage and later adapted again into this screenplay. The result, perhaps the most static of all three adaptations, is just short of a masterpiece. I've never been a great admirer of De Havilland but here she turns in a magnificent performance all but showing us the exact moment when the canker entered the rose. The other thee principals are equally awesome with Ralph Richardson coming out on top by a short head from Monty Clift and Miriam Hopkins. Again I've never understood the acclaim lavished on Wyler but I cannot deny his masterly direction here.</fullReview>

She finds a man who loves her and then the father moves into break-up the relationship. He succeeds in breaking up the lovers and the daughter becomes bitter for the rest of her life.

		<shortDescription>Certainly a good movie but I just wasn't too fond about the story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a rather well done movie but the story just didn't exactly did it for me. In essence you can say this movie is an '40's chick-flick and features mostly themes that girls will be be drawn towards.To me the story just didn't seemed very convincing or likable. How could a girl fall so deeply and madly for a guy that she has only known for one night. And when you're that naive about love you deserve to be taken advantage off in my opinion. The main character played by Olivia de Havilland was supposed to be a naive and inexperienced shy girl, who had clearly never had a guy romantically involved with her in her life. She then totally grabs herself on to the first person that gives her a bit of more than normal attention and affection. So the next day when he asks to marry him she immediately says yes, though she knows clearly nothing about him or vice versa. It's such a silly and bad massage to send out for a movie to young woman out there. Because of the story and its premise I just never could find myself truly liking this movie.Guess the only reason why Olivia de Havilland won an Oscar for this was because of the movie its last 10 minutes. Now I have always been a fan of hers but this movie certainly did not featured her best performance. She even annoyed me at times with her naive, girl like behavior. Ralph Richardson was a far more- and better constant factor within this movie. Montgomery Clift seemed to had been slightly miscast in his role and also his accent just doesn't seem quite right for his part.The movie does have some strong characters and all of the character go to some nice transitions, which is due to its obviously solid written story. The story got based on a novel and the stage-play that got made of that very same novel.Like most of these big studio 'romantic' drama's from the '40's, it's all good looking and well put together. This movie had William Wyler as a director, who of course is more than a capable person. So if you're into the genre of dramatic period pieces from the '40's, this is still a good movie for you to watch.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spinster for Eternity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This year's TCM 31 Days of Oscar is allowing me to beef up my viewing of classic films that they don't regularly show. I've been a TCM fan since I was young and it's my favorite station. Well, last night 'The Heiress' was on, and I like Monty Clift and Olivia de Havilland (sometimes), so I was happy to be able to finally see this one. I usually only get upset by endings if the entire movie hadn't been building up to that moment. My disappointment with the ending of this movie, was that Catherine turned into her father and would obviously remain a spinster for the rest of her days. I don't believe that by the end she was a "better" person. Probably less naive, of course, but more hardened as well. I don't think that the Morris character was fleshed out well enough to lay her bitterness totally at his feet. Her own flesh and blood) didn't think much of her, and said as much before his death. That lack of affection and confidence from her father would indicate how (un)trusting she would be of men. She had already purposed in her mind that she wouldn't believe anything Morris would say and then sought to embarrass him. Sorry, but it just wasn't clear enough that he was telling lies. Nothing about his character really indicated that he was shady. Her father, yes, but not Morris. I highly doubt that a young man who looked like Monty Clift (before AND after the accident) would have trouble finding another woman. What was his motivation for coming back after all that time? If Catherine was a target, did he really not find OTHER targets after at least two years? I just didn't buy it.All in all, I'm glad I finally saw this movie. I'm not gushing with praise for it, sadly, and I wasn't blown away by OdH's performance like I expected. I checked out the other nominees for the Oscar that year, and I've only seen Pinky, so I don't know how strong/weak the other performances were.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well made but...I dunno...it just didn't work for me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Regardless of what Oscars this won, there were things in this that just didn't set too well with me.I think my main issue with this film is the characterizations. For instance, the Miriam Hopkins character is just too ridiculous. She just keeps pushing her to marry this greedy guy and she cares zero that he's in it for the money. I mean were women that rotten as to not care for another's feelings? Especially a niece? The father is the only one who sees the transparency of his daughters suitor and yet he's cruel because he speaks the truth. It's obvious he doesn't have a whole lotta feeling for his daughter. She's not very attractive and frumpish acting but she's still his daughter.The character played by Montgomery Clift is done in a way where you really don't know for a long time in the film if he's actually genuine or not. I honestly think they should have used a different actor for the role. Monty Clift, in any role, is always the nice guy. Even as a guy wanting to marry this not attractive/frumpish girl just for her money comes across as a nice/polite fella all the way through until the end. There was no real evil intent detected throughout the film imo.Let's talk about the makeup they use on Olivia de Havilland. To make a very young girl look as bad as she's suppose to, they over did it. If you wanna real good example of this but more effective...see Now Voyager. They made Bette Davis look like a troll but came out as a butterfly. They could have done the same in here but to me, they really overdid the "Old Maid" makeup.Now, for the Oscar Wins. I can see where this one wins a few but I can see why it wasn't the film of the year. It's a decent film but not a great one. I would stack up any of Bette Davis wins over Olivia de Havillands. In acting circles, you know why de Havillands name never gets brought up as the greatest actress ever. She's good in some things and others she's just so-so. This, to me, was just so-so.In the end, what it comes down to is that the father was right. The ending was done really well and perfect for what it was but quite a few things had me wondering why this film is rated so high. I didn't waste my time watching this but I sure expected different. Oh well...live and learn.</fullReview>

And the great Montgomery Clift ... but not in this part. Only a year before, Clift was brilliant besides John Wayne in Howard Hawks' Red River. But he comes across as too nice a guy to play Morris Townsend. The part demands someone much more suave, predatory and charming. George Brent just came to mind but Victor Mature might have been good as well. And I didn't find Miriam Hopkins convincing either. Again,I loved her in Trouble In Paradise and Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde but somehow the dynamics between her character and the other main characters wasn't quite there. Perhaps alongside heavyweights such as De Havilland and Richardson, Clift and Hopkins just don't cut the mustard, as they say.</fullReview>

Olivia de Havilland plays Catherine Sloper, a somewhat homely young woman living at home with her wealthy and abusive father Dr. Austin Sloper(Ralph Richardson). Miss Sloper is courted by a penny-less, but seemingly sincere Morris Townsend(Montgomery Clift). The tyrannical Dr. Sloper finds selfish pleasure in treating his daughter with emotional cruelty and tries to convince her that young Townsend is a fortune hunter wanting her inheritance over her love. A family friend Lavinia Penniman(Miriam Hopkins)tries encouraging Catherine to go against her father's wishes and put an end to her loneliness. My favorite scene is of rain-soaked Morris and Catherine discussing eloping.de Havilland plays her role convincingly. Clift does not seemed challenged as the ambitious suitor. Richardson is flawless as the villainous father. In supporting roles: Vanessa Brown, Ray Collins, Mona Freeman and Betty Linley.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stick to the play</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Heiress is the film version of a stage play, and it is painfully obvious at times. If a filmmaker decides he or she is going to take a stage play and put it on the silver screen, that filmmaker should have the vision to make it a larger than life film. It should not seem as though the director is simply filming the play, as this one does. This film and Separate Tables (1958) are prime examples of this. Twelve Angry Men (1957) is an example of a stage play that was masterfully made into a film.A stage play is limited by locations, time in the transitional sense, and static viewpoints. A film can take the same stories and make it come alive with multiple locations, camera angles, and segways to better the continuity. A stage play has to rely on a limited number of scenes with heavy dialogue. As audience members, we understand and appreciate that fact, and hope that the actors are vivid enough to make the story interesting. However, I expect a lot more from a film, and this one just didn't do it. Again, if I wanted to see The Heiress on stage, I'd go to the community theatre.As for the story, it moves very slowly, which is fine if the payoff makes up for it. Which in this case, it doesn't. Sliver (1993) is another example of that. And while I'm a big fan of Olivia de Havilland and think she's a great actress, she was miscast in this role. Yet another example of a beautiful actress unconvincingly playing a plain spinster, a la She's All That. Shelly Winters or Jane Wyman would have been much better in this role. Still, Olivia does deliver a great performance, as does Ralph Richardson, who gives a painfully brilliant performance as the father. I don't agree with those who say this is Olivia's finest performance...The Snake Pit or even The Strawberry Blonde are her finer performances, in my opinion. Montgomery Clift plays the pretty boy, as he does in most of his films. No real heart in his performance. Not a lot of heart really in the whole film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>paradoxes intended?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm puzzled by the high marks and reputation of this movie. It asks more of a viewer than to just pay attention, which is fine, but it results in a lot of paradoxes. Viewer identification jumps back and forth between Catherine and her father.- Catherine is an absolute plain-Jane, thick-headed dullard, but the viewer is forced to adopt her viewpoint and invest in her emotional stakes. - The relationship of Catherine to her father ends up squeezing the Morris plot off the screen, but then the Morris plot isn't that interesting and his motives are transparent to viewers after about 8 minutes. Ultimately this has the effect of making the big twist at the end seem pretty short-changed. - Catherine is resentful over being correctly informed that her suitor is a dog. In her arrogance she seems to completely excuses herself of blame in the incident. Whose fault is is that she never became worldly? It isn't her father's. - The Catherine/Dr. Sloper relationship is far more interesting than the diagrammatic obviousness of the Catherine/Morris plot line. Culminating in a parent-child discussion that is never supposed to occur. He's disgusted with his daughters tiresome failure to thrive. As a viewer, I was disgusted with her for the same reason. But Catherine is so dense that he eventually has to grind her nose in her own ignorance and naiveté. The only way he finds to do so is to also burst the socially-sanctioned bubble of protectiveness and flattery to the female ego. Instruments which, in Catherine's case, have actually damaged her.- When Catherine is finally forced to grow up it's only because her father was so harsh. Her new informed viewpoint can be credited completely to his rude remarks. Ultimately he IS right to offend her. - Catherine treasures her awkwardness up till the break, then she treasures her resentments against Morris and her father. She's not exactly growing. - She leaves Morris banging on her locked door... that's it? That's your ending? Even her punishment is unimaginative; and a pretty slim reward for a viewer sticking with the movie.I found Clift mediocre (despite his pride in his own talent) deHaviland only adequate, and Richardson amazing.</fullReview>
