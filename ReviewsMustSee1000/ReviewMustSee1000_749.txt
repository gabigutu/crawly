		<shortDescription>Brilliant Cracking Thriller!!......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Those who have seen "Underground" have probably noticed that we are not watching one film but a collection of at least 10 films in one single masterpiece!!I watched with great enthusiasm the work of Kusturica after "Underground" in films like "Arizona Dream" or "Black Cat White Cat" films which prove to be more elaborate and "smoother" in terms of direction (brilliant works as well!!) but none of these films could ever equal the "nerve" and strength of a very young Kusturica at his best! One could see the passion and boldness that is at stake in this motion picture. It's as if he gambled his own life doing "Underground"How else can you describe this work of art if not a mixture of devilish and holy images that take the shape of a flawless piece of theater-dance!!The actors speak, dance and create (more than interpret) with a vigor rarely found outside the Balkan Circle!In terms of theatrical aesthetics the film incorporates Stanislavski( realism at its best), Brecht (at certain points the actors step out of their roles and mock at themselves) and Artaud (they are flames more than humans)Needless to say more!Shocking, raw, heart-breaking!!One of the most beautiful I have ever seen! 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie on the indie channel, I taped it. I immediately watched it again, totally stunned by the extent of energy, imagination, ideas, images with which I was being blasted. Talk about a universal masterpiece! This movie should be required viewing on every screen, large &amp; small in the US. We Americans lead such narrow sheltered lives; we are so eager to see things in black &amp; white, to have our opinions dictated by columnists &amp; newscasters. This movie should take off a few blinders. On the other hand, people will still opt for easy cartoon ideologies over the indisputable truth about the ferocious &amp; predatory predilictions of all "sides" of humanity. Thank god for visionary humorists like Kusturica.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many years ago I hitchhiked through Yugoslavia and found a diverse, down to earth people living in harmony. Many years later, after economic decline and the breakup of the Soviet Union, Slovenia and Croatia declared their independence and signaled the end of the country of Yugoslavia. Emir Kusturica's Underground is a bold recreation of the events that led to the breakup, spanning the years of the Nazi invasion of World War II to the present wars. The film has been called Serbian propaganda, self-indulgent, an anti-Communist tract, an anti-war tome, cynical, nihilistic, and it may be any or all of those, but primarily it is a work of art whose surreal vision and poetic language makes any search for a coherent message elusive.Underground traces the lives of Marco (Miki Manojlovic) and Blacky (Lazar Ristovski), two charming but immoral black market profiteers who fight the Nazis while hiding in a massive cellar with friends and family where they produce and sell munitions. Marko and Blacky both compete for the attention of actress Natalija (Mirjana Jokovic) after Blacky's wife Vera (Mirjana Karanovic) dies in childbirth, but Natalija plays both of them off against the German soldier Franz ((Ernst Stotzner). After the war, perhaps as a metaphor for the constricting rule of President Tito, Marko fails to inform the underground community that the war has ended, keeping everyone in the dark so that he can support the Communist regime and make a profit selling arms to middlemen.Natalija helps Marco keep up the charade when he makes Blacky into a venerated national hero even though he is still alive. The only innocent characters in the film are Marco's slow-witted brother Ivan (Slavko Stimac) and his pet monkey Sino who form a lifelong bond after German bombs destroy the zoo where he was working. It is only when Sino crawls into the barrel of a tank and fires its guns do the inhabitants of the cellar work their way toward freedom and, in the process of discovery, react like space travelers finding a new world. The new world, however, looks very much like the old and when brother turns against brother, the disintegration of Yugoslavia is complete.Underground is an exuberantly entertaining three-hour carnival filled with wild characters, singing, drinking, and fighting and a brass band that keeps the energy high with Gypsy melodies. While it is a broad comedy that often descends into borderline lunacy, it is also a tragic vision of the betrayal of a people. Its final Felliniesque image of all the characters reunited on a piece of land drifting into the sea tells more than the obvious metaphor of a broken land and a broken people. It is a testament to the endurance, the acceptance of life, and the commitment to joy of the Yugoslav people and a passionate cry for their regeneration.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Underground is The Film, my favorite... And nobody hasn't written any greeting comments in 2005. So, I'm happy to be the first and I wish the best year 2005 to all the Underground's fans. If you never had this chance to see the long version (5 hours) of the film, give your priority, this year, to watch it. After this, the Palme d'Or version will feel you so short!!! If you live in Paris, I can help you to discover the complete Chef d'Oeuvre.Therefore, I understand that the film could be criticized on the political depths. But it is so easy to make movies without any involvement. Kusturica worked for 3 years on the film and involved himself on the content. But the film treatment is not only about Balkans war, but mainly about human ferocity and betrayment. Speaking Cinema, there is no film controlling so well aestheticism, scenario, actors, music and creativity. Emir did it and I am sorry that some arrogant journalists killed the film, getting it off the Cinema theaters without the popular success that Underground deserved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ultimate film for YU-nostalgics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kusturica believes (and so do I) that countries don't fall apart but are actively ripped apart. So if you want to see a short summary of Yugoslav history 1941-92 and an artist's view of why it fell apart, this movie will tell you more about it than many political books or articles. Almost everybody is portrayed with varying degrees of guilt: the communists for lying to the people, Germany for bombing Belgrade in 1941, Germany again for supplying the weapons in 1991, all nationalists... Please do not be surprised if you read negative reviews for Kusturica has stepped on many folks' feet. Invest some time, it's one of the best films in the past 15-20 years. BTW: The soundtrack is excellent, go listen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the two movies ever that made me cry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The scene when after all the pain and suffering the stuttering younger brother finally finds his old ape friend is the most poignant scene in all movie history. I am fully aware that that statement might be interpreted as national bias, but it isn't. What can be said about this movie that hasn't been said already? That a young upstart Balkan nation gambled away the only chance it ever had after WWI of creating a peaceful, stable, safe and prosperous state, opting instead for a "Yugoslavia". That cowards and opportunists always ruled the show over decent people. That these decent people were always great heroes when it came time to fight the enemies from without, but legendary cowards and naive sheep when it came time to fight the enemy within own ranks. That a bunch of criminals ruled a communist Yugoslavia for 45 years, keeping everyone in he dark as to what was actually happening in the world. That when the cat finally came out of the bag, the people in the basement proved catastrophically inept at handling the new situation and that that only leads to more pain and suffering. And all of it, the pain, the humiliation, the bitterness, comes down to, boils into, condenses itself into that one scene where the two old friends meet. And one young lad at that time lacking the luxury of living in a normal country opened his floodgates.There is so much to take in while watching the movie. It is nothing short of a complete history of a deceased nation of brotherhood and unity, all of it told in an allegorical style. All of which I have described in the previous chapter. The music and visual style of the movie is breathtaking. There is not a second of the movie that is not entertaining or engaging. Not a second that is not significant or out of place. And the movie is full of life, for whatever happens, life goes on. With every pain there is joy and vice versa.But this life is decidedly underscored by the forces of death and evil. The full extent of betrayal becomes apparent towards the end, initially being painted with naive humor. In this betrayal an entire country ad an entire people were sacrificed. The only thing that is left is memory. Memory of those one has lost during the dark years of Nazi invasion, the dark years of communism and the dark years of the recent wars. Memory of a past time, with its own rules, characters and experiences. One which humanity must never forget.

		<fullReview>While attending college in Boston a Croatian friend of mine told me about this movie. I rented it a few days later, and let me say this is one of the greatest foreign films I have seen. While the historical and political substance of the film is largely missed by me, the story is strong enough that I connected emotionally with it. The humor of the film is very refreshing, being used to war films that are too heavy or dull to make me laugh. I recommend this film to anyone who appreciates a well told story. You will be rewarded with a beautiful picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It puts you right there, inside the circulus viciosus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For anyone interested in Kusturica's work, this is my favorite. Don't get discouraged because it's set someplace you never traveled before... People are all alike. You'll recognize the patterns easily.It tells a story how come a country which appeared to everyone inside as an uniquely ideal world (they aren't aware where they are) could abruptly dissolve in a really, really bloody war the moment that the outside interferes... And more then that: it lets you LIVE AND LEARN through this experience yourself! It tells what time heals, or can't heal. It tells a lot about people, and about powers of mass deception, and examines personal issues arising from such a condition. It talks about a different set of values, which can be understood only in a specific situation. It makes you understand the Balkans as well as any other region held together by a weird, claustrophobic mix of hundreds of years of love and war on a small piece of land, a thread so fragile that it would break if love gets any more removed from war then it ever was.The sense of time in this movie is marvelously directed, and the reason it starts as an action flick but then at one point starts to drag towards the end is... because there is always, always a slowdown just before the next big boom/collapse; don't fight this feeling or you'll miss on the experience.It is like the Truman Show without the Hollywood ending.The movie is based on a play from Serbian master playwright, Dusan Kovacevic. Anything based on his plays is well worth the watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ethos, The Politics and The Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read through all the comments to date and I agree with some of the positive ones but also with some of the negative comments to an extent. Here is my take on Underground: Firstly, if you look at the original title of the script (done by Kovacevic, NOT Kusturica) which is also given as the opening sequence line, you see that it is an allegory (the title is Once Upon A Time There Was A Country), so I don't see the point of calling the film historically wrong... It was never meant to be historically right, otherwise it would have to leave out all the consequent exaggerations so typical of Kusturica - the length of time spent in the basement, the more theatrical than movie-like acting, the visual motives and so on. This maybe a bit difficult to accept as there are some documentary sequences in there, but I see it more of a context building element than an attempt to mislead the viewer about Yugoslav history.Secondly, people seem to like the first third of the movie for its humorous elements and I guess because they can follow the plot easily (the whole WW2 theme in the exposition, I must admit, I enjoyed as well)... The second third starts as the Allies bomb Belgrade and kill more than the Nazis did 4 years before that, so maybe the Western people are inclined to disagree with the rest based on this line, I don't know...Thirdly, I don't see where the Serbian propaganda element kicks in ... If you think the documentary sequences of Slovenia and Croatia welcoming the Germans with glee, and Serbia fiendishly being left out, is done purposefully for slandering the Croats and Slovenes, I hate to disappoint you, but Serbia saw no such celebration, so there is nothing of that kind to show... Instead the plot balances this out as it is set in Belgrade, where the supposed wartime "heroes" of the story (never ethnically identified as Serbs) collaborate with the occupation forces when they have a personal interest in doing so, and vice versa. Again, historically there were antifascist elements throughout Yugoslavia, but it's also a fact that Croatia became a fascist independent state at the time.Somebody mentioned the Muslim element as being totally absent, and I agree with that to an extent, but Kovacevic's novel was finished in early 1991, before the war in Bosnia escalated into what we now know. And, besides, Muslims were not considered a nation but a religious group until the end of WW2, and since there is no mention of the Caholic or Orthodox church in the movie, I don't see why there should be mention of Muslims.I understand most Wasterners consider communism to be the Soviet kind everywhere, but I saw this movie as a commentary remark on the inequality of the proclaimed and the apparent, not of communism or Yugoslav socialism, or any -ism for that matter. Petar Popara is proclaimed an electrician, Marko Dren a poet, neither one a real politician, but both of them high ranking communists. They are petty criminals before the war who only get into the party ranks to continue their criminal activities when the war starts. Marko, the educated one, continues his criminal activities by using slave labor of the basement inhabitants to make and traffic guns after the war. He is a typical opportunist since he does this for personal gain, lies to the wretched people below that they have to do it for the war effort, and keeps Petar Popara inside in order to be with Natalija up above. This is just what makes the characters and relationships so complex, and in my opinion, the reason why this movie has a universal story. If any propaganda is shown, this one is the anti-war, anti-politician kind.Back to the story, I especially liked the Old Man character as he is the insider. He is the only one who knows what's going on above, yet stays in the basement, he is Marko's accomplice, and he "steals time" by winding the clock backwards, which as I see it, is a comment on the Balkans always lagging behind the rest of the world based on misguided trust in people who claim to be the saviors and are "on your side." The basement youth is totally oblivious to the world, as exemplified by Jovan, Petar's son, born on the first day of the basement exodus, with the side story of going out with his dad to fight the "goddamn Germans" and not knowing the difference between the sun and the moon, based on his fathers stories and drawings(myths and realities of history as told by the idolized wise).As for the movie being co-produced by the Serbian Broadcasting Company, I can safely say that Serbian cinematography and movie productions in the nineties were definitely not purely regime-oriented. How else would you explain RTS having co-produced Pretty Villages - Pretty Flames? Based on all this, I can't say that this movie is even in the same league as Tanovic's Oscar Winner No Man's Land someone recommended instead of Underground. That movie is a simple story of civil war told in a simple good guys - bad buys way. If I were as cynical as some other reviewers here, I could say that it was Muslim propaganda, as many other US produced movies on the Bosnian war subject, as it openly gives the impression that Serbs are the root of all evil, they are stupid and only do things if you hold a gun to their head, whereas Bosnian Muslims are fun-loving pro-Western dudes forced into waging war, but would rather listen to the Rolling Stones, and they are so altruistic that they would even help the enemy in the ditch. Talk about historically wrong...Anyway, I gave the film a 9.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best movie of my life!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having watched around 4000 movies so far, this has been my all-time best cinematic experience since its release date in 1995. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to watch Kusturica's chef d'oeuvre in Cannes Film Festival. The story of wartime profiteers and victims stretching five decades since the early days of WWII to Balkan genocide in early 1990s is a surreal, hypnotic visual treat for which no words of commendation are adequate. The movie looks and feels like having been made by some superior intelligence which transcends human understanding and imagination. Superbly realized story invites repeated viewings to absorb all that writers Dusan Kovacevic and Emir Kusturica have put into it. A true masterpiece. Don't miss this one.</fullReview>

An entertaining dark comedy that weaves how generations of people get screwed over by the corruption of their politicians and their own friends out for selfish gain. So much density of politics and history compressed into such a personal story expressed through actual war footage, real political figures, self reflexivity, theatricality, music and a totally relentless narrative that isn't afraid to switch up from comedy to tragedy from one scene to the next without pandering to formulaic structure in an effort to satisfy an audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comic approach to the drama of the Balkans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Underground is a Serbian-France-Germany movie directed by Emir Kusturica.It is an allegorical tragicomedy about Yugoslavia, which mixes elements of surrealism (some very Bu?uel-ish moments there), comedy of the absurd, neorealism, and époque drama to offer a satirical drama about Yugoslavia - a conglomerate of nations formed by people who have lived in war, against others or against each other, for almost a century.The movie is structured in three parts: War, Cold War, War. The first is devoted to the WW II, the second to Tito's period, and the third to the civil war that would end with the disintegration of Yugoslavia. The second part is the most interesting -and the one that gives the movie its title- as it shows in a metaphorical way how Yugoslavs related to each other, deceived each other, exploited each other, lied to each other, and how things were building up in their spirit during those years.All the characters are well drawn, and all the actors do a great job in their respective roles. The main characters are a couple of rascal friends and a always-in-heat actress. In fact, they cannot be taken straightforward as they are three human archetypes. Marko -played by Miki Manojlovic- is the sort of people who say they have political beliefs and that they are fighting for them, when, in fact, they are using the juncture to thrive personally, despite everything and everybody. Cmi = Blacky -played by Lazar Ristovski- depicts those people who truly believe in what they preach and act accordingly, no matter what; however, they are so obsessed with their beliefs that will end being blind to reality. Finally, Natalija -played by Mirjana Jokovic- depicts those people who will always support the political regime in power, and will change and move on as the scenario does, always thriving. The counterpoint to these three is Ivan -played by Slavko Stimacy- Marko's mentally changed brother, who loves his monkey Soni more than any human and wants to hung himself all the time as he's always deceived and betrayed by everybody.Although all the themes touched in the movie are, indeed, very serious and dramatic, Kusturica's merit is to present them in a farce, and to talk about his people showing his love-hatred feelings, his feeling that they were predetermined to end the way they did, while putting a smile in the viewer's face.Some scenes of the movie are unforgettable because they are surreal, funny, or shocking. My two favorite ones are both at the end of the movie. The scenes at the square of the old village are terrific, visually shocking, provocative and unforgettable. The end with the "island" really explains the whole movie and contains one of the most beautiful images of the same. Some of the scenes related to the marriage of Blacky's son, the first outing of the son to the real world, and the shooting of the movie about Blacky, are also great.Some Bosnians and French philosophers have accused the movie and Kusturica of being pro-Serbian and sending pro-Serbian messages in his movie. However, to me, Kusturica's movie is more an exercise of evaluation of the human traits of the people who amalgamated Yugoslavia, as a whole, as all of them are to blame for the disintegration of the Balkan country in a way or another. Of course, Kusturica considering himself a Serbian and Ortodox, despite being born Bosnian and Muslim, he does not mention anything about the barbaric acts committed by the Serbians. However, we see best friends killing each others... anybody who wants to understand, will. The movie rarely mentions any ethnic group.Going now to the downs of the movie, I thought the movie was extremely long, not engaging at times. At the same time, I thought the movie looked like a TV series re color, texture of the film, and use of the camera, a thing that I don't like seeing in a proper big screen movie. And, alas, it is an adaptation for the big screen of a 5-hour TV-series. This would have not mattered if the editor had done a better job, that is, focused on the important and got rid of the superfluous. Two hours would have been more than enough to tell the same story. Otherwise, you can still watch the whole series.I found the music overbearing and annoying, although some of the individual pieces are beautiful, but there is that choondah-choondah nyiiiiiiiiii-nyiiiiiii sort of sound all along the movie that got into my nerves. However, the music goes well with the histrionics of the characters and the craziness of the story. It is shocking that a society that seems to be so keen on partying and on celebrating, so musical, would end being at war and killing each others.Once upon a time, there was a country... and people who were happy being together without hating each other and killing each other.Underground is, despite the appearances, a very sad movie as speaks of social and human failure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are enough comments posted to gain an objective view on Kusturica's "Underground". I just want to say how important and epic this film is, beyond the obvious cinematic feats...especially to the Balkans. Its dialogue, its music, its protagonists and antagonists breathe with Balkan humor/ferocity. A classic. Unforgettable and heart-rendering -- but only if you can make a connection, not a movie for the (Western) masses. Even more so, the performances shine and stick in your mind. Ristovksi and Manojlovic especially! And the gypsy orchestra...Kalashnikov...the dreamy, magical realism...the last scenes? Classic! Bravo bratia Srbi!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Undoubtedly it's really hard to write about such unusual film as Underground. In my opinion it is almost defies to description. Probably I will always be lost of admiration for it. I have seen many very good films, but only few of them put a spell on me. Frankly, this is the only film, which makes me cry. It's extremely moving and it seems to be quite inaccessible. As a matter of fact, this is the most pessimistic film I've ever seen, although some scenes makes me laugh. Underground is full of symbols and metaphors, some of them are very unclear and ambiguous. Specific atmosphere and sometimes metaphysical or surreal visions make this film so uncommon. Climate of Underground is also made up by beautiful music. Moreover it show us colourful and very romantic local culture. However all these elements are only the background for not so optimistic and rather dismal massage. Through this tangle of expressive images we can see tragic and tumultuous history of Yugoslavia. I think it's some kind of nonsense, that such wonderful film was made under the influence of tragic events, like wars and communism. This film helps to understand, which values are truly important, it show as cruel world, where nobody is really happy. All people suffer, but only several of them are guilty. I find Underground brilliant, but I perceive it like someone, whose country suffered from World Wars and totalitarianism. Maybe that's why this films made such huge impression on me. Everyone should watch it, even though it could be hard to understand for a first time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Underground" is an epic tale of absurdity directed by Emir Kusturica using the tragedy of his motherland, who used to be called Yugoslavia, as the backdrop of the film. The history of this country can be compared to a deep wound that still can't be healed up. The land has been tortured, invaded, raped in her soul by the circumstances of History, it's still bleeding yet people never stopped to sing, to dance, to love, to believe in a brighter future. Such a personal story, so deeply rooted in Kusturica's heart, could have been told in a sad, dark and quite depressing tone, but a sad movie, "Underground" is not. And a hilarious imaginative poignant comedy, it sure is. Emir Kusturica's Golden Palm Winner is a masterpiece of flamboyance, of decadence and non-stop dance ... a never-ending party that revisits the tragedy of History and translates it into an epic, romantic and frenetic comedy, so damn entertaining these isn't a single moment I didn't want to get up on the table and start to dance with a glass on my hand, to Goran Bergovic's incredible soundtrack. Indeed, this film is full of music, of energy, of emotions and transports us into a fantastic journey in the tragic History of Yugoslavia, following a chronological road : World War II, the Cold War and of course, the Modern War. This final act is depicted in a darker tone, to highlight the loss of every thing that made Yugoslavia, a land of hope, of optimism and fraternity. But, never letting war and death pushing our mood down, Kusturica ends the film in an apotheosis. A great finale for a great movie about life and hope, to keep a great smile in your face until the end ... which the film doesn't have, because there's less optimism with an ending than with the belief of a rebirth after the mutilation of a never-ending war.But "Underground" isn't a documentary about this war, or about Yugoslavia. Basically, it's the story of a love triangle and an evil scheme. It starts with two men, two friends : Marko, the sympathetic opportunistic intellectual and his best friend Blacky who's just joined the Party, Blacky is an electrician, a lovable naive buffoon with a warm heart and a head made of stone. Marko and Blacky are both members of the Communist Party and resistant fighters after the partial destruction of the country by the German invasion. Those men love to drink, to dance, and more than that, they love the same woman : the actress Natalja. Natalja is a young, pretty, ambitious woman with many lovers, a Nazi officer, Blacky, her future husband and Marko her future lover. They're all flawed, exuberant, yet always sympathetic. But the lyric soul of the film is Yvan, Marko's brother, an innocent zoo guardian with a stammer and who developed a strange relationship with a monkey, Soni. He loves his brother, he's sweet and tender, and maybe he believes in animals more than men whose cruelty touched him deep in the heart. He seems to be the only who cares for what happens and carries the tragedy in his pure heart.After liberating Blacky from the Germans, Marko hides him in the cave, "underground", until the war stops ... Then Marko, who's been previously struck by Natalja's beauty will elaborate one of the most evil schemes ever plotted in film, just to keep her. He'll make all the population who lived, who were born and grew up in the cave, participate to the War Effort by making weapons for the Resistance ... even after the Liberation when the Allies achieved to destroy what the Germans left. Ivan, hidden in the cave, doesn't know the War is over. Blacky doesn't know the Iron Curtrain is drawn now and he's a dead legend above the ground. He doesn't even know that his best friend, is very close to Tito, and a respectable member of the Party, married to Natalja, an acclaimed actress.Natalja drowns her guilt and her loss of innocence in alcohol, she's weak but she's already been ... Natalja is a beautiful girl flirting with the enemy, married to a man, and having a love affair with another. She and Marko are both opportunistic, they understand each other. She can't hate him because he "lies so well". It's not her fault, she can't control her seductive power. Natalja is like an allegory of a beautiful country invaded numerous times during history, a country that doesn't know where her heart belongs anymore. Blacky and the poor victims of Comrade Marko lived in a cave during the Communism years, did they really miss more than those who lived above the ground ? The scheme is so evil Marko has an accomplice who found a trick to make time go slower, like life in an oppressive time make it seem slower. A diabolical absurd scheme, but no more or no less than the reality ... what better alibi for absurdity than war? Hot or Cold? War is ABSURD enough to inspire such acts ... The story is simply a fascinating metaphor of the more serious tragic fate of Kusturica's bruised motherland.But despite this sadness, the movie is about hope, joy and optimism ... these are the happiest and most cheerful people you'll see in a film, even during War, even when they fight, even in a cave, living years and years without seeing the sunlight, don't prevent them from amusement, dances, laughs, plays and everything that makes life worth to live ... the movie is a big Prison you never want to escape from. It's thrilling to watch, it's an optimistic tale for a tragic story ... you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll laugh and laugh and shout and fight and dance and have an extraordinary cinematic experience ....So, comrades, just have a glass and join the "party" ... Opaaaaaaaa!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I understand perfectly why some people would not like it. It is a little long and if you try to make sense of it you may be very frustrated... my advise is just to watch it and let the story flow... I have read that someone in this forum says there is no main character... I believe the main character is Yugoslavia, and I am a Mexican, living in Mexico, you don't need to be European to understand about the terror of the war and to feel sympathy for the people that have lived the war and the uncertainty of a situation that doesn't seem to have an end. May very well be a cultural thing, I just feel this is a great movie, funny at times, tragic at other times that shows the miseries of the human weakness. My two cents.</fullReview>

And Kusturica really knows a lot about human nature the complexity of which he manages to expose in this masterpiece that is called "Underground", using a great but tragic sense of humor.Kusturica comes from Balkans, where people have suffered a lot through the centuries and maybe that's why he knows the true face of war so well.

I truly believe that it is the finest example of film to date. It has the most unique plot of any movie I have seen, and really deserves to be called an epic. Never have all the elements of movie making blended so well together then in Underground. The characters are so memorable, the acting is superb, the dialogue is unbelievably intriguing, and the cinematography, sets and scenes are a delicious eye full. Underground is a comedy, a drama, a documentary, a fantasy, and a history lesson all rolled into one. It is so full of life and bravado that it actually leaves you breathless, it is the "People's" folktale, and the music is FANTASTIC!! Please see Underground if you haven't already, it will change the way you look at movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A real wonderful film of a genious director.I can comment on it only in this way. I live in Armenia and perhaps, you may say,cannot understand the meaning of "Underground".But no,I see.Sure not like a Jugoslavian,but I understand all the tragedy of this country. I saw "Underground" first when I was 11 years old,but it made so much impression on me that I was,to tell the truth,really shocked.There are many people who say that it isn't worth watching.But I see,I don't judge them.It's just a bit difficult for a simple person to understand the whole meaning of it. To my mind there've been certain great films,such as "8 1/2" by Fellini,"The collour of granate" by Paradjianov,"Dersou Ozala" by Akira Kurosava,etc.But "Underground" is the film which is the dearest to me,and till now I haven't seen anything more tragic,genious and beautiful.

		<fullReview>I laughed, I cried, I lusted after those Yugoslavian women...and I felt sad watching an over-the-top comedy about the mental repression experienced by anyone who has ever lived in a totalitarian country where the media is controlled by the government. (It was much less subtle in the Eastern bloc; we Westerners have made many perfections in the art of propaganda.) The story is that of a group of Yugoslavians who literally go underground during WWII to hide from the Nazis (and from their own Communist dictators). Only a few know that the war has ended and that Tito is President of Yugo-land now--but they keep that secret from those still living in ignorance underground.It's a metaphor for the life lived by those behind the Iron Curtain, and it's a melange of funny, mournful, thought-provoking comedy...with babes. Repression is great for stimulating creativity, as the Yugoslavians (and Czechs) have been proving for years, going back to Dusan Makavejev's "WR: Mysteries of the Organism," another funny sexy romp about the relationship between sex, politics, and megalomania.One more note--the music on the soundtrack is fantastic, and I wish it were released on CD. Someone's leaving money on the table by missing this opportunity for a great soundtrack release.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best film ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Underground", by Emir Kusturica, is the best film ever. By this I don't say that it is the only "best film ever", because there are lots of films that can be described as above; and all of the great pictures are the best film ever.This film is not only entertaining, and a fine way to spend three hours, but it's the kind of film that makes you think about it over and over, because of its fabulous story. It can be seen as a treaty on politics, a review of the Balcanic history - and Yugoslavian in particular -, an anti-communist propaganda film, a beautiful fairytale, a (sometimes) very sad story of love, a sarcastic movie about the pointlessness of war (whether it may be among countries, citizens or even friends), or a thousand and one points of view possible. I have seen it over ten times, and I've had all these feelings whilst I watched it. Although this is a Yugoslav movie, it is not necessary to be Yugoslav to understand it - or love it, by the way - , because it is a completely universal movie. There, we can see the human being as it is, and people over the world are in fact much more alike than they think. Or would like.Emir Kusturica is nothing less than a visionary with extreme talent to direct movies, as anyone can see in some other personal favorites: "Time of the Gipsies", "Arizona Dream" or "Black Cat, White Cat". And he can surround himself with a fantastic crew - the cinematography is excellent, the cast is perfect and the soundtrack... I can't even describe Goran Bregovic's wonderful masterpiece, with his gipsy players and the pungent violin that goes right into the brain."War isn't war until brother kills brother"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best films I have seen in quite some time. I laughed (a lot) and I cried, sometimes simultaneously. It takes a well-crafted film to pull that off. The characters had depth and complexity, and they are the heart and driving force of the story; the war serves as a central concern of the characters, but this is not a typical war-driven movie. I was particularly interested in the way that no matter how surreal or incredible the plot became, it never lost any of its believability. I love surreal movies, like Delicatessen or Tuvalu. This one definitely won my heart over as well. It is a must-see for any cinema lover. The character Natalija tells her lover Marko several times that he "lies beautifully." This film does the same.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I struggled to explain to my sister why this was my ideal film. I showed it to her, pointed out my favourite moments and still she asked why I chose this film, so my choice might be more personal than I realise. But I'll try again: this exceptional film examines both how we fail as individuals and how we fail as a species, and yet it does so with an embracing enthusiasm for the other aspects of our humanity. The music is stunning, the acting is sublime, the characterizations are fully realised and believable, and the absurdity of what we watch unfold is never truly impossible. We are watching examples of misbehaving human beings and acknowledging, all along the way, that we recognize this behaviour. This film is a metaphor, but it is never detached from what its subject or its message - that history is a curse that comes to certain places at certain times and interrupts the natural flow of whom we could be without the extravagance of either ideology or self-interest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably the first film I watch coming from this region of the world(so I can't compare this to anything else coming from there), and I would definitely say that you need to have at least a basic understanding of the muddled, complex history of what went on there from World War 2 and the next 40 years(until when this was made, or just about; that's a lot of time to cover in less than three hours) to fully appreciate this. I'm not sure I agree with the message, and I'll be perfectly honest with you; I didn't love this. However, I can be objective enough to acknowledge that it is a bizarre cinematic masterpiece, with impeccable satire and commentary on politics. There are countless of unforgettable, surreal images, and this thrives on absurdity. People in this often behave like they might if this was a cartoon, making goofy faces, overacting, and just generally being obnoxious stereotypes. I can't claim I found any characters to particularly care about(which is not to say that I never sympathized with them), or to be all that developed. That can make the 164 minute running time be a little trying. This seems like it's partially a throwback to slapstick comedies, with all its pratfall gags and silly jokes. There is black material, as well, not to mention male chauvinism. There is what at times feels like constant party music, and a ton of sexy dancing. I don't know, maybe it's a cultural thing. This is clearly not meant to be taken literally, and you should not expect this to play like a documentary. My subtitles barely translated a word or two of the plentiful singing, so I don't know how much I missed on account of that. There are long and sensual scenes(some of them including female nudity), a bit of disturbing content and occasional violence in this. The DVD comes with a 3 minute Cannes interview, a minute and a half of B-roll and a trailer. I recommend this to anyone who can imagine they'd like this. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The "Underground" is a masterpiece by all means. I've always been a fun of Emir Kusturica's movies but this one was a real blast. I really disagree with many who categorize this film as a comedy. Neither can a soft word as "drama" really describe a movie such as this one. The characters endlessly ache for their country which is suffering a fatal war. The more their ignorance is getting bigger as the plot develops (reminding us Plato's Allegory of the Cave) the more the characters become tragic. Salvation ( for both the audience and the characters) is not to come until the very end. As a cinematographer Emir Kusturica has always achieved to portray the Balkan spirit's madness and proximateness with the most touching way. Watching this film means crying, laughing, hating, forgiving, aching all along with the heroes (or the anti-heroes). The regular fast rhythms, the symbolization and the surreal ways Kusturica uses in order to lead the audience where he wants to are also miraculous. To end with, the actors are amazing, the soundtrack (by Goran Bregovic of course) is breathtaking and this movie should not be missed for whatever the reason. 10/10</fullReview>

However, this should not diminish film's brilliant language and its profound overview of man's nature and stupidity of war. Again, knowledge of local language or at least context would bring much more clarity and joy while watching this movie, but as mentioned - this is our problem...A piece of advice for all of my western friends - if the monkey enters the tank, keep your eyes open and try to pull him out at any cost.

		<fullReview>'The Underground' deals with people's corruption, blindness of the followers (all of us are followers, so don't feel excepted), mentality of people from the Balkans, put in scene through perfect characters (played by perfect actors)... All that at a time of war, later socialism and finally destruction of post WWII socialist ideals.In fact, the first version of 'The Underground' I saw, was the 5 hour-long marathon version. After some months I came to see the shorter cinema version. Which ever version you come along don't miss to watch it, you will know why after you have seen it. It is still influencing my judging of other movies.It is a masterpiece of Kusturica's surrealism, just remember the scene after the first nazi bombing of Belgrade, when animals of the zoo run freely on the streets.. Or the underground system.. Remember the electric shocks, the making of the war movie..Most of the scenes are just perfect as well as the scenario. Perhaps you need to be somehow connected to the Balkans to understand scenes like the one when Lazar Ristovski asks the gipsy musicians to follow him as he goes to the toilette.The complaints that the movie is too political are perhaps true, but only for people who don't know anything about socialism or Europe. It surely represents a landmark in European film. (Since 'The Underground' is not comparable to any other movie, and only because of that, I won't say that it is the best movie ever)Bregovic, the maker of the music for this movie, has created something far greater than he had expected. By now, the music theme is extremely popular in Serbia and can be heard everywhere on Belgrade's streets performed by little gipsy groups.The most important movie to come out of the Balkans; And simply put, it is perfect.</fullReview>

I hadn't seen any Kusturica film yet and didn't quite know what to expect apart from lively gypsy tales, and this was far far more than just that. It deals with the way the communist/socialist regime fools the people of Yugoslavia to believe something that isn't true. 'There are lies in everything'. This repeats when the film rolls into the wars of the 1990s. Same history over and over again, shown by the last title on screen: 'Ovaj pric nema kraj' (or similar, meaning that this story takes no end). The film shows also that any side could be bad or good, and that many evil actually comes from within. Watch this film and get equally stunned!9 out of 10 (I never rate 10s)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Once upon a time," Underground begins, "There Was a Country." And what a marvelous, jubilant country it was. Or at least it was for a small group of Communist sympathizing thieves led by Marko and Blackie. But when war reaches their hometown of Belgrade, their lives, seemingly always accompanied by a boisterous brass band, go from comic to, well, comically tragic. Underground works as history, as a fairy tale, as a national lament, or simply as a fun film.From five minutes in, director Emir Kusturica has me hooked. When the Axis forces attack, their principle target seems to be the Belgrade zoo, both liberating and killing many of the wild animals. The imagery of elephants walking the streets stealing shoes, geese flapping around in slow motion, and the blood stained bodies of monkeys lying in the rubble is captivating. It seems reductive, but basically Kusturica always seems to know where the camera belongs, and it's rarely in the set position fans of classical Hollywood cinema are familiar with.High angles, low angles, and mostly dancing wildly around, Kusturica simply doesn't go wrong.The first third of Underground is outrageously funny. It's the World War 2 comedy that Life is Beautiful wishes it could be and Miki Manojlovic and Lazar Ristovski as Marko and Blackie are the ideal comic duo. They sing, they dance, and the mug for the camera, but they also capture the joy of a now-gone culture. As the film progresses into its second act, both performances darken and develop as the plot takes a striking twist (SLIGHT SPOILERS, but not much): Marko convinces Blackie and the rest of the gang that the war is still going and that they must remain in an underground hiding place, while he (Marko) is marrying Blackie's actress love and rising in the ranks of Tito's administration.Frankly, it would be unfair to tell anymore, or to further discuss any of the wonderous set pieces, the comedy, the beauty, and finally the tragedy of a nation that once existed and now? Well, the final image of the film, which provides a striking construction of national and personal identity, is one of the great endings of the last decade.I don't usually find myself quite so enthusiastic, but only a little padding midway through the second act prevents me from giving this one a perfect score. Still 9/10 isn't bad.Quick Notes: I saw the film in a wonderful widescreen print. I assume that some of its visual majesty would be lost on a small pan-and-scan television screen. Additionally, it is my understanding that the film was released in a number of different cuts. The one I saw was around 160 minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film definitely belongs to the best movies I have ever seen. It is a shocking and surrealistic story about the history of Yugoslavia and it shows the charming but self-destructive temperament that is so characteristic to the people of the Balkan (unfortunately I cannot claim that Hungary would be entirely free from this madness, although my prideful countrymen get usually offended if someone suggests that we have anything common with the Balkan).After seeing the movie I browsed through these comments. Not surprisingly the film wakes strong sentiments and controversial opinions among the viewers, especially among those who come from the region. One statement expressed by many is that you need to live in the Balkan to understand and appreciate the story. I disagree with this: the magic of this movie is strong enough to capture you, whatever background you may have. Your interpretation may depend on your background, but that is always the case with any piece of art. (To add a somewhat ignorant and cynical remark: maybe non-locals are not be able to understand the movie, but locals definitely don't seem to be able to learn from it.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm hardly a knowledgeable film critic, and I can't really add much that hasn't been pointed out by other viewers about this film, but I can say that it's the first film I've seen that's compelled me to leave a comment here on IMDB.Take that for whatever it's worth.The story, writing, acting, cinematography, and ESPECIALLY the music - all top notch! "Underground" is one of those rare films that manages to express its sentiments without resorting to shameless button-pushing. Our Balkan friends can rest assured that it's definitely a film that can strike a chord with American audiences. "Time of the Gypsies" is the only other Kusturica film I've had the pleasure of seeing; I'll make it a priority to seek out his others.</fullReview>

In the other life they can forgive each other and can rebuild a country, or a so called paradise that never wasn't there, just after death. An undefeatable spirit that leads into this people, sad when this spirit fight against each other, the city underground is where Belgrado started and finished this new era in the life of a so called country Yugoslavia, a totally perfect view made by Kusturica together with Angelopoulos the best film-makers from Europe, made by the only people that can tell the history of this Brave country.Simply Perfect 100/100</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not to everybody's liking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is rather dark in mood and technically.Tragedy and comedy are linked together in a furious mixture accompanied by loud memorable music and songs. The surreal situations make this film a parable. In my humble opinion, it is the finest achievement of Mr Emir Kusturica. The movie has such an irresistible Slavic feel to it, that only a very limited number of viewers seem to be able to appreciate its charm. Not to everybody's liking. It's no "Matrix", no "Godfather", no "Pulp Fiction" and it's no "Fellowship of the Ring" or "Star Wars". "Underground" stares at humanity with a grin. A mirror where we all can see the reflection of our past, present, and future. We know what a war is, but we cannot stop. It's a story without end. Three hours fly by in a blur.Some scenes have become classic for me: a monkey in a tank, the heroes with guns in a boat with the orange sunshine upon their faces, underwater characters, theatrical play with some crazy outspoken expressions and jests, the head-butted UN soldier (who started some brainwashing conversation and got served), the running Petar "Crni" with a rifle shooting at a UN (?) helicopter, the "flying" bride, the final gathering (which takes place in some meta-world, like the final scene in "Solyaris").In a few words: it is a funny movie, which is at the same time very horrific.Excellent, 10 out of 10. Thank you for attention.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is certainly the most entertaining film yet, the story just gets better and better - unraveling every layer possible in the most intriguing way. The characters contain the greatest warmth and humanity in the most comedic sense. The use of music is incredible, given that it came out the same year as the dogma 95 manifesto - it certainly must have inspired the Dane's to only use music that exists on location. There are plenty of metaphors and the build ups are so perfect that the direction of the tale is never obvious.Anyone who has anything negative to say about this film should be tied up and executed as they have no understanding nor any profound respect for true and pure cinema.For ever in gratitude to the writer, director, cast and crew! -Nicholas</fullReview>

In a drama of World War II placed in Belgrade, they will be fighting against Nazi Germans, for freedom and for her love.

		<fullReview>Kusturica takes his imagination to the brink, by giving the audience a dark- humor at the WWII. No wonder the movie had won the Palme D'or at Cannes. I didn't have the knowledge of the history or the political piece in the movie but still the story is screen played in a very different, still understandable manner. Felt boring at parts like the song and long-dance sequence and that comedy slap-sticks parts within. Still must admit that i broke to laugh at other parts and music was a treat. An emotional ending with a tint of obscure comedy does give a perfect cover to the script. I loved the liner which translates to "No war is a war until a brother kills a brother" towards the movie end. The bottom line : A different kind of crude humor (slightly boring at parts), wickedly satirical, emotional movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Underground is a film that relates a story about an underground gun factory that is created after the German invasion to Yugoslavia. This factory is created by Marko (Miki Manojlovic) inside a basement, basing his power over the people inside by lies. He tells the workers that the war still going and they should keep on building guns to help the communist, even after the war was over. Blacky (Lazar Ritovski) who is Marko's right hand man inside the factory, due to an accident with a grenade gets put inside the factory with the same lie told by Marko, and becomes the figure inside the basement colony. There he follows the communist rule that everything should be done without selfishness to help the colony in general, assimilating a perfect communist colony. This movie reflects the two sides of a war in general; one where you have a leader who is only persuading power and on the other side, that gets trapped inside the basement, you have one fighting for ideals and to help what he considers perfection on his surroundings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underground</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this film French / German / Hungarian listed in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, the title didn't suggest any particular plot to me, but when I read about it I was certainly up for watching it. Basically, set in 1941, the story follows the friendship between sociable Petar 'Blacky' Popara (Lazar Ristovski) and intelligent Marko (Miki Manojlovic) who live in Belgrade, they met while drunk at a late night musical procession, they also become part pf the Communist Party. They also share working together in dodgy business activities, and are both attracted to the beautiful actress Natalija (Mirjana Jokovic), but of course the dark days of World War II come upon them, they and many other villagers are forced to take cover and go into refuge in an underground shelter. In the underground are a variety of weapons, and all the townspeople can do, as the bombs fall and the fighting goes on up above, is work together to protect, and in some cases, provide these weapons to the forces up above. Years pass and the war does eventually come to an end, but with the work progressing so well below Marko and Natalija decide to keep the momentum by making the people believe that the war is still going on, they achieve this playing sound effect recordings from previous noisy incidents. This deception continues from the end of World War II all the way to the beginnings of both the Cold War and the Yugoslav Wars, but Blacky realises the actions of Marko and Natalija, he orders them both be executed for making money both for taking advantage of innocent and vulnerable lives and for making their money with the weapons manufacturing, in the end all surviving townspeople reunite at a wedding. Also starring Slavko Stimac as Ivan, Ernst Stötzner as Franz, Srdjan Todorovic as Jovan, Mirjana Karanovic as Vera and Milena Pavlovic as Jelena. This film is a good mix of both lighthearted and dark humour, and some of the realities of devastation and psychological affects during the times of war, there are some good memorable moments where a monkey fires a gun in a tank underground, and of course the sound effects of war tricking the people hiding, I admit it is a little slow in places and a little long, but an unusually interesting epic Second World War comedy drama. Good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Magistral work!!! I still have trouble whether I classifying it as drama or comedy. The film progresses in an infernal rhythm, supported by the excellent music of Goran Bregovic. Although the story has less credible elements (tunnel between capitals etc.) Kusturica manages to make us accept all these as normal facts in its characteristic way. (see Arizona Dream)Underground is like a legend, a story which you share with your followers to let them know that "once upon a time there was a country...". I saw the movie in the period of the conflict in Kosovo (4 years after the making of the film) and it looked in some way prophetic. After all, it is a great allegory materialized with the use of the most refined cinema means, telling us about Yugoslavia more than hundreds of written articles and history books. It's a pity such a great nation had such a tragic fate. As a Romanian (neighbour of Yugoslavia) I had a much better (IMHO) understanding of this spirit, its ideals, its weaknesses because of the connections created during the history. Even one of the most played theme song has Romanian origins adapted by the genius of Bregovic. (the song named 'Kalasnjijov' on the soundtrack)Its almost impossible to name the capital idea behind this multiple level movie. Is it the atrocities and uselesness of the war? Or the history of a nation? Or the unacceptance of reality? Maybe a story about mystification? Love, hate? And the list is endless. This is one of those things that should be called without hesitation a masterpiece.</fullReview>

You have to be either dumb or blind (or both) to accuse this movie (as many do, including the so-called intellectual class of France) of being pro-Serbian. It is a gripping, strongly imaginative tale that show the absurdity of war, and nationalism, l that hangs around it. Take for instance the opening scene, with the wounded animals as the Yugoslav capital is being bombed, and the threatening music that goes alongside of it, or the cut in which a burning wheelchair goes around in circles, again with excellent music: images that, as many more of the movie, are burned in my memory ever since I saw it: you cannot make an anti-war statement any stronger, no? Beside being tragical, the movie is also highly comical, and the acting and the music are unforgettable Underground is the kind of movie that would have been laughable had it been made by a mediocre director, the kind of movie that would have been pathetic had it been made by a good director, but the kind of movie that grew to be an masterpiece of art because it was shaped by the genius of Kusturica.</fullReview>

So if you are tired of the many films of the West that are coated and lavished in high production but little substance, then try and track this one down, because it says a lot more than many films, much of it without words. (Imagery is incredible). Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great!.....but so sad....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always been fascinating by the Balkans history, maybe because I study in Trieste, a town at the border with Ex-Yugoslavia. I find really fantastic the way Kusturica describe the terrible madness that has crossed over the Balkans during the last years. Too many things are very difficult to understand for who doesn't live in those countries, but I think that Kusturica has made a very intelligent metaphor to explain the real illness that afflict the Balkans. I've read many comments that criticize the film length, over three hours; I think that three hours were necessary to close the circle opened at the beginning of the film with World war, nor the film would have been uncomplete. The final really impressed me, this idea of an island isolated from the rest of the world with its own history which is going to be repeated forever and ever. A very sad preview by Kusrurica; the people won't change his mind, for this reason his history won't never change.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Three hours of pure weird story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a war-comedy movie, the movie did more than just achieving its original goal of showing a depiction of war and making people laugh at the same time. I think the movie, using its long duration at its best, really exerts control on what the audience feel when seeing it. This movie can be very funny when it is in the comedic scenes; with very black comedic satire laughing at the hypocrisy of war. But it can also be stoic and ironic when it shows the scenes of war tearing a country apart. It can reach the sorrowful depths, as when the movie shows Ivan looking for Soni, or when Crni looks at the burning wheelchair. The acting is quite nice, although I think that the movie lacks so much in story telling, possibly due to overly extensive editing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's 1941 Belgrade. Blacky and Marko Dren are best friends partying around town. Marko enrolls Blacky into the Communist Party. The Nazis bomb and occupy the city. The guys start stealing from the Nazis and hunted as wanted men. Three years later in a rage of jealousy, Blacky goes on stage strapped to his mistress Natalija and kills her Nazi officer lover. Blacky is later shot while escaping. After the war, Marko becomes a high functionary with Tito as he elevates Blacky's heroism through film while Blacky is actually still alive. Marko keeps Blacky and others underground manufacturing weapons under the false pretense that they are still occupied by the Nazis.There is something about this movie that seems lost in translation. It feels like there is something being said about the ethnic mix of the characters but I don't think it's clear. It doesn't explain the war in the Balkans which would be the most important aspect to explain for a movie of that time. The movie's surrealism also takes away from any realism to the all-too-real situation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story follows an underground weapons manufacturer in Belgrade during WWII and evolves into fairly surreal situations. A black marketeer who smuggles the weapons to partisans doesn't mention to the workers that the war is over, and they keep producing. Years later, they break out of their underground "shelter" --- only to convince themselves that the war is still going on.I know very little about Yugoslavian film, or Serbian film or any other film industry of the region. But this is some great satire here, with the sensibility of Luis Bunuel or those fine folks who made "Delicatessen" and "Amelie" (drawing a blank on their names, sorry). Who knew that war could be funny? This is the sort of war comedy that "Life is Beautiful" could only dream of being.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Underground" is a drama movie in which we watch an underground weapons manufacturer in Belgrade during the World War II and a black marketeer who did not tell to partisans that the war is over and they continue to produce weapons. After some years they break out from this underground factory just to convince themselves that the war is not over.I liked this movie because of the different kind of plot which I found very interesting. The direction of this movie was equally good and is made by Emir Kusturica who did great job on it. About the interpretation I liked the interpretation of Predrag Manojlovic who played as Marko. Another interpretations that I liked were Lazar Ristovski's who played as Crni and Mirjana Jokovic who played as Natalija.Finally I have to say that "Underground" is a nice movie to watch because it combines very well drama and war with comedy in such a different and beautiful way that makes this movie not only interesting but a masterpiece of its kind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie long ago in Bulgaria, and loved it. Its set in the dark days of the WWII, but the story goes much beyond the war. In a sense this movie is radically different from the "hero" based American pictures. Perhaps that is why not all Americans fully appreciate it.Friendship and love take centre stage in this epic and the viewer's imagination is stretched to the limit with weird and somewhat sad scenes. This movies develops trusting, doubting, and loving filings in the viewer, and makes you think about the truly valuable things in life like friendship and survival.The music is amazing and can rival classics like the "Pulp Fiction" soundtrack. However I think it requires understanding of the way of life and traditions of the region. Even though it will surely echo inside you long after the movie is finished.Definitely worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Underground" starts off in World War II and ends in the early nineties Bosnian conflict. In World War II, Marko and Blackey are best friends. They form a resistance against the Germans and manufacture and smuggle weapons underground. Blackey and friends want to stay in the underground cellar until the war is over. Knowing this, Marco never tells any of them that the war has ended. He decides to profit off their labor. Eventually, years later Blackey finds out that they've all been lied to. He wants to get back at Marco and this leads to future chaos in Yugoslavia. Director Emir Kusturica takes a serious plot and turns it into a surreal and hilarious slapstick tragicomedy. With its beautiful images, drinking, music, laughter and tears; "Underground" is one of the most unique war films I've ever seen. It not only will make you laugh but also cry. Its images and music stay with you long after its over. No wonder why Kusturica won the Palm D Or at the 1995 Cannes film festival. "Underground" is powerful, stunning and unforgettable!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A controversial film is a great film !!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Once upon a time there was a country...".The subtitle refers of course to Sergio Leone's nostalgic masterpiece "Once upon a time in America". Kusturicas epic has a lot of this operatic and nostalgic moods, which are so significant for Leones movie. Both movies seem to thematize the tragic loss of ideals and the loss of a certain concept of national identity.But Underground has a lot more than Leones film considering its masterful play with metaphors and fictional realities, in which the protagonists are caught up in. The dystopian metaphor of the underground, the film within a film sequence, the imaginary island at the end of the film, they all suggest an interpretation of yugoslavian history that is far more sophisticated than the interpretations you find in all those recent books about the break-up of this country.Communist Yugoslavia was a country that was based on lies and deceptions, is what the film suggests, lead by the arbitrary despotism of some tyrants, that manipulated reality and history. At the end there is a total despair and loss of reality. The Serbs still think they fight against fascists- now its the NATO.Maybe Kusturica was right, when he suggested with Underground, that the people were kept for years in an anachronism and that this deception lead into the break-up of the country. I think one can not think about this film without speaking about the Serbs and there current situation.The film is of course ambivalent and controversial, but isn't it exactly this characteristic which makes out of a good film a great one?</fullReview>

From extreme situations with extreme resolutions, you can see it all: comedy, drama, romance, crime, love, war, satire...Although I believe the acting is a bit over the top, this can be related to the fact the movie has a different culture behind it and it attempts to be a little surrealistic, I suppose.The movie strongest characteristic of them all is its fantastic script. It has an exceptional plot with all kind of plot twists in-between.

		<shortDescription>Clever satire with a wicked black humour ? but drags once or twice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starting with the German bombing of Belgrade in 1941 this film follows two men who are hailed as heroes for their actions during the war. Marko hides people in his basement during the war and they produce guns for the war effort. Petar a.k.a. Blacky is a real war hero and an inspiration to his people, but after his capture and torture he is taken to the basement for safety. After the war Marko doesn't tell the people that it's over and profits from their arms production. As years do by Marko rewrites history to suit him.Winner of the Palme D'Or, I still didn't expect too much from this, but I was pleasantly surprised. It starts well with the bombing of a zoo etc and has several big set piece scenes. It also has a healthy rash of black comedy (witness Blacky polish his shoes with a passing cat without comment!) but it drags at times. The story itself is about how heroes are made and how history is rewritten, but nothing changes. The people emerge from the basement to find the war over, but a new war has taken it's place.As a satire on this I can get it, however I'm not familiar enough with Yugoslavia to fully understand some of the underlying currents. The humour is quite dark but the points are there to be seen. Another comment said that he couldn't understand the whole thing with the people being in the basement for so long?..you have to wonder what he thought he was watching!The final redemption is a nice comment on war, but really it suggests that the film is deep and meaningful. However epic or clever it appears I suspect that it isn't as deep as it would like to be.Overall the cast are good, it is funny, clever and has some good points to make about different types of people through history. But at times it drags and appears to think that it is more meaningful than it is. On the whole and good film and a worthy winner.</fullReview>

If you try to summon any of his movies (accept "OTAC NA SLUZBENOM PUTU" - it really is a great movie) what you will end up with is very superficial and mediocre story. It is the same case with Underground, a typical Emir movie with visual stunts that hypnotise the viewer and make him think that he´s watching something really "important" - but he´s not. If someone wants to see a real movie with a little similar ideas please go and see Andrei Tarkovski´s "Childhood of Ivan" - it is one of the most beautiful movies ever made and without a doubt the best war movie.

After some works more or less known as TIME OF THE GYPSIES (1988) and ARIZONA DREAM (1993), Kusturica saw his work finally recognized all over the world with UNDERGROUND, a poetic fable about the stormy and bloody history of his country, Yugoslavia. It's a film that amuses himself with the history of Yugoslavia, who plays with the unique characteristics of a people who made the connection between the west and the east, but who at the same time shows a enormous respect for that same people and that history. Kusturica films the disintegration of his country as a giant farce. A proof of love for a country, for a culture and for a people. Besides that the soundtrack is fabulous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Underground is the greatest film of the 1990s and, potentially, the greatest film of the last 25 years. It's terribly funny but ultimately heartbreaking and, yes, it's about war. In fact, it's among the greatest war films ever conceived.The film follows Marko and Petar, small-time Communist gun-runners in pre-WWII Belgrade. The movie opens as they drunkenly make-off with an arms-cache to the tune of a gypsy band. The next day, their city is destroyed and the animals have escaped from the zoo, metaphorically and literally. With their families, Marko and Petar escape underground to Marko's uncle's cellar where they intend to wait out the war. The war stops, but Marko fools the cellar-dwellers into thinking that the war rages on and enlists their help in building guns. Of course, those living in the cellar eventually learn the truth.With this movie, Kusturica created a hermetic world that is witty, farcical, surreal, and ultimately sublime. The photography is stunning and Kusturica's shot-composition is painterly. Underground is an amazing work of art, one that should be treasured not only for its cinematic value but for its cultural and historical values as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Once upon a time there was country' - this is how this film starts, setting a tone of legend on what will follow - a long, breathtaking and heartbreaking allegory of 50 years in the history of Yugoslavia and the Balkans. Although the movie tells a lot about Yugoslavia and the internal fights leading to the civil war there ('there is no true war without brothers killing each other' is another memorable quote) the movie can be related to any other Communist country in Eastern Europe, kept for many decades in the 'underground', torn away from the sunshine of freedom.The film was made in 1995, in the midst of a period when Europe was coming together, while Yugoslavia was falling apart. It is not the historic accuracy that was the focus of Kusturica's work, but the need to tell to the world the story of a region that underwent so many conflicts and has seen so much human tragedy, the need to find an explanation for the world but maybe first of all to himself. One needs not relate to this film as to a documentary, his tools are not the ones of the reporter but of the artist.It is a long movie, but I couldn't complain a bit, so fascinated I was by the story telling skills of Kusturica, by the music which is wonderful and plays an important role as in all his movies and by the acting which brings to screen a full colorful world of characters and situations.

		<shortDescription>Good looking but overlong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the only film of Emir Kusturica that I have seen, and his most acclaimed . My first impressions are that Kusturica has an amazing visual sense, is very good at extracting larger than life performances from his actors but does not know the meaning of economical storytelling or narrative progression.All three central characters in this epic saga of the country once known as Yugoslavia are superb. They have unique, beautiful faces and give truly exuberant performances. Then there is the color and overall cinematic look of the film - really good.But, the film is overlong where it does not need to be - some sequences drag on forever. This could easily be cut from three to two hours without any vital plot development being lost on the way. The progression from scene to scene - true it spans half a century - is quite choppy. I don't think Underground is going to age at all well with time. Most of the metaphors already feel dated a decade later given the new realities of the Balkans. A more watchable (and very funny) film on the Balkan conflict is the excellent No Man's Land.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a story of Blakey and his friend Marko who start off runningguns and supplies to communist rebels in Yugoslavia during Naziinvasion. They can really be crazy with wild drunken parties with abrass band literally accompanying them as they walk the streets. They hide their operation in a huge cellar as the Nazis take over. Alove triangle occurs among Blakey, his mistress, and otherpeople. Eventually leading to a rotten deception, that the directorunfolds very creatively over the next 15 to 20 years. The basis forthe film is well established in the first half-- which is 90 minutes. The final 90 minutes was well worth the wait. It was drama atsome points, dark comedy at others. 8 stars from me. (grade A)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thoroughly enjoyed parts of this film. It has moments of pure brilliance and hilarity; however, I'm afraid it's a movie that has great scenes but doesn't really work as a whole. There's a great deal of spirit and ambition in this film, but it just lags a lot in scenes, and the longer you watch it, the more it starts to lose focus, and much of the humor that made it so enjoyable towards the beginning. I did enjoy its unstructured plot, but interest level starts to wane after about the 2 hour mark. This one definitely could have used some cutting; however, this film does take place underground, and the visuals, the music and the setting make for a great atmosphere and a plot that is always unpredictable and filled with adventure, and fun; however, if you want to watch a Kusturica film, I'd go with his other one I've seen: Arizona Dream. It's equally bizarre but it has a much more engaging and interesting story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is important to bear in mind, this film was partially state funded under the Milosevic regime. Not surprising that Croatian or Bosnians characters are depicted as dumb or violent. As for historic war scenes again, the bias seems to land in portraying non-Serbian factions as the worse. Cannot say I am surprised to see this and it really ruins the films genuine integrity. The writer of the film seems quite dishonest in doing so. The opening scenes of WWII for example, completely demonizes the Croats as fascists while disregarding the anti-Fascists movement that grew. It is perhaps the same argument Serbs make of Hollywood films portraying Serbs as the villain. SO this might be the "counter balance".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Audience I watched with found some scenes funny enough to elicit loud laughs but I was led to believe this was a very funny movie, came away thinking it is a involved story that demands that the viewer accept some very unbelievable situations. Some really great staging and filming of some of these situations such as the last scene where a huge chunk of the sandy bank of the Danube breaks away and floats down-stream. The actors are competent maybe even very good. However the story covers fifty years. Makes for a very difficult stretch to accept that an actor can still be so strong, so good looking, so energetic after 50 years have elapsed. Really good score, music very good. One hundred-seventy minutes is a bit long to keep one's full attention though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Serbs where so proud of this film when it first came out. At the time they were super proud and overly proud of anything left them. I hope they understood the film and were not simply proud at how fun and crazy their people can be, we knew that already. War is such a terrible thing, it does not matter who started, we are all brothers and sisters, thats the point. This film makes it look like war is a natural thing to a Serb as though they did not know any better like the Arabs. And that after decades nothing has changed or gained any sophistication in that part of the world, at least up until then. Thats the impression this film gave me. We will all turn one upon the other and meet in heaven....Ah thats nice.....not. This is a long film but its so good that you will not notice how long it was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Distortion of historical facts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite my respect for Kusturica's great previous pieces of art such as "Do You Remember Dolly Bell?" or "When Father Was Away on Business", I find the movie "Underground" as a very irritating distortion of historical facts and politically motivated in favor of the Serbian anti-Titoist 'chetnik' ultra-nationalism which Kusturica supports (he left his home-city Sarajevo for Belgrade and sided with the ultra-nationalist policy during the Bosnian war)Kusturica's overly exaggerated metaphoric 'scary story' about former Tito's Yugoslavia depicting a life of people being kept in isolation and total ignorance about the rest of the world for a half century, manipulated by an "evil-commie" leader may be an appropriate metaphor for the former Enver Hoxha's Stalinist Albania and the Eastern Bloc countries such as USSR, Czechoslovakia, Poland, East Germany etc. but certainly NOT for Tito's Yugoslavia which was NOT a part of the Eastern bloc (since the conflict with Stalin in 1948). Yugoslavia under Tito was a leading founder of the Non-Alligned Movement (not East, not West) highly opened to the rest of the world in many aspects (arts, fashion, music, film etc.) The citizens under Tito enjoyed a freedom of movement which gave them opportunity to learn and experience the rest of the world and there was a free exchange of goods and ideas with the rest of the world (expecially with the West who helped Yugoslavia to some extent as a buffer zone to the former USSR and it's satellite countries)Speaking of Kusturica himself, during that SAME socialist Yugoslavia that he criticizes and ridicules so strongly in this movie, he was actually a highly successful and respected movie director and he was involved in the Sarajevo rock'n'roll and art urban subculture (such as the crazy Sarajevo "New Primitivsm" movement which was related to punk rock and the new wave for example, then the 'Monthy Pythonic' "Surrealist" movement etc.). He is the last person from whom I could expect such cynicism and so bitter discontent for that historical period. Taking all this into account Kusturica is very dishonest with this movie and I must say ungrateful.The pseudo-Orwellian allegories in this movie may only fool ignorant viewers looking for some "heartbreaking story about people suffering under the 'communist Inquisition' somewhere there in the east". I strongly believe that every viewer well informed about the history would agree with this. However, as a person who lives in this Balkan region, in this movie I would agree with the way the foreign interventionist policy was presented: selfish, cynical, greedy, using the complicated Balkan situation for own geopolitical purpose, taking or switching sides in the Balkan conflicts, playing "divide and rule" etc.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had high hopes for this film, and for a while it looked like I was going to love it. The first third of the movie or so is very entertaining, on several levels. I called my brother about 45 minutes into it and told him "you gotta rent this movie!!" Then it just petered out, but still dragged on (and on and on) for two more hours. When the movie ended I called my brother again and said "nevermind."I felt like those guys in Swingers on their drive to Vegas.If you're in the mood for a GREAT non-US movie about a family dealing with the effects of war and political upheaval on their lives through the decades, skip this one and check out the Chinese "To Live" with Li Gong. That's also a relatively long movie, but you'll find yourself completely wrapped up in it &amp; entertained (as opposed to thinking "HOW MUCH LONGER CAN THIS DRAG ON???" like I was during "Underground")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a long film. After 2 hrs I started fast forwarding the film and still could not finish it. It has got to be the longest film I have ever seen in my whole life or not seen. There are lots of interesting things but I found the film trite and banal. The amount of money spent on this film is just unthinkable. There are a few scenes which are nice but most of the film is basically a road-side show where people do what ever it takes to entertain you. There is a character that keeps breaking bottles on his head. I am yet to figure out what it signifies. It wasn't entertaining I can say that at least. A dancer keeps getting drunk, keeps removing her clothes and keeps dancing. I have no idea why she does that. If that represents her way of shirking her guilt then I must say a very long and irritating way of showing that. I could have edited this film to easy 50-60 good minutes but director chose to keep it a 170 minutes long film. You can use all great words like surrealist, great composition, cinematic poetry but fact remains that you are waiting for the bloody scene to finish so that you know what's going on. It is not convincing because under Tito country was doing good and Yugoslavians were traveling through out the Europe. So basically metaphor is politically incorrect too. Yugoslavia which was one of the main countries behind NAM and Tito literally threatened Stalin of killing. If it was Russian I would buy it but not Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia was the only economy under a communist regime which was doing well because it was an open economy. People traveled and brought money back into their economy. If you are a film student or you want to compare history then watch it. 6/10 for the making of the film. There is no doubt that making of the film is fascinating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If only he had stuck to making films, and not gone into politics...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very difficult movie to judge. It is definitely a very powerful film, well photographed, acted and directed, but in my opinion also with some major flaws. The main problem is that Kusturica cannot make up his mind whose side he is on, and this, for someone coming from the ex-Yugoslavia and who has witnessed the happenings, is unbelievable. Apart from being nostalgic for the "good old days when all the people where united, happy and carefree" (even though he does in a way, condemn communism), at the same time he is condoning almost every atrocity by telling us that "it is simply human nature"... For me, this is not enough.When I heard during the civil war that he had left Sarajevo for Belgrade I found it to be strange, but only before having seen this film. Now all is clear. For a great secular Muslim director from Sarajevo (that is at least what he was before he became a Serb nationalist...) to make a Serbian propaganda film in the middle of a civil war involving these two ethnic groups, is simply too much. To make it even worse, in the film there is also a scene at the beginning (subtle but definitely there) where he pictures the entire Slovenian and Croatian nations as blatantly pro-Nazi, which is not only historically incorrect, but simply offensive to those peoples (after all, he seems to forget that his beloved Tito who fought and finally defeated the Nazis in Yugoslavia during WW2 was not a Serb, but a Croat). Last but not least, he conveniently forgets in the film how and why the whole mess in Yugoslavia started in 1991...Kusturica is definitely a great artist (or should I say was), but since he has politicized himself, I am sorry to say, he has lost it. Trust the French to be the only ones to give him an award for this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Absolutely the WORST Kustarica film I've had the misfortune of sitting through- he tried to be funny about one of the least humorous topics in recent Balkan history (the Bosnian conflict)--maintains the problem is between Serbs and Croats and disregards that Bosnian Muslims were even an entity in Bosnia. I found the irreverence, starting with the close up of a whores large bottom at the beginning of this tedious film, intolerable. The visual gimmicks were tired and previously employed in Time of the Gypsies and Arizona Dream and therefore unoriginal. The day after I was subjected to UNDERGROUND a local station showed WHEN FATHER WAS AWAY ON BUSINESS reminding me why I felt cheated and betrayed by Underground and why I used to admire Kustarica in the past. Bregovic's soundtrack is the only redeeming element of this waste of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know why everybody likes this film. At least in the user ratings there were more people rating it as awful (1) than people who gave it at least an 8.The point of the story is obvious: Kusturica wants to give an account of the history of his people since the 40ies. He puts this into the form of a satire showing people living underground without realizing what is going on "on the surface" - in real life. Conflicts resulting and consequences (nation falling apart, war) are unavoidable. Good idea for the story, so far.But what a horrible show does Kusturica make of this! Pointlessly the story drags on forever from one set to the other all of which want to show us something important, something that can only be understood metaphorically or at second sight. The whole plot is split up into several long-drawn-out parts, the last one of which ends in Berlin - nobody knows why. (Does Kusturica perhaps think about that fascist Ex-Yugoslav war spreading over the rest of Europe, eventually?) The two protagonists are being shown in a justifiable - let alone sympathetic manner - pretending to everybody: "Well it is a tragedy with our people and our history, but that is the way we are...this is our way of life - we cannot help it..." By and by you feel like wanting to shout out loud (if only Kusturica sat in the cinema) "FOR CHRIST'S SAKE, COME TO THE POINT, PLEASE..!" In fact, if this movie really shows something the basic mentality of the Ex-Yugoslav people - why do we still keep asking ourselves why they don't get their acts together to come to terms with their political problems?!This film really got on my nerves. If I had not been stuck in this crammed cinema right in the middle of narrow rows of seats I would not have finished watching it. And then it had overlength whereas I had given up hope that the plot would become any better by the middle of it... The pictures themselves are brilliant, it is true, they recall Fellini's films - yet only in that point. But then again, there was that terrible disharmonious brass music with it, starting in regular, unpleasant intervals.Did I get anything wrong? I felt like being talked at by a mad preacher trying to convince me with his distorted, pathetic view of god and the world, instead of seeing a good and entertaining story, with a well written plot with some - at least some - suspense in it.This is one of the most embarrassing films that I have ever seen. I give it a 1 (awful) in the rating. But only because there is no 0 to be given. If a director knows how to make a good picture but does not find a way to express his views in a good story he should either keep on trying until he can or do documentaries instead of political satires.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>possible SPOILERS below.i know a lot of folks love this movie but i must say after seeing the video that i just don't get it. the first 1/3 or so of the movie is interesting and well done - the bombing effects and zoo animals is very powerful and the partisans are well portrayed and frequently amusing. however once the war seems to be won the movie completely loses me. i don't understand why the villagers are in the basement for apparently decades (they must be really stupid) or how the war movie fits into this - the movie seems to jump back and forth between different time frames or topics and ultimately became unwatchable for me. i just didn't derive anything from this in terms of plot development, character development or anything else on a deep level. maybe it's a movie that is best understood by eastern europeans, several people have said that it seems very typical of a yugoslavian or balkan way of thinking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't understand why anyone like this movie, it's sick, confusing and boring at the same time. I saw this on TV for about 2 month's ago and I must say that the only thing that I learned about it was the weird mentality of the people who lives in the Balkans. I just can't understand why they worship this mentality in movies. I have read most of the previous comments and I found that most of the people who liked this movie is from Eastern-Europe. The same people (not all) who protested against NATO's involvement in Kosovo &amp; Bosnia. But it seams that this two missions finally ended most of the cruelties in this region. You should think about that ! I will also say that I mostly agree with Jochen Metzger's comment.This movie gets 2 out of 10 from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful mystification</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Underground', like all the other Kusturica films is completely fake, mystifying &amp; false story, with unoriginal characters, banal ideas, suspicious messages, and it is generally completely worthless as a piece of art. Good example of artificial creating of 'great artist' in a world without real criteria.Mr. Kusturica is really a good professional director, which is nowadays pretty rare in a global art film industry (which is justified by so called avant-garde), but, he is also a narcissus (used to get it as a habit at a time when he was a spoiled child during his privileged position within a communist establishment environment childhood in ex-Yugoslavia).Therefore he uses his 'artistic' copying of Mr. Bertolucci or Mr. Tarkovsky just to cover his own lack of original ideas or his banal 'heroes' (so called 'outsiders' but actually brutal and stupid primitives) or 'ingenious' considering of commonplaces in his quasi-political 'engagement'. He was a good friend with the management of 'RTS' (Serbian state TV broadcasting station during the peak of Milosevic's war propaganda) which had actually financed the 'anti-regime' films like the one I am writing about.But, considering the last decade in the area of European artistic films like the period which cannot be described as really creative, Mr. Kusturica, thanks to the poor competition environment and exotic/wrong reading of his films (his characters and stories are fully realistic in Serbia, but, in The Western critics are interpreted and understood as surrealistic, and smartly created, because of cultural differences between The East and The West) has got the title of a 'great' European director.Completely wrong! His only honest attempt to make a film with the clear ideas, without mystifying Balkan myths, ended like a complete disaster. That was, of course, his American failure, 'Arizona Dream'. That film shows the real Kusturica possibilities, without any manipulation. I personally find this film as the best he has made, no matter how bad it is. Because it is true, unlike the others.If one likes to see the real artistic films, let's try with 'Crush', 'PI' or 'The Signs'. I won't name the directors. All the details can be found here in the movie database.</fullReview>
