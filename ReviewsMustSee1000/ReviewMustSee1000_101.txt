		<shortDescription>Powerful, graphic, unsettling movie with a profound message of hope and human courage shown in adversity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this movie with no expectations. The title made it seem like it would be a typical action movie; all guns and brawn and little in the way of storyline but boy was I wrong. This movie, based on a true story, was powerful and touched me so much that it has prompted me to write my first film review on IMDb in over six years! This is a movie with a solid pedigree of cast behind it, it is based on the life of Sam Childers (Gerard Butler), who without giving much away, has a criminal past, finds God and embarks on undertaking missionary work in civil war-torn Sudan, leaving his loyal, loving wife Lynn Childers (Michelle Monaghan) and his young daughter Paige (Madeline Carrol) back home in Penslyvania. This movie follows Sam's juggling how his Christian faith inspires him at home and also in Sudan.Gerard Butler has always been something of an enigma to me. In my opinion he can be hit and miss as an actor, but in this movie he gives a powerhouse performance as the emotionally conflicted and stunted Sam Cilders, someone who follows his faith and shows simple, sometimes primal humanity in inhumane foreign environments. I think this is Gerard Butlers best performance to date, he expertly immerses himself into Sam , he is so believable in this role, both emotionally, mentally and physically. The audience may find it hard to remember it is just a movie at some stages. Michael Shannon is amazing a Sam's childhood friend Donnie, a troubled soul who is another person loyal to Sam but ultimately flawed.This is not a movie I feel will get the awards it richly deserves. Similar in tone to Hotel Rwanda, it is an inspiring story but with a sobering message. It reminded me a lot of Hotel Rwanda because it showed how one man alone with enough faith in simple humanity can make a difference. Sam Childers is not a saint; far from it, he is flawed and he has a violent and criminal side and this is evident in the movie. However he is also shown as having humanity and the fact that he decides to make a stand and do something away from the comfort of his armchair in America is testament to his character. Would the audience have the courage to do what Sam did? That is a question facing the audience as they leave the movie, along with the graphic images which will haunt the audience for a long time after seeing the movie.There are so many powerful moments in this movie that it is hard to pin point any without spoiling the plot. This is not a movie that you should take a date along to; or anyone who is squeamish or unsettled by blood and guts. This is a movie that takes the audience in the palm of their hands and opens their eyes to the blunt reality and the truth of genocide. It is similar in that way to Hotel Rwanda but I found this movie even more graphic and unsettling in many ways. This is a movie you should watch at all costs although you may not want to see it again. It is hard hitting, powerful, emotional but most of all thought provoking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amazing story.. An amazing movie!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie and was simply left speechless. It was amazing!! The story of Sam Childers is amazing. It really makes you think and wonder how can one person have so much willpower and stamina to keep doing what he has been doing all these years for these children. I was shocked by what the LRA has been doing to these children but unfortunately this is the truth and history keeps repeating itself especially in African countries. I have lived in Africa for many years and seeing somebody doing something about these atrocities does mean a lot (even though he is a "white savior"). If this is what it takes, so be it. Let's not denigrate it as I have seen so many do in their reviews. It is a very moving story and although it is extremely violent at times (let us not forget this is a true story and these things happened), it can be very touching and emotional. Gerard Butler's performance is Oscar worthy and Michelle Monaghan and Michael Shannon were also great even though their roles were short but then again the story is about Sam Childers. However, what I would really like to know is why some of the critics trashed this movie?? !! Most of the people who saw it found it excellent as I did. And why was it not widely distributed??? I think people should see this movie and be more awake and aware!! Was it too controversial for some?? It leaves me wondering !!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Had to travel to Denver to see it, but it was worth it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The interesting observation after viewing this film at the historic Mayan Theater in downtown Denver was that every female was crying by the end and the men were poker-faced. Also of interest is that the negative reviews, which are often unnecessarily unkind to Gerard Butler, and unhelpful to the reader, often seem to have been posted by males. Sure, women around the world are crazy about Gerard Butler, but come on, this was an astounding performance about the life of an awe-inspiring man. If you didn't like the film, walked out, or wanted to punch Mr. Butler in the face, then donate the cost of your ticket to Angels of East Africa. My final comment is that Mr. Butler produced this film because it wouldn't have been made otherwise. This is a story that had to be told and he didn't accept his normal fee for his performance; in fact, although I obviously can't confirm it, I heard that he accepted a fraction of a fraction of his normal fee.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WOAH! Incredible in every manner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film deserves a MUCH higher score. It's one of the best movies I've seen in years.Very well developed characters and storyline and amazing acting/plot.I was a little upset in the beginning and thought the movie will turn out to be cheesy, but it really takes hold on you after a few initial disappointments and doesn't let go until the end.Buttler fits the unstable "born again, dead again" character extremely well and delivers an extremely believable performance.What really makes this movie stand out is its non-stop change of pace. It goes from slow and peaceful to hardcore Rambo action, but does so in a very creative way.Definitely a must see and definitely a masterpiece!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heart Wrenching and Poignant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw a screening last night at the DGA, and wasn't prepared for what I was about to witness. I was in tears several times during the film. It was something that will stick with me forever. I think the fact that this was a true story made it even more powerful. The whole cast was really wonderful, but Michelle Monaghan stands out in my mind. That girl is a true talent, and hearing her speak after the movie made me realize how invested she is, not only in the film part of the project, but in the charity with Sam Childers as well. Such impressive work, both in front of and behind the camera.The movie made me want to help. It made me angry that our military, government, and governments across the planet have neglected these people. I am still reeling from seeing this. Brilliant, moving, and absolutely gut wrenching. Did someone say Oscar?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I m not a usual review writer of any kind but i especially register for IMDb to write about this movie. After watching the movie and checking the IMDb rate i must say it is highly underestimated and i was forced to make a statement.i would recommend this movie. it leaves you thinking not only about the characters itself but also about the issue of the movie. I myself spend hours of researching about the problems which are shown in the movie.i find the characters very appealing although at some point i thought it could be portrayed better than it was actually done.Overall it is a really good movie and worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very touchy movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Machine Gun Preacher" is an inspirational melodrama directed by Marc Forster and starring Gerard Butler, Michelle Monaghan and Michael Shannon. This film is based on the true story of Sam Childers a former gang biker who finds god, becomes a pastor and has dedicated his life and all his resources ever since to rescuing and protecting orphans in Sudan, Africa. Childers founded Angles of East Africa an orphanage located in South Sudan.Marc Forster has under his belt an impressive resume with films like Quantum of Solace, The Kite Runner, Finding Neverland and Monster's Ball. Reviewing this film has been very complicated because of its subject matter. The movie has a strong religious subject, addresses the civil conflict and severity of the crisis in Sudan, ideals, hypocrisy and religious fanaticism. This film will divide Christian audiences because of the redemptive arc of the tale.This is one of those movies that will provoke both sympathy and aversion. Sam Childers (Butler) is not an ordinary preacher; he carries a machine gun and kills LRA rebels in self-defense looking at it as helping God's children. Sam had a troubled life, was a gang member, drug dealer, junkie, married a stripper, but his life dramatically changes around when he finds god or god finds him, as he states in the movie. He claims to be a soldier fighting for freedom and becomes a member of the SPLA (Sudan People's Liberation Army). Mark Foster does a good job bringing such a complex and controversial story to the big screen utilizing his well-known visual skills. This movie has a lot of graphic and violent scenes, showing the horror caused by a civil war, torture, savage murders, and how entire villages are destroyed. MPAA rating: R Runtime: 2:03 mins Production Co: Relativity Media, Virgin Produced, Apparatus Productions</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic but Unfortunately not Well Known Biography</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the addicted gang biker Sam Childers (Gerard Butler) is released from prison and learns that his wife Lynn Childers (Michelle Monaghan) is no longer a striper and has converted to Christianity. One night, Sam and his best friend Donnie (Michael Shannon) give a ride to a hitchhiker that threatens Donnie with a pocketknife; however Sam reacts and stabs the stranger and dumps him on the road.Sam is affected by the incident and is convinced by Lynn and his mother Daisy (Kathy Baker) to join their church and he is baptized. Sam finds a straight job in construction. He is well succeeded and when he meets a preacher from Africa, he decides to visit the continent. Sam travels to Northern Uganda and South Sudan many times and builds an orphanage for the victims of the cruel Lord's Resistance Army (LRA). Further, he fights whenever necessary and becomes a legend known as The Machine Gun Preacher."Machine Gun Preacher" is a film tailored to Gerard Buttler about the fantastic but unfortunately not well known biography of Sam Childers, an addicted troublemaker drug-dealer biker that changes totally his life and becomes the only hope for thousand of orphans in Africa. The story and the screenplay are engaging with a perfect combination of drama and action. The only thing that irritates me is douchbags that write that this film like is a Christian propaganda. This is a true story and can be found everywhere in Internet and has nothing to do with propaganda, but reality and redemption. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Redenç?o" ("Redemption")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Movies based on true stories and real people tend to receive the benefit of the doubt from me when they exaggerate those truths and characters. The real life Sam Childers at the beginning of the movie is an ex-con, druggie, gun-loving drug dealer, thug, lousy dad, worse husband, and overall man of failed character. When he finds God, he loses the drug labels but the only other thing that really changes is his postal address.Sam Childers sees himself as a modern day crusader working to make a better life for the war orphans in Sudan. It's impossible to argue that he hasn't had an impact on lives. The real question is, at what cost and by what methods? Over the closing credits, we even get a clip of the real Sam asking us "does it matter how?".You will find no debate here for whether or not this man has made a difference or whether his methods should be judged. This space is merely for analyzing the movie which is telling a story. Gerard Butler does an admirable job making Sam a somewhat sympathetic character. Re-read my first paragraph if you think that's easy! Michelle Monaghan plays Lynn, his incredibly supportive wife who actually helped Sam find God, rather than continue his criminal, drug-addled ways with friend Donnie (Michael Shannon).While I found the story of the Sudanese children to be heart-breaking, the choppy and fragmented manner in which it's presented was quite annoying. The story began in 1998 but we never really knew what year it was or how much time had passed between Sam's trips home. Many of the gun battle scenes came across very staged and set-up for a cool shot of Butler brandishing a weapon and bandanna.So while I found the story to be quite interesting, I found the delivery to be less than adequate. This despite fine performances from Butler, Monaghan, Shannon, Kathy Baker and Madeline Carroll. There are numerous magazine articles about Sam Childers and I believe you will find those more accurate and informative.</fullReview>

The story is rich and the movie keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. You also learn something watching it. I was so interested that i looked up Sam Childers organization and watched some of his interviews afterwards. I also thought Gerard Butler did a really good job portraying Sam - really good acting. The other actors are really good as well. Won't lie - i shed a few tears too. You feel terrible for all the people and children of Sudan and Uganda. I would definitely see this movie!!!!!!!! You won't be disappointed. Awesome! Loved it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Childers Story Holds Great Potential -- Lead Role Sadly Miscast -- Inconsistent Script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Machine Gun Preacher" is produced by Gerard Butler, who by no small accident has absorbed the lead role, which is based on the real-life story of Sam Childers. Sam is a reformed ex-con, whose former life was dangerously reckless, until he turned his life around and began to do the Lord's work. I was inspired by the core storyline, which concerns itself with themes of transformation.There were some missing puzzle pieces in the script. One example is just after Childers comes to Jesus. After a mandatory church scene, the period of time when he truly changes his life is not addressed. If the film had shown this difficult transition of what it really means to leave "the old world behind", then the plot would have benefited by a reality-shot to the arm. Some of the African scenes were moving, like where Childers has built an orphanage and becomes a freedom fighter who rescues war-torn children. And that's why I felt that I had to give this film a rating of 6 stars, rather than a mediocre 5.Kathy Baker and Michael Shannon, both very fine actors, should have been given more lines and more screen time. Savane did a fine turn as the African comrade. I'm not as convinced as some of the pro critics about the casting of Monaghan as his wife. She played it with a quiet sincerity, but what I hoped for was a stirring undertone, revealing fragments of her former hard-scrabble life. Who could have done this role real justice? How about Melissa Leo?At the end of the film, the rolling credits reveal the real-life Sam Childers. It was at this moment in seeing and hearing the burly, earthy-looking biker man that I was further convinced that Childers himself was miscast. Gerard Butler's handsome looks are distracting. He does a fair enough job, but the role does not shine. In the church scenes when he was preaching, the credibility was sorely lacking. It felt like Butler was going through the motions. Can Gerard Butler get an Amen, brother and sisters?Sadly, not from this viewer.So, who could carry the mantle of Childers with sufficient gravitas? Several actors come to mind: Billy Bob Thornton, Philip Seymour Hoffman, or Michael Shannon. Each of these gentlemen have the chops to tackle a difficult role like this. I'm grateful that this story has come to light in this film. But after going online to find out more about Sam Childers, I see that his personal web site is polished and fairly commercial. This slick branding is the opposite of Childers, who is a gruff rebel rouser, and also happens to save children. Similarly, this film seems to try too hard to be accepted into the fame-driven flock of Hollywood. And that, dear brethren, could be the weak link in this film. While the movie is clearly faithful to the commercial demands of Movietown, the genuine story of Sam Childers has been watered down and compromised. My hope is that 10 years from now, some indie filmmaker will re-develop this story, and infuse it with all the complex, gritty glory which it deserves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just another Religiously filled movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While the idea of the movie is not that bad, as an idea, the way it is presented is absolutely horrible in all scales. The whole idea surrounds around the church and how it affects people in a good way. The problem is that the whole movie is filled with unbelievable turns of actions, and not in a good way. The idea of 'turning from evil to angel' is taken word to word from a religious point in this movie and there is no decency in the the way things take action. I just cannot believe this movie has such a high rating with the amount of bullshit it contains.Another negative point is the 'facts' this movie is trying to show. At one point it started promoted Christianity as the right way of life, and I do not say that is completely wrong as I am open minded, but when it does that in a very explicit way it just kills the movie. Another horrible turn of the movie is a sentence that made me sad because it is being taken for granted. It is a part of the dialog in the first half of the movie where a man says "The Muslim north has been killing the Christians in the south for over 30 years." From a political view that is pure bullshit and there is no other way to describe it. If they were trying to be informative they should have brought the facts in a right way, the way it was said, very carelessly, indicates a very wrong fact about the situation between Southern and Northern parts of Sudan.I am completely disappointed with this movie and I sincerely hope I never ever heard of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truth is it isn't a Great movie or a Bad one either</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie stars Gerald Butler and his life transformation from a pitiless biker to a church builder avenger.A lot of criticism of this movie comes from people crying out against white superiority or religious propaganda, in my opinion this movie does neither and anyone that have read books and documentaries about Africa knows that the situation over there does require occidental involvement in any form to help those countries until they can manage their own states by themselves, of course dependency on foreign aid is another issue but let's no get into that.My problem with the movie that is said to be based on a 'true' story comes from the script itself. I did not believe Gerard Butler's transformation from a ruthless bandit that forces his wife to go back to stripping instead of working in a mall, not saying that this is impossible in real life, but that the way they presented it was lacking realism.The rest of the movie sends a good message about people implicating in Africa's civil wars, and especially Sudan although the situation has since changed with South Sudan's new sovereign state. A good way to this at home is perhaps to visit and give support to African based groups advocating for a united Africa with real bureaucracies, laws, corruption-free police.For a movie that talks about Africa The Machine Gun Preacher is less than stellar compared to many others, not because of it's message but because of it's content and I didn't think it portrayed white superiority in any kind and I don't think supporting white Christian churches for their actions in Africa is a bad message anyone saying the contrary should ask themselves what are they doing that those churches aren't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>fantastic, worth seeing, but don't see it if you forgot your heart at home!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really can't believe some of the reviews I read about this fantastic movie! The story is amazing and the movie itself wonderful to watch. Although I've been in Africa, and was expecting that part of the movie to be somewhat "boring" to me (after reading a previous review that claims that the first part of the movie was "slow-doing" and "boring"), I swear I was so absorbed by the story that I felt no second of bore or slowness. I have no clue what some people were expecting! The actors and actresses did a great job to do the characters justice. I loved Gerard Butler but who doesn't love this guy. What I appreciated especially about his acting was the real depth he gave his character. An amazing performance. I ended up crying towards the end because the story is so touching. It is by no way a light-hearted movie to watch if you can't think for yourself about certain truths in life; if you want a brainless comedy obviously this won't be your cup of tea. I loved the real-life Sam 'takes' in the end near the credits. And yes, I think this guy is doing exactly what he is supposed to be doing and he's making a huge difference in the hopeless world in Sudan. In that context (of a lawless country where kids have no rights whatsoever) what he does is what anyone with a consciousness (and guts) ought to be doing to make a difference in the world. I hope this movie opens the door to more funding for his efforts. And like Sam says to his church goers: "WAKE UP! Don't be like sheep". This man is truly living his life fully awakened. Thank you to all who worked to bring this story to the movie theater. It was more than worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Documentary-lite but High on Energy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Religion and violence are far more synonymous than most people of faith would care to admit, and with Machine Gun Preacher Gerard Butler's criminal-turned-man-of-god certainly embraces that twisted mantra with a fervor. Despite adding a little too much "story-of-the-week" flavor, what allows this African-set, wartime drama/actioner to distinguish itself from your typical "one man against evil" archetype is Butler's charisma and instances of character arc complexity that do not play out as you might expect. Directed by Marc Forster (Quantum of Solace), Machine Gun Preacher chronicles select chapters from the life of Sam Childers (Butler) and his crusades against the genocide in Sudan by constructing an orphanage for the casualties of the conflict ? the ones who are still alive. When we start out, Childers has just been released from prison and wastes no time returning to his biker bar, reuniting with his bad influence of a best friend (Michael Shannon) and setting up a tidy drug score. After an unforeseen complication (and an attempted murder) leaves the man shaken, he turns to his religious wife (Michelle Monaghan) for salvation. What he finds while on a missionary outing to Sudan are the orphans, whose cause he initially addresses by allowing the majority of a wandering pack of young children to cram themselves in his tiny motel room. From there, it becomes an obsession ? an addiction ? as much as a cause. It is from this point where the fable deviates favorably (if not flawlessly) from its traditionally constructed roots, when Childers realizes simply constructing a modest orphanage (and the presence of a "white man") is not enough to keep the rebels at bay. Hence, the "machine gun preacher" is born, allying himself with revolutionists and carrying out attacks, raids and ambushes with the apparent end goal to protect "his" children. What we actually see, unequivocally, is his sociopathic side slipping through his soft veneer and his addiction swelling to an all-out overdose of righteousness. To make matters worse, he alienates his actual family back in the States, drives them close to financial ruin with his self-funding efforts and refuses to quit because of his own broken logic. This makes Childers a somewhat unlikable individual in that respect, but also makes him all the more intriguing. I still fail to see Butler ever rising to the plane of an awards- garnering thespian, but he is consistently larger-than-life and rarely uninteresting to watch on screen. He infuses Childers with a bravado and intensity that is enough to compensate for unevenness in the screenplay. Also of note is that while the film is about a preacher and his godly crusade, "Machine Gun" ironically rarely preaches and lets the story and the horrible situation speak for itself. There are instances of manipulation when it comes to the orphans, but things are kept refreshingly low key. Machine Gun Preacher tells an interesting story (if a familiar one thanks to an amplitude of entirely fictitious and melodramatic Hollywood fare available) about a man, who still to this day champions orphans in Africa. Crisp action, punctuations of graphic violence and solid performances throughout convey the proper message despite never really offering up of an enough impact to make anything click in the minds of the average individual. Essentially, this is documentary lite with just enough energy to warrant the big-screen treatment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible Experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never seen a movie about a protagonist that was so unsympathetic. He pretty much spent 90% of his life terrorizing everyone in his community and then he stabs some drifter and suddenly he finds Jesus....give me a break. He then magically gives the American dream to his family that he neglected and abused for 90% of his life and suddenly everything is A-okay.He then starts his own church and a mission in Africa. He spends most of his time neglecting his business and church to hide from his problems in Africa. It's like he can't focus on the problems plaguing his community, which obviously has problems, if there is such rampant crime and drug use, which he knows of first hand. Anyways, he gives some warriors of god speech to his church so they can sponsor his little jihad/vacation in Sudan.He also goes to his former boss and pretty much uses the fear of god's wrath to bully him into paying for his little crusade. When his former boss doesn't give him exactly the dollar amount he demands, he storms out of the party his former boss invited him to, like an angry child and throws a temper tantrum at his wife and kids.I also love how he cares so much for these people half way across the globe rather than his own friends and family. He pretty much just ignores his family, browbeats and verbally abuses his daughter when she just asked for some money to get a limo to her prom (even though he took out a freaking loan he has no hope of repaying for his mission in Africa), and leaves his friend to die all so he could run away to Africa and play hero. It's partially his wife's fault because when he wanted to quite (like any person with a brain would after watching their mission burn down and be thrown into a war zone), his idiotic wife tells him to stay there, waste more money and possibly die.In short, it was a movie about a bunch of people with a messiah complex that would rather play savior then actually think for themselves. If these people had even a little bit of a sense of self or logic, then half of the stuff in this movie would not have happened.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From respected film director Marc Forster is this film that we are told is based on true events. In that case it leaves me with a bad feeling as we somehow have to cheer for some kind of cold blooded murderer.Sam Childers is a bike gang member, a drinker, druggie and a criminal who spends time in jail. His wife finds religion and over time so does Childers. He gets into a successful construction business.When he hears a sermon from a missionary from Sudan, Childers is inspired to go there and build an orphanage. He is driven into improving the life of the kids in South Sudan. He soon comes into conflict with Joseph Kony's Lord's Resistance Army that operates from Uganda. Now Kony and his cronies are evil, turning boys into armed soldiers and selling girls into sex slavery.Childers in no time returns to his violent instincts becomes a commander in the Sudan People's Liberation Army fighting against Kony's faction, hence the title Machine Gun Preacher. Gerard Butler is left with a dilemma by the script. Childers is less a preacher and just another guy spraying bullets with a gun and worse still just looks like another white man from the western world here to rescue the black folks of Africa.The film turns into a violent graphic novel rather than a man fighting his conscience. He even neglects his business and family back home for this zealous course he has undertaken.Childers is just another mercenary and a cold blooded one. For his sake let us assume the film is not true because he should be charged with being an unlawful combatant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Morally suspect, yet watchable to the last</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(50%) This may be the most all over the place movies of recent years that if it wasn't for the fact that it's based off a real life story would be as toxic as nuclear waste. As at its heart there's a morality tale here quite unlike any other, and if it wasn't so confused it could be considered almost dangerous. For the fact remains that fighting fire with fire only leads to lots and lots of burnt dead people. This wants to be part drama/part intense action, but the drama side lacks true depth and the action is too badly shot to have any lasting impact, though this isn't a bad film by any means. Butler is well cast as a born again ex crook who takes no bull, and there's hardly a dull moment throughout with something always just around the corner. Overall a watchable time passer with a fair amount of meat on the bones, but it's not quite all there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I've got mixed feelings for this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's no secret that as a young Christian, someone like me would be drawn into the story of "Machine Gun Preacher", which according to its Facebook tag line, is "a great story of human and redemption". However, my admiration for this real-life saint, this living legend wasn't enough to cushion the disappointment and confusion after seeing the movie.On one hand, Mr. Childers' vision in saving children from battlefields is inspiring, especially worth a mention to Christians in peaceful countries who took peace and life prosperity for granted. The movie depicts him as being driven by this vision almost into the abyss of madness, which is beyond reasoning, beyond family commitments and even beyond his own faith in God. You can taste that the movie makers are tough and brave enough to show you the dark sides of a modern-day saint, which is kinda like the point of modern storytelling. It's as if they were totally expecting (or maybe even aiming for) controversy in the first place, that the depiction of Childers' religion reaches new heights of theatrical unconventional-ism. This is not a man who reach out to unfriendly fellow human-beings with a "turn the other cheek" attitude, but rather a man who strike out like a wolf without any fear to hold him back from executing an enemy. When Gerald Butler roared with AK-47 in hands, he was not shouting to the evil rebels who like to grab kids and brainwash them into killing machines, he was literally shouting out to people who are disconnected from the real cruelty which is happening every minute. If Childers ever want to laugh at us for being fat and useless, I would say he has every right to say so becausetrying to defend yourself whether with mental cleanliness which you call "pacifism" or smart argument that we are too little too feeble to do anything substantial for those kids, there are those risking their lives on the front line for them. On the other hand, the Christianity I know may not work like what the movie depicts. I know some dedicated Christians who work in rehab centers here in Thailand, who has to witness the addicts getting clean only by the grace of Jesus. That certain process is extremely painful, challenging and no less difficult than being born all over again. However the movie, to my disappointment, took the transformation for granted. In a way, I also wish this kind of "montage cleansing methodology" can be applied in real life, which would save so much time and strength. Unfortunately, I don't believe so. It seems to me that, as far as Childers' motivational sermons(speeches) go, he may have turned his church from a place of healing into a shooting gallery, with bullets made of religious terms. Although it seems more dramatic and scary on the big screen, but one has to confess that Christians can often do so without ever realizing it is exactly what Jesus hated so much about religious people in the 1st century. The movie itself also acknowledged this issue lightly, but indifferently marched on with Childers at the center of righteousness. Childers' donation collecting approach is more like "call yourself a bastard if you don't care", which is amusing since it reminds me of some Chinese advertisements and viral marketing methodology in which a curse is landed onto you if you don't act as required. I am also pretty sure that's not how Jesus preached in the Bible.Whether it's for artistic reason or not, the story development in this movie, as some reviewers pointed out, is a bit inconsistent. Potentially it can cause many unnecessary confusions to those not familiar with Christian faith, in my opinion. For example, there was a scene in which Childers made a bad decision to leave dozens kids behind when there weren't enough room to move them back all at once. This led to those kids being slaughtered and burnt, which made Childers questioning his God, commenting that Mr. Almighty doesn't care or doesn't exist. So the scenario is, you did your best calculations and pulled out a long shot, which the "God Insurance Co.Ltd" didn't choose to cover, and you're so angry that you call God a fraud. How smart is that? Still, Jonas in the Bible did something similar, but Jonas' story ended on the note of God's reassuring words, unlike Mr. Childers' story which ended on Childers being "redeemed" by the little kid who was forced to kill his family, when the kid told him not to lose himself in catastrophes. So I guess the inconsistency of the story comes with the problem of redemption. Who was redeemed by whom from what? How's redemption ever possible? The movie started off establishing the power of the God's love as the ultimate answer, but gradually skewed towards humanism which finally sees Childers as the fleshed out hero, who's maybe one step away from claiming higher moral ground than God (which I surely hope the real-life Childers won't do).With this review, I hope that some bottom-line can be given to my fellow movie-goers who walked out of the theater confused, or even offended by the Christianity depicted in the movie. Also, I hope to know Mr. Childers in real life better, and will look forward to be inspired by his account of faith and redemption.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Based on an auto-biography---</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Machine Gun Preacher (2011) Gerard Butler, Michele Monagham, Souleymane Sy Savane. How can a story be propaganda if you make a film about what the person themselves has put on paper? Sam Childers wrote a book about what he did and now everyone is saying, in effect - "no you didn't. We know better. It was this way. You are a jerk and don't know what you're talking about!" I think people don't WANT it to be true, because that makes them feel superior.But Sam thinks he did what he wrote. I have watched it twice and taken some notes. Remember - it is HIStory and we, the viewers, can't change facts to suit our preferences.The films prologue sets the theme. It's 2003 and the atrocities in Sudan are unbelievable. Then we jump to what Sam's life was in 2003. Drugs, robberies, prison, etc. It is HIS story from then on and he pulls no punches in how bad and lost he was.He was rescued by his wife Lynn and the church. Because he knows what it feels like to finally walk into a place of worship and feel so alone, he decides to build a storefront that says "come as you are - we need you." Which is the Christian message. Not propaganda. Sam is successful in getting things going. He has a construction business and his church and is inspired to go to Africa to help build a school. It is the changing point for him. He is compelled to go back again and again to do something for the youngsters living in Hell.He finally realizes that no matter how "good" the missionaries are, the Kona army will keep burning down everything, kidnapping children, killing their parents, and worse, until stopped. The 'government' has no help for those out in the bush country. So he grabs a gun and takes a truck and the mission guards and goes to get what kids he can and bring them back to safety. And they do have to kill some of Kona's thugs.And he doesn't sugar-coat how the other missionary communities feel about him or visa-versa. The young woman says to him "you are a mercenary." But he only knows he is rescuing some of the children. That's it for him And it is HIS story. It's his P-O-V. I can't fault him for that.The cast are good. Gerard Butler is especially good in the beginning scenes showing the bad-boy biker persona. The same qualities that made Sam an addict make him successful in other pursuits. Singleness of purpose, and a laser-beam on what he wants to do. And of course, Butler is fine in the action scenes. Looked real to me.Michele is good as his no-nonsense wife. She loves him but stands up for herself. Michael Shannon as Sams buddy, doesn't get much to do. The actors in the Africa segment are all good, but Savane is a strong presence. Madeline Carroll, as daughter Paige, is sweet and normal. Wants some attention from her Dad.The film was engrossing to me. 8/10 http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1586752/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocre entertainment...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Machine Gun Preacher" tries to tap into the sympathy of the audience with a real life story, but the movie ended up being entertaining for what it was, but it was a mediocre experience at best.The story is about Sam Childers, a reformed criminal and substance abuser, who finds God, builds a church and then goes to Sudan to help the needy in a war-torn country.Personally, I found the story a bit too sappy and too much of a goodie-two-shoes, but then again, I don't buy into the whole Christian concept. But that is a personal preference, of course.Gerard Butler put on a good performance, although it was a bit out of his usual area of acting. But it is nice to see actors branch out to new things and genres.This movie is not the type of movie that you watch more than once. While the work that Sam Childers have done is commendable and commendable, the story in the movie just doesn't have enough weight to support multiple viewings. For me, this movie just didn't pack enough punch to really be a great movie, despite of however larger-than-life compassion for life and selflessness it tried to tell.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too emotionally vacant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's good to hear that they're making a film about Sam Childers' story during the mayhem in Sudan. It's good to hear that Marc Forster, the director of Monster's Ball and Finding Neverland, will direct this biographical film. It's good to hear that Gerard Butler was picked to play the part as Sam Childers. But that good hearing is eventually turned into a disappointment because Machine Gun Preacher is too emotionally vacant to bring Sam Childers' story into the big screen.I think the main problem is mainly in the script. Every scene in the movie is vacant for emotions. We want to witness Sam Childers' story, right? But what we got is a predictable biographical film. It's filled with horrible pacing, poorly direction, a script that is terribly written and a waste of talented casts. Machine Gun Preacher is a mess. I wonder if the real person behind this film also feels the same way.Overall, I think I will give this film a score of 3 since the casts did a pretty good job and the music is beautiful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, this movie did well in the beginning while introducing Sam Childers. He was a complete chauvinist and violent guy who notably had a mental disorder, and his family had to deal with him everyday. After some while, Childers decides going to church and traveling to Africa in order to help the poor people that live there. The problem is that, as the story goes, we're able to notice that Butler's character believes to be a hero, even if it means killing lots of people because there is a war going on. It is interesting to remember that Hitler, and several other totalitarian presidents, began their career as "the world savers", growing their popularity until the horror began. It's very known that power corrupts men, and this movie mixes this subject with a predisposition that Childers always had. I mean, he always seemed to be an explosive guy that needed no reason to beat people up, so it was almost obvious to imagine he'd become something like that. The problem of this film is that... there is nobody to spectator feel identified with. The characters' lack of charisma let this movie a little boring, mainly if the audience doesn't enjoy religious advertisement. In my opinion, "Machine Gun Preacher" is just a regular film that entertains for some moments, but never delivers. We've seen better....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Africa</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Childers was a hard core criminal until he becomes very involved with his local church and turns his life upside down towards the better, starting his own business, taking care of his family and getting his life in order. Then he travels to Africa, to build a orphanage for the children of the civil war. The movie deals with many subjects, with the war, the volunteering, the family relationships, the violence, the human passion. And it present them all equally and wonderfully. The human drama and the violence are a little harsh, but the atmosphere of the film wants a darker light. The story is good, even though the lines are not as good, but as it is a true story it can't be something over the top. However the ending is not that good, it feels like it ends suddenly, as if they run out of money and they had to stop shooting. So 4 out of 10, because of the great performances and the strong massage behind the story.</fullReview>

Even I came up with a new name for the genre of the movie, which is- "where ever there is a problem, there is a white American to get you out of the mess".A beautifully crafted fantasy film based on a true story. The director gives u such a ease, that you even won't feel like googling, what really happened up there.

		<fullReview>Please do not watch this movie! If you've already watch it, you know its story of a former drug addict, prisoner and eventually murderer and a mass murderer. Thus, if every film has its protagonist, this film has antigonist.The absurdity of the film shows how the main antigonist, who wants to fix his life, begins to believe in God and do good and in the whole time is supported by his wife. This is fine, but whenever he is going to do something he goes too far and forgets everything. His attitude towards everyone is extremely hostile and inadequate. He fails to get close anyone. It is funny how his family and his best friend support him almost to the end of the movie.So, he tried to show us strong will that is needed to a guy who is actually so engrossed psychologically (repeatedly our antigonist has crises that the need of treatment is not a secret to anyone) but his try remained unsuccessful because despite all his faults he never could recover and socialize. Even the idea of &#x200b;&#x200b;the possibility of such life is again absurd.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie unworthy of the story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Former addicted gang biker with a prison track record Sam Childers (Gerard Butler) after almost killing a man manages to find god, thus changing his life and remolding the future of his family. Backed by his also reformed wife Lynn (Michelle Monaghan), Sam manages to open a successful construction business moving up from dire poverty to up-standard suburban villa. However, the calling of God takes him away from his smug life and throws him into the cross-Ugandan-Sudanese territory terrorised by pseudo-Christian cult Lords Resistance Army and their deranged leader Joseph Kony, renowned for utilising child soldiers for his ruthless bloody reign. Aghast by the cruel toll LRA has taken on local community, Sam decides to build an orphanage on Southern Sudanese land, acting as a preacher for the many children finding shelter in this sanctuary of peace. Unable to stand back and turn the other cheek, when confronted by the onslaught of LRA's wicked rule, the former biker decides to take up arms with Sudanese rebels. Effective and uncompromising Sam Childers soon becomes known as the 'machine gun preacher', handing out death to those who would harm the defenceless.Based on the true life story of Childers unfortunately it fails to ignite the expected reaction. Dealing with rich material on the nature of good, the movie only truly hits home during the end credits, when the real Sam Childers poses a truly tough moral question about retaliation, use of deadly force for the greater good. This in turn suggests that maybe the more appropriate route for highlighting the life of this remarkable, conflicted man would be served in the form of a documentary. Thus several moral issues litter the movie, but fail to get a proper treatment, as the dubious path of Childers forces him to shoot and kill armed children, whilst tough choices has him leave a group of children in the clutches of the enemy (only for them to be slaughtered afterwards). Nonetheless Marc Forster at least attempts to bring these questions into the picture, however heavy-handed his approach may have been.Thankfully avoided overly rampant Christian propaganda, mostly focusing on questions of redemption. Nonetheless the key conflict regarding Sam's military gun-toting approach and biblical morality are glossed over at the key moment of the story, as if especially hidden in order to not undercut the Christian cohesiveness of Childers' conversion. Surprisingly lifeless given the source material, the biopic almost mechanically stutters through key moments in the life of Sam Childers. Especially when Forster back-tracks from the truly tough questions, leaving it as an unresolved hanging thread (the Macchaivelian - does the aim justify the means?). This is however partially dealt with by Sam Childers himself during end credits, basically leaving the judgement to the audience as to whether the militant actions of the protagonist are a step to far. Nonetheless the mix of drama and action mostly work well, engaging emotionally, especially when thrust into the brutal everyday war-torn reality of LRA-controlled land. However the religious undertones disrupt the focus and flow of the otherwise well developed character drama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although the topic is serious and the plot is based on real events, there is something short... Shift of scenes is not smooth, some things let you shrug your shoulders, e.g. the selection of actors: Gerald Butler does not resemble Sam Childers (who is shorter and with belly), and most of actors (apart from Michael Shannon) are not catchy. Moreover, Butler has totally different image as actor and, in my opinion, he did not show versatility in depicting Childers' character.There are far more interesting and profound similar movies out there in the movie world, e.g. In a Better World (a Danish Academy Award winner). And as I see, most of critics and viewers have found the same - Machine Gun Preacher was a total flop in theaters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One hell of a fight!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film starts with the raid of a Sudanese village by the LRA (Lord's Resistance Army). A young boy watches his father being shot dead and is then forced to kill his mother by clubbing her over the head. We are then taken back a few years earlier, to the other side of the world, in the United States. Sam Childers is being released from prison to wreak his own havoc on the community and his family. The first thing he does is fly into a rage when his wife tells him that she's following Jesus and refuses to work as a stripper any more. He storms out of their trailer-park home and gets totally wasted on drugs and alcohol, slipping right back into his violent lifestyle. He gets what he wants the same way as the LRA, by raiding homes with a gun in his hand and hate in his heart.They say the power of prayer is powerful. No doubt the prayers of his wife, mother and daughter bring him to a point of desperation after he repeatedly stabs a hitchhiker, throws him out of the car into snow and leaves him for dead. Back at home, as he washes the blood from his hands, his wife walks in and sees his broken state as he pleads for her to help him. At that point, Sam's life is transformed. He cleans up his act, is baptised and sets up a building business to look after his family. Another major turning point in his life comes after he volunteers to go to Uganda to build homes for a Christian mission. He asks to be taken to Sudan to see first-hand the state of this war-torn country. The evil he experienced in the United States paled in comparison to what he faced in Sudan. The senseless annihilation of tribal races by the LRA did not only affect adults, but left children abandoned, tortured, sold into sex slavery, and murdered on a daily basis. These unimaginable horrors are enough to shake anyone to the core. Protecting these children became Sam's personal mission. He fights the only way he knows how ? with a gun in his hand.Marc Forster made every frame count. Every shot has meaning and there are layers that go beyond, such as a Christian fighting the LRA. There is nothing that is far-fetched. It's as real as you can get. We watch Sam fight his demons through his amazing journey. We watch him struggle to make sense of why God would allow these precious children to suffer. He loses focus of his mission as the balance of love and hate are tilted towards hate with the growing anger and frustration he feels in a seemingly unwinnable war. His anger becomes fuelled at everyone and he becomes a dangerous missile, alienating himself from his team of Freedom Fighters who no longer see him as a safe leader. It's the words of a little boy that brings him back into balance as he tells Sam that 'they can take everything away from you ? but they can't take your heart.' ? unless you let them. Gerard Butler gives an outstanding performance. He communicates powerfully so that we feel what he feels whether we agree with him or not. He has taken on a mission that has no ending. If he stops protecting these children, they will perish. And to add to the burden, more and more children are found hiding in the bush. There is no happily ever after tied in to this film, it continues, just as life does.Michelle Monaghan as Sam's wife, and Michael Shannon as Sam's lifelong friend also gave excellent performances. To Forster's credit, he was spot on with his casting and his vision for telling this story was perfection. It was a difficult film to watch as we don't want to believe such evil exists, but I highly recommend it. This story has the power to change lives.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hi, I just saw this movie right now and that was wonderful to me! I can offer to all people, 'cause maybe not believe God like me, but can believe one man can help for the others! If every 10th people can thinking like Sam Childers our world be changing! Right now, right here is the point of thinking about our life! What we have and why we have and what we need exactly! 'cause I see many many people have more than what they need it, but always want more and more. They can't thinking about the other people who need food, who need water, who need love who need family! This movie give to me absolutely CATHARSIS! But than I saw box office from this film and I'm very worry and angry! Because here is the real story what can be touch the people hearts and in US on the opening weekend just F..king 4 screens can be watched? This is really? How or why doesn't interesting this movie for Americans nation? Why this people doesn't care what happens and still happening until today in Sudan or anywhere in Africa! Than I feel just like all Americans don't want to help for other poor people for orphan children to get a food or to getting future! Absolutely simply how you can help: just buy a ticket to this move and I think Sam Childers getting donations from the gross of this film, or you can checking out contact with their account number and send couple of $ for help to them! That's it! Hey Americans! You have to open your eyes and see what happen over your stupid "Terrorist" war! (or maybe this side of the world not interesting 'cause there is no OIL or Diamond or Ivory? Or that's real what I have heard: Americans don't have sympathy with other nations! So if you want to see very wonderful film about love, helpfulness, sympathy, self-sacrifice, fight for children, spiritual liberation. Than you have to watch this movie! Gerard Butler acting is awesome, but Michelle Monaghan and Madeline Carol or Souleymane Sy Savane also very good and powerful. I liked the story, directing and pictures too which was very sensitive.Please don't be afraid, just go to one cinema or buy on DVD or buy their book and give chance to your soul and to the orphan children! 10/10</fullReview>

It is very hard for people to connect to the struggles that the children of Africa face because they are being killed by their own people and the war is so hostile that it scares most people that would help away. Not to mention black children have never been societies favorite children but this movie was phenomenal. Character building was awesome from beginning to end. The journey was realistic. I was able to sink my teeth into the story and get the meat out of it. I would like to have seen how the family came together to support the missionary more. I could connect with the character completely and I understood his battle. I will be donating monthly to this charity from now on. Thanks for the awareness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Machine Gun Preacher is a true story of a modern day hero who fights for the defenseless in Sudan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Machine Gun Preacher is the true story of a modern day hero with a troubled past, who was transformed by Jesus and then devoted his life to defending children who cannot defend themselves from the evil lurking to capture them.Check out my full review here: http://reelstorymovies.blogspot.com/2012/04/machine-gun-preacher.htmlI thoroughly enjoyed this film except for one thing: I have no idea how Hollywood can portray Christians as so old-fashioned that they would show them as stuck in some time from 30 years or more ago and haven't changed with old hymns from the turn of the century, a church built decades ago that hasn't been renovated since its construction. The preacher is also portrayed as a slick talking Southerner who lays guilt on the newcomers who have not yet come to know the Lord until a dozen people accept the Lord. Granted, Sam is a self-proclaimed "hillbilly from Pennsylvania" but there's no way that this is really how church is in backwoods Pennsylvania.Sam Childers' (Gerard Butler) conversion to Christ comes after a night of doing drugs and nearly killing a hitchhiker. At the lowest of lows, Childers surrenders his life to Jesus and radical transformation begins in a man's life marked by crime, drug abuse, and evil.In his new life as a born-again Christian, Sam listens to a missionary who comes to visit the church he attends. He tells of the work that is going on in Uganda, bordering the war-torn nation of Sudan. Sam's trip to Uganda forever changes his life. He sees the disparity of the nation and wants to go north to the Sudan. Here he finds terrible acts of evil committed against helpless children by a wicked terrorist group.The film pits Sam's character against the leader of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), Joseph Kony and the war atrocities he commits against the people of the Southern Sudan. Indignant at the conditions in the Sudan and the way the "invisible children" of Sudan are hunted and forced to live in constant fear of being apprehended in the night, Sam decides to make a difference in this worn-torn area.Shell-shocked by his short-term trip to Uganda and the Sudan, he realizes that he must return to be an advocate for those who cannot defend themselves and are terrorized by evil men who take advantage of them.Sam's first night home he receives a vision from God. God speaks to him to build a church. He describes the church as somewhere that "ain't gonna turn you away if you're a prostitute or a drug addict. A place for sinners just like me."His wife Lynn, the one who introduced him to Jesus thinks he's crazy, in which he replies, "yeah? a little bit." He is energized by the plans, the hopes, and the dreams that go into his vision. Even crazier, is the orphanage he's planning on building in the Sudan!Returning to the Sudan, Childers finds the piece of land he wants and construction begins immediately, despite the threat from the LRA and the conspicuous location in a remote part of South Sudan. When LRA soldiers take begin an assault on the village he is staying in, he evacuates all of the kids to go to the church, which is under construction.After fending off the LRA soldiers, he calls his wife, Lynn (Michelle Monaghan) dejected at the turn of events. She gives him a serious pep talk not to give up:Lynn: "It's a test, Sam." Sam: "I can't do it no more, Lynn. It's over." Lynn: "Those kids have had their whole lives burned to the ground and worse. How many of them do you see giving up? God gave you a purpose Sam Childers. Now, get off your butt, stop your crying, and build it again. You hear me?"As he defends the kids and fights against evil, his fame spreads as the "white preacher" even among the kids who have been recruited as warriors for the LRA. It's a powerful moment as his kindness and love to fight for the powerless pays off in the deliverance from evil, young kids forced to become soldiers in a battle they do not want to fight.The film is a poignant story of the power of the gospel. God is just. He is a father to the fatherless. He is a defender of the weak. He brings hope to the hopeless as he shows them what it means to be children. He teaches them baseball, builds a playground, and restores to them their childhoods. The story is not only about the children being rescued and delivered, but it's a story of Childers journey with God, his struggles against evil, and finding the true love that God has to offer.Psalm 68:5 describes God as "Father of the fatherless and protector of widows is God in his holy habitation."The fight Childers faces in his journey is described in Romans 12:21, "Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good."Some closing facts and figures from the film:Amnesty International estimates that Kony and the LRA are responsible for over 400,000 murders and 40,000 child abductions.These children are tortured, raped, sold into sex slavery, and forced to take part in ritualized killing by LRA commanders.To this day, Sam Childers fights for the children of Southern Sudan and Northern Uganda.As a side note, even though this could be considered a "Christian" film, it is not suitable for children. The film is rated R due to violence, language, drug use, and a scene of sexuality.My score ? Overall Rating: 7.5 out of 10 Plot: 7 out of 10 Character Development: 7 out of 10 Acting: 8 out of 10 Audio/Visuals: 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Man's Heart and the Violence Around Him</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Machine Gun Preacher is based on a true story of Sam Childers when he became a born-again Christian and goes to Sudan, Africa to save children from an evil rebel army. The film fulfills its promise for being a decent action drama. The drama is effective and compelling enough. The action is easily watchable. It's a solid film though the pacing is quick in the slow moments while the gunfights and explosions has more interest. Machine Gun Preacher is not as bad as most people said. The film may not be a masterpiece or an Oscar worthy gold but it's good enough as a biography of Sam Childers.It's quite an inspiring story about a bad man who became a hero. The film tells it well but it suffers with jumpy quick pacing. Like when Childers was planning to go to Africa, it immediately jumps to the scene when he's already there. It's not a bad thing but it feels kinda rushed. The drama is good at its best. There are plenty of emotional and heartbreaking moments. But most of the sad moments are the violent deaths of these children. The action scenes are watchable but sometimes it didn't quite fit to the drama. Like I said, the film tells the story well despite from its jumpy pace.This may not be Gerard Butler's acting nuance but his performance is pretty good. Everybody knows that he's better in holding guns but here it's always about portraying Sam Childers and he does it well. Michael Shannon, Michelle Monaghan, and Souleymane Sy Savane also did a good job to their roles.Nothing too much to say about the filmmaking. It's just decent. It's strange that a lot of people didn't liked it, but hey, it's their opinion. The film has its flaws. It's quite entertaining but what matters here the most is the story of one man who struggles with his beliefs and wanted to save lives. Though, the saddest moments relies too much to the violence and some of the action seems out of place. These things are necessary to the story but I think they embraces it too much. It's still a pretty good drama and it's best if you are here to see this man's story. It's flawed but heartwarming.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>497th Review: Powerful but way too melodramatic to really shine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MGP is a terrific plot, that is a good watch in some respects - the story is earnest, necessary, and vital - but the delivery is way too melodramatic - it's kind of preachy in a revival sense, and we get little or no real maturity - it opts instead for action and heightened emotions at every step.The plot of the true story of Sam Childers, the ex-biker criminal and,frankly, low-life, who finds Jesus and then Africa is gripping in so many ways - but with a full throttled approach at every step we're not really getting insights to the real man, we just the highlights, and that's pretty crude film- making.I wouldn't want to put people off watching this - it tries to highlight earnestly the horrific mess that Sudan is in - but it does so as an all out action film and that really doesn't do more than entertain - and that's the biggest fault of all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>God, Me and Africa</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Plot: An American biker criminal finds God which leads him to go to the Sudan and start an orphanage which, in the face of attacks by the LRA, he begins to defend with armed force.This is a biopic and, like so many biopics before, it can't make up its mind where the story is. Instead you get a "and then and then and..." narrative, like reading a Wikipedia article. So, is this a redemption story about a violent drug-abusing criminal who gets God and turns his life around? Is it a faith story about the trials and tribulations of a Christian trying to do what he thinks is God's work in Africa? Or is it a Heart of Darkness story about a Westerner who is almost destroyed by Africa? As a result of this indecision the story is repetitive and over-long. By the second half it seems to consist entirely of watching Gerard Butler travel to Africa and then back to America. There is an interesting spin on the usual Western "Save Africa" sort of film. Aware that such films usually lack popular appeal, this film tries to broaden its audience with lots of modern shaky-came combat and an appeal to fellow (especially in the US) Christians to help their brothers in Africa. It doesn't really work. Partly because the battles are repetitive (the same stunt involving an RPG and a jeep is used three times) but mostly because they are disconnected from most of the rest of the story. They make great trailer fodder, but little else. Whilst the Christian aspects never seem to quite work, partly, I suspect, because the Director isn't a theist. I did however appreciate the treatment of the American Midwesterners. As one of the few groups you're still allowed to hate (see "Red State"), it was nice to see them treated with a little respect rather than just as redneck, hillbilly, Bible-bashin' racists with guns.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uneven, lackadaisical, and shockingly emotionless.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What in God's name was director Marc Forster thinking when he took on Machine Gun Preacher? Sporting a talented leading man with chops and charm far beyond his most well known work, Gerard Butler can't work his way past a series of unfortunate hurdles Machine Gun Preacher lays out.Along with Butler, a memorable performance from Michael Shannon (unsurprisingly), and an inspirational story are wasted on an effort that has major issues in tone, plot, and overall message. Machine Gun Preacher is uneven, pedestrian, and shockingly emotionless, conspicuously so for a tale of a man who survives prison and drug abuse to open an orphanage in Africa. (There's no need for remorse here, just because it's about Africa doesn't mean it's a good flick, or that it needs to be seen.)Gerard Butler plays Sam Childers, a former drug dealer getting out of prison in the Machine Gun Preacher's opening scene. From the first line, where Butler groans a force expletive at the guard, it's obvious that Machine Gun Preacher has no idea what it's trying to say, nor how to execute it if it did.After returning home to his wife (Michelle Monaghan) and child (Madeline Carroll), Childers is ready to return to his old ways, since prison didn't change a thing about the man. His wife has found Jesus however, and it's time for Sam to do the same. Hence, after a brief few days of drug fueled insanity with his buddy Donnie (Michael Shannon), resulting in an attempted murder and loads of other good times, he hits rock bottom and gets down with Jesus too. Don't mistake the tone as satirical, Machine Gun Preacher plays out exactly as described.. It's as if every scene was attempted to be shot with as little effort as possible. It feels as if the audience is reading a biographic of Sam Childers with only straight facts, no sense of motivation of feeling in it. Machine Gun Preacher is dryer than an encyclopedia entry about Childers... Honestly, wikipedia tells a more interesting narrative, and it saves you two hours.Sam eventually finds God, gets his life together, and embarks on a mission to Africa. The reason for his interest was simple enough, overhearing a guest speaker at church mention the need for volunteers. Sam, whilst in Africa, doesn't just stick to his mission works, instead deciding to tour some of the most dangerous land in the world. He comes back a changed man, something prison never did to him.Becoming obsessed with Africa, Sam makes frequent trips back to set up an orphanage for children. All of this causes stress at home, conflicts with the life he lives in America, and begins to divide his attention so much that he neglects and loses focus on his family at home for his children abroad. His friend Donnie also cleaned up his act with God, and is watching over Sam's family while he's gone. The relationship between the two is by far the most interesting in the entire story, but Forster chooses to waste Shannon's glorious talent and keep him in the narrative as little as possible. It's a sub plot that eventually effects Sam's life in am major way, but it wasn't built up enough on-screen, and the audience just doesn't care past Michael Shannon's empathetic performance.Sounds like the makings of an emotional climax, right? Especially when Sam decides to take matters into his own hands and must defend the orphanage from attack, and Sam even becomes proactive, seeking out baddies to take down. The issue is, none of the action sequences are gripping, every shot is devoid of effort, and the end result is a flat interpretation of what was probably some juicy real life material. It's a damn shame to see Machine Gun Preacher come out the way it did.OverallShannon and Butler shine through the clouds, but it's a losing battle Despite a few moments of emotion or suspense, 90% of Machine Gun Preacher is a flat lined affair. It's a shame that Sam Childers didn't get an on-screen product that is cohesive in its message, pacing, and direction. His life is far more interesting than the product made about it, and the situation in Africa is once again told as a national geographic sociology report, rather than a personal struggle to motivate those to take action. Which, could have been the point of Machine Gun Preacher... it's hard to say.On the Side Michelle Monaghan is beyond typecast as this point. Once again, the role seems enticing, Oscar bait even, but in the hands of this director and screenplay, her character is reduced to a supportive yet tough device to further Sam's arc along. She isn't given the time she deserves, just as Shannon's character wasn't.</fullReview>

And what about this dude, leaving America to work in Africa? like American people don't need any help! what about Katrina and the fluid victims? aren't they christens too? or is it just Africa that is accepted to help?Again people, just get your facts strait before watching a movie and believing it!.</fullReview>

I would have like to see more depth to his way to finding God. There is also a lot of jumping in time, too fast to give the movie a solid ground. The overall score is OK but I expected more from this movie.

		<shortDescription>Right or Wrong? But good, for sure!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is based on the book 'Another Man's War' and describes the story of an American who takes up the gun, again, albeit for a different cause now. That too in a far off land, Uganda to save children from becoming victims of a bloody civil war.It also in a subtle way shows the swings of the 'hero' between his personal life and the chosen extended family; between reliance on God and carrying out His mission and his own determination to 'set things right'; between being a preacher and a mercenary... It is quite interesting to note the transformation of Sam Childers from a drug addict to a 'missionary' with a very definite and clear vision. Gerard Butler, who plays the lead role, does a great work and his characterisation is something that makes the movie realistic. An interesting angle to this movie is the recent outcry on social media against Kony and the 'wave' to get rid of him and save the children of Uganda and South Sudan.Besides these contemporary and actual facts, the movie raises several moral questions. The most challenging of them is perhaps the one posed directly by Sam Childers himself at the end of the movie. "... If your child or family member was abducted today, if a mad man came in or a terrorist came in, abducted your family member or your child, and if I said to you, 'I can bring your child home,' does it matter how I bring him home?"In another instance in the movie, a relief worker questions Sam Childers' 'rogue' means of carrying out his 'ministry', to which he replies that he does the same thing as she, but in a different way. Having heard all his arguments, she concludes, "Kony too had the same reasons when he began his reign of terror!"I suppose it is a thin line that one treads here. Killing a human being is always wrong, but does become permissible if that one wrong preserves and promotes the lives of several children?http://www.vcastilino.blogspot.in/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No, this isn't a exploitation film with a preacher with a machine gun going on a violent streak. This is a dramatic movie about a man that finds God and tries to do what is right by trying to save children in Sudan that is forced to become soldiers, sex workers, basically slaves that won't have no future. By any means possible, even by using force. The problem is that it goes in a very narrow direction and you just won't feel like you got to know Sam Childers who this movie is based on. Well mentally anyways and their is drama but it just seem to lack the engrossing emotion to drive this movie forward. The intentions are good but it just seemed lacking in the moving department. Yeah, there is a lot of bad things happening in this world but it didn't seem to delve enough into that issue to be inspiring. And it becomes so formulaic and narrow to the point it loses it flare, and I feel a bit guilty for typing that. But the first half of this movie is so dull to the point it becomes boring. It would have been more attention grabbing if it had more better development to how Sam Childers found Christ. But it doesn't and it felt like a man just going from point A to B. Which may work in the real world but watching a man get saved in the direction this movie goes just didn't seem to stand out all that much. It's nice to see Childers get saved but it just didn't have that engrossing feeling going for it. In fact the problem was that the movie just seemed to be a bit too forced at times. It does have it's key moments though and during the scenes where Childers preaches it does stand out and will probably make you think, even if you thought about the issue at hand. I hate to bash on a movie based on a man that got saved and tries to save innocent children, but this movie just wasn't all that effective even if the intentions are good. It does have it's sentimental values and does have to key scenes and dialogues with messages. It would have been better if it was a more effective film that pulls at the heartstrings of the audiences with more fleshed out and developed characters and direction.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie looked to me like one of those tear jerker movies made to elicit a emotional response for a cause. While I can appreciate some movies like that, a lot of them are really boring and fairly cliché. I mean have already see enough boring stuff about blood diamonds. No, I am not sending 10 cents a day to support kids overseas, and I don't get a special warm feeling all over when I hear Brad and Angelina have found another child to adopt to their growing village. This one may be one of those types of movies but is a really great one.It focuses on an ex-bad boy, ex-con, that finds religion, and it brings him to a cause in the Sudan, trying to help kids and the violence from the now Facebook infamous Kony.Gerard Butler was great in the lead roll. The only problem I had with him was the fact that it is real hard to disguise that accent, and sometimes he is just unable to do so. Now, I know what you're thinking, but before you jump to conclusions there are scenes of religion and preaching, but this is now trust in Jesus and tout the grace of god movie.There was some good action sequences that made this movie even more interesting. The story was good, it was just a great movie all around and a very pleasant surprise.Comments about my reviews, hate them, like them, any DVD's you would like to see reviewed?

		<fullReview>There haven't been too many movies about the crisis in Sudan. We have heard about George Clooney's efforts to bring Darfur, which is in Western Sudan, to public attention. This movie is about South Sudan and the efforts of a man to run an orphanage there. This movie didn't well at the box office. I guess genocide based movies aren't really that popular with movie goers.The movie is also about the man Sam Childers and his reform from criminal to preacher. The main character goes from one extreme to another and Gerard Butler gives an earnest intense performance. He is a bit too clean cut and dashing for white trash. Michelle Monaghan is sympathetic as his ex stripper wife. It actually quite inspiring how they turned their lives around.There are some graphic moments of the brutality in Africa. The main character seems like an action hero with all his fighting back against the rebels but I guess that's one of the strange things about this true story.Worth a watch.

That almost falls flat on its face with the first major (and obvious/foreseeable) character change at the beginning of the movie.But it's not Gerald Butlers fault (though I tried to imagine Michael Shannon in the lead and came to the conclusion he'd be a better suit), the movie just don't seem to hit the right notes, to really achieve what it aims for. The intentions are more than noble, of course. How much of the story really happened?

		<fullReview>When a movie title sounds as corny as "Machine Gun Preacher", you would expect it to be another mindless action movie. Thinking the same, I recently watched this on a lazy afternoon with no good expectations whatsoever. Not half way through the movie and I was highly mistaken for underestimating this film. Somewhere between what I expected and what I experienced, is a fierce narration of human rights abuse that the 'free world' has chosen to ignore, just because it can be ignored.Soon after his release from the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections, Sam Childers (Gerard Butler) goes on a drug and alcohol fuelled rampage of violence. After a vicious attack on a drifter, Sam attends a church service with his wife Lynn (Michelle Monaghan) and comes home a changed man. Call it an epiphany- from a hardened biker outlaw, Sam is suddenly a model Christian and a respectable member of society. This is when he volunteers as a missionary to Uganda. What he finds there changes his life and opens his eyes to the atrocities of war-torn Southern Sudan. Armed with the Bible in one hand and an assault rifle in the other, Sam becomes a legend overnight but soon finds himself reverting to his former self when faced with mounting pressure and dwindling resources in saving Sudanese children from the evil clutches of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA). As clichéd as it sounds, the context here ? about a criminal who finds God, then goes on a crusade against child abduction and human genocide ? seems contrived and done before. However, googling 'Sam Childers' will not only yield over two million links, it will throw light on one of the greatest atrocities involving under aged children. In fact, I highly recommend the 30 minute YouTube video titled "Invisible Children" as a mood setter, before watching "Machine Gun Preacher". If you are man enough to sit through this movie without as much as batting an eyelid, I dare you to not shed a tear as the end credits go up. Through monochromatic short takes, we are not only introduced to the real Sam Childers, we get to see the real victims; barely 10 year olds, whose crayon sketches are so shocking that it forms a stark contrast to their counterparts in other parts of the free world. Acclaimed director of "Monster's Ball" and "The Kite Runner", Marc Forster fuses Sam Childers' memoirs of Another Man's War with Jason Keller's screenplay into this remarkable, not-to-be-missed movie. Forster's forte is in making an action-drama with a heart wrenching aftertaste, a unique feat not many directors have achieved since Mel Gibson's "Braveheart" or even Kevin Macdonald's "Last King of Scotland". What makes this movie all the more compelling is that every bit of it is true. On the other hand, there isn't much the audience can do except wallow in pity. Or is there? If one man, just one man, can fight for the lives of innocent children thousands of miles from the comfort and safety of his home, then Forster's true success is in allowing the audience to judge for themselves, whether looking the other way is the humane thing to do. Childers' arch nemesis and leader of the LRA, Joseph Kony, is never really shown in the movie, and deservingly so. In comparison, googling 'Joseph Kony' will yield just about 300,000 links. Evidently, Forster has given prime importance to Childers' heroics and in the process, vindicates our hero's gung-ho yet controversial modus operandi. If you think about it, war machines are scattered all over the planet in the defense of "peace", so why shouldn't one man shoot to kill, even if it costs 100 bullets to save the life of one abducted child? Before I get to my 'must-see' conclusion, let me also add that Gerard Butler may not be half the man Sam Childers appears to be, but as the protagonist, Butler returns to form with the same intensity last seen in his portrayal as King Leonidas in "300". There is a connection between both these characters and Butler skillfully drives the message that freedom is a God given right and no human being should ever have to live or die in captivity. With lesser screen time but in easily her best role so far, Michelle Monaghan smolders as a brunette. Her captivating looks aside, Monaghan plays her part to perfection as Childers' wife and sole impetus when the going becomes relentlessly tough. Also worth mentioning are Michael Shannon as Childers' friend in Pennsylvania and Souleymane Savane as his trusted aid in Uganda. Now, did I mention this is a must-see movie? You can either choose to watch it or not. Considering the butterfly effect, if you do watch this movie, there is a slim possibility that another child under Childers' care will receive a morsel of food.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningAfter being released from prison, tough guy biker Sam Childers (Gerard Butler) returns to his trailer trash home set up to find his wife Lynn (Michelle Monaghan) has converted to Christianity and wants to try and guide him in a more moral light. Initially despondent to this, after a night of madness involving a crazed hitchhiker, Sam finds the light and tries to start a new life as a construction worker, only to hear about a building project in Sudan that is set to take him on a course to change his life forever. There, he becomes driven to build a shelter where children can get an education and live a safe life, without being rounded up as child soldiers. But, as he encounters opposition in Africa and the pressures at home he can't forget, he finds himself locked in a battle that will change him forever.Telling one of those 'unbelievably true life' stories, Machine Gun Preacher is interesting, as it makes reference to Joseph Kony, the African warlord who was the subject of an internet only film that went viral last year and was made at the risk of the lives of the film makers. He has also caused some protests outside embassies around the world, and seems to be one of the bigger players in the child soldiers scandal around the African continent. He's certainly one who'll be on Amnesty International's radar for a while, and maybe he'll be involved in other films in time, but MGP is a firm starting ground.Marc Forster is at the helm here, and after the pretty awful second Bond instalment Quantum of Solace, here he has a film that is not a vast improvement, but certainly a notch above what went before. The film is overlong, slovenly paced and not averse to the odd genre cliché of 'hell for leather bad guy finding redemption' films that have gone before. However, it's well made, passionate and interesting enough to warrant your time, with Gerard Butler adding another notch to his growing tugh guy repertoire, only this time with a little more cranial matter and bright sparks flying above. ***</fullReview>

Machine Gun Preacher raises the awareness of the ongoing genocide in Sudan, yet collectively, we as the world are doing nothing about it.By no means am I a "pro-reviewer", just a guy, stating the facts that this movie has changed my life. I'm a 21yr old South African, even though we aren't suffering like the Sudanese, people are suffering and losing the war against Aids. This here is my pledge to join that fight, to somehow attempt to be a Sam Childers. Great movie. Worthy of far more acclaim than it has received.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Medium good drama (which could've been more)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What I'll say for Machine Gun Preacher is that it turned out to be more compelling than I was led to believe. In fact, there were points in this film where I felt it could have been a major awards contender. The potential was there, but unfortunately, the execution of this story about Sam Childers (a biker who became a freedom fighter in Sudan) has a few too many faults.Even with a substantial running length of two hours and a bit, it feels like director Marc Forster is trying to tell more story than can be comfortably fitted into that body of time. The editing is rather hectic throughout, and the plotting feels rushed (especially in the first half). It leaves Machine Gun Preacher with too many story and character contrivances. For example; the speed at which Childers evolves from a disgruntled punk to a good Christian is almost unrealistic.I thought that Gerard Butler had a fairly epic screen presence. While this is arguably is strongest performance yet, I'm not quite sure that he was the best choice for this particular role. Sam Childers, as depicted by Butler, comes across as more of a well rounded action hero than a well rounded human being. I think part of the problem is that Butler tries a little too hard. He has too much adrenaline in him.If there is any reason to see Machine Gun Preacher, it would be to see Gerard Butler step up his game (even if he's still got much to learn). He is able to bring some drive to this drama. Machine Gun Preacher a film with noble intentions, and while it is usually engaging, it never feels deep enough to reach its full potential.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unorthodox emotional action drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>¨Why don't you fight the evil in this place your way, and let me fight it mine.¨ Marc Foster has directed some interesting movies in the past such as Kite Runner, Quantum of Solace, and Monster's Ball, but in my opinion his best film is Finding Neverland; a movie I absolutely fell in love with; so each time Foster makes a new film I am always looking forward to what he is going to do next. His latest film, Machine Gun Preacher, was a very emotional and entertaining film. It combined a lot of action with an emotional drama that worked really well thanks to the lead performance from Gerard Butler. I enjoy these types of inspirational movies where we have a lead character with several flaws who tries to change his life around and redeem himself from his past. I've witnessed several of these cases in real life where people have been able through their faith to do great and honorable things despite however dark their past might have been. I believe the world can be a better place if we can learn to let go of our past and live a life of love and service for those in need. Foster makes a very interesting film here and delivers this message in an unorthodox way. The main character isn't your ordinary converted Christian. This guy has a Bible in one hand, and a machine gun in the other. He is willing to protect those in need by risking his own life. At one point he becomes so immersed in this calling that he puts aside even his own family. Machine Gun Preacher is based on the real life of Sam Childers, a former gangster who becomes a Christian and who's life changes when he travels to Africa on a Mission trip. I found it to be a really emotional story, but at the same time very entertaining as well. Childers shares even the darkest side of him in this story.The story begins with Sam Childers (Gerard Butler) being released from prison after having spent there several months for dealing drugs. He is a redneck who loves to hang out with his biker friends in bars around Pennsylvania. He has a wife named Lynn (Michelle Monaghan) and a daughter named Paige. Lynn worked as a dancer at a strip club, but Sam discovers she hasn't been doing that anymore since he was in prison. Lynn doesn't smoke or drink either, she claims to have found God and has decided to turn her life around. Sam is not happy about this one bit and continues to live his normal life spending time doing drugs in bars with his best friend Donnie (Michael Shannon). One night his life changes when they pick up a homeless man who tries to steal from them and Sam ends up stabbing him several times. He realizes he has hit rock bottom and agrees to go to church one Sunday with Lynn. He ends up finding God and being baptized. Sam's life turns around completely as he abandons his life as a drug dealer and begins to make a living as a construction worker. A few months later his hometown is hit by a devastating tornado which works out really well for Sam because he has much more work to do now and ends up managing his own construction business. Sam hears about a mission group that is going to Africa and decides to go. His life changes when he arrives in Sudan and experiences the horrors of the civil war as young kids are being taken from their villages by the rebel army. He befriends one of the army officials named Deng (Souleymane Sy Savane) who tells him what is going on in the country. Sam decides to help out by building an orphanage for the kids and rescuing those who have been taken by the rebels, but he will realize just how big the fight really is as it takes up most of his time and resources.I already mentioned that Gerard Butler is good and believable in the lead role, but he also had a strong supporting cast to rely on. Michelle Monaghan was surprisingly good in last year's science fiction thriller Source Code, and here she delivers a strong dramatic role. She is very supportive of her husband and always has a word for him when he's discouraged. Michael Shannon received a lot of praise for his role in Take Shelter, and in this film he's good although he doesn't have much screen time. He's a great actor, and in the little scenes he was in he was good. I really want to speak about Souleymane Sy Savane, an actor I loved in the small film Goodbye Solo where he played a taxi cab driver who befriends an old man. Savane is really good and it was a real pleasure to see him in this film. I really felt emotional during some scenes which were difficult to watch or really opened my eyes as to the necessity that some of these people have. I might not agree with the way Childers does things, but I was touched by the passion he had for those kids. This is a very powerful and emotional film and I think Foster doesn't disappoint with the way he directed this movie.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As usual I watched this film without reading reviews of it so I wouldn't be influenced by them. As is often the case I was surprised to find that according to wikipedia the film was 'panned' by critics. I thought the story was very well told with lots of emotive moments and that all the cast put in great performances. It was watchable throughout with a very strong story-line. I find with critics that they jump on bandwagons with certain films which they hype, maybe this one didn't meet their criteria but I would recommend it to all, apart from maybe younger viewers as there are some graphic moments of violence (necessary for the plot). Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'MACHINE GUN PREACHER': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)An action biopic about an ex-drug dealing biker turned preacher named Sam Childers who made it his life crusade to combat the Lord's Resistance Army in Africa and save the orphans turned slaves held captive by them. The LRA and it's leader Joseph Kony were also the subject of the recent widely seen internet documentary 'KONY 2012', by filmmaker Jason Russell and the group Invisible Children Inc. This movie, although panned by critics (as was 'KONY 2012'), is effective in getting it's message across and the real Sam Childers has said that he was satisfied with it despite it having a "slight Hollywood spin to it". Childers shows screenings of an edited version of the movie to churches throughout the world in order to raise awareness and money for his campaign. If nothing else the movie is at least educational (to those who don't know much about the subject) as well as entertaining. Gerard Butler plays Childers and Michelle Monaghan co-stars as his wife Lynn. The movie opens with Childers being released from prison to find out that Lynn has 'found God' and given up her job as a stripper. He at first continues on with his alcoholic drug dealing biker ways, alongside his best friend Donnie (Michael Shannon), but after almost killing a man he finds God as well. He heads to East Africa in order to aid in the rebuilding of homes there that were ruined in the ongoing civil war. He then becomes driven with a passion for helping the orphans turned soldier slaves there and builds an orphanage for them. He joins forces with the Sudan People's Liberation Army and begins going on armed missions to save the children from their captors. The film was directed by Marc Forster (who's also directed such popular films as 'QUANTUM OF SOLACE', 'STRANGER THAN FICTION', 'MONSTER'S BALL' and 'FINDING NEVERLAND'). It was written by Jason Keller and based on Childers' memoir 'Another Man's War'. The movie is basically an action film with a heart that's also informative and a good current history lesson. Like 'KONY 2012' it does raise awareness to a very important issue and for that you have to give it credit. As far as it's action goes it's decent but there's nothing really too intense or thrilling going on (at least that's depicted that way to the viewer) and as far as it's emotional drama goes perhaps the characters could have been fleshed out a little more. It's definitely not a perfect film but for the most part it does what it sets out to do and is definitely worth a viewing.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKNLyy6lGng</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gritty portrayal of unimaginable brutality in the Sudan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"MACHINE GUN PREACHER" - A very powerful movie. My question is: how many modern American Preachers would actually teach in support of the efforts of San Childers and how many would condemn his methods? This R-rated film is a gritty and realistic portrayal of the unimaginable brutality still going on in the Sudan. My favorite aspect of this film was that it showed the deep flaws and humanity of Childers, his struggles, doubts and anger.My hat is off to Relativity Media and the other production companies for their courage in bringing this movie to us. Stars Gerard Butler, Michelle Monaghan, Kathy Baker, Michael Shannon, Madeline Carroll, Souleymane Sy Savane and the rest really put it on the line here!Too often "christian: films paint an unbelievable picture of the faith process and the way God works in this world. It would be very hard for me to imagine any American church showing this movie to its congregations, but church leaders themselves, at least, need to watch and deal with these realities. How do we reconcile God of the Old Testament with God in the New Testament? Did David have Bible study with Goliath? Was not King Saul commanded by God to wipe out nations? How does this "fit" with the Gospel of peace Jesus preached? We know "the Lord our God is one God" and that He is immutable (never-changing). The concept of Dispensations only shallowly addresses this topic. Preachers: let's hear it!- from Media Samurai -MK- with Gamma Pictures and xFaith.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad, but not very satisfactory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title "Machine Gun Preacher" evokes images of the exploitation cinema, and it can remind us of films such as Machete and Switchblade Sisters; but the reality is very different, because the film is a drama about the humanitarian efforts of a man who radically changed his life in order to help poor people. A film with that subject could have been intense and touching, but unfortunately, that didn't happen in Machine Gun Preacher, because it has a screenplay of a doubtful structure.I don't want to make inappropriate comparisons, but Machine Gun Preacher could be described as an unstable hybrid between Hotel Rwanda and Rambo. The screenplay runs a similar field to the one of both films, because besides of the elements of an action film, we also have a serious component which tries to reveal the atrocities of a war without any sense at the same time it denounces the apathy of the international community, which prefers not to intervene because there isn't any tangible benefit in the solution of the conflict. And if we add a religious subject to all that, the final result is a film which tries to be too many things at the same time, losing the focus and causing conflicts in its narrative which distract us from the main point, or even sacrifice the humanitarian subject in order to focus on the main character's redemption. Having said that, it's difficult to question the way in which a film based on a true story was handled; and we also know that the "personal redemption" formula is one of Hollywood's favorite ones, so I understand its use as a "hook" in order to make this film about sad realities and cruel events more accessible. However, I feel that its divergent aspects should have been better balanced, in order to complement themselves with each other instead of hindering with each other.On the positive side, I can mention the performances. Gerard Butler makes his character's evolution credible, while Michelle Monaghan and Michael Shannon complement him well with their solid performances. And I also appreciated the fact that director Marc Forster portrays the atrocities on a raw way, without softening them in order to make a more commercial movie.So, in conclusion, I didn't dislike Machine Gun Preacher, and I consider it worthy of a slight recommendation. However, I didn't find it very satisfactory, because I found it weakly structured and quite manipulative.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful, Raw and Provoking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the trailer, I immediately drew this film on my "to watch" list. After seeing Machine Gun Preacher, it was nothing I was expecting. It was better.The story is centralized around Sam Childers, a man with a heavy criminal past. When he hits rock bottom, he finds God and with the love of his wife, daughter and mother and manages to turn things around. Inspired by a preacher working in Sudan, Sam decides to go to Africa and help those in need.From the looks of it, Machine Gun Preacher would seem like a perfect feel-good film, starring a man with a criminal past, who almost over night turns things around and goes to Africa to help orphans. It isn't. Director Marc Forster has done a fantastic job building up the character of Sam Childers (not to mention Gerard Butler who plays the man). He is a complicated man, conflicted with the urge and will to do good but with the means of evil, with the responsibility of his wife and daughter and with the orphans in Africa.I said in the title that the movie was provoking. I believe that this is a movie that is asking all the right questions; Where do we draw the line? Where do the means justify the ends? There is no easy answer, maybe none at all. But I feel that this is an important question and I am happy the Marc has once again bought is back to our movie screens.The only critic that I feel a need to raise is that it is way to subjective. We are made to believe that the enemy rebels, the LRA, are the ultimate evil force on earth, killing hundreds of thousands. I'm not questioning whether this is true or not. I simply don't think evil is that simple, that each conflict can be divided into a good side and an evil side. It would be naive to think that cruelty haven't been done on both sides.At last, I would like to leave with a quote from Sam Childers: If a terrorist came into your home and abducted one of your family members and I told you I could bring that member home; Does it matter how I do it?</fullReview>

It does not have special effects and graphics that you will want to enjoy in 3D on a weekend with a chilled glass of beer on your side. Its a movie which you need to see to see through it.

		<fullReview>This was better than I anticipated and a thought-provoking story.During the ending credits, the real "Sam Childers" is seen asks us - the audience - (paraphrasing) "If a family members of your would be kidnapped by killers and/or terrorists and I told you I could get them back, would it matter how I do it?" For about everyone, including non-violent people, the answer would be "no." I was pleased to see a film expose the genocide that has been going on for years now in Sudan, something most of the world doesn't seem to care much about. The Muslims up north slaughtering the Christians in the south should be of concern as it is to the main character of this story. Does he take it too far? When you're talking about saving hundreds/thousands of children's lives, I don't think so."Sam Childers" is a complex person and an interesting one to watch. Kudos to Gerard Butler for a memorable performance. He is a character you won't forget.Don't be fooled by the cheesy title - this is a serious, pretty darned good film with plenty of food for thought. Warning: this has plenty of Christian themes but it's not a movie for Christians.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gerard Butler does it again and this time with one of the most meaningful messages in a movie that has ever been made. This by far is one of the most inspirational movies of the century if not the millennium. Machine Gun Preacher shows that no matter what you have done or where you come from caring can go a long way. Gerard Butler and the actor who plays the Sudanian child searching for his brother are the two monumental characters of this movie. After watching this I will start donating to Sam Childers operation in Sudan. (Slight Spoiler) This quote from the Sudanian child, "If always have to be full of hate, then they have won. you must not let then take our hearts." This quote sets a certain tone that is need to spark a movement of people who are trying to make the world a better place but are facing adversity. This movie is motivational, emotional, and encouraging. It also shows the magnitude of the help that is needed. This movie deserves an Oscar as well as Gerard Butler and the actor who plays the Sudanian child.</fullReview>

His drug addiction miraculously cured. Then he goes on to kill Africans who enslave children--WHO HAPPEN TO BE Christian ZEALOTS THEMSELVES.So the whole plot of the movie is ironic because Christians are the reason the Lord's Resistance Army exists. People who don't understand philosophy, can easily find this movie inspiring because they think that religion is necessary to do good, and that's just deceptiveness of the filmmakers here.Childer's could have been a Jew, or a Buddhist monk, the religion does not matter---yet the film tries to make it seem like Christianity is the only way.No one seems to be aware that belief-without-evidence is the very source of the problem with Africa. And using belief-without-evidence in America to inspire oneself to fight others who have belief-without-evidence is the strangest most ridiculous movie plot ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pennsylvanian biker Sam Childers (Gerard Butler) gets out of prison to find his wife Lynn (Michelle Monaghan) as a born again Christian. She had quit stripping and drugs. Sam is angry and refuses to join until one harrowing night. He joins her church. After a close call with a tornado, he starts his own construction company. He goes to Uganda to do missionary work and discovers a horrific war in South Sudan. Joseph Kony is the ruthless leader of the Lord's Resistance Army. Sam sets up a missionary in the war zone saving children from death, slavers, and conscription.I really like Sam's journey to find religion. It's a very standard Christian film story but it's done very well. The second half has him going back and forth between Africa and America. It does disrupt the flow of the story. There are bits of compelling scenes but the disjointed nature does take its toll. The final ending is not climatic enough. The entire second half needs a certain literary license to configure a more compelling flow. The tension isn't built up properly. Overall, I like Gerard Butler, the standard formula of the first half, and bits of the second half.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There seems to be more and more true story biopics coming these days and machine gun preacher is another one. The premise of this film sees a gang member/turned Christian attempt to rescue a bunch of kids in the Sudan. I like Gerard butler, he has been in good movies like 300 and bad movies like the bounty hunter. This is probably the best performance he has ever given. His character is so motivated and has so much belief in what he is doing that you really root for him and want him to succeed. But there was also allot of damage to his character as he unravels during the film and butler has some really fantastic power scenes. Michelle Monahan is pretty good in the movie as his wife. She was a pretty strong character I just wished she did more and the same could be said about Michael Shannon's character. I felt the supporting performances were fine but this was butlers movie. The story was really good as you see the lengths that this one man goes to do what he thinks is right. You see him starting to unravel and I think the film depicts him and his character in a very good way. He is a flawed hero and you see that but you want to like his character and get behind him. The script was okay with some really good dramatic dialogue. I just felt the dialogue between him and his family wasn't that good and there was absolutely no humour in this film. The style was pretty good with showing some brutal stuff but I kind of wish it had gone a bit grittier with the whole situation and showed us even more. Overall this was a much better film then I expected and I liked it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>bizarre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title and poster make it look like an exploitation flick, and the film honestly feels like one at times. I'm just not sure what it intended to exploit. Sam Childers (Gerald Butler) is an ex- convict who turns around his life, develops an obsession over Jesus and, for some reason, orphaned African kids. So he becomes a missionary and preacher in Africa, basically abandoning his wife and daughter at home. He builds a school where orphans can live, but there are bad people who don't like what he's doing. He must defend the orphans. Hence the machine gun. I find this film a bit sleazy. It's not awful, just kind of unpleasant. I feel sorry for Childers family that he leaves behind. The orphans aren't given much personality so that it's impossible to deeply care about them. It's sad when we see them die, but not because we are emotionally invested in them. Shoot a dog on screen and it will make people unhappy. It's manipulative. That having been said, there are some powerful scenes. Gerald Butler is compelling in his way.Strangely enough, this movie reminds me of "American Sniper", which I didn't care for much either. Both films are glaringly from the American perspective, and both have two distinct settings that they switch back and forth during their runtime: "at home" and "in the foreign land", thus the pacing in both films is very uneven. Neither film provides any good reason for their leading mans' motivations. And Gerald Butler and Bradley Cooper are practically the same character. Most importantly, both the films are about a mans obsession with a faraway crisis, and descent into madness. They are also both based on true stories. To be sure, Machine Gun Preacher is an oddity, as I can't imagine what demographic it intends on catering to. It seems to be a PG-13 film pushed to an R rating (usually it's the other way around). People looking for an action filled film won't find it here, but neither will they discover an intelligent drama. Part of me wants to recommend this film, just because of how weird it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Machine Gun Preacher is a good, but very flawed movie. It is fairly accurate, with less historical inaccuracies than you'll find in most Hollywood movies. Most importantly, it accurately shows the horror of violence, and shows how even Sam Childers has his morality thrown off by the violence that he engages in.The movie does use a lot of stereotypes and doesn't represent the wide spectrum of people and places. It primarily takes place in two locations - rural western Pennsylvania and rural Africa in the Northern Uganda/Southern Sudan regions. Its depictions of these areas are accurate, but if you take them to be representative of all Americans, of all Christians, of all areas of Sudan and Uganda, etc. then it is inaccurate. Not all areas of America are like western Pennsylvania, but this was a reasonably accurate depiction of western Pennsylvania. Not all Christians are the way that they are portrayed in this film, but this film did accurately represent the specific slice of Christians that it intended to. Not all of Uganda and Sudan are countryside with small villages and old cars. The urban areas of these countries are far more advanced than the countryside. Yet this movie didn't take place in the urban areas. An American could easily be misled by this movie into having an inaccurate view of what Uganda and Sudan are like because of the lack of any urban scenes in Africa, or scenes showing how Africa isn't all just small villages in the desert. Similarly, anyone that doesn't actually know Christians could be misled by this movie into having an inaccurate view of what Christians are like because of its portrayal of Christians as those who get baptized on a whim and get a messiah complex when faced with evil.This movie isn't for those who are trying to learn history or culture. I sincerely hope that anyone watching this movie realizes that it portrays a small slice of the cultures, and that it is not representative of the entire cultures. However, I know how such a huge portion of moviegoers are ignorant of history and culture, and that they'll become even more ignorant and uninformed because of this movie. This movie isn't suited for the uninformed audience. If the moviegoer doesn't know about Joseph Kony and the LRA before watching this movie, I shudder at what this will do to them. I'll repeat myself because this is so important: this movie is not for those who are ignorant or history and culture.As a Christian pacifist, I was very disturbed by the way that Christians were portrayed in this film, but I also understand American Christian culture well enough to know that this depiction was an accurate depiction of the dominant Christian culture in white rural America in the western Pennsylvania region. The fault lies not with the director, but with the Christians of this country. I am very grateful that the director showed how Sam Childers' trust in violence caused him to neglect his family, to lose the trust of his men in Africa, and to start down the same path that Joseph Kony took. This was best represented by the scene where Sam Childers gave a sermon where he claimed that God doesn't want sheep, he wants wolves. This is an abomination, this is a heresy, and this is offensive to God. Yet this is not an inaccurate way to describe American Christian culture. And no Christians stood up to him and shared the gospel with him when he was very visibly living a heretical life, trusting in violence. And this is also an accurate account of how Christians in our country act. The movie did have minor inaccuracies, such as its oversimplification of the political conflict in southern Sudan (the stereotypical violent Muslims against non-violent Christians propaganda), and in its depiction of Lynn Childers as a young beautiful wife (Hollywood almost always makes the hero characters much more attractive than they actually are, even in movies like a Beautiful Mind or The Imitation Game). But these did not change the fact that the general tone of the movie is a reasonably honest depiction of the various subjects in the movie. I sincerely hope that any moviegoer realizes that this is a fictionalized account, and that they seek truth from news organizations and factual accounts, rather than from a Hollywood action/drama movie. I'm realistic (and cynical) enough to know that in most situations, moviegoers will not take this extra step to find out the actual truth.This was a good movie, but I plead with all those who watch it to seek out the truth. This was an honest enough depiction of the horrors of war to not offend a pacifist like me, and to be a movie that I enjoyed. But this movie is a Hollywood version of the truth, it is not the actual truth. Please let this movie inspire you to seek out the truth, and to not just be content with the story this movie presents.</fullReview>

The beginning things moved well but halfway through nothing new happens, it turns into a pointless drama then ends. In my opinion this movie should have stuck to one genre and i think it would have done better. Machine gun preacher starts edgy and brutally realistic, turns to a stand still drama and ends like a documentary. Some of the dialog and scenes are aggressive and not politically correct but makes no statement just like it was thrown into the movie for realism and nothing else. There are lots of scenes where i get the feeling that certain groups of people will take offense to but does nothing with it. Take American History X for example they pushed obvious boundaries but made statements that made it not as offensive and balanced at the very end.

		<shortDescription>A moving commentary on subtle moral violations and travesty in the world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This poignant masterpiece achieved exactly what it intended to do by leaving us emotionally distressed by injustice across the world and being a catalyst for action. Most of the critics of this film are disappointed by the religious themes and reflect on the film poorly because of it. Firstly, the religious themes was not the focus of the film, secondly the director of this film does not make "Christian movies" as he directed Quantum of Solace and World War Z, thirdly, provided this was a Christian film, it did not negatively affect the acting, cinematography or writing in this film. Unfortunately, the number of "F" words in the film was not even enough to prove to ignorant critics that this is a brilliant film regardless of ideology about a Christian man who struggled with morality and the pain of the universe. This film asks some very important questions and delivers controversial answers. Above all, it is a story of a man and not a Christian propagandist film. There was no resolution to this film, but that is only because there has been no resolution for Sam Childers and the Children of Uganda and Sudan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good story, acceptable translation to the screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If ever there were a true story ripe for cinematic adaptation, this is the one. MACHINE GUN PREACHER tells the true-life story of Sam Childers, a biker turned born-again Christian who travelled to Africa to set up a church, save the children and kill a whole bunch of rebel terrorists in the process.It's a film you have to watch with a certain amount of tongue-in-cheek - after all, this is another spin on Hollywood's favoured 'white saviour' sub-genre - but the narrative is engaging enough for it to work as a movie. There are also strengths in the casting of Gerard Butler as the volatile, foul-mouthed Christian hero, while the supporting cast and African backdrop work well together.The only downside is that they picked Marc Forster to direct, and as anyone who's seen QUANTUM OF SOLACE will tell you, this guy's not terribly skilled behind the camera. Thus his action sequences are acceptable rather than spectacular, and when it's real people being killed it's kind of difficult to cheer the hero on. An interesting film then, but not exactly a favourite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tale of a blood-soaked missionary!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When ex-biker-gang member Sam Childers (Butler) makes the life-changing decision to go to East Africa to help repair homes destroyed by civil war, he is outraged by the unspeakable horrors faced by the region's vulnerable populace, especially the children. Ignoring the warnings of more experienced aide workers, Sam breaks ground for an orphanage where it's most needed-in the middle of territory controlled by the brutal Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), a renegade militia that forces youngsters to become soldiers before they even reach their teens. But for Sam, it is not enough to shelter the LRA's intended victims. Determined to save as many as possible, he leads armed missions deep into enemy territory to retrieve kidnapped children, restoring peace to their lives-and eventually his own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Machine Gun Preacher" is an excellent story of redemption.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The true story of violent drug dealer Sam Childers is documented in an original and stylish way with a gritty and soulful performance by the perfectly casted Gerard Butler. Childers once being a violent drug dealer wanted something more in life and wanted to feel the ultimate redemption experience. Instead of hurting other gangs and doing drugs, he went off to Sudan to help the sick and poor and do something good in his life. However, Sudan being a rebel war zone, Sam was in for a rough experience causing him to use violence on the evil rebels in order to help innocent civilians. This interesting true story is documented in a form in which we see all aspects of Sam's adventure We get a perfectly timed situation of his life before he changed and how his bad actions shaped his life in prison. Then we see his transformation that isn't rushed or fake. He doesn't go to Africa right away or anything, instead we see some powerful adjustment. When we see Sam in Africa, we get a great representation of all aspects of his journey there. The orphanage he built, the children he meets, the protection required in order to save people, and many different emotions. Director Marc Foster gives a great visual appeal to making this film by using realistic settings and actors and a genius outline of this mans incredible journey. Not an overdoes of action sequences or making the sad scenes involving rebels like a "Rambo' film at all. Instead you get powerful war scenes that feel like something out of "Saving Private Ryan." This ultimate adventure is a story of redemption and the hard decisions faced when dealing with morality and saving others. Overcoming guilt is another theme i found extremely relevant, because most films involving redemption ignore the fact that the people probably feel horrible about themselves! This film has all the aspects of an action film with a powerful message and is the ultimate tale of redemption.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Im not one who is a religious type but I still got touched by this film. A spiraling out of control drug addict decides to find god and then go over to Sudan to help with all the orphans talk about a transition. And the even more shocking part is that this a true story. At certain parts I wanted to break into tears and at others rejoice with happiness but I have to say this is one of my favorite films of 2011. I recommend this movie to many people and if your one of the people who doesn't care for it because of your strong disbelief in god I even recommend it to you because even I don't fully believe in god and I was still touched by this beautiful film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gerard Butler's character is so gritty in this film. His violent temper is capable of serving as a fuel source, which is awesome to watch.I found this film particularly touching because I've also been very touched by the central issues this film touches. It seems like some of the issues faced by our brothers and sisters in foreign countries aren't real to us, that they are not ours to worry about. What is the best course of action? Is there a right answer? Are our efforts for improvement, or to help the suffering just swallowed by the machine of violence mankind is capable of? If that is true, what incentive is there for us to try? If nothing else, I find the reason to try is so I can say, "I'm one of the ones who did." at the end of my life.I found myself thinking what would I do. Many scenes seem to reach through the screen to the viewer and almost call for action.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Machine Gun Preacher was a fantastic movie with a plot that almost felt like a modern day version of Schindler's List. Now don't get me wrong. In no way am I saying that this film was anywhere near that level. I'm just saying that some of the emotions were similar due to the similarly tragic nature of the true stories they tell. Gerard Butler leads a cast that provide great acting throughout the film and deliver on those emotions. The plot develops well and the reality of the story adds an additional layer of depth. The action sequences were a little weak and unfortunately the movie leans a little too heavily on those scenes. The constant varying perspectives makes you think and the drama is effective. I think the ending felt a bit rushed and the film lacked that climactic emotional sequence that sticks with you but overall, I think most people would really enjoy this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Buy it or rent it - but SEE it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My highest rating ever - partially to compensate for the undeservedly low ratings assigned by those who hate Gerard. This movie is nearer an 8 than the 6.8 average it boasts on IMDb. The fact that it is fairly close to the true life story of the nominal protagonist only magnifies the impact; and considering that Gerard allegedly backed the film with most of his salary for the role is also quite a powerful endorsement. So: buy it or rent it - just find a way to SEE it (before you write a disparaging review, please.) Be as nasty as you please AFTER you see the movie - including pointing out the flawed presentation of the premise, and the inconsistency of the character of that protagonist - I will not argue. But if you can honestly tell us which movies you liked better in the past 3 years - I would like to know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth Watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is based on the true story of Sam Childers, a criminal thug who realizes he needs to change and becomes a Christian with the help of his family. He later becomes a preacher and decides to dedicate his life to protecting the children in southern Sudan and northern Uganda. If you watch the closing credits, you can see some pictures/video of him. And he definitely looks like someone you don't want to mess with.This is one of those movies like Hotel Rwanda and Attack on Darfur that opens your eyes towards some of the horrible things that are happening in this world that most people aren't even aware of. In this case, its the abuse of children by the "Lord's Liberation Army" led by Joseph Kony in Sudan/Uganda. Young boys are taken and trained to be soldiers and kill.The movie starts off slowly but advances forward in time by weeks or months or years several times. My only complaint about this movie is that it doesn't really tell you how much time has passed. And the characters don't seem to age in appearance (except for Sam's daughter).It might be a little slow at the beginning, but the movie is worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do The Ends Justify The Means?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed this movie, and thought it provided a very compelling look at the situation in South Sudan, and in particular at the atrocities committed by the so-called "Lord's Resistance Army" led by Joseph Kony. It also raises the always troubling question of whether the ends justify the means, and in the end I was left wondering whether I thought Sam Childers (the title character) was a good guy or a bad guy? Did I admire him or not? The troubling question he raises at the end of the movie (which was basically, "if your child was kidnapped and I told you I could get him or her back, would you care how I did it?") is a haunting one.The movie is Childers' story, and he does have an interesting life, which - for the most part - the movie seems to portray fairly accurately. He was a drug addict and a drug dealer, loosely involved with some outlaw biker activity who suddenly is converted to Christianity. The very overt religious themes in this movie surprised me, to be honest. I was expecting far more about South Sudan, and instead we got a lot about Childers' own unique take on spirituality (along with a good primer on South Sudan.) Childers eventually feels called to travel to Uganda and South Sudan on a personal mission trip to help orphans, and while there starts to learn of the LRA. He becomes increasingly fanatical in his opposition to the LRA and in his goal of freeing children from them.That's all well and good. Childers, to me, also represented the danger of religious extremism. He becomes more and more extreme as time goes on; basically he takes a "my way or the highway approach," he becomes committed to the mission at the expense of his relationship with his own family back home, he's dismissive of those who don't share the same passion, and he adopts increasingly violent means (thus, the nickname "Machine Gun Preacher") to accomplish his ends. At one point, he's told by one of his associates that he's becoming just like Kony.That's the troubling aspect of the story. At what point does one go from being an ardent supporter of a cause to being a dangerous extremist? I can't answer that question based on this movie and what I learned of Childers. I can't question his sincerity and devotion to his cause, and I certainly can't claim that it's not a good cause. But - back to that troubling question - do the ends justify the means? This leaves me at least scratching my head trying to figure that out.Gerard Butler plays Childers in this. I'm not a huge fan of Gerard Butler, but I have to say that he seemed perfect in this role. He seemed to me to capture Childers perfectly.This is a very good and thought-provoking movie that offers a pretty good ethical dilemma that the viewer is left to work through on his or her own.

		<shortDescription>Action Movie with Heart!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Throughout this movie you see how the main character struggles with drugs and the past he his consumed by from his bike ganging days. However, somewhere along the line the character finds God and has a vision. The vision he has tells him to go to Africa to help the people in need. Throughout the movie you see Sam confront the difficulties in his path from money to the LRA, an army known for harming the innocent and forcing young boys to fight their war. Sam does succeed in many of his struggles only to find that he has lost precious things back at home. From beginning to end you see the transformation of a convict to a man lost in the word of God. In this movie religion and guns are intertwined to depict the book Another Man's War; which is based off of its writer's life, Sam Childers. In the movie Sam Childers is released from jail after doing his time. Childers being the roughed up biker he is goes back to drinking and drugs soon after he is released. After getting sick of doing drugs Childers decides to go to church with his family where he "finds God". From there you see Childers straighten up and become a better person. Childers then has a vision and believes it is his duty to create a church and to help the children in Africa. Throughout the rest of the movie Childers's conflicts are introduced and you see how Sam deals with them. From economical to family and friends; Sam deals with all these things in his is own driven and powerful state of mind. The Machine Gun Preacher has a lot of heart but is surrounded by action. From realistic shootouts to rocket propelled grenade explosions. You get to see Childers kill a LRA soldier only to find out that Childers killed a child; which does internally conflict him. Closer to the beginning of the movie you even get to see a woman with her lips torn; which were torn by LRA soldiers for not answering their questions.Machine Gun Preacher is a movie to see if you want a small glimpse of what's truly happening in other places of the world. The movie does a great job of creating a film that has drama, action, and truth all intertwined into 129 minutes. This movie does have the power to humble a few people and even give them a sense of duty to help the children depicted in this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Inspiring,intense,heart-wrenching, phenomenal, all adjectives which describe this film. Initially,I wanted to see this movie because of Gerard Butler, because he happens to be among my list of favorites,particularly in his more action/drama roles(300, Law Abiding Citizen) and I just happened to be so lucky to stumble across this movie on Netflix.This movie stirred up the same emotions I had while watching 'Tears of the Sun'a film that is of similar nature. Humanity and compassion are huge themes in this movie and we experience a realistic depiction of the conflict and war zone in Sudan. What makes this movie more inspiring, is that it is based on the true story of Sam Childers.Gerard Butler does an amazing job in this role as Childers,giving a solid performance as a man who is both conflicted and compassionate. And I could not forget to mention Michelle Monaghan as his wife,who does a great job as well.This movie stuck with me after I watched it,definitely makes you think, and in my eyes, that makes it a success.I highly recommend this movie, just be prepared because this film is sure to evoke strong emotions.10 stars for this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this movie, and I had know expectations going into it. From the title alone I thought it was going to be a pretty cheesy B movie. Before watching the movie I had never had heard of Machine Gun Preacher. I thought this movie did an incredible job of doing all that it intended to do, which was dramatize the documentary of Sam Childers life. The way the movie depicts the changes in Sam's attitude are great. The movie takes place over roughly a decade, because of that Sam goes through quite a bit. The movie did an awesome job at subtly showing you the reason for all of Sam's changes in attitude which I loved. Lastly being a Christian myself I thought it did a good job at presenting Christianity in a way that does not get in your face (not-christian critics agree) nor does the movie make itself pro or against Christianity. It presents to you the life of Sam Childer in a way however that you may see the effects of every action he makes and thing he encounters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life Changing Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If this were a tale some writer dreamt up, it would be an thought provoking movie; a movie that might make you want to think about your priorities in life. But this story is based on the real life of Sam Childers who confronts one of the biggest evils in our modern world: the LRA. This man inspires me to give everything for those people in the world who have nothing. I spent a week in Uganda &amp; I know how Sam must have felt when he stepped off the plane back into the US, back into our ignorantly blissful &amp; over indulgent luxurious lifestyle. How can we be OK pursuing more wealth &amp; comfort when there are children (right now) being kidnapped in tortured in Sudan &amp; Uganda?? When Sam goes back into his life in the US &amp; tries to raise a small bit of money, I can totally feel his rage when people, blinded by their comfortable materialistic lives, turn him down. I love this this story because it shows the power of Jesus to change a life from a murderous junkie to someone who fights for the life &amp; well being of thousands of children in Africa! I love that Sam is so focused on his goals &amp; doesn't listen to naysayers. I know Hollywood has to stay in the middle on religious matters so they don't alienate viewers &amp; so they are a little ambiguous showing how much of Sam's journey was guided by the Holy Spirit moving in his life (that's really the only set back in this movie). I highly recommend Machine Gun Preacher!!</fullReview>

This Film title hides a very different story, a story about a Gang Biker from the wrong side of the tracks... Sam Childer... boy! this is a story... A TRUE Story.Sam is released from prison, he returns home to his trailer to find his wife and little girl have found god. For awhile he's mad and drops straight back into his former wild ways. But one day everything changes...i mean ..hmm changes is an understatement..i'm not going to spoil this movie for you, However, this bad ass ends up building his own church &amp; then heads to Africa in Sudan. There,in the war torn African outback, he builds an orphanage. This is a story of two worlds,two contrasting countries, Sam's story and this film show them for what they are and put you right back to where humility grows and materialism becomes shameful. Its a film that will make you think,it'll make you consider god, his concept and why he needs to exist...be it in your head your heart or your soul. It'll make you cry...tears of sadness and tears of joy. When and if you watch this... remember.. this is a true story...clearly not exaggerated, if anything played down...An amazing story..truly amazing. This film should and will bring compassion into your life if you haven't found it.10/10 A Must See Movie! - Don't Let The Title Deceive You.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the successful "Quantum of Solace", a disrupt of the 007 concept, with a more believable James Bond, Marc Foster returns to explore the humanitarian side of life, previously done in movies such as "Finding Neverland" or even "The Kite Runner", with this tale about moral death and moral resurrection. Gerard Butler delivers quite possibly, the performance of his career as the unstoppably ferocious but still human, reborn and tender Sam Childers. The directing is confident, addicting, violent, realistic and hauntingly shocking. It somewhat reminds us, even with less action, Edward Zwick's vertiginous "Blood Diamond". The outcome is a compelling life lesson, incredibly warm, touching, ending in a way that suggests something uncompleted: Sam Childer's accomplishments are a beginning of change. There's still a lot of work to do, certainly. However, there's room for hope.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Blessed are the pure of heart, for they shall see God." The whole movie can be rounded off in this simple truth. The protagonist played by Butler is good but alas it could have been better. The character could have been given more depth but has been let off loosely from time to time. There are times when the scenes are intense but end just a wee bit abruptly and the tempo changes. It would have been great if there was more of human to human interaction rather than Ramboic gun fights that seem to be happening at the drop of a hat. The movie would not have lost anything, had the scenes with trucks turning upside down with massive explosions been deleted. Great story but even greater opportunity lost to portray the suffering of our fellow humans. All in all its a good movie and worth a watch at-least once. If you could just glaze over or attend to your cellphone during the gun fights you should do fine. Last but not least do not miss out on the closing credits at the end, you will get a glimpse of the real life crusader. I cannot forget that face ever again, its a Lion amongst us Humans.

		<fullReview>I didn't know what to think of this when I first heard about it. It is not your regular Gerard Butler fair. When I read that this was about a real guy, I became interested.But this film is not the usual evangelical rubbish put out by TBN or other so called X-tian entertainment maker, else I would not have even seen it. Marc Forster of 007's Quantum of Solace directed this BRUTALLY Honest Movie. I've seen too many stories about great people who have converted or had a unique ministry, totally ruined by evangelical filmmakers.Sam's story is too good of a real-life story not to have a good, realistic film made from it. The scenes depicting Sam Childress' origins as a Biker and Junkie and badass are as realistic as the scenes in a church with his wife Lynn played by Michelle Monaghan. Even Sam's "conversion" scene? I know all about that, the preacher is inviting you up, and you want to go up, but you just can't... Until finally, you just do it. I never envisioned myself doing that, I could not envision Gerard Butler's character doing it either. But point in fact, I did it, and he did it too.And that's the way I deal with my own Faith, I do not try to deny where I came from and what I have done, I take strength from that and add it to who I am now. I don't seclude myself from the world around me, and the way Gerard Butler plays Sam, it appears that not only did Sam Childress feel the same way, but he would actually risk his own personal safety, which he does in order to help out his buddy Donnie played by Michael Shannon, Childress goes right into a "shooting gallery" and extracts his friend at gunpoint, in order to get him off the dope. I've seen similar things in real life, so it was not too far fetched.What makes the story of this guy so interesting is that he rapidly found a place in the world where his special talents, which had been used for crime in his old life, come in very handy for a Missionary in a Third World Country.What attracts me to the character is that he has real guts, will not "turn his cheek," and he'll get done what needs to get done by any means possible. In all my years in various churches and groups, I've only met ONE other person who did this. This guy basically went into a hell zone and brought God with him. Sam Childress is a special man, not too many of his stripe in the world today, including among my own peers, people who believe the same as I believe.You cannot shove God down another person's throat, all you can do is be yourself, and if you are doing it right, people come up and ask you without any prompting. Sam Childress went into Uganda to do this, not many people, especially in today's American religious climate, would be willing to give up their comfort zones and go to another country, and give up ALL to help people who really need it. I was at a religious conference about seven years ago, which was supposed to be "prophetic" and all the main speaker would talk about was for us to go out and buy property! In this climate where people of Faith are only concerned about gaining more possessions, this movie was a refreshment for me, on the scope of the movie "Luther" starring Joe Fiennes which was made some years back. Or, "Brother Sun, Sister Moon" about Saint Francis of Assissi-I put this film on the same level.With all that is going on in this election year, especially with the "X-Tian" right, this is why I urge them to see this movie: and WEEP.</fullReview>

All in all, this movie had an excellent message and was very well done, with a strong performance from Gerard Butler. It was not all action, nor was it overly preachy; it struck just the right balance. The only negative reviews that it's been getting are people who are upset that it actually shows good Christians and not the crazies you see in the news (not sure why this makes it a bad movie, perhaps they are just hypocrites who claim to be open-minded yet shun any positive mentioning of religion in a public forum).

		<fullReview>OMG, where to begin?. Prior to viewing this film, I knew absolutely nothing about it!!! I thought that I was sitting down to your typical "B" exploitation, shoot 'em up genre type movie; however, what I got was a very riveting true life story of Sam Childers. An ex-con, former motorcycle gang member, heroine injecting losers, who after hitting rock bottom, found God, got saved, turned his life around, and waged a one-man war against the brutality of Joseph Kony and his Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) in Northern Uganda and Southern Sudan.A truly remarkable story, much in the like's of "Hotel Rwanda" (another film that I highly recommend seeing). However, what's even more extraordinary is that he continues to fight the inhumanity in Uganda and the Sudan still today. Perhaps the most incredible part of the film are the ending credits, where real live footage of the real Sam Childers is being played along side the credits. I was overwhelmed.The film stars Gerard Butler as Sam Childers and Michelle Monaghan as his loving and "mostly" supporting wife. But please do not misunderstand; Sam Childers is not a likable individual. He's hardheaded, stubborn, single-minded, thick skin, and does not / will not listen to anyone. He puts his needs and wants before all others even if it is for the greater good of his cause(s).This film is phenomenal, shocking, brutal, and nothing that you would expect with such a ridiculous title. However, I loved this film, and highly recommend it!!!! However, the subject matter is very adult in nature, and would not recommend for younger viewers. An extraordinary tale, I am glad that I had the opportunity to see this film!!!! SEE MORE OF MY REVIEWS ON FB @ 'THE FARIS REEL'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DISGUSTINGLY Under-appreciated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is amazing, Butler is enthralling and one of the most comprehensively REAL characters I've seen in a long time.Worth-a-watch? YES, I urge you to watch this movie. I looked up what other critics had to say and I was bemused, what a revoltingly underrated film. It was hard-hitting, not divergent or apologetic of brutality and ultimately both heart-wrenching and thought provoking. It was fantastic; every moment thought through, every reference significant, every sequence orchestrated for full-impact and every performance emotionally potent, startlingly real portrayals of four dimensional, imperfect people. Gerard Butler gives the performance of a life-time and he, like all the characters in this film does not become a shallow plot device, simply providing a villain or a hero to the piece. Everything, just as in life, is uncertain and subjective. With a lasting feeling of inspiration - this film, does what GOOD cinema should do ? asks questions, about morality and humanity, and demands you search yourself for answers. Watch it.

Surely going to read more about him.Brilliant casting as Gerard just rocked !! At the end of the movie, i wanted it to go on and on and on, That is a kind of magic that it created. I think even commercial movie lovers wont mind watching this.And this one is for my Indian friends - Guys, you missed a great movie.

		<shortDescription>The type of movie that could change things. If you were able to watch Hotel Rwanda then watch this one. I say A+</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"There are too many, you can't help them all." Sam Childs (Butler)is a drug addict biker who has just been released from prison. Upset that his girlfriend is no longer stripping he leaves to go drinking with his friend. After picking up a hitchhiker an event happens that changes Sam's life. When a church event introduces him to the problems in Africa he travels over to see if he can help. There are movies that you love so much that you can watch over and over and love it every time. There are some you put in make popcorn and are entertained for a few hours. There are some that make you think after they are over and begin good conversations. Then there are movies like this one. The ones that have the possibility to change things. Much like "Hotel Rwanda" this movie opens your eyes to the atrocities that are happening and make you wonder why this is the first time many have heard about it. Also like that movie though because it's so emotional and not full of CGI it is not promoted the way it needs to be to get people to see it. Without going on a rant here I will just say that this is a movie that NEEDS to be seen and hopefully the right people will see it and do something. Overall, a movie that needs to be seen and felt. A one time watch but a must see one time watch. I give it an A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A deeply disappointing movie about an extraordinary man.As he did with The Kite Runner, Marc Forster has managed to turn a truly heartfelt story into a flaccid movie experience.This was crying out for a director like Ed Zwick or perhaps Kenneth Branagh to turn this incredible true drama into the emotional and harrowing movie this could have been.Instead Forster delivers a dull and matter of fact account devoid of feeling. What motivated Butler to change from a scumbag to a man who finds God overnight? We never find out why. The characters are so thinly drawn that we never get to find out what drives them. The action is muddled and hard to follow. The direction is as flat as the landscape and the emotional high points of the film are unconvincing.It is only because of the story that I watched this movie to the end. But for much of the running time I felt irritated by the shoddy cinematography, poor execution and lack of heart in this film.A missed opportunity</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An American voice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amazed, bedazzled, blown out of the water. These are all my initial responses to this fantastically entertaining and moving piece of art house cinema. Gerard Butler, likely a war veteran (the film never really tells us this, but hints at it HEAVILY) scarred by some numerically disproportionate encounter with some Persians, is a no-good, rebel-rousing, beer-wolfing, gun-toting, cigarette-sucking, ne'er-do-well with a unquenchable thirst for Judas Priest and armed robbery. It also seems he is diabetic, though this neither is expounded on. A hitchhiker is picked up after a successful robbery, but after the hitchhiker tries to make a move (rape?) on his best friend, he stabs him, the hitchhiker, probably about 60 times.*Spoiler alert* The hitchhiker doesn't die*Spoiler alert* The first major plot twist in the film comes when it is shown that his wife is a radical Christian and no longer a hooker. Then Gerard Butler becomes a radical Christian and is no longer his wife's pimp. Then his best friend also becomes a radical Christian; he does however still remain Butler's bitch.Half-heartedly, they build a church, or a hangout for criminal biker gangs and alcoholics (the film doesn't really clarify this), out of some old driftwood or white cardboard or something.Then King Leonidas moves to Africa - this is where the fun begins!Most of you will probably remember my review of the gut-wrenchingly spectacular "the brave one", were Jodi Foster stars as the ghetto-cleaning, Hispanic-murdering FBI agent, hunting a known Mexican serial killer. Well, this is that, only in Africa, and with orphans. Guys, this is a non-stop, action-packed thrill ride from start to finish.Explosions, rocket launchers, child soldiers, dead child soldiers, *Spoiler alert* dead best friendthat punk bitch Kony 2012, car chases, machine guns and gore. Tons. Of. Gore. All you gore hounds out there (I am one myself) prepare to be entertained! The blood looks really good in this one too. They did a great job with the opacity of the blood on all that dark skin, under all that bright scorching light.summary: Leonidas basically builds a shelter for recovering child soldier orphans, all the while fending off attacks from child soldier orphans that are all grown up.This film isn't all fun and games howeverOn a more serious note, this film leaves us with such a crucial message: if more people did as this brave American hero did, then maybe Africa wouldn't be such a crazy place, huh? Think about that. Do it. Open your eyes guys. What would Samuel Child do? Dare to think outside the box. Sometimes the only acceptable results are achieved through civil initiative and explosions.I recommend this film to all fans of low budget gore flicks, fans of the Saw franchise, fans of schlock, fans of the Transformers franchise and to fans of revenge and, especially, vigilante cinema (as I am). 10/10If you like this be sure to check out Harry Brown, starring Michael Caine and Pay back, starring Martin Riggs Peace love and charity</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am perplexed to see the low rating and mixed reviews of this movie. To me it was mind-blowing in every way.Gerard Butler is very convincing, he impersonates a very difficult, sometimes even schizophrenic, character. The choices that the characters (and the real people on which the story is base) make are perfectly presented in their entire drama, while the character "church" is unveiled in the most gentle manner.The only point where I think the movie could develop more is the rather biased approach towards South Sudan. Being made in 2011, the movie is a tribute to the young state's independence and to John Garang, but it should not be taken for granted that the Southern Sudanese forces are not contributing to the atrocities.On a more positive note, recently the LRA has been almost decapitated. Kony's closest aids have been captured and the LRA is thought to have no more than 500 soldiers. Predictions go that it should be completely crushed by end 2012.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie as part of an educational resource for my children regarding the heinous crimes occurring in Northern Uganda. It was intense and horrifying and captured the attention of the plight of the Sudanese children by my three children. Although the violence is graphic, the language is crude, and the content mature, I feel this movie was told in the context of reality and awareness. Gerald Butler was very realistic in his portrayal of Sam Childers and the movie did an excellent job explaining what is happening on the other side of the world.

		<shortDescription>1st hour of the film is too long and dull to make this a good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1st thing I have to say is that unlike 99% films i go to see, i didn't know anything about this film, from the plot to who starred in it. Most people would think this to be rather silly spending money to see something that wasn't my type of film, but that is if I actually spent the money, but the fact is my friend got some free tickets so i went along.Now the reason for the open paragraph is this could be down to the whole reason of me not liking the film too much, in fact I checked my clock on my phone twice inside the 1st hour, which is a record for me. The reason i did this, was because i didn't see a point/meaning to the film for the 1st hour - hour and half and with a meaning to the story i find it hard to concentrate, i finally got the meaning after a hour and half of the film, which after that point i started to like the film.The film tells the life story of Sam Childers (Gerard Butler) after he gets out of jail. A quick review of the plot is that a bike gets released from jail. The man is a right bastard, who threatens his wife, drinks far too much, does drugs and hangs out with same kind of people. One night he kills a man who was threaten to kill his friend. This leaves him into a state of mind where he knows he must change so he finds god. After a tornado hits his town, he get rich by setting up his own building business. After his business has taken off he decides to but his building skills to use in Africa for a few weeks. While there he take a trip into Sudan where he see homeless kids leaving in fear and getting killed. This starts him to build an orphanage for the children.What i just describe to you in 6 and bit lines is the 1st hour and half of the film. Looking back now i can see the reason for the overall long build up and this is because the film makers are trying to say it doesn't matter how bad you have been in your life, if you find god you can become a better person. Still i thought it was far too long and could have been done in half the time.The late half of the film is where the film takes off and gets interesting and without giving to much away, he shows the path of Childers takes in Africa from originally just wanting to help the children by building an orphanage, to becoming a freedom fighter to help protect them.Butler was conversing enough, to make believe he was a con going on the right path. The supporting cast, of his wife, Lynn Childers (Michelle Monaghan as a former stripper, who found the lord, was an average character, who was mainly there 1st to show how badly her husband treated her and then to show him to the path of the lord.While the film was an interesting story, I am not sure how much of the true story is actually true, the film could have been 20-30 minutes shorter, if this was so i would have been as bored in the 1st half, but the 2nd half saved it.My rating of the film would be 2.5/5</fullReview>

I was expecting a 6.8 movie and needless to say I was pleasantly surprised. It's based on a true story and very timely considering the leader of the Ugandan rebels (Joseph Kony) is in the news with a viral video about him. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4MnpzG5SqcThe basic premise is quite intriguing before you even see the movie. A bad boy biker finds god but he never gives up his love of guns and still has a penchant for violence if pushed hard enough. Add in the evil insanity that is presently still going on in Uganda and it's an incredibly compelling story. I don't want to say any more at the risk of giving away some of the things that are best left to the movie to explain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film that does a great deal to address the way faith makes people do incredible things. Sam Childers' journey is not without fault, the elements of Christianity portrayed in the film are very stereotypical and at times a little cringe-worthy ( not sure why in America they have to use the song 'Amazing Grace' to identify that we are in a church scene.Butler is a simmering testosterone-fuelled maniac, his character remains the same, much throughout, despite the apparent change in his faith and turn to God. I felt this was not explained very well, though no doubt the film makers would have wanted to proceed to the 'money shots' of the action sequences.Characters are a bit one dimensional, his wife is the typical rock at home, we never see her story developed which is a shame because evidently she is a strong woman. Likewise, the friend and daughter.But the real story of love and conversion is with the African experiences, hard-hitting, not for the feint of heart and frankly be warned there are some tough scenes to deal with in this film.Overall a great story and for the most part well told, well worth watching, but not a film for those seeking action of the JCVD or Arnie genre, it just isn' that at all!</fullReview>

But when I got out of the movie hall, I was somehow feeling like I just stepped out having watched a documentary. I am not sure what did it but I was sort of put off at the end of the movie.Having seen a man's struggle with his inner self to begin with and then that with a system that is surely beyond one man's ability to uproot or change significantly, I was hoping for the story teller to give me a conclusion. The only thing that I could take away from the movie was that Sam Childers is a person who lost himself to drugs to find God to again lose himself to the rage and anger that he felt towards his helplessness to change a system (that he should have realized he is not going to overthrow) to again find himself resurrected by a child.In the meanwhile I am just wondering how a man can be allowed to wrong his family to the extent that he did. I am searching for a conclusion to this story and not finding one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent film with something worth saying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gerard Butler plays Sam Childers in an adaptation of Childers' real-life story. It opens with Childers being released from jail to a warm welcome from his wife Lynn (Michelle Monaghan), and quickly showing that he remains a violent drug addict criminal. However, Lynn has found God during his jail term and, when he realises that his life is out of control, he too turns to God (of the fire and brimstone, Hallelujah, do ya hear me, Brother? Variety). This turns his life around and he becomes a successful building contractor and builds his won Church. He is also inspired to go to do some charity building work on the Uganda/Sudan border, and it is here that he discovers the atrocities visited on the locals by terrorist groups. He determines to build an orphanage for the child victims.I was expecting this film to be OK and no better: but it actually has quite a lot to say.. Childers' domestic situation is necessary dramatically as part of the set up, but for me this section didn't really add very much, and could have been dealt with much more quickly: his getting of religion was very shouty, but I didn't feel there was that much of an epiphany. Also, this section contained some potentially emotional elements which never really got resolved (perhaps because they didn't get resolved in real life, either).The African sections were much more effective (even though they, too, contained elements which started and then never got resolved). You get used to films portraying violence and inhumanity, and you become somewhat inured to it: here, I was very aware that while the portrayal was manufactured for this film, the events portrayed happened (if not exactly, then something very probably worse), and that children like these were and are subjected to atrocities very like what was shown. And I can understand Childers' single-minded determination to make a difference.While I have quite enjoyed many of Butler's films, I have never regarded him as an actor with much range, although he does do intensity quite well. Here is a part which suits his abilities perfectly.Give this film a chance, because there is much about it which is worthwhile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why would you do this to us Gerard?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a long time, I have been of the belief that Gerard Butler only ever made films in which he was a man on the edge. A man who was pushed. A man who merely wants his family back. I have, in fact, on many occasions watched an entire GB movie whilst screaming 'Give me my family back' at the screen.I had extinguished all hopes of this being a 'Nude Nuns With Big Guns' meets 'Shoot Em Up' exploitation extravaganza as soon as I saw the poster. The first warning signals went off when I saw that it was directed by Marc Foster, the being responsible for Monster's Ball, Finding Neverland, Quantum of Solace and The Kite Runner, none of which I particularly enjoyed. Yet, being a man who is open of mind and forgiving of spirit, I decided to roll the dice and take a chance.Nothing could have prepared me for what these eyes have now witnessed. Machine Gun Preacher starts with Gerard Butler (playing Sam Childers, the man whom this story is tenuously based), he's just been released from prison (gets his family back far too early in this one, thus removing any genuine Butler based motivation from the movie), he's a man on the edge. He takes some drugs and stabs a hobo. Then he feels bad about stabbing the hobo and his girlfriend takes him to church.After visiting church ONCE, Childers is so filled with the holy spirit that he immediately turns his life around. He not only wants Jesus to fill his every inch of being, he wants to put Jesus into other people too.Cut to war torn Sudan, where Childers is now working construction (one of this movies many flaws is that it is unable to link sequences with any sense of grace or artistry, leaving it as clunky as Marley's chains) and witnessing the injustice and genocide that sweep the country, he decides to build a massive church in the middle of the war zone (because that'll be a huge bloody help) and can henceforth spread his message from the lord (delivered personally at the back of a car park according to Childers) to these heathens and hopefully end the war in the process.OK, so it's an orphanage as well, but to be honest, you can't let the emotional elements detract you from the fact that this is one of the most disgustingly propaganda-like movies that I have seen in years. It basically says that if you accept Jesus into your life, nothing's gonna stop you now (like Jefferson Starship). It's hokey, overly sentimental and horrendously played out. Butler is as wooden as a supporting beam on one of his ramshackle shelters.There's a really explicit form of violence portrayed to manipulate you into thinking that because this is a film about serious subject matter, that it is above scrutiny. Women are shown after having their lips cut off, children lie in mangled heaps after playing hopscotch on land mines, but it's not effecting, it's crass and presented for all the wrong reasons.I am not putting down anything that the real Sam Childers has actually done in his life, he sounds like a genuinely nice guy, but real life doesn't play out like it does in this film. It's a contrived amalgamation of saccharine and horsesh*t, with some 'heavy' battle scenes thrown in for the 'oh the humanity' effect.The worst fermenting pile of garbage that Gerard Butler has ever put his name to, and I've seen The Bounty Hunter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I am still trying to come to terms with this amazing story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think for some this film fails because it can lack structure, and I also think there is little emotional use made of music. But what gives the film real impact is that it is a true story - and I think that rightly priority has been given to getting across an amazing tale constrained within the popcorn multiplex format, rather than compiling a traditional narrative arc. This film raises in a dramatic way so many issues, about how Christians, and others, should respond to evil. There has been so much said about loving your enemies, maybe that has excused not fighting them. And while Western armies of thousands fight on in Afghanistan, a one man army in a forgotten war does his crazy bit to fight evil and protect orphans. It is because he is so extreme that he challenges comfy stereotypes, and because he is flawed and rough that he brings to his new life so much of his own, old character. This film will leave you thinking - whatever faith you have, or none. A red neck hill billy out following his ideal of justice for those who are weak and under oppression. An unbelievable tale of courage and determination. Gerard Butler fits the role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really short sighted religion centric movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>--spoiler alert!!!--At first, movie is about sudanese civil war and religion. Movie shows muslims as evil rebels and christians as saviors of the sudanese children. (In fact, northern sudanese army supplied by Muslim counties and southern sudanese army supplied by Christian countries, thats all.)The sudanese civil war is not about religion, it is just to justify war against people. It is about some country's interest about Africa. Like selling weapons, making profit and getting cheap raw materials. Personally, i oppose killing people for any reason. Including belief, race or way ideals, so i am not supporting any side here.Also story was somewhat weak. I don't recommend to watch this movie, it is waste of time.I recommend to watch 'hotel rwanda' before watching this movie. And if anyone wishes peace for Africa, press authorities about selling or providing food and industry to them, instead of weapons!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Machine Gun Preacher</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Machine Gun Preacher became my first theatrical outing for 2012, a biopic about the life and times of a down and out former gang biker finding a second life through religion, becoming a preacher and following what he would deem to be his just cause in getting involved in the plight of Sudanese children made orphans and slaves by the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA). Directed by Marc Forster, who also did powerful dramas like The Kite Runner and the last Bond film Quantum of Solace, Machine Gun Preacher found itself in good hands at straddling conflicting ideologies and values in which a man of God takes, finding himself having to fight fire with fire in order to protect lives and the changes he tries to bring about through opportunities provided.As with all big screen biographies, there is that dramatic license being taken, with the trailer touting this like an all out action film, and like a character said in the film, made Sam Childers (Gerard Butler) seem like a one man Rambo in Africa. The narrative is hardly that blatantly violent, opting to have its first hour concentrating on how rotten a man like Sam actually is, just out of prison, and can't wait for his wife Lynn (Michelle Monaghan) to get back to stripping for a livelihood to fuel his booze and drug addiction. Things spiral out of control, and wanting to change his life, he follows his family members who had found religion, and through that experience, found a new calling in life.Which came quite accidentally in fulfilling a vision he had of what God had wanted him to do, to set up a church in his hometown where the downtrodden like what he himself was, will never be turned away and to be able to find community, and in a trip to Uganda to put his contracting and building expertise to good charitable use, finds himself embroiled in the fight between the LRA and the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), seeing first hand the indiscriminate killings, and inhumane conditions that the Sudanese children have to live in. Deeply perturbed, Sam spends the rest of his life (in the film at least) straddling between two worlds, that of his wife, children and congregation back home in the USA, and that of the African children and SPLA soldiers who are fighting for the children's basic survival.It's how Forster manages this balance in story that makes Machiine Gun Preacher a compelling watch without indulging in too much action, nor too much emptiness in his talk, reminding me of films such as Hotel Rwanda where one man's efforts has tremendous impact on the community he finds himself in. Sam is precisely the man who walks his talk, preferring positive action and even pre-emptive ones as he launches raids into enemy territory just to save children, whether a couple, or large groups, from their impending doom no matter if there's a price on his head for doing what he believes is right, and can. In a way this helps to propagate a myth that he's virtually indestructible since he has God on his side to combat the evilness of man, and that builds a fearsome reputation that he's a man not to be trifled with. In order to not alienate the masses, Forster has taken deliberate steps not to get overly preachy with sermons, keeping them to a bare minimum and being absolutely nothing that spreads the word of the gospel, but instead tapping on Sam's experience thus far in providing the fuel to fire up his speeches for his congregation. If anything, the narrative is sprawling, touching upon the insanity of the situation in Sudan, and Sam's spiral into having his cause and calling turn into obsession, and consuming him from within. It reminds us that at times certain situations and environments are far too complex for one man to handle, but that doesn't mean we don't try, only to have to acknowledge the limits set before everything begins to fall apart.Gerard Butler is clearly the star of the film in having to play someone who's been on the wrong side of the law, and then fighting on the side of God in choosing action over words in leading his faith, preferring to ensure that children, no matter where they are, are given a fair chance at life without exploitation. He's capable of the more dramatic moments when Sam is tethering on breaking down and giving up, after all, it's always so easy to just pack up and walk away from something that inevitably sucks up one's resources and attention to the detriment of one's personal life. And if the situation calls for it, which I believe some quarters will find that this violates some religious ethics in taking up arms and killing in the name of, Butler's in his element as well without going over the top into a guns blazing action hero.The film is ultimately a thought-provoking one, leaving you room to contemplate if we are frivolously living our lives with disregard to the plight of our fellow man on any other part of the world, or the question may just simply be how do we help, and to what extent and how much can our help be useful. In our relatively selfish ways we don't see how we can continuously deplete personal resources like what Sam did, just to benefit someone else whom we don't even know enough of. Perhaps after watching this we may feel some guilty pangs for a period of time, and I wonder, myself included, how many of us would make small, positive steps, to make our world a better place to live in, through whatever means and efforts we can expend. Sam Childers may be an extreme example of charity, but surely we can find something well within our own abilities.Machine Gun Preacher opens this Thursday, lookout for it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See In A Better World</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Childers is still serving the needy children of Southern Sudan and Northern Uganda, where limbs are hacked off and children forced to kill their mothers. As Gerard Butler portrays him for the first 40 minutes, he's a bad-ass druggy biker who eventually becomes baptized and a zealot for the underprivileged.His wife, Lynn (Michelle Monaghan, too classy looking for this role), is indulgent of their trailer trash life and his part-time residence in Africa, where he becomes known as "White Preacher" and "Machine Gun Preacher." The latter appellation suggests his former life of guns and drugs transferred to the plains of Africa where the Lords Rebel Army rules with little patience for Childers' goody act.Although Childers' acts of heroism are praiseworthy, no real emotional connection is established for the audience, just bursts of gunfire and the occasional heart-rending child speaking with a fluency impossible to believe in an area of the world where ignorance thrives as a means of rebel control. His travel between the states and the Sudan becomes repetitive, one not helping the other to develop his character. The only truly emotional scenes are in the car dealership where he begs for contributions from an owner condescending at best to those in true need.Another wasted effort is the opening chapters of Childers' disturbing life as a druggie who, with slacker buddy, Donnie (a waste of Michael Shannon's considerable acting talents), beats on bikers and themselves in a worthless pursuit of happiness. Five minutes of this cliché and I get the idea. Nor does director Mike Forster or writer Jason Keller give us much to go on for his quick change into a Bible-thumping preacher.The creative team for this film might have forgotten we've seen the white savior motif in In A Better World, where children are again a catalyst for some searing drama</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Religious propaganda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While it's no coincidence that it has been released around this time with the front runners in Americas opinions, it was still a decent watch. It advocates religions and guns, I'm waiting for the gay-bashing to begin and it'll have it all. This is what you call political propaganda and I've got a feeling it's not the last we'll be seeing in the near future! Please keep Hollywood out of religion!!!Gerard Butler saves what would otherwise have been pure religious propaganda and turns this film into something worth a look, I am definitely glad I didn't go to the cinema to watch this. I borrowed this film from a friend and would say to anyone else DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film really destroyed Gerarg Butler as an actor for me. In the future I will triple check on the story before I watch another Gerard Butler movie.Is this supposed to make me feel closer to Jesus or start going to church or something ? I turned it off after watching Gerard making a fool of himself and reaching Asian stupidity level.Now all I see in any Gerard's movie posters is the Jesus freak guy acting in some other movie. What a pity Mr. Butler....from gamer and law abiding citizen to this religious crap.Horrible movie I would walk out of a friend's movie night if he put this on the DVD player.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Christian propaganda!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I kind of liked some of the ideas of this movie.However it utterly fails in my book because of all the Christian propaganda.The movie is filled with it.It doesn't add anything to the story itself but rather destroys it. I mean the idea is good enough. The actors likewise. The budget large enough to make a convincing movie. It could have been a nice one without all the unnecessary Christian messages all over the place.So I'll have to say the movie was awful.Don't watch it if you're not a Christian. It will just annoy you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of two films I have walked out on.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film made me feel violently ill. This, and David Lynch's 'Inland Empire' are the only films I have ever walked out on. David Lynch I walked out on because I didn't have a clue what was going on, this I walked out on because it is basically a complete load of absolute guff and no mistake. Drivel, complete and utter total absolute sweaty balls and smelly armpits.To save you the money and agony, a heroin addicted thug turns Middle American Christian after being pushed into a plunge pool by a paedophile. God Bless America! He kind of builds a school, but in a half arsed, 'Oh look how great I am for doing this' kind of way. Whilst tribal war fare runs rife, due to no doubt, displacement of indigenous populations by the actions of a US based multi-national company that is destroying the local environment forcing the people to become slaves to the corporate machine when they were living perfectly peaceful lives living a nomadic lifestyle in harmony with their surroundings. God Bless Christianity because it has done so much good for the world!I left the cinema, had a chat with the staff about how bad the film was, they agreed, and I went about my evening. As I sat at home thinking about how much of my life I had just wasted by watching the first hour of 'Machine Gun Preacher', it dawned on me that there may actually well be people still sat in the cinema, watching the cinematic equivalent of eating mouldy spam and I pitied them. But I forgive them. Because I love and have compassion for everyone, warts and all, and I am not a Christian, I am a human being capable of envisioning God without the need for secular nonsense. I am God. You are God. We are God. In God. We are consciousness itself. So in some respects I made this film. And for that, I apologies. To myself. I can't wait to watch Tin Tin however. And I quite fancy seeing Johnny English 2, if anything to support Rowan Atkinson who is a God himself as it happens. And Kill Keith intrigues me. Might stream that one though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A poor attempt at an educational and evocative movie, falling at every hurdle.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't really understand how this title managed to get produced. A massive amount of storyline was missing along with a lacklustre attempt at a realism.It seems like it was filmed, and then cut down to the lowest common denominator with a couple of bangs and some church scenes. The acting was on the whole poor, though this was due to the atrocious script, such that every scene seemed forced and none of the characters (apart from maybe the daughter) seemed to have any emotions.Gerard Butler was inappropriate for the role of Sam Childers, it felt like we were following an action hero on his quest to rid the world of an opposing faction, which definitely made this film less believable than Aristocats.I see this movie appealing to the American Deep South and that's about it. A poor attempt at an educational and evocative movie, falling at every hurdle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gerard Butler's 'Machine Gun Preacher' tells a detailed biography of a martyring hero. He does provide both the good side and the dark side (his obsession blinding him to the fact that it's wrong to teach children to support gun ownership). Butler also shows the clash between Bhagat Singh's and Gandhi's viewpoints quite effectively. He has tried to stay historically accurate and even though it is released during the same time as the chick flick snoozefest remake of 'Straw Dogs', 'Machine Gun Preacher' triumphs above that and is a masterpiece in comparison.Gerard Butler, though intense roles are his strength, may seem like an odd choice to play the title role, especially because he is like some poor man's version of Russel Crowe. Otherwise, he delivers a winning performance. Michelle Monaghan and Michael Shannon are equally powerful. The supporting cast that includes an excellent Raj Babbar, a sincere Nicole Michele Sobchack and dusky beauty Madeline Carroll leave a mark. I would like to see a movie about just these women. The actors who play the Sudanese orphans are horrendous.The cinematography is fine and Tito Rahman's soundtrack is another winner. Most of the feel is patriotic but there are a few different numbers too. The background score, though beautiful, is intrusive at times and kind of adds a melodramatic feel (when that isn't necessary).'Machine Gun Preacher' is one of the fewer biopics in Hollywood cinema that tells a good story while attempting to stay true to the current political climate. Some might find it difficult to watch due to the violent massacres but it is a movie that is worth viewing on any off day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Haven't walked out of a movie in a long time, but this was horrible. Butler needs to stick to action movies, as he was not believable in this role past the junkie role. Really need a new title to this movie, as it is so misleading. Found that the story was moving really slowly, and jumped ahead too quick. I was excited to see the movie initially as biopic's are usually pretty interesting, but this one was extremely misleading. I like Butler as an actor, but I believe he was miscast in this movie. Eddie Shannon's a great actor and was misused in this movie, stick to Boardwalk. Michelle Monaghan was OK in this role, but again, not a fan of this movie in any shape or form.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something Missing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a vacuity during and after the film ends. Already having an awareness of the plight in the area set my expectations to reach higher than what the film aimed for.On the shallow end, there is absolutely no physical resemblance in Gerard Butler to the actual Sam Childers. That from the start tends to dilute the filmmaker's goal. Gerard Butler tries much too hard to be believable and at times seems more to be posing for a rough version of GQ. Unfortunately, there was audience laughter during periods where none was due.Delving deeper, there is definitely a disconnect as to how the story tries to make the audience accept Sam Childer's elevated motives. The conversion should have felt like a reversion, whereas the opposite comes through actually solidifying the wrong characteristics its trying to eradicate. Leaving the theater I felt that I should agree with the rationale of the end justifying the means, but I couldn't. Overhearing the comment of others afterward, we weren't alone.</fullReview>
