		<shortDescription>Philadelphia is about life, and making it matter.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Philadelphia is a guttingly emotional and tragic story of how a lawyer fired for having AIDS attempts to vindicate himself in court. Tom Hanks gives perhaps the most powerful performance of his career as Andrew Beckett, the afflicted lawyer. He received the Academy Award in a waltz, and you could almost pick any of his major scenes as worthy of the award.This movie is probably the best drama regarding gay issues ever made. Remember, it was made in 1993, when AIDS was still a terminal disease, and it recalls the early days of an epidemic that may not square with the vision afforded today, but at the time, this was the reality of AIDS. The entire crew is A-List. Tak Fujimoto, who would also film Silence of the Lambs and Sixth Sense, directed cinematography. Jonathan Demme, also of Silence of the Lambs fame, directs with typical honesty and grit. Bruce Springsteen and Neil Young contributed hauntingly touching original songs. Even Antonio Banderas, whom I never miss an opportunity to vilify, is moving as Hanks' devoted and supportive partner. Denzel Washington was well cast as the homophobic lawyer who ultimately takes Hanks' case, and Mary Steenburgen is surprising in an uncharacteristic villain role.Ron Vawter, who played one of the lawyers in the firm from which Hanks was fired, and also appeared in Silence of the Lambs, was himself suffering from AIDS at the time of filming, and he eventually succumbed to it a few years later. His appearance in the film encapsulates the reality of the AIDS epidemic, in that it often touched our lives in unexpected places.Although I have literally thousands of movies in my collection, I don't own this one. Not because I don't love it. I do. It's because I can't watch it without being overcome by emotion. Anyone who can watch Hanks' in the Opera scene, or hear Springsteen's or Young's eerie and melancholy ballads and not weep is dead inside. But in the end, Philadelphia is about life, and making it matter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gay Men Are Macho Too</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Philadelphia is a truly amazing movie and a touching story. Tom Hanks plays a lawyer who has been stricken with a horrible disease. He plays a convincing role as Andrew Beckett, a man who knows the meaning of justice and knows what exactly his rights are. What Mr. Hanks also accomplishes with this role is he breaks free from the stereotypes society has dictated on the average gay man. Andrew Beckett is not feminine in any way, he does not have a flair for shoe shopping or hold his arms limp-wristed or talk with a lisp. For these reasons, it has been said that Tom Hanks was not believable as a gay man. I strongly disagree. Andrew Beckett is a normal man who enjoys smoking cigars and takes joy in the law. Who would think he was gay? This is precisely the point the movie is trying to make. A gay man may be walking among you, every day you may see him at school, may play raquetball with him at the gym, may work late hours with him at the office... but yet you'd never suspect he is gay because he does not wear loafers decorated with tassels and he has a low-pitched voice. Men are men, whether gay or not, and should be treated as such -- gays do not deserve special treatment but they deserve equal treatment. Because in most areas, gay men are just like straight men. I commend Tom Hanks for showing the world that gay men can be just as manly as any other. His Oscar was well-deserved and the movie was amazingly ground-breaking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a better film in sight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With Hanks, who is always watchable, and Washington, who has also got a very good track record, this film was destined to be fantastic but not even I, who always has an optimistic view when it comes to movies, was ready for the impact that this film made. Tom Hanks excelled even himself with his performance as an AIDS striken homosexual who is fired from his job simply because of his condition. It is Hanks, by himself, who makes the whole scenario in the film believable. Although this is Hanks's best performance of his career, he is very closely followed by Denzel Washington who gives a perfect performance as the only lawyer who will take on the case although he is a homophobe himself. The emotional strain of the film on the audience is immense and in the later stages of the film it is almost impossible to watch because of that. The make-up which gives the impression that Hanks really does have the terrible disease is perfect and the simple yet striking direction from Jonathan Demme(The Silence Of The Lambs) make this utterly compelling viewing although at times it is very uncomfortable. All praise to everyone in the making of this beautiful film.Anyone who hasn't seen this film must do as soon as possible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hanks gives his best performance ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Philadelphia" may be the movie that changed Hollywood. For so many years, they portrayed gays as sissies, but this movie forced them to change. Tom Hanks gives the performance of a lifetime as AIDS-afflicted lawyer Andrew Beckett, fired from his law firm after they discover his condition. Equally good is Denzel Washington as homophobic lawyer Joe Miller, who is forced to ignore his own stereotypes in taking Andrew's case. Good support also comes from Jason Robards as Andrew's vicious ex-boss, Joanne Woodward as Andrew's ever-loving mother, and Antonio Banderas as Andrew's companion.Maybe this is just me, but I think that "Philadelphia" was released at just the right time. Think back to 1993. We had just come out of the Reagan-Bush years and we now had Clinton. Maybe he wasn't openly pro-gay, but he did change the military's policy towards gays. Moreover, Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington are analogous to Paul Newman and Sidney Poitier: the embodiment of the new era under a new president (in Newman's and Poitier's case, it was Kennedy; in fact, those two co-starred in "Paris Blues" the year that Kennedy became president, much like Hanks and Washington were starring in "Philadelphia" the year that Clinton became president). But let's not get sidetracked. This is a great movie, and I recommend it to everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely astonishing!! Hanks' best performance!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I only saw this film recently after I saw the special edition DVD for sale at only ?5.99. I bought it and watched it as soon as i took it home and I thought it was amazing. Jonathan Demme's direction was great too. but the two best things about it was Tom Hanks' performance as the lawyer with aids and Bruce Springsteen's song " Streets of Philadelphia". I always thought that Liam Neeson's performance in Schindler's List was what should've recieved the Oscar in 1993. But when I eventually saw Philadelphia a few weeks ago, I could see why Hanks won. Denzel Washington as the homophobic but supportive lawyer is also great. The three, Hanks, Washington and Demme make a good team. The film is wonderful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moving and Powerful! Demme shines!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jonathan Demme's "Philadelphia" throws us into a world of pain and stark truth that is few and far between in mainstream cinema. The sheer idea that a film would so blatantly take on the difficulty of AIDS and homosexuality, helmed by the director of "Silence of the Lambs", the actor in "Big" and the guy who played Malcom X, is staggering. AIDS is a reality and homophobia is a nasty truth that permeates our "United" States of America, as well as the rest of the world. At the time that this film was released (about 1993), the U.S. found solace in the idea that AIDS and homosexuality were dirty brothers in a distant family. By placing the film in the "City of Brotherly Love", hiring Bruce Springsteen to sing the title song and having an up-and-coming Tom Hanks star, director Jonathan Demme wisely readied an ignorant America for our first, uninhibited glance into the face of AIDS. Tom Hanks embodied his role in an Oscar-worthy performance, allowing us to watch as his lovely and lively Andrew Beckett deteriorate before our eyes. Tom Hanks and the writers took to task the difficult and annoyingly controversial hurdle of playing the "gay" character and placing the "straight" audience into that different world. Stereotypes are mostly shied away from in the script with a few "fem" gays and drag queens. These scenes are few, but are also a reality. Many a Christmas party have I attended with the same crowd ("fems" and drag queens) in the mix. The other, mildly annoying, factor in this film is that the writers inform us that squeaky-clean gay Andrew Beckett contracts AIDS at a porn theater from an anonymous stranger, while in a committed relationship. This annoyed me because I wanted a righteous victim, not a impure victim. Yet as time has gone by and I have had the opportunity to work with many a victim of AIDS, whether be it male or female, gay or straight, I have seen that this too is an unfortunate reality. No one is perfect (gay or straight, male or female) and mistakes are often made. Costly mistakes are often made. This was a painful truth, but it is a truth nonetheless. In this, Tom Hanks as Mr. Beckett, brilliantly gave AIDS an honest face for a distant America. Denzel Washington, on the other hand, allowed America to have a relatable character, one whose shoes we've fit in before. Denzel's views of homosexuality were (and still are) commonplace in the American psyche and his reactions to AIDS were understandable to the average audience. Yet all in all this dramatic film brought a message home. Demme's directing style is nothing amazing; he tastefully weaves a tale without flashy shots or fancy cuts. At times the film borders on preachy, but, as always, it is Demme's story that grasps the audience, his mood that sets us into the tale, his actors and his direction of them that gives the film honesty. This film is highly recommended if not for the great acting but for lovers of a great story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A touching movie, which has taken the place of "The Fugitive" (1993) as my favorite movie. Tom Hanks' performance was obviously worthy of his first Oscar for his portrayal of Andrew Beckett, a gay, AIDS-stricken man who was fired from his job for what he believes to be discrimination against his sexual orientation and disease. Denzel Washington, in his portrayal of Joe Miller, the ex-homophobic who decides to help Andrew win his case, is excellent, deserving of a Best Supporting Actor award. This story of AIDS, homophobia and homosexualism is first-rate. I highly recommend this to anybody looking for a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Compelling, but over the top</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To me this movie is both a relevant and compelling story, as well as a model of overcompensation. I feel as though Philadelphia was trying desperately to show a touching, human side to the AIDS epidemic, but at the same time overly conscious of the lack of compassion much of middle America has for homosexual victims of AIDS. As a result, our protagonist Andrew Beckett is made to be a virtual superman. I would have had more respect for the film if they'd made him more like you and me. If he had been a bright, successful lawyer with friends, a loving family, and a serious relationship that would have made him someone we could really relate to. Instead, Andrew was a legal phenom, THE rising star, future senior partner, the future leader of the law firm. And in his personal life, he was the most popular person at his firm, beloved by all. More than that, he was the most popular member of his whole family, he was brilliant, affable, going straight to the top, simply AMAZING!!! Doesn't it seem like they tried too hard to get us on his side? To show the human story of AIDS, show us an actual person, not superman. That is problem with Philadelphia.Having said that, Tom Hanks was fantastic, as usual. Denzel was also rock solid, his character basically representing all of us, the general public, the ones who don't empathize with gays because they either don't know any, or aren't conscious they know any, and fail to appreciate that they are real people and not merely stereotypes. His enlightenment with regards to this is one aspect of the movie I felt they came through on exceptionally. Philadelphia was an important story to be told, for just like so many other human tragedies, for us the unaffected to be able to see just one example up close and personal, it carries so much more weight than all the news reports and statistics in the world. I hope it had some positive impact in creating compassion among the general public. I just wish the film makers hadn't felt it would be necessary to go to superhuman lengths to give us a character we could feel for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfortunately Misguided Criticism Should Not Stop Anyone From Seeing This Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first review I've written on IMDB, but I shouldn't have to write one for a film of this caliber. It succeeds in everything it attempts to do and it bothers me when I read comments from gay readers that absolutely loathe this film. After thinking about it for a little bit, I think I've found the reason for why all the gay viewers hated this film: they're sick of the pity and the sympathy. I can understand that, and it is basically impossible to make a quasi-realistic film about gay rights and anti-homophobia without exhibiting some sympathy for the alienated gay population. I admit that I have little experience with gays, although I am acquainted with a few. They are on wonderful terms with their families (even though one homosexual writes here that families are NOT like that). I disagree with people who think that because their family is displeased with their sexual orientation, every gay person is estranged from their family. That is untrue. Another wrong comment I read was that the film gives viewers the impression that gays are the only ones that can get AIDS (and that the disease is always deadly). That is false, as well, since a portion of the movie deals with a woman who is an AIDS survivor and who contracted the disease in a blood transfusion. There are many other ways of getting AIDS, but it would be impossible for the film to identify every single way in order to be PC. The most powerful argument against this film seems to be that it is anti-homosexual propaganda in how it shows the relationship between Tom Hanks and Antonio Banderas. First of all, everyone is making a big deal that Hanks and Banderas do not kiss. Apparently, filmmakers cannot possibly show love between two people without having them kiss. It sounds to me that most disappointed gay readers were hoping to see gay pornography rather than a film about two homosexuals and the troubles they face when one of them contracts AIDS. They do not kiss, fine, but they dance, they talk to one another in such a way that I, a heterosexual man, envied the relationship they had. The first time we see Banderas is when he is racing to the hospital to see if Hanks is okay. I know if my girlfriend were in the hospital, I would probably look and act the exact same way that he does. I disturbs me that so many gay readers would rather see the two of them make out than display affection for one another in more powerful ways. Another argument I noticed more than once was that, aside from Hanks' character, the film portrays all gays as "pansies." Believe me, the critics here are far more stereotypical than this film is. One scene that comes to mind is when Denzel Washington is shopping in a grocery store and a college athlete approaches him to praise him for his work. Washington is gracious and it comes off as a surprise when the athlete starts to hit on him. I suppose that most gay viewers saw that message as something along the lines of "Gays are everywhere...watch out!" If that were the case, the film would have glorified Washington's character, but instead we feel sorry for liking Denzel. Why do we like him? Because too many of us are like him, just average people who want to take a few steps back every time a homosexual walks nearby. By presenting someone that we all can associate with and highlighting his flaws (which are, essentially, our own), maybe we can begin to change. As for the film, I find it hard to believe that anyone would rent this thinking that it is simply a courtroom drama. It is well-written, and well-acted. I mostly enjoyed some fabulous direction on Jonathan Demme's part. I remember, in particular, that when Hanks would recall when he was fired, his associates had the appearance of monsters. The camera would show them in a darker light, up-close, at an awkward angle. Many other viewers found this to be "cartoony," but they're forgetting that these scenes were not reality. They were simply memories, and although Hanks' character is a noble, honorable, unfortunately ill homosexual, he naturally feels angry towards his former employers. He's furious, even though he rarely lets out any of that fury directly. The only way we see these memories is through his distorted memories. Hanks is frustrated and furious with what happened and he cannot look at his former employers anymore without seeing monsters. In this way, the filmmakers build a connection between Hanks' character and the viewers, gay or not. This also helps the viewer sympathize for homosexuals and see how they are essentially no different than anyone else. I apologize. I am sorry that so many gays would rather remain alienated, would rather see Hanks and Banderas act in gay porn than a meaningful film. I am sorry that there is even one homosexual out there who are is alienated from their families that they have no one to really turn to. This film is not the most accurate portrayal of homosexuals, but is far from the worst. Do not even attempt to persuade me, that this film is nothing but worthless drivel, that it tries to alienate gays even more. It is as accurate as it has to be. If it were to go too far over the line, it would be too much for the average person to handle. Viewers have to remember that controversial topics like these have to be handled carefully, and it could not have been done better than in "Philadelphia." If all gay people are looking for is a depressing, uninventive, inaccurate P.O.S. that emphasizes homosexual kissing rather than acceptance and integration, then maybe they should remain alienated. Sorry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was fantastic.I am a huge Tom Hanks fan. This was one of those movies that really show if an actor really knows how to act. Denzel Washington, I think, should have won the "Supporting Actor" award for 1993 because he was exceptional in the movie. I really enjoyed watching this movie because it made you laugh and cry and very few movies do that. Tom Hanks is the only actor to win two consecutive "Best Actor" awards (Philadelphia and Forrest Gump) and I think Philadelphia was the start of his superior career in acting. In conclusion, I rate Philadelphia a 10 and I recommend it to all Tom Hanks fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You really can't make a movie about "being gay," or, more pointedly, "being-gay-and-discriminated-against" and not have the movie judged primarily as an agenda-flick, especially when the characters are as two-dimensional as they are in this story. Tom Hanks plays a gay man who for a brief, sad time in his life was sexually promiscuous. He caught AIDS.His character doesn't work--he is a stereotype, or, rather, what the filmmakers would *like* to be a stereotype, I think: the sensitive, intelligent, put-upon Gay Man. His employers, who fire him immediately upon finding out he is gay and has AIDS, are stereotypical Villains. They seem to have very little to talk about (particularly around poor Tom Hanks!) other than gays, which of course they do in a coarse and insensitive manner. They are the Cold-Hearted Homophobes.Denzel Washington is Hanks' lawyer, the Homophobe-Who-Becomes-More-Human by knowing the Gay Man.Sound puerile? It is. What the filmmakers have failed to realize is that if you REALLY want to present a human drama, you can't keep the characters as two-dimensional as they are in Philadelphia. Hanks needs to be more than a Sensitive Gay Man. Jason Robards needs to be more than the Cruel Homophobe. And so on. In real life, people aren't that simple. This kind of b&amp;w morality works in Hollywood adventure movies, but it doesn't work in art.In addition to ignoring the complexities of human character, this movie totally ignores the complexites of the AIDS issue, and gay rights, simplifying them into a thin gruel of unthinking, maudlin, propaganda. This movie is a tearjerker if all you want is to have your position on the AIDS/Gay issue confirmed, but sorry mistake if you expect something with aesthetic merit, or thought-provoking content.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful and for once me and Oscar agree</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to say what I think of "Philadelphia". I say to a lot of people that the better a film is, the less there is to say about it. The problem, as this film shows, is that simply that phrase doesn't work. Whilst it's true that for most films, having little to say shows that it's been well made and there is nothing to complain about. With "Philadelphia", it's not accurate as all I want to do is sing the praises of Tom Hanks and Denzil Washington.In this film, Hanks plays Andrew Beckett, an outstanding lawyer fired after the discovery that he is contaminated with the aids virus. Beckett seeks out Washington's Joe Miller as a lawyer as he progresses to sue the company for wrongful dismissal.First things first, lets be honest, Jonathan Demme took a huge chance directing a film about such a difficult matter, but fair play to him, he pulled it off. This film is a powerful, moving, eye-opening experience which will leave even the most unemotional person with a tear in their eye at one point or another.Hanks, Best Actor at the Oscars for this film, is truely magnificant and worthy of his award. Washington too is superb as the homophobic lawyer being taught a thing or two about his beliefs.Ultimately, I find very little wrong to say about this film. The last five minutes seem almost rushed, and it would have been nice to have seen the Company suffer a bit more, but ultimately, this film is worth it's weight in gold and worthy of all the awards it picked up in it's time. If you haven't seen this film before, and I know for a guy who's just watched it eleven years after it was first released this is hypocracy, but go out and rent it. "Philadelphia" is a gem.</fullReview>

Denzel Washington starts out as a bigot but is cured by the wonderfulness of Tom Hanks and friends. I could not buy any of these characters as real life people. They were all caricatures.The movie was totally predictable. A wonderful beloved man man with AIDS sues the evil lawyers. Guess which lawyers present a pathetic, incompetent case. Guess who wins. Guess who dies. Guess who is sad about the death.The pacing was very slow. The scene where Tom Hanks explains the Maria Callus aria goes on much too long. In the scenes with Tom Hanks giant family, all the family members have to get in their camera time.Tom Hanks does a great portrayal of a Gay man struggling against bigotry, the effects of AIDS, and the fears of AIDS. It it too bad that character was not placed in a better movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*This may contain a slight spoiler*Jonathan Demme steps into the director's chair here to direct a film targeting the social prejudice of aids and race. I heard many things about this film before I watched it, how sad it was, how good it was. And I'd have to agree with both. It really is a good film. Starting off with a superb introduction (Bruce Springsteins "streets of Philadelphia") we are entertained by a comic scene between Andy (the ever superb Tom Hanks) and Joe Miller who later fights for Andy's case (magnificently played by Denzel Washington). It really is a true and deep film, accurately portraying all the things society looks down on yet still does sub-consciously themselves. Particularly in a scene where he is fired, it really shows; prejudice is an unwanted part of society and natural reaction. Yet it is still there, deep beneath the surface. This film has everything. All in all, it is a poignant, scarily accurate drama that is powerfully spreading the word of peace and acceptance. It is only weighed down slightly by one ludicrous opera scene.Overall: 9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is a moment in the film in which I looked into his character's eyes and believed that Tom Hanks was actually gay. The commitment in his performance is monumental. The film is an episode of "The Practice" and not necessarily one of the best but if I feel inordinately happy I put "Philadelphia" on. It never fails to bring tears to my eyes. I loved Hanks in the part because I believed him so completely. The casting of Joanne Woodward is a stroke of genius. What an extraordinary actress. Her much to brief but perfect, moving, beautiful portrayal adds layers and layers to Hanks's character. We complete our understanding of him because of her. Denzel Washington is great fun to watch and as good as he is I haven't yet warmed up to him. There is something there that confuses me. Convincing in "Training Day" Unconvincing in "The Preacher's Wife" Banderas is lovely even if it was difficult to imagine him in a "Law of Desire" scene with Tom Hanks. I'm sure that a bit more explicitness about their relationship could have lifted this good movie into a great one, but probably wouldn't have made as much money. I'm not sure if I made myself clear, I'm recommending the film. I am, the qualms are all mine. Pay no attention. Hanks at his phenomenal best, Joanne Woodward and Bruce Springsteen. Of course I recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little overlong and feels it has to shout it's message but still a polished film that had more impact in 1993 than it does now</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Andrew Beckett is a successful lawyer with a major law firm and is on his way to being partner. When he contracts AIDS he hides his illness and continues work. When an important document goes missing and an important client only narrowly avoids ruin, the partners fire Beckett. He however, suspects that they have fired him due to their discovery of his sexuality and his illness and approaches Joe Miller to represent him in a trial of unfair dismissal.I remember watching this film in the cinema in 1993 or so and I notice that it's relevance and impact has changed since then. On the television in my house today (2003) I watch 6 Feet Under and The Shield, both of which have gay characters struggling with various aspects of their lives, while my wife watches Will &amp; Grace featuring several openly gay characters. I would argue that the latter doesn't make any positive contribution to the images of gay people, but certainly the latter two do. So it is against this sort of thing that the film Philadelphia doesn't really stand up as well in terms of message.The plot allows the film to look at all the various things resulting from homosexuality and AIDS in a world where it is viewed by the majority as something to be abhorred. One could argue that that society still exists but I think generally the Western world is more tolerant than it was in 93. Hence much of the message now sounds like the volume is up too loud - or that we are dumb and need the point laid out very slowly and carefully for us to understand, in fact it's almost using the words of Miller, `explain to me like I was a 6 year old'. However I am being unfair because this had more relevance in 93 and needed that approach. Some have said this film is too preachy, I don't think it is - I think it is just a little too slow and deliberate in making it's point to the point where it may feel overbearing.The film is refreshingly free of sentiment and `cry now' scenes. Instead it is pretty free of clutter and allows for a look at the wider issues rather than this one man dying. Not all questions are answered but certainly views are challenged - I just wonder whether these views are the majority now. It does go on a little long as a result, but only by 15 minutes or so.As a courtroom film it doesn't work - the case in question is pulled all over the place in order to allow the film to look at the issues. This takes away any sense of courtroom fireworks (although they are still dramatic at points) as I doubted whether the defence would allow Miller to lead them down the paths the case takes. The central story of Beckett is good but he is never allowed to be just a person -he is representing bigger things and thus, occasionally feels a little distant.I felt at the time Hanks got his Oscar for the nature of the role rather than his performance and I still feel that way. I am glad he got it though as it was a brave role to take at the time. More deserving I think was Washington, he played the more complex character and the more important to get right as he represents `the ordinary man' in this piece. Support is good from names such as Robarts, Banderas and Steenburgen but it is Washington who really holds the film together and he who is the pivotal character rather than Andy.Overall this is a glossy Hollywood film that did well to take a difficult issue and present it in a reasonably balanced light. Miller's homophobia and distaste for the sexual act works well as it allows us to follow him as he goes from seeing a sexuality or a disease and finally seeing the person behind it. Not as relevant now as it was then this is still an OK film but will be watched less and less as time goes on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What could have been a groundbreaking and moving drama gets turned into a patronizing, politically correct sermon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In making a successful, persuasive film dealing with such serious subjects as homosexuality, AIDS, prejudice, and discrimination, the trick is to be even-handed and to avoid stereotypes and black hats and white hats. In this respect, "Philadelphia" misses the mark.The film's concept is sound, and it was timely in the late 1980s/early 1990s. It could have been a solid drama about dealing with one's shortcomings, through overcoming prejudice or admitting dishonesty. Unfortunately, it gets bogged down with its own intellectual dishonesty, not helped by the sluggish courtroom drama or the screenplay's dull characters. Tom Hanks' character of Andrew Beckett, the gay lawyer with AIDS, is dreadfully dull. The scene with him "voguing" to Maria Callas while hooked up to an IV tube was particularly atrocious. He tries hard to make something out of the vapid, anodyne, PC stereotype he's given, but it just doesn't click. It certainly isn't Oscar-worthy. The liveliness and depth he would create a year later as Forrest Gump is nowhere to be found. Jason Robards and Mary Steenburgen, both fine performers, also get stuck playing boring antagonists. Denzel Washington's character, who, as the lawyer who takes Andrew's wrongful termination suit, changes from an intolerant man to a tolerant one, is the only interesting one.The film is too wrapped up in its self-satisfaction to realize its own intellectual dishonesty. The thing that caused Andrew to get AIDS, cheating on his partner (played by the woefully underused Antonio Banderas) with a perfect stranger in a gay porno theater, is glossed over. Whether he spread the virus to his partner, his reaction to the adultery, or even where their relationship stood then or at any time, go unmentioned. This might have made it a more interesting drama, but it would tarnish the halo that they try to paint over Andrew's head.It is clear that Jonathan Demme only made this film to appease those offended by supposed stereotypes of transsexuals in the far superior "The Silence of the Lambs". I didn't realize that anyone got the idea, from this movie or anywhere else, that all trannies were psycho killers. There was no intent in that film to preach or proselytize. It was just a good story with excellent performances. "Philadelphia" is offensive in its attempts to depict gays with AIDS as innocent victims while paying lip service to the reckless promiscuity that has cost far too many gay men their lives. As a film it is quite routine, and as a piece of propaganda it falls as flat as the characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>yet ANOTHER overrated film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie had the potential to tell a compelling story, but they did it all wrong.The movie had good believable acting from Hanks and Denzel Washington, but they completely failed in the way they chose to tell the story. There's just too many courtroom scenes and not enough character development, and that gets very boring and repetitive, very fast. You can't give the movie credit for the story it's TRYING to tell, because as far as I'm concerned, the story it DID tell was not told in an entertaining way, this should've been more character driven.The two main characters weren't developed enough. For one, the transformation of Denzel's feelings about gay people was not believable, there just wasn't enough shown on screen to make the viewer believe that he would have any reason to change his feelings. The way it was directed, it looked as if that opera scene is what changed Denzel's feelings about Hanks, and that's ridiculous to have someone's lifelong feelings that has been etched into their persona be changed almost because of a single incident (like I said, the way it was directed implied this). They should've shown a gradual change and made it interesting, maybe throw in a scene where Denzel protects Hanks from ridicule or something, I don't know, just show some sort of growing relationship to make the viewer care.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Garbage. The bad kind of garbage.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There ARE good kinds of garbage (e.g. Gigli) that are so, so bad that they actually become watchable. But Philadelphia is the kind of garbage that is so, so bad in a BAD way. The movie just takes itself so seriously it's simply laughable. The director likely believes that the film is a humanitarian message.Let's get this out of the way: Tom Hanks, Denzel Washington gave GREAT performances, especially Denzel. . Now, to the movie: the movie is so overly indulged in 'emotion' and musical cues that it becomes so embarrassingly sappy and unwatchable. I take solace in knowing that there are OTHER innocent people who were abused by such cringe-inducing scenes like the opera/red light scene, which counts as one of the most hideous abuses of "director's privileges" ever; an utterly embarrassing scene to watch any way you look at it. The movie is literally STUFFED with rubbish like that, like the defense attorney looks at Becket for a couple of seconds before saying, "Andrew Becket is dying", or the whole scene near the end where Becket has to take his shirt off to show the jury his lesions. The music, the bosses turning their heads away, the look on Hanks' face, Wow. The director is begging us to cry. Oh, I did feel like crying, but for a completely different reason. The only reason I feel content giving this movie one star (as opposed to the much sought-after zero stars, which exists in review titles only) is because of Denzel's performance. Avoid this piece of feces at all costs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Minority Issue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Denzel is now in a position whereby injustice is not imposed upon him. He is on the other side of the table whereby a gay person (Tom Hanks) from a minority community comes to him for representation in court as a lawyer, but is initially turned down. Denzel has his own prejudices against the gay community, but is confronted by them when he sees other people's prejudices against Tom Hanks and the gay community being expressed in a library. For a moment, Denzel places himself in history and reverses the role. He is a black man in a predominantly white library where the staff do not want him to frequent. Whilst tolerating his presence in the library, frequenters of the library choose not to sit next to him because of his difference. Denzel, a black man, now connects with Tom Hanks, a gay man, because of his difference. Philaedelphia is not a film about representing the homosexual community, it is a film about difference. The black man and the gay community represents that difference.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Script Hedged Bets Every Which Way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Others have commented on caricatures and on "heroes versus villains" simplicity of the characters. I generally agree. I should point out, however, that the plaintiff is portrayed as having succumbed to casual sex and professes to have been very naive about the etiology of HIV. As some have noted, the plaintiff's attorney is a homophobe and, Demme and the script make it clear, overcomes that tendency but a bit in the course of the film.The caricatures to which I should draw attention are the lawyers in this lawyer-laden film. Demme and the script have created a festival of lawyer jokes. The advertisements and literal jokes ["What do you call 1000 lawyers chained to the bottom of the sea?" is an example] MAY have been an attempt to analogize between stigmatized social groups [such as gays] and stigmatized occupational groups. If so, I do not believe the effect was achieved. Instead, the film plays to stereotypes and mythology about law and lawyers.Take the brief interview in which Denzel Washington's character establishes that a injured man is pushing a lawsuit without merit. Added to Washington's TV ads, the ambulance-chaser stereotype is realized -- but to what end? How does it advance anything to play to slander and innuendo about plaintiffs' attorneys? At best the viewer sees that, confronted with a genuine case, Washington turns it down to get Hanks' character out of his office.Moreover, the laughable testimony by the law partners virtually handed the plaintiff the case. Why would lawyers tell stories about Navy latrines or expound on the Bible when they knew it would hurt their case?So, when you hear that this film is sappy and politically correct, please realize that such comments are slightly off center. The film is sophomoric rather than sappy. The humanity of the Hanks character is actually realized deftly, in my viewings of the film. The film IS politically correct -- but the political correctness is in slurring lawyers as a class. It is politically correct to castigate lawyers.Could have been a much better film with a little thought and care.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, films like "And the Band Played Slowly" deal more factually about the issues dealing with AIDS. Yes, the film does "sell out" by depicting a homosexual character with AIDS who never seems to show affection for his male partner beyond a little hugging. Yes, the characters in this film are played by actors who are almost universally liked, and distract the viewers from the compelling reality that AIDS affects many people who engage in behavior that to many people is morally ambiguous. Yes, and most importantly, this film is flawed as a story because its plot is related to the status of courtroom drama.Yet, aside from these apparent roadblocks, "Philadelphia" is a beautiful drama. The beauty of this film lies in the way certain scenes captivate the soul, and unleash the universal patterns of humanity that most of us share. Take for instance, the scene where Andrew's boyfriend is angered by Andrew's apparent lack of interest in anything else other than work. The dialogue in this scene, the anger and compassion exhibited by Banderas, and the look of emotional tenderness by Hanks, is positively sublime. This scene exhibits the love these two characters share that is both tender and original. This scene is a better example of love than any make out session.There are also many other wonderful scenes. The scene where Andrew talks with his caring family, the famous opera scene with virtuoso performances by Hanks and Washington, and the final heartbreaking scene, showing Andrew as a child playing in the ocean.The theme of this film, I think, is spoken by a previous employee of Andrew's lawfirm who received HIV by transfusion. She states quite clearly that its not about who's fault it is, or why you got the disease, you just try to survive with it. Those naysayers of this film seem to miss this important point. We should all have the love of life that Andrew seems to have. Yet, we should all feel privileged to continue a life that people like Andrew lose every day. I think, what offends people the most, is that Philadelphia is not really about an issue. It is really about a human being who doesn't want to lose his life, but has bravely accepted it anyways. 8/10</fullReview>

I just realized this time that Tom Hank's "I'm ready." was part of a planned assisted suicide. I can't understand the critiques of the remarkable ensemble that produced so many nuanced performances of recognizable people. Many of the criticisms are just inaccurate. E.g., neither Hanks, nor his partner nor more than a couple of people at the "gay" party were in drag. Denzel Washinton's growth from frightened homophobe to advocate and his relationshp with Hanks was credible (I could recognize much of myself in his development). Hanks gives his character--admitedly a nice guy, very talented and loved by all who knew him, which actually happens in this world and was true of my first friend to die of AIDS--a real interior life, which included a love of opera like my own. It is of course a commercial movie with many of the conventions of commercial movies, but it moved many of us when it first appeared and it continues to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I was tremendously impressed by PHILADELPHIA when I watched it recently on cable TV, there were some things that bothered me. I thought the courtroom scenes were extremely well done except when it came time for TOM HANKS to take the witness stand. His scenes on the stand, instead of being as dramatic as the other witnesses, merely showed that he was becoming too ill to really give any insight into his character and motivations. Nothing was really revealed about the man himself.Having said that, the other obvious weaknesses were in the script which was a little too contrived at times. Furthermore, Denzel Washington's willingness to overlook his homophobic attitudes and become a buddy to Hanks was just a little too implausible. Then too, the final hospital scene with all of the family gathered around Hanks was not quite convincing.But credit must be given to Jonathan Demme's tasteful direction and to the very fine performances given by the large cast. Jason Robards, Jr. is a standout as the executive seeking to have Hanks dismissed. The only actor shortchanged by the script seems to be ANTONIO BANDERAS who is given little to do and does not really seem a plausible partner for the Hanks character. In other words, they have no chemistry together.As for TOM HANKS, he surely deserved all the awards he received as the lawyer determined to find someone who will fight for his cause. DENZEL WASHINGTON is equally effective in a difficult role, demonstrating once again that he is an actor to watch as he matures with each characterization.Absorbing all the way through--thoughtful, provocative and guaranteed to stir your interest in its delicate handling of a difficult subject.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very important film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>More than anything, Philadelphia is a story simply about people and the human nature. As the opening credits roll with Bruce Springsteen's "Streets of Philadelphia" playing, there are several shots of the camera going by many different people in the streets and inside buildings. They are doing different everyday different things like working or walking with friends. Then as the credits and song end, the attention and focus almost randomly stops at the story of two lawyers played by Hanks and Washington. They are rivals in a case, and seem like two complete opposites. Minutes later we learn that Tom Hanks has AIDs, and about 20 minutes later we learn he got fired from his job. He believes that he was fired only because his employers somehow found out he had it, and discriminated against him. He seeks the help of Denzel Washington, his last resort, and he eventually and hesitantly takes the case. By the end they actually become close friends. A lot closer than Washington's character would probably like to admit.Even though it's barely even 10 years old, Philadelphia seems a bit dated. It was made at the time when AIDS was increasing, and new things were being learned about it all the time. It used to be believed that only gays could get it, but now we know that's just not true. The employers that fired Hanks spout out clichd lines that any prejudice person would. They seem like cardboard cut-outs. But none of that matters. It's not a political movie. Like Hanks says to a reporter in one scene, "I'm not a political man. I just want justice to be done." Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington are great. Hanks obviously steals the show, but actually not by too much. It's a great performance and this is the movie that made me a Tom Hanks fan for sure.My rating: 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>AIDS-infected lawyer sues the company that fired him. Director Jonathan Demme, perhaps doing penance for making transsexuals look bad in "The Silence of the Lambs", wants to walk the fence throughout "Philadelphia", determined to show all sides and give every voice an opportunity to be heard. That's fine, but there's so much sentiment poured into the mix that it's clear Demme wants us to love and adore the Hanks character. I saw no reason for it. As tragic as the illness is, the character as written isn't very interesting or sympathetic. His family (devoted sweater-wearing types who live in a Norman Rockwell world) and his love-interest (Antonio Banderas) aren't terribly believable (Banderas is just kept around for a dance and a pat on the hand; we get little evidence of their commitment as a couple). The film looks fine and is well-made (except for those extreme close-ups of Jason Robards' snarling face: "For Chrissake, someone call a doctor!"), but it isn't an exceptionally moving picture. Instead, it's solemn, sobering, and a bit stand-offish. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

Philadelphia belongs to the second group, because it portrays AIDS and homosexuality, two things that were not common to films before. It features great acting, and an incredible song score.It falters, though, for the lack of insight between Hanks' and Banderas' relationship, the suprisingly supportive family Hanks has, and the last minute melodramatic ending.This is a film that people, especially film buffs, should see, but I doubt one will see it more than once.</fullReview>

And I doubt the trial would have been won in real life in the 90's. As time progresses, the law is getting behind more discriminated minorities, but not then. The movie was wonderful, stirring, moving. It left me with hope, that the world may get better for gays and aids victims. But it left me crying imagining my own child in that position. I also speak all of this as a Christian who believes that the act of homosexual sex is a sin, but we are all sinners, aren't we?

		<fullReview>We are students in a French high school in Caen in normandy and we have watched Philadelphia in our English class: we have felt like writing a review on it. Philadelphia is a very interesting film because it deals with a topical subject.In fact, the scene takes place in Philadelphia in the nineties. It is the story of Andrew Becket, a brilliant young lawyer who had Aids and this is precisely the reason why he has been fired by his employers, Wyant and wheeler, the most prestigious firm. Andy decides to sue them for discrimination with the help of Joe Miller, a black lawyer. We think that this kind of film is very interesting because they make us think about our prejudiced society and how Aids sufferers cope with discrimination. It also shows what should be done to make people more tolerant. We had many emotions thanks to the actors who successfully act : it is easy to know what they feel. Andrew is pictured as a very courageous man: he faces his problem with dignity. He is also staightforward, honest as he doesn't hide his disease to Joe. joe Miller, in spite of his prejudices is very brave because prosecuting the biggest firm in Philadelphia is very dangerous and difficult. He shows that anybody can change his mind and mentality. Charles wheeler and his partner exactly represent what our society can be : hypocritical and intolerant,even narrow-minded.Each character symbolyzes an attitude, a state of mind , a mentality. In the role of Andy Beckett, Tom Hawks is prestigious. We feel what he feels, we can be in his shoes and the most important thing is that when looking at his face, we feel socially dead too. As to Denzel Washington, he is wonderful too. We can identify to both of them. Our favorite scene in the film in the one which takes place at the library. As a matter of act, we realize that joe is not a stone-hearted man because he is the only one who doesn't reject Andy. On the contrary he stands up for him and finally decides to help him. To conclude, we think that such films are very useful : it can make mentalities evolve. It gives us food for thought.Aurlien Julien Outhone Richard</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1993 was the right time to be making a film about the scourge of HIV &amp; AIDS and Jonathan Demme found a good, simple story with which to confront its realities and mourn its victims. Nonetheless, it's a film that could so easily have been glib, excessive or woolly.No fear. A cynic might reasonably suggest that Hanks had the Oscar in the bag at being cast in such a role but his memorable performance was probably still in the minds of those considering Gump a year down the line. Denzel Washington underplays his Damascene lawyer a bit but fires up for the courtroom confrontation. Banderas, Steenburgen and the foul Jason Robards are excellent.Demme doesn't do things by halves and it's a strong film. However I could really do without the Callas-lacquered set-piece nigh the end which does the opposite of that for which it is intended, irritating rather than delivering the emotional home run. 7/10</fullReview>

Denzel Washington is so good in this role specially the scene where Hanks get him to listen to his favorite opera. This scene is just stunning. Everyone of us has his/her own pains and this piece of music with Washington almost tearing, really gets your goose pumps. There are so many special moments in this movie other than the opera part. There is for instance, Denzel's famous line "consider me a three years old kid", the last court scenes and the over all goal of the movie which is to say that no body has the right to judge you, destroy your career even if you are dying, and most importantly consider himself a God above your sins no matter what were they and chooses to treat you like shiiiiit. I guess this strong message was well delivered by the team of this movie.No need to talk about Jonathan Demme I guess.

		<shortDescription>Good acting, fair directing, weak plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Hanks has AIDS, from the start of the film. He gets sacked when one of his bosses realises.When the film came out I could not be bothered to see another courtroom drama whose conclusion I could foresee. But Tom looks the part, and acts it well. It is true that you can foresee the conclusion, but Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington, and pretty much every one (including Antonio Banderas as Tom Hank's lover) do a pretty good job.What is it about Tom Hanks? It is not as if he really looked like any of the gays I have known, or that he really pulled of being dying. But he always manages to entice the audience in, to make them believe in something, I am not sure what, perhaps that Tom is the person he is playing. I wonder if Tom Hanks exist in real life. Tom Hanks the actor is just beautiful to watch.The "Opera Scene" did not do it for me. I am uncouth but I have heard some opera. I know that it can be really moving. But Tom, eyes shut, giving a weepy commentary to some Aria made me think that Demme (the director) had seen and was moved by the penultimate (and other) scenes of Amadeus. The camera spirals down on the weeping Tom giving commentary to Maria Callas, and the "single clarinet" (or was it cello?) But F. Murray Abraham does a fair sight better with his interpretation of Mozart (in Amadeus, 1983)...."Then suddenly - high above it - an oboe, a single note, hanging there unwavering, till a clarinet took over and sweetened it into a phrase of such delight! This was no composition by a performing monkey! This was a music I'd never heard. Filled with such longing, such unfulfillable longing, it had me trembling. It seemed to me that I was hearing a voice of God."But that was all an aside. In Philadelphia, Tom Hanks is very convincing as a dying gay. Denzel Washington is fairly convincing as a homophobe that overcomes. And, despite being a film about a guy dying, it is even a cheerful, and almost not corny flick. Watch it on video. It is well worth the rental.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent, well-acted drama reliant on pity for its effects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just read some of the comments after having seen the movie for the first time this evening. I am surprised by how much it affects people - and I suspect it is really due to the fact that the movie naturally generates pity for a sweet character who dies at a young age.I think the movie's purposes are confused.Clearly it is not meant to be a gripping courtroom drama - all witnesses stick to their stories, there are no twists or otherwise surprising changes in testimony. That may be realistic but it's not dramatic - we simply sympathize with the suffering Hanks.If meant as a realistic character-driven drama of two different people, it doesn't really work. The movie just doesn't show enough of the characters' lives to make them whole characters whom we feel we really know. Hanks and Washington remain somewhat generic characters: the establishment, semi- closeted homosexual and the ignorant prejudiced man serving as the surrogate for the audience.So is the drama really about the conversion of the bigoted? Only glancingly. The formula for such movies is how the initially selfish or materialistic or indifferent or even hateful character sheds his/her former skin and through association with the injured character sees the terrible injustice/danger of whatever the movie seeks to urge.The Denzel Washington character used to be a Jane Fonda specialty. Whether it was:a) the lame brave Julia (Vanessa Redgrave) converting Jane Fonda's initially materialistic Lillian Hellman in "Julia",b) the pained nuclear plant worker (Jack Lemmon) converting the initially vain success-focused reporter (Jane Fonda) to the dangers of nuclear power in The China Syndrome,c) the disabled Vietnam veteran (Jon Voight) converting the initially shallow officer's wife (Jane Fonda) to the "true meaning" of male sexuality and the evil of the Vietnam War in Coming Home - or later,d) the injured and gang-raped Jodi Foster converting the initially cold and success-oriented Assistant District Attorney (Kelly McGillis) to the horror of gang rape in The Accused, ore) the shattered wife/widow of the missing radical in South America in Missing (Sissy Spacek) converting the politically credulous and conservative businessman played by Jack Lemmon to the evil of an American-supported regime.In each of these, the suffering character must be presented in a very sympathetic light to draw the audience's surrogate, the initially hostile/indifferent character, to the light. Although I did very much pity the suffering of the AIDS victim played by Tom Hanks, the conversion just wasn't made that interesting. We didn't really KNOW Washington's character well enough to be moved by it.So is the movie meant to change our minds or alert us to a social problem? If so, it's far too late. I found amazing the comments that this movie, made in 1993, was brave or unusual in addressing AIDS and prejudice. It was in 1984 that I recall seeing on Broadway, both As Is (presented on television in 1986) and The Normal Heart. They won awards - presented on national television.There had long since been television movies such as An Early Frost (1985); the book, "And The Band Played On" was a best-seller and widely reviewed and discussed when published in 1987. From Armistead Maupin's newspaper serialized and popular book Tales of the City in the 1980s (also made into a television series) to groups like ActUp (founded in 1987), there had been a flow of information and drama about AIDS for almost a decade. I believe the play, Angels in America" was already on Broadway by 1993 -a far more savage look at the social consequences of AIDS. I think the play, Falsettoland about AIDS, had also already been nationally acclaimed by the time of this movie's release.Moreover, from about late 1983, demonstrators appeared wherever Reagan officials appeared, to chant for more to be done about AIDS; Gay Pride protests had become massive AIDs protests throughout the 1980s. It was rare in most of the 1980s, NOT to hear about the disruption of services at St. Patrick's and other cathedrals or of the St. Patrick's Day Parades in every city - due to angry protests about AIDS. Similarly, the drumbeat about how AIDS was, and was not contracted, was pretty loud by 1985.AIDS protests, AIDS marathons, AIDS dance-athons, organizations such as GHMC and the roles of Mathilde Krim and Elizabeth Taylor in raising funds for AIDS research, Congressional hearings, the AIDS quilt, raging discussions about whether homosexuality was engendered biologically or environmentally -- these were the very stuff of the news in the 1980s - in presidential debates, on television news every night.And then long after, in the middle of the 1990s came Philadelphia with its antideluvian villains. In fact, at one point in the movie, Hanks' character is asked whether by 1984 or 1985 (when he had the scene in the theater), he had not known that unprotected sex might lead to AIDS. He says no! Yet such information had been omnipresent for at least a year, two years by that time. As herald of a social problem, Philadelphia seems to have been made for another country or an earlier decade.Similarly, if the movie meant the audience to believe that the character played by Jason Robards (described as brilliant, incisive, and well-educated) and all his partners, were truly fearful of contracting AIDS from an attorney in the office, the idea was simply bizarre for such bright people in one of America's most cosmopolitan cities by the mid-1990s.If instead, the movie meant to show that the villains DID know there was no danger of contraction, but simply wished to exclude homosexuals from their law firm, using AIDS as an excuse (the likelier meaning given the different treatment meted the woman who contracted AIDS from a blood transfusion), then prejudice about AIDS victims was really not the issue in this movie but a mask: the issue is really the acceptance of homosexuality. If this is so, the movie does little to tackle the issue except to present a decent person who is homosexual. That isn't substantial enough to really affect people's opinions.The movie mainly shows the growing suffering of Hanks - which certainly causes sorrow and pity - but isn't very dramatic. We'd probably feel the same for the fatal suffering of anyone presented as good, despised and too young to die - the victim of any disease or accident.Hanks and Washington, Joanne Woodward and Mary Steenburgen, Jason Robards are all first rate in their roles - particularly Hanks who is very credible as the saintly sufferer. I certainly don't begrudge Hanks his Oscar - he gives a fine performance - but the Academy's reaction to the movie as a whole, seems to me to be primarily an attempt to show common feeling with the unfairness of excluding homosexuals and sympathy for AIDS sufferers- not really a judgment on this movie.The movie does indeed induce bathos - but this decent movie just didn't have anything to say beyond what had been said for a decade - and wasn't imaginative enough to create whole rounded characters that would have meant a memorable drama. It wants the audience to feel sorry for someone - and we certainly do. To that limited degree, it succeeds.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie displays array of multiple emotions, it made me feel passionate, sorry, angry and sad at the same time. There are not many movies on this subject lurking around. it's one of those that when one makes it, it is hard to make another one about the same subject, and it really targets crucial issues of mid-late 20th century. Great act by Tom Hanks which, honestly, i was kind of expecting, followed by the dramatic scenes in "The Green mile" or in "Forrest Gump". All and all, Judging the entire effect of the movie, it was amazing. "Philadelphia is a good movie and it is especially outstanding for its time 1993, what is the most important that this movie actually provided information of how people who are infected with HIV feel like until it turns into AIDS.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I adore, the City of Brotherly Love. Philadelphia is a heartfelt and beautiful movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie made me cry like a baby when I first saw it, and still does now. It shows humanity, compassion, love and loss. People really can be beautiful if they try just a little. This ground-breaking, historically-significant, and realistic film from director, Jonathan Demme was one of the first major mainstream studio produce films to confront the AIDS issue from a medical, political, and societal point of view. Inspired by the true stories of attorneys Geoffrey Bowers &amp; Clarence B. Cain, who, successfully sued the law firm that fired them in one of the first AIDS discrimination cases of wrongful dismissal. The movie loosely create a similar fictional story of a gay lawyer, Andrew Becket (Tom Hanks), having to sue his law firm over job discrimination when he got contracted with HIV/AIDS virus, with the help of a personal injury lawyer/friend, Joe Miller (Denzel Washington). Written by Ron Nyswaner, the movie had some controversy when it was first released, because how similar, the fictional story of Philadelphia was to Geoffrey Bowers. The family of Bowers, sued the writers and producers of the film, because of this, but it was quickly settled out of court. Although this movie was well-intentioned and compelling, it was also criticized by gay groups at the time, for the studio trying to attempted to block the casting of the HIV-positive, actor Ron Vawternote , until director Jonathan Demme pointed out how hypocritical this would be in the face of the film's message. Another thing, that got gay groups mad, is downplaying the affectionate romance between Andrew Becket and his lover, Miguel Alvarez (Antonio Banderas); as well, as not allowing the character to seem like anything less than the patron saint of AIDS victims. Yes, the character seem like American Boy Scout, however, in my opinion, I don't mind, the many compromises for mainstream audiences. After all, it got me, to watch the movie, when I wouldn't have watch it, otherwise. If anything, the main character of the film is arguably Joe, as he is the one to go through character development. It's nice to see him, warm up to the idea of helping Andrew, without feeling too preachy. Coming after HBO-TV docu-drama, 'And the Band Played On' about the growing AIDS crisis. The presence of two major American straight actors, Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington really helped to broaden awareness about the problematic disease. It also help bridged actor Tom Hanks' earlier career as a comedian to the more sober and serious side of his dramatic career. Tom Hanks is amazing in this role. The fact that Hanks lost 35 pounds and thinned his hair in order to appear sickly for the role, shows how committed he was, to the role. He really gave a deeply felt, carefully nuanced performance that deserves an Oscar. I'm pretty glad, he did win, Best Actor that year. I also love the fact that Hanks' Oscar acceptance speech, also help inspired the conflict in 1997's In &amp; Out. It's also funny to hear that Denzel Washington, on the other hand, was asked to gain a few pounds for his role. Washington, to the chagrin of Hanks, who practically starved himself for the role, would often eat chocolate bars in front of him. Wow, what a joker! The drama also made effective use of the music. 'Philadelphia' has some of the best music, made for a film. Composer Howard Shore's 'Precedent" is still one of the purest track I have ever heard. Then, there are the fans and critic's favorite song, 'Streets of Philadelphia' by singer, Bruce Springsteen whom music video and the opening of the movie, able to shows the city in all its aspects ? both the bright, shiny downtown landmarks, and the poor areas ? minority, homeless, urban blight, and decay. While, it is a tear-jerking song. In my opinion, the song that deserve the Oscar, wasn't Bruce Springsteen, but music artist, Neil Young's song, 'Philadelphia'. In my opinion, the film without Neil Young's song, wouldn't have touched as many as it did, because of it. That song still makes me cry, when I hear it. It's such as a beautiful journey of emotional. Overall: This groundbreaking and moving drama is absolutely astonishing. A must watch for anybody with a heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Touching and emotional eye opening legal drama that shows fight for your rights no matter who you are!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Philadelphia" might be 1993's best film for one it's relative for the fact that it was based on a real life case in the city during the 1980's and it's theme of AIDS, discrimination, and homophobia, is downright appealing. And the performances and acting from both Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington makes the film a winner as their chemistry is unmatched. From the opening scenes of the city the song from Bruce Springsteen called "Streets of Philadelphia" really draws you into the movie.Based on a true story in the city of Philadelphia, Pa Andrew(in Tom Hank's best role)is a hot young lawyer at a big high dollar firm and after years of being with the firm he's suddenly let go. The law firm members claim because of on the job performance yet it's much more it's discrimination and it's because he has AIDS the horrible new disease on the block for gay men especially. So it's a visit to Joe(in a wonderful supporting turn from Denzel Washington)a tough and macho type money hungry ambulance chasing lawyer who takes his case of discrimination by bringing a lawsuit for personal and emotional damages against the high powered law firm. Overall this legal drama turns into a case of courage to overcome bigotry and corruption. The performance from Hanks is one to remember as he proves stand up and fight for rights and equality no matter who you might be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dated and Cheesy, but the Performances Shine,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Philadelphia is a good movie with a reasonably well developed storyline and an outstanding cast. The highlight of the film and the thing that holds it all together is without a doubt the performances, Tom Hanks is a down on his luck homosexual, he is believable in every moment, a well deserved Oscar win. Denzel Washington also shines as his homophobic lawyer who is still willing to win his case, the bond that forms between them throughout the movie is terrific and the main reason I did not rate this lower. My main disappointment was that it was, to put it bluntly, cheesy, we are expected to care for these characters before we even know anything about them, and it was clear that the director was hoping to have us in tears. The delivery of the emotional scenes was too straight forward that you could not get teary eyed. This may not be a problem for some viewers, but I found it very dated, it's hard to get sucked in to a story about gay rights when that has improved so much today, as well as that it portrays AIDS as a deadly disease, which of course it was back then, but today it's not a big deal which makes it harder to feel genuine concern for Andrew. While it has many imperfections, the performances are terrific and if you're a fan of Hanks and Washington, which you certainly should be, then it's worth the watch. When a gay lawyer is unfairly fired from work, he hires a homophobic man to take the case. Best Performance: Tom Hanks</fullReview>

Maybe the average viewer doesn't appreciate the nod, but it's not lost on the rest of us.Strangely, as Tom Hanks' disease progresses, he looks increasingly like David Hyde Pierce. Coincidence?

		<fullReview>Philadelphia was an excellent movie but you don't need me to tell you that. It starred two heavy hitters in Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington; so really, what needs more to be said? At that time Tom was sizzling hot. He had done A League of Their Own and Sleepless in Seattle then Philadelphia. He would go on to do Forest Gump, Apollo 13 and others. So, needless to say, Tom Hanks crushed it. He played a challenging role and he played it well.Denzel is Denzel. He may not have a trophy case full of the big awards or the box office dollars that some other lesser actors have, but that's due to his qualitative selection of roles, not his inability to act.I'm just glad I was able to see two heavy weights be on the screen together in their prime. The subject matter was jarring--homosexuality and AIDS--and Hanks and Washington put on a clinic. Only if Mayweather and Pacquiao could've done the same.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to ignore the idea that the primary thrust behind "Philadelphia" is an entreaty to have a serious talk about AIDS; which meant a lot more back in 1993 when the fear was more palpable. But you can't talk about that disease without also discussing homosexuality, so the movie hasn't lost its compelling edge. And the really nice thing about it is that it plays the material straight and doesn't overdo things (even during the more dramatic moments). This could easily drift into Oscar bait, but it never does (at least, to me). Sure, a lot of it's hard to stomach, but it's some powerful stuff, and characters aren't just cardboard cutouts just dropped in there for the convenient teachable moment. And it's funny how the Oscars work; it's evident that Tom Hanks gave an award-worthy performance (transformation and all), but I was genuinely surprised that Denzel Washington was completely looked over by the Academy. This is one of my favorite Denzel performances.And on the whole, a pretty great movie.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Astoundingly powerful and moving, complete with vibrant performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom hanks and Denzel Washington, some of Hollywood's most powerful actors, come together in this powerful drama about fighting for your rights and equality. Tom Hanks plays Andrew Beckett who works at a Philadelphia law firm. When he is fired by his employers when they not only learn about his homosexuality, not also learn he has been diagnosed with AIDS, he sets out to find a defense attorney to support him in a case against his unfair termination. Unable to find an attorney due to his condition, he enlists the help of a personal injury lawyer Joe Miller (Washington) to assist him in the case.Philadelphia fell thoroughly nothing short of a timely and deeply riveting story, and succeeds at both a courtroom drama and a family drama. This film boasts some enthralling performances from a stellar cast including Antonio Banderas, who plays the love partner of the main character. Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington deliver some vibrant performances. These two demonstrate amazing chemistry, the bond between their characters felt so strong and realistic. Over time, you learn to gradually care for these characters more and gain a strong feel of their emotions, and the script does an amazing job with this. It is no surprise that Tom Hanks landed his first Oscar for his performance. It is surprising however, that Washington didn't receive a nomination for this genuine performance. The story is very beautifully written and moves so well, while both managing its main plot line dealing with the court case and the subplot about Hanks's character forming a bond with his family when they learn about his terminal illness. There is no doubt that this very powerful, very moving, and does not fail to grab at your heart strings.Philadelphia is one of the best films with Tom Hanks as well as Denzel Washington. It is astoundingly powerful and moving, and an amazing piece of artwork that is not easy to forget. To be warned, a box of tissues may be necessary.</fullReview>

The nature of the premise is inevitably appealing but unfortunately the script is very academic : statement of the facts, trial, verdict, done deal. Scenes follow each other very linearly, without much tension, and despite high stakes you never really get carried away by story whose mise-en-sc?ne is sometimes too melodramatic.

This is about a struggle, of a promising young counsel(lawyer as few others call them) against people who hired him for his skills and later threw him out of the company. The basis of the protagonist getting fired gets the centerpiece of attention. There were no flashy dialogues on the part of Hanks nor was Washington's over the top dialogue delivery very prominent. The blend of two styles of acting was the best combination. What proceeds next is the struggle against prejudices in the society,and at its time, it was a valid point to cut across.

		<shortDescription>This Movie Changed Tom Hanks Career</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie changed Tom Hanks career from silly (but enjoyable) comedies to Oscar winner and candidate for all the top scripts, Plot In A Paragraph: When successful Philadelphia lawyer Andrew Beckett (Tom Hanks) is fired for alleged incompetence, he believes it is because his employers found out he had AIDS. When nobody will take his case, he turns to homophobic, small time TV lawyer Joe Miller (Denzel Washington) to sue for wrongful dismissal.What needs to be bared in mind when watching this movie now, if you have not seen it before, is that when this was released AIDS was still a death sentence, it was an incurable disease that had recently claimed the life of rock legend Freddie Mercury. The discrimination, fear, prejudice and panic reaction was really what it was like.Giving a career best performance, Tom Hanks deservedly won the Oscar for this movie, and in reality he could have won it in many other years too. His performance is THAT good. Denzel Washington, who I'm not really a fan of, because in every movie he is in, race comes in to it. And this movie is no exception and it is the fuel behind him taking Beckett's case, after initially turning him down for "personal reasons" as he sees Beckett receiving the same kind of discrimination he has faced all his life. Ron Vawter (who was actually dying of AIDS himself when he made this movie) is also excellent, as is Antonio Banderas (in his first good role) as Miguel, Beckett's boyfriend.Bruce Springsteen also deservedly won the Oscar for his brilliant song "Streets Of Philadelphia".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A significant film in the history of America and even the world over. It's an important film in terms of Gay rights and even the discrimination for the AIDS patients. Never before this movie was such a strong case was build up for the fight against discrimination of AIDS patient. Based on a true story, PHILADELPHIA is movie that is made well and made throughly engagingly and is completely empathizing the victim of discrimination and the victim of AIDS. Tom Hanks as Andrew Beckett gave a great performance, with all the nuances touching the notes of perfection, and making me empathize with him. It;s not sympathy, people like him need, it's empathy. They don't tear drops they need people who stand by them. Denzel Washington as Joe Miller, fought his case and fought it hard to win not just compensation for Beckett, but also glory fro him and he made history with this. Kudos to Jonathan Demme, to have made it with a poise that deeply moving and at the same time having a reality check completely in place so that it is not dramatized out of proportion. It's a case that's well fought with an ardor and decency that we see in good cases fought between good people. Andrew Beckett was good but he was Gay, his partner is Antonio Banderas as Miguel Alvarez. Antonio gave a subdued and a good performance. Indeed everyone played their part well, be it the kids of Joe Miller too. I liked the acting of everyone, but it was a Tom Hanks movie. Yet, I loved Denzel Washington's poise more than anyone else, in the film. Now, coming to the production, firstly kudos to the studios Tristar to have accepted a subject which in 1993 was still considered a taboo and bring out a brave film. Thanks Tristar for trusting in Jonathan Demme, a master in his own way who had to struggle a lot to establish himself as director.Now, the dialogs are good. The case was terrific I must say, mostly convincing arguments, it just goes to a peak when Miller asks Beckett to open his shirt. Rest all was great in a very very important trial and a historical case. A great movie that has a relevance of taking up a social issue and fighting it to the core. This is a for sure 4/5 from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A heart-tugger from the darkest days of the AIDS epidemic and public disdain for the gay community. It holds our hand a bit more than is really necessary, and tirelessly beats us over the head with its point, but it feels like that sort of treatment was somewhat necessary for such a controversial issue in the early '90s. Tom Hanks is revelatory in the lead role, balancing his usual bubbling vat of character with a potent, hard-edged determination to fight for the justice he's due. Not to harp on the morality of the times too much, but I don't think it can be understated how important this casting was, both for the film and its lead actor. The level of good-natured, approachable personality that Hanks wears on his chest is crucial to humanizing the character, making him more than just the sick, faceless member of an alien culture. That we'd laughed with him so many times already makes it all the more powerful to see him near death, struggling to remain upright in bed as the disease ravages his body. Denzel Washington fails to keep pace as his moderately scummy, though well-spoken lawyer, an awkward personification of the ugly, ignorant target audience, but he nails a few convincing courtroom speeches and has his come-to-Jesus moment, which is all we really need from the role. It can get clunky at times, but Philadelphia's message remains potent and profound, even amidst the vastly-shifted modern landscape.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a path breaking movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a dying man, to fight for his rights requires a lot of courage. And there could be no one better than Tom Hanks to portray this. He is undoubtedly the best actor in today's age.Denzel Washington's first reaction when he learns about Tom's disease and cautiously scrutinizes every item touched by Tom, exposes the prejudices of literate, educated people, mainly due to their own ignorance. Unfortunately, even today these prejudices exist. And the helpless, distraught look on Tom's face after being let down for the tenth time by another prejudiced lawyer is heart wrenching. The court room scenes are the highlight of the movie. The cruel, cold-hearted treatment Tom Hanks is subjected to is a lesson for all of us on the need to be sensitive to others state of mind. But even today, even when we all know who is guilty and who is innocent, we still need to prove it in the court of law. Having a supportive family is good, but we live in a society and we also need them to accept us for our distinct nature and individualism. Slowly, Denzel realizes that he is not just fighting for a law that has been broken, a lot more than the law has been broken and that is what he is fighting for.The songs at the beginning and ending of the movie are aptly worded and sung to perfection.All in all a beautiful, sensitive movie and a path breaking one too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Superb movie. Moving, intelligent, insightful, and very socially relevant. The central plot may be predictable, but the sub-plots, moral, legal and ethical issues, and pure human drama are far from unoriginal. Moreover, director Jonathan Demme's telling of the story is very sensitively done. Direction is perfect - camera angles (lots of facial close-ups), pacing, editing (no excess scenes, and no spoon-feeding of information) - all are spot-on.Casting is perfect, and the cast delivers in spades. Tom Hanks delivers probably the performance of his life, and considering his incredible acting talent and body of work, that says a lot. He well deserved his Oscar.He is well supported by Denzel Washington, Jason Robards and Antonio Banderas.Surely one of the most socially relevant movies of the 90s, if not of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hanks and Denzel Give Legendary Performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Impression- Being one of the first mainstream movies to tackle the AIDS/Homophobic topic, it does a great job at bringing both sides to the story. It shows the reality that there were quite a few people not okay being around Gay's. This is an issue that still exists today, which is why the movie will live on for many years to come. It also didn't remind me of any other AIDS related movies, which makes it unique.Praise- This movie contains 2 of the best performances that Denzel Washington and Tom Hanks have given in their career. At the time Hanks wasn't known for many dramatic roles as he was primarily in comedic roles. Obviously now we know him as one of the greatest actors of all time. Hanks really does pull off the emotional side very well. As for Washington, I really liked that they didn't just make him right away erase his homophobia. For a man who was raised a certain way I would have had a hard time believing him automatically accepting the case. So I'm glad that even at times during the case he admitted he's still bothered by homosexuals. Antonio Banderas was decent with limited screen time, but the real stars were Hanks and Washington. I'm very surprised Denzel wasn't nominated for an Oscar that year. Could have been because it rarely happens that 2 actors from the same movie both get lead nominations. Considering this movie involves him as much as it involved Hanks.Complaints (Minor)- Throughout the movie there are weird camera angles. And I actually found myself distracted at times. it seemed like the director/cinematographer decided they wanted to shoot this movie with as many close ups as possible on each actor. It was like in TV shows when actors look directly into the camera and break the 'Fourth Wall', well this movie often showed the actors looking into the camera probably for dramatic effect, which didn't really add much. Another minor complaint was the pacing. I felt it started off intriguing but then for a good 30 minutes it felt slow and barely involved the lead character. Jonathan Demme is usually good with this, as in Silence of the Lambs, its paced perfectly.Final Thoughts- It's a very good movie, with legendary performances from the lead, but wasn't perfect. Its good for anyone who likes Tom Hanks, or was interested in the story of how some people with AIDS were mistreated. 8.1/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inspirational message about the values of life ... and the value of life ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I could describe "Philadelphia" in one word, it would be 'powerful'. And the film has not one power but plenty of them. First, it tackles an extremely touchy subject: "modern society's general intolerance against AIDS" and deals with it in an always tactful and never stereotypical manner. It then renders very well what might be perceived as the common opinion. But it's also capable of approaching a difficult subject with a social realism with never neglecting the emotional side. Yes, homosexuals, much more those who're struck by AIDS, fight for tolerance but it's also about respect, esteem, love in the Biblical sense that we all should love each other. Finally, what is probably its greatest strength, "Philadelphia" invites us for a general understanding, and that also applies to the roots of homophobia. Indeed, in a very thought-provoking way, the script intelligently highlights some unconscious aspects of our cultures. It's not against the idea of establishing norms but banishing everything that is outside it. Still, a character like Denzel Washington's Joe Miller who defends Tom Hanks' character Andrew Beckett despite his blatant displays of homophobic prejudices is less an alibi for the viewer than a subtle way to tunnel us through a character we'd easily identify with in the road for tolerance, well if not total tolerance, at least understanding.And that's why "Philadelphia" is such a challenging experience: by relying on two main characters: it never falls in the trap of sentimentalism. Andrew Beckett is the victim of a horrible injustice: a young lawyer promised to a brilliant career in a prestigious Law firm, respected and admired by his boss, a charismatic and intimidating Jason Robards, he's suddenly fired when they found out he had AIDS, after an obvious machination made-up to prove his incompetence. For us, viewers, it's an open-and-shut case, Andy Beckett is on the right side, and deserves to get a consequent indemnity. But the guy is dying anyway, so money is not the point, the essential is elsewhere. Part of this essential lies on the character of Miller, he observes Andy, with a double disdain first, for both his homosexuality and disease, and progressively, learns in the process, the true meaning of the word 'empathy', being able to dilute all your prejudices just for once to see life from another's perspective. It's an eye-opening experience for both Miller and the viewer. And there's one extraordinary moment in the film that illustrates that, with no need of words. Miller is introduced as a wised up lawyer, who gets his kick through appearing in media. He proudly asserts his manhood to his wife. His behavior even flirts with cowardice when he's teased in a bar because he defends a homosexual and then only justifies it by the fact that what was done against the law, not against his principles. And last but not least, it's the same Miller who violently rejects a homo who was flirting with him. The guy seems incurable, even the gay party in Andy's house doesn't impact him, but then the pivotal moment occurs when he witness Andy's total immersion in his favorite opera moment. Andy is so desperate to live his last hours at their fullest that what he inspires at the very moment, is a human, universal attachment to life. After that, Miller feels an urge to go back home. He wakes up his baby daughter and tenderly kisses her and then he embraces his wife at bed. "Philadelphia" is less about AIDS, about homosexual rights, about tolerance, than it's a wonderful lesson about life.These moments are quite rare in the film, unfortunately I would say, but when they happen, it's so intense, so meaningful that it redeems all the little flaws that might be pointed out. The trial in itself is not the highlight and suffers from some conventionality, my point is not to be negative toward "Philadelphia", but there's a reason the film wasn't nominated for more major Awards like Best Directing for Jonathan Demme (who signed the successful "Silence of the Lambs" two years later). The fact is that "Philadelphia" essentially relied on actors' performances, on a screenplay, on Bruce Springsteen's classic "Streets of Philadelphia" and Neil Young's tear-jerking "Philadelphia" that concludes the film. What have all these elements in common? They drive emotion, and emotion is "Philadelphia"'s greatest strength. It's about these feelings that govern our lives, love and family, the short moments featuring Joanne Woodward are absolutely beautiful. There's naturally the love between Andy and Antonio Banderas as his companion: Miguel. There are not many intimate scenes between the two men, but then again, it's about love. Do we need to see a man and a woman making love to get the point? Tom Hanks won his first Oscar for his spectacular performance, carried by such a realistic make-up that it reminded me my first entrance in AIDS' knowledge, and the way some pictures used to traumatize me. I was like Miller too, having a lot of preconceived ideas, thinking that I could have AIDS 'just like that'. Maturity helping, I'm able to see the film for what it is, a powerful message about the value of life, and the values it should stand for: Family, solidarity, friendship, understanding, earning a deserving place as AFI's 20th Most Inspirational Movies, Beckett was in the hero's list not as a martyr I guess but as a human being who delivered a poignant message for universal tolerance and love between people.And all those who loved Andy paid a last tribute in one of the saddest and emotional movie's conclusions ever. My father who shares the same old-fashions ideas as Miller cried like a baby, I guess it was not just Young's haunting music that cut straight to his heart, he simply could respond to the loss of someone loved, regardless of his sexuality. It's all about love. That's the eye-opening power of "Philadelphia".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>many individuals viewing the film would have little difficulty sympathizing with a person afflicted with HIV/AIDS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Hanks plays Andrew Beckett who is a gay attorney afflicted with HIV and is beginning to show symptoms of AIDS. Andrew's character is portrayed with a serious nature to coincide with the film's intentions of addressing the segregation and discrimination issues experienced by a person with HIV/AIDS in our society. Denzel Washington plays Joe Miller who is also an attorney. At times, Miller's character provides some comic relief from the seriousness of the issues presented in the film. Philadelphia (1993) focuses on a lawsuit which is filed by Andrew Beckett against his former employers. The lawsuit claims discrimination simply because Andrew beings to show signs of being afflicted with AIDS. Mary Steenbergen plays Belinda Conine the attorney for the law firm in which Andrew is suing for wrongful termination.The theme of Philadelphia (1993) deals with bringing the issues of racism against those afflicted with HIV/HIV to light. Simply stated, the theme is no one, not even, a person with HIV/AIDS should have to endure discrimination and segregation in their lifetime. Mississippi Burning (1988) addresses discrimination and segregation issues surrounding African Americans in the south on the basis of the color of their skin. Although, the plot details of Philadelphia (1993) and Mississippi Burning (1988) are different, the themes of the movies are based on the same premise which is discrimination and segregation should not exist in a civilized society, but yet it does.The setting of this film takes place in Philadelphia the birth place of the Declaration of Independence. According to the Founding Fathers of America, all are supposed to have equal rights which should include people with HIV/AIDS. Using the title of Philadelphia, and having Andrew Beckett's story be told in Philadelphia, supports the theme of the film. The setting and overall plot of the film is supported by the use of a theme song the "Streets of Philadelphia" by Bruce Springsteen.The plot of Philadelphia encompasses educating viewers about how a lesion looks and where lesions can appear on the body of a person showing signs of AIDS. Makeup artists, lighting crews, camera people, and the director of Philadelphia did a phenomenal job of presenting a very unpleasant aspect associated with AIDS to the audience during Miller's redirect in court regarding the lesions which were present on Andrew's face when the brief was lost. The presentation of the topic of lesions throughout the film supported a rationale of why individuals with HIV/AIDS are often segregated and discriminated against which is fear of the unknown.The realization and fear of death from HIV/AIDS are addressed during the film in a profound, memorable, and moving scene between Miller and Beckett. The scene encompasses Miller listening to and watching Andrew as he explains an opera song playing while moving about with an IV pole. The combination of: the varying levels of the opera song heard, the dialogue spoken, the multiple camera angles used, and the lighting of both Andrew and Miller during the scene convey to the audience that Andrew will die soon from AIDS. This particular scene is included in the film to address another rationalization of why individuals segregate and discriminate against individuals with HIV/AIDS which is the fear of death.The director Jonathan Demme's use of sounds and varying camera angles coupled with superb editing techniques employed by Craig McKay created a film that moves fluently from beginning to end. The plot of the film moves forward toward helping the audience realize how it must feel for a person afflicted with HIV/AIDS to be discriminated against in our civilized society. The theme of the film is communicated to the audience in a way that many individuals viewing the film would have little difficulty sympathizing with a person afflicted with HIV/AIDS. Moreover, many people who view the film may find it more difficult to segregate and discriminate against individuals afflicted with HIV/AIDS in the future based on the material presented throughout the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ron Nyswaner wrote this story based on an actual event. Directed by Jonathan Demme, it relates the story of Andrew Beckett (Tom Hanks) a dedicated, successful and superior attorney working for a prestigious Philadelphia Law firm when they decide to fire him for incompetence. Feeling that he was dismissed wrongly, Beckett visits nearly a dozen other attorneys, before he finds Attorney Joseph Miller. (Denzel Washington) Accepting his case, Miller and his client face a daunting task against one of the city's top Law Firms. The fear of contracting AIDS is apparent in everyone's mind as audience and jury members alike react in similar fashion to the mere thought or exposure of contamination. Yet the performances of both primary actors as well as the entire cast which includes Antonio Banderas as Miguel Alvarez, Jason Robards, Charles Napier and Robert Ridgely is superbly and forcibly felt in their vivid performances. Indeed, the movie is superior in every way and in my opinion will become a Classic in due time. ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Upon discovering that attorney Andrew Beckett, played by Tom Hanks, is a homosexual with AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome), the prestigious Philadelphia law firm where he works, fires him. Certainly one of the largest law firms in Philadelphia would know that it is illegal to fire someone for having an illness or for being a homosexual. That is why a plot is carried out to make it appear as though Beckett misplaced an important legal document that could have cost the firm an important client. Beckett knows he did not misplace the document and that his record is impeccable. He also knows he works for a firm run by middle aged, prejudice white men, in which one of them had noticed a lesion on his forehead two weeks earlier.Though Beckett has AIDS and knows he is dying, he loves the law and cannot remain silent and accept being wrongfully fired. After being unsuccessful in finding an attorney to take his case and join him in suing his previous law firm, he contacts "The TV Guy" who runs cheesy ambulance-chasing commercials, attorney Joe Miller, played by Denzel Washington. Joe Miller struggles with his own personal prejudices toward homosexuality.The director, Jonathan Demme, shows Joe's phobia toward AIDS in a scene in Joe Miller's office, just after Andrew tells Joe he has AIDS. With the skill of the editor, Craig McKay, the scene goes from a close up of Joe's face to the lesions on Andrews face, then to the hat he places on Joe's desk, moving to a shot of him pulling a cigar out of the box, next back to the lesions on his head, followed by a shot of Andrew putting the cigar he was holding and touching back into the cigar box. During all of these shots soft dramatic music is playing in the background to heighten the feeling of concern. Throughout the entire movie this scene was the best use of this technique, the editor was successful in capturing the mood and the message with the selectivity of the shots. This one scene captures the essence of how people with AIDS were treated in 1993 when the movie was released, and perhaps still today. It is similar in the same way prejudice is shown in the movie The Help, where white people didn't want to share a bathroom with the African American people from some crazy notion that they would get germs or a disease.The movie goes a little over the top with having a very passionate scene where Andrew is over taken with emotion as the sounds of Opera engulf the screen, this plays into the stereotyping of homosexuals. The scene was intended to show Joe, the softer human side of Andrew so he could understand him better and begin to care about him. However, the director missed an opportunity with Andrew's partner Miguel (Antonio Banderas), where he does not do enough to build his role as the loving and caring partner. Someone who has the person they love on their death bed. Though the opera scene did the job it needed to do, using Andrew's partner would have been more powerful and had a greater impact on the audience.Joe Miller goes up against defense attorney (Mary Steenburgen), for the law firm that fired Andrew. Tension is felt in the court room as witnesses lie for the law firm, while others show sincerity and concern for Andrew. It's like a divide amongst those that are prejudice and those that are not, exactly what the movie, Philadelphia is about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Landmark Movie On AIDS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Philadelphia is a film that was one of the first mainstream Hollywood films to acknowledge HIV/AIDS, homosexuality and homophobia. It stars Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington together with Jason Robards,Mary Steenburgen,Antonio Banderas,Joanne Woodward and Stephanie Roth. It was inspired in part by the story of Geoffrey Bowers, an attorney who in 1987 sued the law firm Baker &amp; McKenzie for wrongful dismissal in one of the first AIDS discrimination cases.It was written by Ron Nyswaner and directed by Jonathan Demme.At the time of its release, Philadelphia was the first big-budget film to tackle the medical, political, and social issues of AIDS. Andrew Beckett is a talented lawyer at a stodgy Philadelphia law firm. The homosexual Andrew has contracted AIDS but fears informing his firm about the disease. The firm's senior partner, Charles Wheeler, assigns Andrew a case involving their most important client. Andrew begins diligently working on the case, but soon the lesions associated with AIDS are visible on his face. Wheeler abruptly removes Andrew from the case and fires him from the firm. Andrew believes he has been fired because of his illness and plans to fight the firm in court. But because of the firm's reputation, no lawyer in Philadelphia will risk handling his case. In desperation, Andrew hires Joe Miller, a black lawyer who advertises on television, mainly handling personal injury cases. Miller dislikes homosexuals but agrees to take the case for the money and exposure. As Miller prepares for the courtroom battle against one of the law firm's key litigators, Belinda Conine, Miller begins to realize the discrimination practiced against Andrew is no different from the discrimination Miller himself has to battle against.During cross- examination, Beckett admits that he was originally planning to tell his law colleagues that he was gay, but changed his mind after hearing them make homophobic jokes in the sauna of a health club. When asked about the truth of how he got infected, he confirms that he engaged in anonymous sex with another man at a pornographic movie theater. However, he and Miller gain an advantage when the partner who advised settling out of court confesses he long suspected Beckett had AIDS but never said anything, and how he regrets his inaction.It is an extremely well-made message picture about tolerance, justice and discrimination is pitched at mainstream audiences.It is not just canny, corny and blatantly patriotic, but compassionate, compelling and emotionally devastating.It was a moving film that fostered empathy towards homosexuals and people with AIDS.The cast was exceptionally brilliant especially Tom Hanks,who obviously deserved his Oscar win for the portrayal of Andrew Beckett.Obviously,the film tried its best to be both apolitical and non-preachy despite the fact that it has a message to impose to its viewers.An added amount of humor was perfectly blended as well.This is a must-see picture not only for a masterpiece Hanks- Washington collaboration but also for it was a landmark film towards asking for tolerance towards homosexuals and people who have contracted AIDS.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Philadelphia" a film directed by Jonathan Demme, is a must see movie, that takes a world crisis and then shoves it in your face. The emotional screenplay written by Ron Nyswaner gets into the controversies of AIDS a virus at the time, the public feared because of lack of education and misunderstandings. The cinematography by Tak Fujimoto gives viewers a warm feeling to the over all cinema. Fujimoto used camera angles that capture emotion and a feel of joy throughout the film. The music for the film was done by Howard Shore. Howard Shore created emotion within the film by using the song "Philadelphia" by Bruce Springsteen. "Philadelphia" is a movie that will warm your heart and understandings of how important it is not to be judgmental or bias. "Philadelphia" is about two competing lawyers Andrew Beckett (Tom Hanks) and Joe Miller (Denzel Washington) who join forces to tackle a law suite against the law firm Beckett was fired from because he was found to have the AIDS virus. Beckett who is a homosexual with AIDS and Miller who is a homophobic build up a unique friendship over the period of the trial and become close friends. The two friendships are immortalized in a scene after Miller attends his first homosexual party, and Beckett plays opera music. At this time Miller realizes how human everyone is, no matter what there sexual orientation might be. Tom Hanks as an actor is proved matured since his previous film Radio Flyer (1992) and is best proved in "Philadelphia".The film starts off with Andrew Beckett a senior associate in one of the largest corporate law firms in the city of Philadelphia being assigned to the firm's most important case. A noticeable skin lesion was noticed by a partner of the law firm on Beckett's face in the office. Because of this, Andrew Beckett was let go from his duties at the law firm. The reason for was in the finding of him having the AIDS virus. Andrew Beckett struggles to find a lawyer to help him in his discrimination case against the law firm. Beckett decides to represent himself, until Miller, finds out that he cannot contract the AIDS virus by just being around Beckett. Miller decides to take the challenge of pursuing a law suite with Beckett against the big Philadelphia law firm. As Beckett and Miller go before the courts, Charles Wheeler (Jason Robards) the head of the law firm claims that Beckett had deliberately hidden his conditions from the law firm, and because of this, Beckett was fired from the firm. The law firm represented by an emotionless lawyer Belinda Conine (Mary Streenburgen) shows no emotion when it comes to Beckett as if she is disgusted by his sexual orientation and disease. Carl Fullerton's makeup choice used in the film was classical by showing Beckets transformation of being a healthy lawyer, to being in his last stage of AIDS, to the point of death. Jonathan Demme created a realistic courtroom feel with filling in the chairs of the court with an outstanding cast and background actors. The trial ends with Beckett collapsing on the court floors. Tak Fujimoto angle used in filming this scene shows great emotion. A verdict in the favor of Beckett compensates him for his losses. Beckett passes away but is remembered by friends and family and ultimately his new friend Miller. "Philadelphia" is rated PG-13 (Parents Strongly Cautioned). The film has mild language and brief nudity. Released by Tri-Star Pictures 1993, the film running time is 119 minutes.</fullReview>

It reminds me of an up-dated Frank Capra with the bad guys (rich and powerful) pitted against the good guys (poorer but Simon pure). The emphasis is for the underdog, quite transparently, and the villains of the piece are portrayed in two dimensions only, rather like Eisenstein's gargoyles. The constant reaction shots during the trial play on the emotions of the viewer and the episode with Callas opera aria is downright embarrassing to watch. As Shirly Booth put it in "Sheba".

		<fullReview>When it's used in a statistical sense, the term "minorities" refers to what is small in number, less than the majority. Over time, it's become a handy awning tag under which many groups can be filed. But it's a deceptive categorization. It deludes those accepting the pigeonholing into viewing people called minorities as small not only in number but also in significance. In a democratic nation based on majority rule, such a classification can make the benefit and concerns raised by minorities seem less significant than those of the majority. Besides, more and more the label is not statistically truthful. For example, depending on how one adds together a given demographic in certain cities and states, there is no single majority.At the same time it was the height of what is already being considered manipulative emotional effect and sardonically designed buoyancy, 1993 seemed to foreshadow a progressive fashion in Hollywood, after the pervading Reaganite camp of the 1980s, which met audiences head-on with real and communal truths having to do with things the majority would rather not think about so much. Released the same year as Spielberg's Schindler's List, yet the most critically and commercially extolled konk on the head for everybody to truly take a hard look at what happened during the Holocaust, came this impressively directed effort, more than ten years after "gay cancer" first became public knowledge. There had been extremely good films made about being gay in America during that time, like the deeply touching Torch Song Trilogy or the heartrending Longtime Companion, as well as quite a few before the AIDS epidemic, but they hadn't reached an audience as wide as Philadelphia. Inspired by the story of an HIV-positive attorney who in 1987 sued an international law firm for unfair dismissal in one of the first AIDS discrimination cases, the film was the second big-budget, big-star Hollywood film to tackle the issue of AIDS in the U.S. and also signaled a shift in the early 1990s for Hollywood films to have more realistic depictions of gays and lesbians. And yet somehow, as Hanks remarked in an interview for the vital 1996 documentary The Celluloid Closet, some scenes showing more affection between him and Banderas had to be cut.Jonathan Demme is an influential director across an array of genres, and whereas his previous films seem to have been about embracing life, Philadelphia is preoccupied with death and dying, but he nevertheless infuses it with authentic joy and generosity, as well as his eye and ear for music. This is a Hollywood production that would've fit right in with its era of pat sentiment and cynically calculated optimism, but Demme makes it all feel genuine and moving. His use of music allows for the pleasure of the story to be individualized and shared at the same time. Grabbing at the soul of each moment with his trademark use of characters looking straight into the camera, Demme uses the emotional meaning of every shot, not just manipulating the temporal length or rhythmic characteristics of the cuts. He elicits a reaction from us even more complex than if he were to paste one static shot to the next based on the literal beginning and ending of each.The performances in Philadelphia all seem to reflect the personal histories of each character, perhaps because each scene gives them another situation to respond to, changing the course of their thoughts, feelings or actions. Everyone is human here. Maybe that's why, as a classic contemporary Hollywood feel-good tearjerker, it transcends so many of those corresponding conventions. No one's there to be a prop to act upon the "good guys," who themselves are far from perfect. Everybody---from the underdog hero to the friends and families of the central figures, from the ignorant but humanist attorney to the smallest player in the courtroom---has opinions and feelings, consequences, they change, they carry things forward, such is life.Demme's best films hum with that loving vibe that everyone knew they were all making the same film. That they were allowed to make mistakes, that they were allowed to try things. The acting is strong because it's fresh, simple, honest, emotionally alive, moment-by-moment. And precisely and equally so is Demme's camera. It never just rolls. It's never just coverage. It's always specific. It captures the essence of each moment, stops time, changes space, defines characters, creates beauty, ugliness: It truthfully and sensitively tells the story. And it leaves a residual warmth in your frame of mind for some time upon finishing it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film in Massachusetts, on a weekend retreat, with nearly a dozen women with HIV/AIDS. If I recall correctly 80% of the women were African American (Black).It is for these women, and their courage to survive, I rate the film with a ten. Each left the theatre empowered and emotional.It may not have been as realistic as their lives, but it was and is a good stand in for how people were and are treated when they have a disease people associate with shame.Hanks and Washington were a magnificent team. The balance of power of the two attorneys, their racial and social differences added a second level of sensitivity and dimension to the themes of the film. It is one of those films that exceeds the teachable moment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best Tom Hanks films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my favourite dramas to watch. The story and the characters really make me feel about them and really get me involved.The disease of AIDS fascinated me because before I watched the film, I never knew about it. It also showed how people are prejudice and also discriminate. The story of the film also fascinated me. Every time I watch it, it always nearly makes me cry at the end of the film.Tom Hanks really does deserve his Oscar award and Densel Washington definitely deserves an award for best supporting actor. Antonio Banderos did an excellent job as well. The song "Streets of Philadelphia" is one of my all time favourite songs.I think many people should watch this film because it shows and teaches what prejudice and discrimination is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Both a touching and pioneering courtroom and human drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Hanks, arguably the best white actor of his generation and Denzel Washington, easily the best black actor of his generation--and the film is about homosexuality and the AIDS epidemic. That's the easiest thing to overlook and perhaps the most brilliant part about "Philadelphia:" Never once do you feel an ounce of racial tension between their two characters in this film. It's as if to say that we've broken a social barrier like this before and we'll do it again.The film follows Hanks as Andrew Beckett, a young stud lawyer in a major Philadelphia firm who learns his HIV has become AIDS just as he is promoted. Before long, Beckett finds himself fired for incompetency, though he believes it is based on his disease. He seeks the help of Joe Miller, a civil attorney, who at first turns him away due to his own homophobia, but later accepts. The film sort of baits us on our interest in courtroom drama and challenge us with some reflective, personal, human moments. While the film is about this legal battle, "Silence of the Lambs" filmmaker Jonathan Demme makes sure to remind you that its really about a man and his family struggling with a terrible disease.The genius of the script is that it blatantly plays on American prejudices about homosexuality and AIDS, reminding us of our ignorance about the virus and its disease in the way that it is contracted most specifically. We are supposed to come at it from Joe's perspective, slowly coming to understand that our homophobia is unfounded. It's not flawless execution as some of the ignorance feels artistically forced, but most of it is very real. This is one of those movies that uses such a sharp societal lens that it will leave you with "shaken head syndrome' where you can't help but shake your head based on how terrible and prejudiced some of the things said and done in this film are."Philadelphia" definitely seems to be on the upward portion near the climax of the illustrious acting careers of both Hanks and Washington. While best actor awards tend to make people think of the most dramatic performances, it is the way Hanks shows the debilitating effects of the disease through the course of the film that makes him Oscar-worthy. Washington's performance is familiar, but what makes it stand out a bit is that transformation in perspective we see him undergo.This is a story driven by content and meant to play toward emotions. It is meant to be sad and uplifting, both of which it is. It is a landmark film in its willingness to address AIDS and homosexuality in the "pre-RENT" era of entertainment. While it is a courtroom drama and meant to handle a serious subject matter, its more simplistic and raw than profound and artistic. "Philadelphia" is a very important story sandwiched between a great Bruce Springsteen song and a good Neil Young song that belongs among the library of issue-focused films</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely Depressing But Ultimately Rewarding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When comparing the Denzel Washington of old with the Denzel of today, it depresses me. In the 1980s and '90s, Mr. Washington sold himself as a great actor - and he was. These days, he plays characters that are extremely angry, for one reason or another. (I mean, for crying out loud, he made a movie called "Man on Fire." It seems that is the epitome of Denzel Washington today. Too bad.) But in 1993, Mr. Washington made a wonderful movie called "Philadelphia" with Tom Hanks, and Antonio Banderas. Denzel plays Joe Miller, a self-promoting homophobe, who also happens to be a lawyer. Mr. Hanks plays Andy Beckett, an AIDS patient, and a once up-and-coming lawyer who was fired from his prestigious law firm because he supposedly misplaced an important document, though Beckett maintains someone moved it, trying to implicate him. After much deliberation, Joe takes the case, but tells his wife the homosexuals still gross him out. The court scenes take up most of the film's two hours, and they are brilliantly executed by the director, Jonathan Demme (that's right, the "Silence of the Lambs" guy.) That is to say the court scenes are very intense, mostly because we have grown to hate Andy's ex-law firm so much. Jason Robards leads the team of evildoers, as Charles Wheeler, Andy's ex-boss, who has, to put it lightly, a problem with Andy's lifestyle. The movie is an emotional powerhouse, featuring exceptional acting from Mr. Hanks and Mr. Washington. The film remains fairly realistic, saving a few court scenes and the ending, penned by Ron Nyswaner. "Philadelphia" is a very depressing film, but it's a hell of a lot better than "Rent."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington gave the best on screen duo of any two actors. I thought their characters did a lot of types of actions. I'm a fan of both of them. I thought there were some funny parts in the movie. I liked the song that Bruce Springsteen sings in the beginning. It's called "Streets of Philadelphia". I thought Hanks won a well deserved academy award "Best Actor". He also won it for "Forrest Gump". Although I also think Washington should have won the academy award "Best Supporting Actor", although he won that award for "Glory". I think I should give both of them the academy award "Best On-Screen Duo" because they played their parts real good. I think anybody should come out and see two of the top 5 actors together for the first time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't abandon a fellow human being</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are times when you realize how precious life is and a sense of balance returns to your life, you start appreciating life like a gift. This is yet another truly soul stirring movie not so much for the role of a fellow human being in helping Andrew Beckett but for show casing how the very same society to which we belong to in one way or the other, often alienates us (abandoned when bruised and battered on the streets of Philadelphia.Another aspect of this movie is how it rekindles memories of social ostracisation on account of illness such as AIDS. Today we have demystified AIDS to a large extent and hopefully a more effective cure is on its way but it only takes another new undiscovered and unraveled ailment or social practice to bring out our prejudices. So in that respect, such a movie for me, personally brings out from the compassion for a fellow human being as he lies in bed, inhaling the final remnants of life. A great performance by Tom Hanks who incredibly imports life into such otherwise common place characters we see in life everyday. Denzel Washington is superb, cannot say anything more. Finally i did cry but those tears when washed away only rekindles hope and makes the heart glow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film for the first time last night on DVD. It's always been one of those films I felt I should watch, but somehow never got round to it. I've always been a fan of Tom Hanks, and was curious to see his performance in this particular role, being quite different to anything else I've seen him do. I was not disappointed by his performance, nor by that of Denzel Washington. I thought that both performances were very convincing. The movie overall, I felt was very good. It had a good story, and I cared about what the outcome of the trial would be. My only critisism was that I would have liked to have had more sympathy for Andrew Beckett. I did have a little weep at the end when he died, however I did have the entire film to prepare for that eventualitly as somehow I knew he was going to die at the end. The lack of sympathy I'm talking about comes from not having the chance to get to know the character properly, and not knowing enough about him to relate to him personally. I felt the film was rushed really, that there were large chunks of story missing. I'm not sure I liked the swift changes between events earlier on in the film where we are only really given facts about the character which are relevant to the trial later on. I suppose this may have been deliberate, as this would be similar to how facts are presented to a Jury in a courtroom. Before I saw the film, I knew that it was about a man with AIDS. I therefore thought it would either be depressing, or upliftiing. It turned out to be both. Generally a very good film that I would probably watch again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wasn't impressed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie in the theatre 11 years ago and I remember feeling very underwhelmed by it. There are a number of reasons for this and none of them have to do with homophobia. I'm secure about myself enough not to have to hate anybody else.I haven't seen the movie again since the first time, so I'll try to recall what happened and how I felt about it. I remember Tom Hanks's character left an important file on someone's empty desk and walked away; later on, that file turns up missing causing the firm to lose a case and that was the ostensible reason for his getting fired. We're supposed to feel with him, to be on his side, that he was fired because he had AIDS and that his lawsuit was justified. I don't know if this was a failure on the writer's or the director's part but I thought if someone didn't ensure that an important file wasn't lost, they should be fired (or at least reprimanded). It's negligence. Watching, I knew what the movie wanted me to feel but I just didn't feel it. I felt like the movie was trying to manipulate me and it was failing at it.There was a scene where Tom Hanks's character is listening to some opera ("La mamma morta" from "Andrea Chenier", I believe). Again, I'm supposed to believe that this character is transported by listening to this music but he simply looks like an actor who's acting like he's being transported. It probably didn't help that I wasn't impressed with that particular piece of music.Throughout the movie, I'm supposed to feel sympathy for the character (and as far as his disease is concerned, I do), I'm supposed to believe in the validity of his lawsuit, I'm supposed to feel this and that. I felt like I was watching a movie that I was expected to feel a certain criteria of emotions and I didn't feel any of them. Tom Hanks is a wonderful actor, one of my favorites but his work in this movie didn't impress me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been scanning through the comments, and there's only one thing I really wanna point out: everyone's saying this movie is outdated and that it portrays AIDS as a disease that only gay men seem to get. Don't forget this was made in 1993, just years after HIV and AIDS was discovered and they didn't know much about it. For 1993, this movie seems very true to form, and believe it or not, there are some very accepting families out there who would accept their children/siblings/relatives if they were gay. Great film, love Hanks and Washington. Still sends a message, even today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First let me say I waited 8 years to see this movie because of the death of my brother from aids. Philadelphia is a very moving personal story, of a lawyer with aids who is wrongly fired from his firm, this is a true story and to this day the law firm still has not paid up for losing the case. Philadelphia is Tom Hanks best film by far and he well deserved the Oscar. A great cast a great story and a great director. 9 out of 10Now lets get to the knuckleheads. I read one review of Philadelphia saying gay people are a myth like aliens. What a moron. My brother was not a myth, he was a hardworking man who did not know his lover was cheating on him, he died 6 months after finding out he had aids. He and the millions of gay people around the world are not a myth.A couple of other reviewers said Philadelphia was propaganda, ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME!!! The Reagan administration called it gay cancer first, then after 15 years they admitted it affected non-gay people also. The republicans still think if they ignore aids it will go away. That is not propaganda it is the truth. People staring at a sick man wondering if he has aids is nor propaganda it is the truth. Insurance companies denying gay men health insurance is not propaganda it is the truth. Some Americans can't accept other races how can we expect them to accept gay people. Philadelphia is a movie everyone should see because you never know if or when it will strike a family member.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When the credits rolled they inserted home-made footage of Andrew's childhood. It was too cutesy to be artistic but showed the confidence Director Demme had on his film, because what went on before it was so powerfully and poignantly done. Tom Hank solidified unequivocally he was one of the finest actor of our time after this film and won an Oscar deservedly. The Maria Callas aria scene alone is as powerful and moving as any scene in cinema. As gripping as the train station scene in Schindler's List (or in any holocaust movie), it showed compassion,despair,joy,hope,sorrow and redemption all wrapped-up in one magnificent human moment. Having said this, the movie is not perfect. It must be said that Andrew family was too perfect, too understanding, not a single dysfunctional member in the bunch - what the world is coming to! Antonio Banderas's character had little to do but appear sympathetic. The writers must thought that was enough. Denzil Washington was good but predictable. Denzil has done better work before and after this film. Overall, these are small complaints against a film of such lasting achievements. Lastly, Mary Steenburgen was excellent in her small role as the bitchy lawyer. I like to see her return as lead character in future movies.</fullReview>

A benchmark in filmmaking for being the first major studio produced film about AIDS it suffers only in its watered-down approach to its gay protagonist yet avoids being condescending in its theme of societal bigotry. Kudos for director Jonathan Demme, screenwriter Ron Nyswaner and the haunting Best Song, "Streets of Philadelphia" by Bruce Springsteen.

When he's fired for frivolous reasons he decides to file suit, but the only one who'll take his case is small-time homophobe Washington. Gripping, well-made drama has two excellent leads, a great supporting cast, and a thought-provoking story that sheds light on some sensitive and controversial issues. A few story elements seem much too contrived, and the material is likely to offend some, but it's meaningful and has moments of powerful drama. A must-see for fans of the leads. ***</fullReview>

I am a nurse and have seen many people with various illness which eat at them until they die. This movie brought home that they are still the same person throughout their illness and if given support an love can live the last few days of their lives surrounded by friends, true friends with some modicum of dignity and happiness. I also saw this movie demonstrate very clearly that a mothers love is there always and forever unconditionally for there children.Mr Tom Hanks, is in my opinion one of the best actors I have ever seen and his dedication to his profession is to be commended.

		<fullReview>This was an excellent movie. It came on a couple of days ago and I really wasn't interested in watching it but when I saw that Antonio Banderas was in it that's when I started watching it. And I am so glad I did. This was one of the best movies I've ever seen. Tom Hanks gave an Oscar winning performance and nobody could've done it better. I really enjoyed the fact that it didn't detail the homosexual relationship between Andrew (Hanks) and Miguel (Banderas). The way Denzel Washington acted towards Andrew Beckett when he first met him made me kind of angry because he was homophobic. But I was so glad that he decided to become Andrew's lawyer. And I liked the fact that Andrew's family still loved him and cared for him when they found out he had AIDS and that he was gay. This movie made me cry. Especially towards the end when it was just Andrew and Miguel in the hospital and Miguel kissed Andrew's hand. And when it showed the clips from Andrew's childhood. I couldn't hold it in any longer. Well, I don't have much more to say about this movie except that it was an awesome movie and all the actors in it gave excellent performances. And Tom Hanks deserved that Oscar.

		<fullReview>Philadelphia is one of the first original screenplays to show us the effects of AIDS on people's lives. It strikes them first with the fact that their life will be significantly cut short, it alienates them from people and can make them an outcast, it slowly eats away at the person's body, and tragically kills them.Tom Hanks's Andrew Beckett is a lawyer who is gay, and contracted AIDS. His law firm, like most people at the early 90's are terribly afraid and phobic of AIDS and just want it out, they feel they have been diseased just because Andrew was around them, talked with him, and touched things. Tom Hanks convincingly plays the role, as he beat out Liam Neeson and Daniel Day-Lewis for the 93' Best Actor Oscar. As Andrew's condition gets worse threw the movie it just becomes more sad and pathetic. Denzel Washington has a great role as Andrew's lawyer. Philadelphia is a very important movie to watch, heart-breaking story, real life characters, and looking at society's predjudice against people with AIDS. 10/10 without a doubt for this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most emotional drama ever written.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Philadelphia is a truly wonderful, unforgetting film that looks into the life of Andrew Beckett, a homosexual with the AIDS virus. This film particularly highlights the feelings and strong emotions of Beckett and his caring family. The film's main plot is about a homosexual with AIDS (Beckett played by Tom Hanks)who is fired from his law firm after gaining a big promotion. Andy Beckett claims that he was fired because his employers were prejudice towards himself and his disease. He decides to hire a lawyer to take his case to court and he finds Denzal Washington. Denzal Washington played a wonderful part in this film and deserved to be nominated by the "Academy" for Best Supporting Actor. However, Washington didn't win, but won for two other films. I don't believe anyone can say enough good things about Mr. Tom Hanks and his wonderful acting in all of his roles (especially Philadelphia). Hanks executed his character in an absolutely perfect sense. Hanks made you cry more than once in this particular film when he couldn't find anyone to help him go to court. The graphic scenes containing lesions, which were a result of the virus, made you cringe. The makeup on Hanks couldn't of been better. The "Academy" came through with this film awarding Hanks and the talented Jonathan Demme (the director) with Oscars. Different Oscars also went to other persons for this film. This film will make you cry several times and I would highly recommend that you rent this film for a cold, rainy afternoon. If you are worried about seeing gays kissing and hugging, don't worry. The homosexual sense isn't that bad in this film. Bottom Line- Philadelphia will never be forgotten in good cinema!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This has to be a powerful film, it made me (a grown man) cry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this film extremely moving because it is acted so well. It has three double Oscar winning actors which are all favourites of mine, Tom Hanks, Denzel Washington and Jason Robards. But Hank's peformance had to the best due to the amount of emotion u feel from just watching him dying. The whole film was moving, the ending had the most effect to me, i began to weap as it showed Andrew Beckett (Tom Hanks) as a child and how much of an effect his death had on his family and friends. This start of the picture I was also impressed with, showing the city and everyone going about their daily business. Then it is singled out to Beckett, showing him work and then showing the effects of the AIDS on him. In my opinion i think this is Jonathan Demme's second best peace of work (next to The Silence Of The Lambs) and most certainly his most moving.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first movie to make me cry...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nothing can describe the way i felt throughout this whole movie. Mostly compassion and sadness. Tom's performance in this movie was brilliant. I was never the kind to cry from a movie b/c you know, its just a movie but this was so different. Aids is real, unlike the made-for-movie romances that most people find tearjerking while i sit there wondering when its over. The part that broke that barrier was when Andy was talking about the meaning of the opera and he is saying he is life and love while crying at the same time. i didnt even know i was crying til it was over and i cracked a smile when i saw Joe on the verge of tears from watching him. Then, the rest of the movie i would cry off an on. Even sitting here thinking about it makes me teary eyed. A wonderful movie, 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is the most amazing movie I've ever seen. It's more than a movie, I just can't find the words to describe what I felt while watching, and what I'm still feeling now...... I'm writing this comment already for 5 minutes and still, there's no way to express the emotions - some shock, some bitterness, some sadness, maybe dejection, and many other feelings I can't describe... the most of all the identification I felt with Tom Hanks's role. His roles are always touching and special, and I truly adore him for that... but this time it was way more than just a role, way more than just a movie for me. Thank you for the experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant Treatment Of A Sensitive Issue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An absolutely riveting film starring Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington, who are both superb in this account of a lawyer fired by his law firm because he is a gay man with AIDS.Hanks plays Andrew Beckett, the young hot-shot superstar lawyer who is dismissed by the most prestigious law firm in Philadelphia on a trumped up charge of incompetence after one of the managing partners notices a lesion on his forehead that he recognizes to be caused by AIDS. Forced to take legal action against the firm in what appears to be a no-win situation, Beckett manages to retain the services of Joe Miller (Washington), a somewhat sleazy lawyer who makes a lot of money by hustling personal injury cases. Originally disinclined to accept the case because of his own distaste for homosexuality, Miller becomes committed to the cause and offers a brilliant courtroom performance, while all the while we watch Andrew get sicker and sicker.A strong supporting cast featuring the likes of Antonio Banderas as Andrew's lover Miguel, and Jason Robarts as Charles Wheeler, the head of the firm that fired Andrew, makes this a truly must-see movie. It deals unashamedly with the stereotypes of the day around AIDS and homosexuality. The only weak part of the movie in my opinion was an unnecessarily long scene in which Miller and Beckett are going over testimony, and Beckett is playing opera and interpreting it for Miller. This, I thought, was overdone, but it was the only weak part of the movie I can see.Absolutely brilliant. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Do you actually think the movie was suppose to convey a message. The purpose of a Hollywood movie is to make money, which it did.To complain about stereotypes and cardboard characters does not make sense. Hanks and Washington both do a superb job. Lets try not to forget that for its time the movie was a risky project for all involved, especially for a mainstream Hollywood movie.What about Boys in the Hood? Did that not have stereotyping in it? Is that the typical black life. No, it is not.Instead of complaining about the film be grateful that it has opened the eyes of millions of people. Thanks to Hanks, maybe others have changed their minds about who homosexuals are, not just the stereotypical view that Hollywood tends to portray.The movie is a step in the right direction!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You may not know it, but there are parents who accept their gay children. So that criticism is not valid. There are gay people who are lawyers (and notice that noone knew that Andy was gay,when they did, they fired him). All the criticism around this is rubbish. This is a great movie, that shows real life issues and how gay people are discriminated by others. The movie shows that they are people and have feelings to, just like anyone else. The other question here is AIDS. This movie shows that you can't get AIDS by breathing the same air or kissing someone who has it. It breaks many of the prejudices around gay people and people dying of AIDS. I had a dear friend who died from that horrible disease and I have a dear friend who is lesbian, and let me tell you, that's the way they are discriminated. About the cast, Tom Hanks has a great part, and performs it very well. Denzel Washington is amazing in this movie, he would have deserved an oscar for best supporting actor. Please, those who don't like it, see it again. If you pay atention, I know you'll love it. I give it 10 in 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In defense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In response to some of the common criticisms on IMDb:- "The movie/characters are cartooney/flat." Unfortunately, this is quite possibly necessary. The general public would have difficulty accepting a more complex story when some of their sensibilities are already being challenged, and clearly part of the point of the movie is to bring this story to the general public (i.e. Hollywood audience). C'est la vie.- "Hanks and Banderas' gay relationship is not made believable - they don't kiss much." Their relationship was not a focus of the movie; if they had been kissing all the time, there would be the stereotype that gays are always getting some. I found it refreshing that, for once (and for whatever reasons), a Hollywood movie couple *isn't* always making out.- "Hanks' character does not represent the typical gay man." I doubt that he was *supposed* to - after all, the stereotypical gay man is not a lawyer. Besides, it is not fair to demand that a movie tell the story of "every gay man" and yet not be full of stereotypes and/or generalizations, real or imagined.- "The family is not realistic - they all accept Hanks' character." It is never implied that the immediate family never fought over homosexuality; their son might have come out decades ago. Perhaps a few dissenters would have been more believable, but then again it is never proven that all family members were present.- Finally: "The movie is propaganda." All movies are propaganda. It's just that only those that don't advertise the status quo are labeled as such.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hanks and Washington, are an amazing duo in this film that attempts to show the publics' prejudice and ignorance toward those afflicted with this horrendous disease. Hanks is Hanks in this film and as usual is without peer, but Denzel Washington showed strengths he never revealed before. The pivotal scene in this film came when Andrew (Hanks) and Joe (Washington) are preparing for Andrew's appearance on the stand at the end of the trial. The use of Maria Callas performing La Mama Mort and Andrew showing his heart wrenching emotions as Joe looks on in astonishment was unbelievable. Without this scene, the movie would never have made it with me. Overall, the film was a valiant effort on the parts of the actors and the director at exposing the truth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first, we may be seeing an usual film. That's right, so this movie is about discrimination, no doubt's there and every "inspired by true events" TV movie talks about this same theme. So, what, or let me rephrase that, who keeps this one from being standard fare? Demme. Springsteen. Callas. Denzel. And above all them a man which rises up to perfection as he lives with the character and makes us cry when he reaches his summit. A man which achieves a stature few manage to, a man which gets out of his body an inhabits another one like few can, and a performance to live in history. Since the beginning to the very end, Hanks is the depiction of the ordinary man who becomes extraordinary by the consequences of our acts and the acts of others. At the final moments we know Hanks wouldn't be the same no longer. He would be someone who rose to the top in only two hours of life. And this is rare. Incredible film, which goes straight to our insides and, from within, makes us tremble. A hommage to millions of lives lost.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moving and poignant without being preachy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1993, not many films major films with top stars had taken on the AIDS as a topic, so Jonathan Demme really was taking a risk here. He made the smart move about keeping the movie true to the story and outlining how all of us are prejudice in one form or another. He also made a film about a man dying from AIDS, plain and simple.Philadelphia does not stand on a high horse as a gay rights film, and if it did its mass appeal may well be ruined. I am very conservative by nature, but still this film makes me cry and reminds me that above all, people die a horrible death.Hanks won a well deserved Oscar here, and I think he won mostly for the brief but pivotal scene where his lawyer (Denzel Washington) re-directs a line of questioning about skin lesions. I will not spoil for you, but if this scene fails to move you then nothing will.I love courtroom dramas and this a great one. Denzel Washington is key - you see his character change over time from a greedy lawyer with prejudices to a compassionate friend. I do not think that the his character ever overcomes his prejudice, but grapples with it and learns what is right in spite of himself. Denzel gives a Oscar worthy performance as well.A wonderful film. ***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie when it first came out. As i grew up in the Philadelphia area ,it hit home quite well. The scenes ,the locations all incredible and moving . Tom Hanks portrayal was so moving, I cried. The opera scene may have seemed too long but think about it.In reality can you put a time frame on someones expressions . It was beautifully worked. Denzel Washington was good in this movie and the scene of him being come onto in the drug store was real . I know that scene and have been in it myself and it showed how most heterosexual people handle it by getting upset rather than saying excuse me I'm sorry I'm not gay . I mean if a woman hit on him and he wasn't interested would he yell at her. The family was depicted honestly , I know gay men who have wonderful loving families who overcame prejudice and loved their children no matter what . So you critics who say that the family was too good to be true ,take note, I'm sure that in real life a family like that it took years to get to what they portrayed in the movie. they loved their son no matter what. Jason Robards was wonderful as the opposing lawyer and I'm sure that this has happened a lot in real life before laws have become stricter on firing because of orientation.We all know how his character felt . betrayed , sickened ,like he had to go run out and get tested and take 1000 showers. And what a shocker to see sweet Mary Steenburgen type against cast as a ruthless defense lawyer . She is so a comedic actress that it was wonderful to see her stretch her acting skills. A few goofs not noted . Jason Robards mentions to his defense team to find out about gay bars that Hanks' character frequented on Chestnut St.At the time of filming there were no gay bars on Chestnut St. And also the gay porno theater where he had his anonymous encounter with another man is not in Philadelphia but rather I believe in LA. Overall a 10 out of 10 - to you naysayers take a hike . The movie was wonderful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to believe, it our enlightened time of "Will &amp; Grace," that there was once a time when it was very risque to have gay characters in your big-budget Hollywood movie. Tony Curtis was denied of an Oscar nomination for Some Like it Hot, and the movie was even banned in Kansas (what a surprise). But then in the early 80's, a time when glam rockers were wearing makeup and had long hair, there was a surge of gender-bending roles, starting with Dustin Hoffman's Tootsie. There was also Julie Andrews and Robert Preston in Victor/Victoria and John Lithgow in The World According to Garp. Then, in 1985, there was in my opinion the greatest "gay" performance of all time, William Hurt in Kiss of the Spider Woman (I was surprised that the Academy actually had the guts to give him the Oscar that he deserved hands down).But then the 90s came roaring in, and people seemed to feel guilty about the open-mindedness, and a new wave of homophobia set in. But there was also a wave of political correctness, and I think some ground-breaking films were made, like Longtime Companion in 1991. Jaye Davidson also gave a phenomenal performance in The Crying Game. But there still was never really a wide-release Hollywood film that dealt with homosexuality. Then came Philadelphia.When I first saw this movie, there was no doubt in my mind that Tom Hanks would go on and win the Oscar that year. First of all, it took a lot of guts for him to even take this role, because God forbid people in Hollywood think you're gay. And there were so many phenomenal scenes that he really just nailed. Like the scene when he's listening to the music (I don't want to give any spoilers), it was really just amazing. Jonathan Demme, fresh off his Oscar win for Silence of the Lambs, also does a great job in directing.I really think this movie deserved a Best Picture nomination. I also think Jason Robards deserved a Best Supporting actor nomination. I know that his character was truly just an idiot stuck in the 50s, but a movie like this needs a villian, the absolute homophobe to round out the story. There wouldn't be a movie without the homophobic dumb ass, would there? I also think he is a great actor.So all you people who criticize this movie (homophobic, perhaps?) should really take into consideration the groundbreaking that this movie did. Would The Birdcage have done so well in the box office if Philadelphia didn't pave the way?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A recent second viewing of this film was well worth the trouble; indeed, as is the case with any really good film, I was able to pay more attention to various details than the first time. Quite apart from the subject matter itself, the two principal actors, Tom Hanks (enjoyed his `Forrest Gump') and Denzel Washington (memorable performances in `Cry Freedom' and `The Pelican Brief'), were stupendous, well worth their Oscars (if how many of them are anything to go by to judge a film..........). I cannot help thinking that a third Oscar was justified: Jonathan Demme showed us once again that he has a maestro's hand for this kind of film, just as in `The Silence of The Lambs'. Nowhere is this better perceived than in the scene with Hanks and Washington while the former explains and translates an aria being sung by Mara Callas; and the ensuing few minutes when the latter arrives home to his wife and daughter. These 12-15 minutes must rank among the best pieces of North American cinematography of all time. Simply superb. My only snuffle is that it might have been a good idea to have used another soprano, like Joan Sutherland for example; everyone has a favourite soprano, I suppose: Mara Callas is not mine.Excellent film, well worth renting if you missed it: I give it 8 out of 10, a bit higher than the present IMDb voting average. I can't wait to see `Cast Away'...........</fullReview>

A wonderful tour de force performance from Hanks who really proved that he is among the greats. Washington too handling his homophobic character excellently. I wouldn't say he is completely turned by the end of the film, but he's not so against them as he was.Robards too gave off an aura of a truly prejudiced man - who doesn't really get his compuppance.

		<fullReview>I remember when I first saw Philadelphia in the theatres. I was living in Chicago and my date that evening was appalled at the subject matter of the film. Right then and there I knew her and I were going nowhere in our relationship. This movie was not only great acting, screenwriting, and editing, it was also a movie in need of being shown to the American public.Aids had become the scariest word in the mid eighties and, despite the faces of those Hollywood icons like Rock Hudson and Liberace who had succumbed to it, there was not an outpouring of emotion for any person afflicted from the public. This movie helped to put a face, albeit it was only Hanks in the role of Andrew Beckett, on the desease and the prejudice that accompanied it. We all grapled identifying with the fears of the partners of the firm, the anger we felt toward how they treated Beckett, and the helplessness this whole AIDS afflicted under-culture goes through on a daily basis.The acting is incredible! Tom Hanks, of course, won an OSCAR for his part, but kudo's have to go to Denzel Washington, the late Jason Robards, Mary Steenbergen, the great Joanne Woodward who played Hanks' mother, and the entire cast. An equally compelling theme song, written and sung by Bruce Springstein, underscores the mood of the film. This film will get you to well up with tears no matter how many times you watch it. A definite must see for those who have not!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We are high school students in a French Junior High school in France, in Caen (Normandy). We have watched Philadelphia in our English class and we felt like writing a review on it.At the beginning, Beckett is recognized as a very good lawyer because he has won an important trial, so his employers gives him the responsibility of a very important file. However, his life is ruined when his employers notice he has AIDS, and so he is laid off. Andrew is so revolted to have been sabotaged that he decides to go to see Joe Miller, an other lawyer, with a hope he could help him to sue Wyant and Wheeler, but, unluckily, Miller doesn't buy it, first, for personal reason. Fortunately, after asking Mr Ambuster, the doctor, more precisions about AIDS, Miller accepts to help him. As a consequence, it's the beginning of long trial between Andrew and his employers. But it is very tight because the two sides defend their causes very well. Unluckily, Andy feels worse and worse, and Miller and himself were aware of the fact that Andy may die before the end the trial. So, the day after, the trial goes on, and meanwhile Andrew feels very bad and he finally faints, that's why he has been brought to the hospital and so Joe finishes the trial without him . Fortunately, he succeeds in winning it and in compensing Andy and his family. So everybody meet at the hospital to support Andy, but, a while later, he dies, but serenely because he was avenged. Finally, Wyant and Wheeler appeal . . .We like this film because of the good actors : indeed they play very their part and seem very realist. They are in the shoes of the film's characters. Then, because of the story : it's original to denounce discrimination of AIDS sufferers and it shows us the reality of life. Futhermore the music is very moving and so it touches our right chord.First, Andrew is very courageous when he answers the questions; and he's a great lawyer because he wins lots of trials. He represents the brilliant homosexual. Secondly, Joe is prejudiced against AIDS sufferers because at the beginning he treats Andy like leper. He represents the man who is narrow-minded. After that, we can say that Charles seems friendly with Andrew. However, when he learns that Andy has AIDS, they reject him and fire him; that's why we can say that they're hypocrite.Then, our favourite scene is when Andy ask if he can work for him. It's very moving with the music above all when he lives his office. It shows us the narrowness of people like Joe and how their mind have changed during the film.We think that this sort of film can make mentalities evolve. Indeed this film denounces the prejudices against AIDS sufferers. So we realize that this film can make us think, and it shows us that AIDS sufferers deserve to be considered like everyone and more respected.julie Edouard julien</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>AIDS a physical and moral disease</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Andrew Beckett, a brillant lawyer, works for Wiant and whiller a famous firm in Philadelphia. He has been fired and he is sure that his employers have fired him because he has AIDS. So, he decides to sue them. After seeing nine lawyers, he meets Joe Miller. First, he refuses, then, he chooses to help Andy. Thanks to their work and their perseverances they win the trial. A few days later Andy dies. In spite of the length of some scenes the story is very touching. It makes us understand we shouldn't turn our backs on AIDS sufferers.Andy appears as a straightforward, and honest man. Moreover he is fascinated about his job, and he believes in law.At the beginning, Joe Miller represents the part of the population who is ingnorant so they are prejudiced against AIDS sufferers. Then, he changes his mind he becomes Andy's friends. Charles and his partners are selfish and narrow-minded.Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington are very good actors, because they are convincing in their role. To my mind, the best scene is the flashback at the end of the scene. We can see a video of Andrew when he was a kid with his family. That's very touchy because he's dead and it is the best way for his parents to remember him.It can change mentalities, as people who are prejudiced against AIDS sufferers and exclude them can get aware of the arm they do. If they were in Andy's family shoes, they might have another attitude. Everybody can be contaminated by this terrible disease.Hl?ne, Delphine, Andra, Camille.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We are high school students in a French junior high school in France, in Caen (Normandy). We have watched Philadelphia in our English classroom and we felt like writing a review on it. It is the story of two men, Andrew Beckett and Joe Miller, who fight against the discrimination against gays and AIDS sufferers. The story takes place in Philadelphia in the nineties. Andrew is a lawyer who has AIDS. He has been laid off by his employers, Wyant, Wheeler, Hellerman, Telow and Brown; so Andrew has decided to sue his employers, and hopes Joe Miller will help him. First, Joe Miller refuses to help Andrew. Later, Joe Miller accepts to help him. Together, they combine their forces to prepare their defence speech. In spite of Andrew's disease, they manage to win, too late for Andrew, the trial. We like this movie since it shows the discrimination against AIDS sufferers and gays. It could be an awareness campaign for the teenagers who have seen the film. The characters' personalities are Andrew is a figther and a straighforward man, Joe Miller wants justice to do his duty, Charles and his partners represent this part of people who are ignorant and prejudiced against AIDS. Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington act very well. In the movie,we can see the spreading of the disease and we can see Joe Miller's repulsion against gays and the fear of AIDS sufferers. Our favourite scene in the film is the meeting between Joe and Andrew. We see Joe Miller's fear and Andrew's distress because of the changes of the expression on their faces. The usefulness of such films is very important for the part of people who discriminate and are prejudiced against AIDS sufferers. The film can make mentalities evolve as teenagers discover a killer desease and its consequences. Moreover, adults won't exclude AIDS sufferers any more and will sympathize with them. We can say that the film will contribute to the improvement of the relationship between people and AIDS sufferers. Mathieu Franois Julie Christophe</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fly in the ointment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is great. It's beyond discussions. But like it happens very often, a fly in the ointment spoils all the thing. I'm talking about Antonio Banderas. Of course, he's a great actor, but to my opinion he has nothing to do in this movie. May be his role was too short and third-degreed to show up all the abilities of Mr. Banderas as an actor, but there were a number of roles in this film even smaller, but performed wonderfully. Beckett's junior brother, for example, drove me to tears in the farewell scene. But Antonio is totally unconvincing. It's not his kind of movies, I think, and correct me if I'm wrong - I have included my e-mail. And there is another thing that bothers me: Why "Philadelphia"? I mean, what the creators wanted to say with this title? Surely, this is not a local problem. Even more, there's been shown very little of the city itself - all the action happens in the courtroom. So I think the film, so to speak, remains untitled. But again, correct me if I'm wrong.Finally, I gave it 9 out of 10. And who knows, what would I have given it, if Andrew's boyfriend was played not by Antonio Banderas. Anyway, like I said, it's a great film, and I highly recommend it to everyone. You won't stay cool, I promise, and there's a big chance that you discover the tears in your eyes, even if you consider yourself as a rock-hearted cool b*****d.</fullReview>

He is fired from his job and takes his case to Denzel Washington, who plays Joe Miller, a homophobic lawyer.Washington's character becomes closer to Hank's character as the movie progresses however, and there are some good moments in the courtroom.This is a highly enjoyable movie and I would recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it yet. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe this got only 7.3 stars. Philadelphia is a very deep, moving and sometimes funny movie. It makes you think about life and where some people's priorities lie. Denzel Washington is superb as the homophobic lawyer who eventually takes up Andrew Beckett's case out of simpathy and his love of the law. Did Denzel get an oscar for this? I'm not sure but he sure deserves one.Made in 1993, it does seem a little dated now, society today being more accepting of gays/lesbians and more understanding about AIDS (I don't think Andy would be fired, although I can still imagine that lawyer being just as repulsed by his homosexuality) but nevertheless it's very effective and takes the viewer on an emotional ride.Comments were made about the surprisingly accepting and supportive family that Andrew has. I for one think this is a great touch since too often in movies they give us this cliche of the poor little gay boy kicked out of home by an overly cruel father. In Philadelphia it's the opposite and I thought this was quite original. The fact is that a loving close-knit family is still a loving close-knit family even when a son is gay/has AIDS, there's nothing unbelievable about that.The only flaw I could find is the lack of background and detail concerning many of the characters, especially Andrew and Miguel, but also the defending lawyers.I tip my hat to Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington for choosing to be in this movie, these were somewhat risky and controversial (at the time) roles, and they acted and portrayed the characters beautifully.I don't like court room dramas (I find them boring) but I love Philadelphia because it offers so much more and is so well executed. It's a movie with soul and it oozes quality. I give it 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leaves you asking for more, but not necessarily in a good way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I get why this movie was so praised and so famous, I really do. The subject was perfect for its time, the actors brilliant, and the message delivered sensitively. The writers carefully picked apart most of the prejudices that people still have towards homosexuals and AIDS victims in an entertaining way, they showed us what homophobia really is, and gave us characters that you feel deeply for. That said, there is no denying that Philadelphia is severely limited. Facts stands that this was made for the heterosexual public to deal with an urgent subject in 1993, and that is glaringly obvious, even though it was probably just what the doctor ordered.17 years after this was a burning question, and for someone who isn't a member of the straight target audience, that means that the central plot became much too simplistic for my tastes, and what did get me hooked on the movie was the promising conflicts that were, quite sadly, barely hinted at. Take Andy's and Miguel's relationship for example. They give more affection to friends and family than each other, yet nobody seems to acknowledge it. Then we have Miguel's obsession with nursing Andy clashing with Andy's denial and Andy throwing a huge party when Miguel asks for more of his time. On top of that we have the exposed infidelity, which combined with Miguel's near serenity right before and after Andy's death makes me wonder whether their relationship really survived that crisis, or whether it was the guilt of leaving a fatally ill man that kept them together. In other words, while the very overt kind of discrimination against homosexuals that is shown here is becoming something that we can relate to less and less, relationships in crisis and the impact that a fatal disease have on the people around its victim is something that most of us are going to live through.On the other hand, some of these hinted conflicts may very well just be a clear demonstration of how neglected Andy's personal life was. While it is apparent that the writers tried to create an impression of who he was outside of his career with the huge family and many friends, there are simply too many of them; the screen time is just not enough for us to get to know all of his siblings, nephews, in laws and friends. The result is that they become a faceless mass of spectators, and we end up learning nothing at all about Andy. And if you look at what I've written about his relationship to Miguel, the one that has received some care at least, you can see that it's badly inconsistent. How can the man who bosses his boyfriend's doctors around and get a minor breakdown over a missed treatment possibly have become the man who is passively listening to a doctor while looking no more than concerned, and then lets his lover die while barely blinking, all within a week? It seems that his actions are more based on what makes Andy look good than what fits his character, and as I've noted, that only make their relationship come across as suspicious. Andy's own personality leaves a lot of questions too, and with some unfortunate implications in their wake. Just how did a man raised in what seems to be a fairly traditional family, graduated from an old, prestigious university and working for a conservative law firm get so comfortable with having his stereotypical gay friends come over on a sick day  la the stereotypical "framily"? How did he fit so well in with the rest of the community that he could throw a huge drag/masquerade party complete with a barbershop choir and a band? This seems to be two parts of his life that are different as night and day, and much like Miguel's behavior, we are never given an explanation of how he manages to tie them together. Once again the information we get about Andy only makes it seem like he has every personality and none at the same time.To sum up, this film could be seen as having two aspects of a story of good quality. The first would be what it was praised for in 1993, for picking apart a problem of society that was acute then and bringing it to attention. The second would be what could have made Philadelphia interesting for future generations and what could have spoken to the people that it was supposed to portray. But the scales tipped heavily in favor of the former aspect, making the film fade into obscurity when the novelty wore off, and leaves me wishing for a remake that would take pity on the potential wasted in this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Once an important movie for its content, now mostly notable for Tom Hanks, who goes for broke</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Philadelphia (1993)Tom Hanks pulls out all the stops in this performance as a man, Andrew Beckett, dying of AIDS in the 1980s. If the courtroom battle about his rights to keep working is the driving plot, the real drama and tragedy is in the decay and death of this talented, likable man. Coming to his legal aid is Denzel Washington, who could charm the slippers off of Dorothy, and he does his best to win over the jury. But more important than his lawyering is his openly anti-gay feelings, which he has to face in himself as he gets fully absorbed in the trial.Director Jonathan Demme is a quirky director coming out of the independent film atmosphere of Roger Corman in the early 1970s, but this is a conventional movie in every way. Even his Silence of the Lambs two years earlier had a filming style and some plot elements that pushed the medium a little. So it's safe to say that there is no distraction in Philadelphia from the one thing that matters, the struggle of Beckett to survive, with dignity. In fact, it depends on its utterly ordinary feel to succeed among a wide audience.Like Brokeback Mountain (an Ang Lee film), Philadelphia is a breakthrough for the ordinary person. The themes in both films (being a gay cowboy, or dying of AIDS) were things not easily talked about or understood by many people, and many of these people went to the movie and had to come face to face with it. By not making Philadelphia sensational in any way (gay sex, for example, is only mentioned in passing), it became completely mainstream. And the two leads and the director are not homosexual, so it isn't a "gay" movie. For that large audience, at that time, the film was really important and probably a deep experience.But for many others who have already absorbed the facts and meaning of the content of the film, the man dying and the trial, the movie is more ordinary, with some common plot advances and side events. Time has made these facts a proved history, and they lack controversy. On its own, Philadelphia is a well made but formulaic movie. But Tom Hanks? His performance really is extraordinary, and that will stand the test of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Philadephia. A Necessary Film About Difficult Subjects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If Philadelphia were only a legal drama, it would be magnificent. It is more than that. It is a commentary of how the negative perceptions of homosexuality and AIDS permeated society. Some perceptions still do. These taboo subjects are seen as off limits in some circles. But all issues are worthy of serious discussion, however uncomfortable they may be. Under the veil disguise of a courtroom drama, Philadelphia makes that possible.Andrew Beckett is a talented young attorney at a prestigious Philadelphia law office. By his own account, he is an "exceptional lawyer" who has quickly risen up the ladder at his firm. Beckett is also a homosexual suffering from AIDS; details of his personal life he has kept from his employers. When Beckett is suddenly fired from his job, he attempts to bring a wrongful termination suit. After an exhausted search for willing counsel, he is finally represented by Joe Miller. Miller is an ambulance chasing personal injury attorney leery of taking on a homosexual client with AIDS.Jonathan Demme is one of those remarkable directors who is never locked into one specific genre. He has the comic credit of Married to the Mob, the psychological thriller Silence of the Lambs and the compelling social drama Philadelphia. Most directors find a niche and stick with it. Demme refuses to do so. Such daring film choice should be commended.What all his films have in common is strong characters, talented actors and compelling scenes to exhibit their talents. Demme sets the scene, puts his actors in position and allows their gifts to be displayed for the world to see. The results are breathtaking. The scenes between Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster in Silence of the Lambs carried the film. Philadelphia had similar moments. Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington are two of the most talented actors in film, as their recognition by The Academy would indicate. Both were given opportunity to shine in Philadelphia. The courtroom provided Washington the stage to make his case against fear, hatred and discrimination of those 'different' from us. In the Courtroom it may be called grandstanding. In Philadelphia, Washingtons's scenes are powerful and resonate with the audience; the ultimate jury.With the multitude of outstanding dramatic roles now in his repertoire, one must remember that Philadelphia was one of Tom Hanks first dramatic performances. This, combined with the intense subject matter, made it an ambitious undertaking. Hanks is tremendous. Hanks' emotional performance in Beckett's apartment, with the Aria playing, is one of the great moments of the film and likely cemented his place as a sensational dramatic actor. The music, lighting and camera work only added to the power of the moment.Music was another key player in this film. Rock legends Bruce Springsteen and Neil Young open and close the film respectively with tender melodies that act as bookends for this powerful film. The Young song Philadephia together with the touching home movies, close out the film as emotionally as any in recent memory.At the heart of Philadelphia is the issue of discrimination. At one point in the film Joe Miller has to remind a colleague, despite what they both may think of homosexuality, "a law's been broken here...you do remember the law?". While Beckett's suit balloons into a landmark case, that is not his intention. He only wants "what is fair and what is right". You do not need to be a gay rights activist to support this notion of universal freedom from discrimination.Ultimately, Philadelphia brings the issues of homosexuality and AIDS discrimination to the forefront of conscience thought. It was the first studio picture to tackle these subjects. Beckett is a successful attorney with a loving partner. He has the support of family and friends. These are wonderful qualities, whatever your sexual orientation. Philadelphia reminds us that, at our core, we all have the same wants and needs. To deny us this is unacceptable. Philadelphia proudly takes up this charge and, in the process, gives us the pleasure of a truly outstanding film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Andrew Beckett is a University of Pennsylvania law-school graduate who works for the largest corporate law firm in Philadelphia. Andy is successful, easy-going, secretly gay, and an AIDS patient. Because his boss Jason Wheeler has a strong prejudice against gay people, Andy hides the truth about his sexuality along with his life partner, Miguel Alvarez from the members of the firm. Though not a full partner in the firm, his legal performance is exceptional, and he is promoted to the post of Senior Associate (one step beneath full partnership) and he is assigned the most important case the firm has taken on.His condition has reached the stage when he has developed Kaposi's Sarcoma, a form of cancer marked by multiple tumors on the lymph nodes and skin. He has been using make-up to cover the lesions, but a member of the firm notices one that has appeared on his forehead. On the last day that they can file the papers in the case he has been assigned, he has finished the necessary forms for the case to be submitted. Leaving the paperwork on his desk in plain sight, he informs the clerk about it, instructing him to file them with the court, and he leaves. An hour later, the clerk phones him asking where the papers are ? they are not on his desk. Additionally, all of the copies on his computer's hard drive have been erased. His work had been sabotaged and he is promptly fired from the law firm the next day.Andrew tries to hire a lawyer to take his case and sue the firm for illegal dismissal, lost earnings, and punitive damages, but nobody will take an AIDS patient as a client. One of the attorneys he attempts to hire is Joe Miller, a family man and injury lawyer against whom he had argued in an earlier case. Andrew's appearance is markedly different from when Miller saw him previously, and when Andrew reveals that he has AIDS, Miller's entire mood changes. Miller is homophobic and not knowledgeable about how AIDS is spread, fearing that Andrew's handling of objects in his office can spread the disease. Miller steadfastly refuses to take Andrew's case for personal reasons, and is so fearful that he later gets a checkup from his doctor.Ultimately, Andrew is compelled to act as his own attorney. They encounter each other again at a law library where Andrew has been doing research; people in the room are leaving the immediate area when they see him and one librarian attempts to persuade him to move to a private room. Miller is disgusted with the behavior he is witnessing ? behavior he was guilty of when earlier discussing the homosexual lifestyle with his wife Lisa ? and, after going over some of the material Andrew had already prepared, decides to take the case. After Miller gives the firm a summons during a Philadelphia 76ers basketball game, Wheeler and the other partners discuss wanting to find out if Beckett is a member of any LGBT rights groups and frequents gay bars.Andrew and Joe gain great trust and respect for each other as they fight a David v. Goliath case, much to the shock, admiration, and, for some, disgust of the population. Miller must show that Andrew is a good man, not a threat, and that his boss fired him under fraudulent pretenses as he begins to realize that gay and bisexual people are still human beings with feelings. As the case goes before the court, the partners of the firm take the stand one-by-one, and commit open perjury ? smearing Andrew's name, claiming he was incompetent, and deliberately tried to hide his condition and sexual orientation. Andrew had planned to tell his employers about his homosexuality - but after hearing his coworkers and the firm's head lawyer, Charles Wheeler, tell a homophobic joke in their athletic club's sauna, abandoned the idea. Alleging that the partners learned of his illness from a lesion on his forehead, Beckett's case is proved graphically to the jury when Miller asks him to unbutton his shirt while on the witness stand, revealing that his lesions were indeed visible and recognizable as such.Later, during Wheeler's cross-examination by Miller, Andrew has a blackout in court and goes into his final medical crisis. Andrew does prevail in court and the jury orders the firm to make a large payout, consisting of $140,000 in back pay, $100,000 for pain and suffering and $4,000,000 in punitive damages. He learns of the victory as his family gathers around him at the hospital. Andrew's head has been shaved, and he's been blinded in one eye by the vicious seizures and medication. He removes his oxygen mask to speak to Miller when the attorney arrives (to great Beckett family fanfare). When Andrew, at one time, struggles to breathe, the previously phobic Miller replaces the mask on Andrew's face, touching his skin in the process. Miller knows this is the last time he will speak to his client and friend, but yet says, "I'll see you soon". Finally, all the family says their goodbyes and Andrew is left to spend his final moments with Miguel. Miguel dims the lights in the room, and begins kissing the fingers of his lover. Andrew removes his mask and tells Miguel...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I saw this movie I rated Tom Hanks as a competent actor, always consistent and dedicated to his craft. Roles that stood out for me where undoubtedly Forrest Gump and of course The Green Mile. I came into this movie knowing absolutely nothing about the plot, characters whether it was popular or how widely known it was. My house mate had rented it out, and left it sitting on the table. I picked it up and looking at the cover saw Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington staring back. Of course with two solid and professional actors like that your pretty much guaranteed a movie of a certain standard. But still I was hesitant about watching it thinking it must be some already overdone story about two strong interesting characters coming into and then overcoming some obstacles, providing views on life and such along the way.I can't believe I almost didn't watch this movie. I wont tell you anything about the plot or the story. Because even though the plot is interesting and the story relevant, you'll have seen it done a hundred times in other movies, television or literature. The reason you will want to see this movie will be to witness Tom Hanks sink his teeth so deep into a role that he will make Forest Gump look like a training exercise. Not that it overshadows it, the opposite in fact, seeing him capable of this extraordinary performance only leaves you wondering, if you didn't already, how you didn't see before what a remarkable actor he is. If I have led you to believe that this film offers nothing more than Hank's incredible performance then that is not my intention. The film itself is staggeringly magnificent, see for yourself and let the film take you in and Tom Hanks leave you breathless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good movie about discrimination.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It could be argued that Tom Hanks had one of the best runs of any actor, with the movies he made in the mid-1990s. Here in 1993 he won for best actor in "Philadelphia", and the next year for best actor in "Forrest Gump." Those are the highlights, but he was in several other fine movies during that time. Ah, to be so fortunate.In "Philadelphia" Tom Hanks plays Andrew Beckett, by all measures a fine lawyer with an important law firm. However, he develops AIDS and, as he begins to show symptoms is fired. The firm gives its reasons, none of which make sense to Andrew. He decides to sue in court, but has difficulty finding an attorney to take his case. His search takes him to Joe Miller (Denzel Washington) who also steadfastly refuses, because he has a prejudice against gays, especially those with AIDS. Andrew persists, in the process making Joe come to grips with his flaws.It is interesting that a dark-skinned actor (Washington) was chosen to play the person that has the prejudice, which is a turn-around of many roles that Washington has taken in many other movies. Both he and Hanks give superb performances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Philadelphia could have been just another court room drama and then no-one would have noticed it if it hadn't had such big actors in its cast. But this one is different thanks to its subject.Andrew Beckett (Tom Hanks) is a gay lawyer with AIDS who has lost his job at a conservative law firm because of his disease. He knows he has a case against his former employer, but no other lawyer dares to defend him, except for one. Joe Miller (Denzel Washington) is a homophobic small time lawyer who decides to defend him anyway, only because the law has been broken, not because he likes Beckett all that much.Like I already said, this movie could have gone by unnoticed, but it didn't. I guess you have to be extremely homophobic or you've got to have a heart of stone if you aren't touched by it. Not only the story, but also the images are very powerful. You see how his health gets worse as the story progresses and you can almost feel his suffering. This movie would have been OK anyway thanks to the good direction and the story, but it is thanks to the great performances of Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington that this movie has become an icon. Even Antonio Banderas, who isn't know for his excellent movies, was more than just good in this one.All in all, thanks to the strong performances and the good story this movie has become a classic in the genre that should be seen by everybody. I reward it with an 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as groundbreaking as we thought</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1993 and AIDS was emerging as the most fearful disease on the planet. It had surfaced in the mid 80's but the early 90's saw its establishment as a terrifying and ultimately fatal disease. What made it so petrifying was the fact the exchange of blood or sexual fluids were its methods of contraction, so even the most precautious individual could still acquire it by an infected blood transfusion.Making a drama based on this horrific condition is, on paper, an extremely sound and worthy narrative. How does the suffering of AIDS cause stigma, labelling, and ultimately the breakdown of physical and social faculties? Is it as terminatory as the media portray it to be?To this end we have Philadelphia, starring Tom Hanks as Andrew Beckett, a hotshot lawyer whose ascent to the top of his firm has been quick and impressive. His record is top class and he's been assigned the most prestigious case in the company's history. However, when he becomes afflicted by AIDS his bosses fire him on grounds of incompetency, when a report he made, which was critical to the big case, mysteriously disappears from both his desk and computer hard drive. Convinced he was 'sabotaged' he decides to take them to court with the aid of the homophobic (Beckett is gay though he concealed it from his bosses) 'TV guy' lawyer Joe Miller, magnificently played by Denzel Washington. After an edgy start to their relationship the 2 take the corporation head on in a courtroom drama.Without doubt the acting is excellent in Philadelphia. Hanks and Washington bounce off each other tremendously and a mutual respect between them is obvious. The problem with this film is the script is too contrived and many aspects are just not plausible. One of these will only become apparent when you see the film, and for me to explore it would be a spoiler.Another is the fact of Miller's bizarrely quick switch from homophobe to 'quite comfortable with it all, really.' His anti-gay language initially is strong, and yet it doesn't seem to take him long to come round at all.Also, the movie is unsure if it is being a protest against homophobia or a sympathetic portrayal of the sufferers of AIDS, and it left me confused as to exactly what its message was.Ultimately that was its letdown - for such an attempt at a powerfully emotive movie it seemed to misfire in places, and no amount of oscar-winning acting could change that.Puzzling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was recently shown on UK network TV and I saw it for the first time. I remember the hoo-hah when it was originally released, at the crest of the "AIDS awareness" wave, as the first "studio" movie to deal with gay men and AIDS. I avoided it then, as an unnecesary and overblown exersize in liberal hand-wringing. Finally seeing it seven years later and out of its armchair-political hot potato context, it's hard to see it could possibly have gained "classic" status. How quickly it has dated, not just in the details of clunky cell-phones and the last gasp of 80s power-dressing, but in its desperate presentation of gay men and especially gay-men-with-AIDS as the essential fashion accesssory. It's the movie-town mentality behind the exchange in "The Player", where attending an AA meeting isn't about your drinking problem, it's because that's where the deals are being done this year. Out of its time, "Philadelphia" passes as an effective melodrama in the "Erin Brokovitch" style, lifted out of the disease-of-the-week TV movie ghetto by otherwise unjustified star and directorial interest. Hanks and Demme don't phone it in, but the result isn't a "great" movie either. Anyone wishing to praise the film on its own merits should first consider the runaway-train inevitablity of every element of the plot. Then try to coherently justify the painful, extraordinary and bizarre "favourite aria" sequence. Like Denzel Washington's character, ultimately you just want to get away quickly and not make eye contact.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my favorites movies and I have reasons. It ain't just because of its great performance, or the perfect sound track, it's the humanity, the good things, the logic things and the bad ones. Good things like the passion for music, the understanding in the couples, the friendship. Logic such as established prejudices (I'm not sure if I'm telling it right)and the idiosyncrasy of a kind of people. Bad things like pure racism and discrimination. But above all, the hope. The hope in the world that we live and its rights and laws.Speaking of rights, what a great decision was the Oscar prize, Tom Hanks were great, specially the part when you only see him and listen to the song, he doesn't speak but he doesn't have to either, just his face tells us everything.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that will never be forgotten.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I watched this movie, I expected just the normal routine: guy getting fired because he's gay and has AIDS and he hires a lawyer to fight his cause and they win. But Philadelphia was more than that. It is a movie that makes us aware that gay people/people stricken with AIDS, HIV or any life-threatening disease are created equal as well. We are so frightened of gay people or people with AIDS that we alienate these people completely ignorant of the fact that they are part of the "all men created equal".Before Philadelphia was made, Tom Hanks was just a comedic actor. He appeared on sitcoms and SNL and performed in comedies like "Bachelor Party", "Splash", "Big". But all he wanted to do was to become a dramatic actor. Then this movie came and Hanks really pulled off the greatest performance of his life winning an well deserved Oscar. In the movie, Hanks portrays Andrew Beckett, a gay lawyer stricken with AIDS who is fired by his bosses. Sick and furious, he hires Joe Miller, a homophobic lawyer played by Denzel Washington to fight for his cause. But throughout the movie, audiences can see the pain and suffering Andrew Beckett is going through. In Joe Miller's office, when Miller says that he can't take the case, you can see the hurt in Beckett's face. During the courtroom scenes (particularly these scenes top A Few Good Men by a lot), Beckett is still in pain because of the sickness and angry. He looks at his bosses in loathing and Miller as hope. But the opera scene after the party is the real scene stealer as Beckett recalls his favorite opera. Audiences see the joy in his face that he had before he was fired. It didn't matter that he was gay, he was ecstatic, his life was fulfilled, HE HAD EVERYTHING. Upon his death scene, he is very happy to have won the case and passes away in peace.As mentioned before, Tom Hanks was never taken seriously until this movie and he gives his greatest performance ever, even better than Forrest Gump. This was his first dramatic performance and he really pulled it off, winning a well-deserved Oscar. Denzel Washington has always been a great actor and he does a superb job as the lawyer who sheds his homophobia to defend his client who in his eyes is as equal as all men. Probably Washington's best scene is when he grabs the young black guy who doubts he can succeed in the case and exclaims, "I don't give a damn about what you think about me, I am a lawyer and I am going to win this case!" His determination and commitment for Beckett's case are the most vital aspects of this film. These two titans of Hollywood are the best dramatic duo ever. Their chemistry is so well done that they are indeed the best actors ever in Hollywood. Also supporting them are Jason Robards as his boss, Mary Steensburgen as the opposing lawyer who gives a great villainous performance, Joanne Woodward as Tom Hanks's mother, and Antonio Banderas as Tom Hanks's gay partner.Director Jonathan Demme, coming off of a huge success in The Silence of the Lambs, does even more in Philadelphia. He does not try to show a true biopic, rather he is showing the portrait of a everyday man who happens to be gay and to have AIDS. The courtroom scenes are shot so beautifully that as mentioned, they surpass Kramer Vs. Kramer, A Few Good Men and many more courtroom dramas. Overall, this film is the best human told story ever. This is a great film which inspires everyone to take action against any prejudice. I applaud this film as a landmark to discovering that we must take action against discrimination and homophobia. Even those who are homophobic should realize the fact that everyone is created equal. We must not judge anybody by their skin, sex, diseases and homosexuality for that is wrong and unjust. This movie doesn't deserve a 10 out of 10. It deserves a 12 out of 10! A MUST SEE MOVIE!!!!</fullReview>

This movie was the first movie to deal with a deadly virus called Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (aka AIDS). Hanks plays Andrew Beckett, a homosexual lawyer who tries to conceal his ill and his private life from his bosses led by Charles Wheeler (Jason Robards- Enemy of the State, Crimson Tide). His bosses find out that their "golden boy is gay and has AIDS" and fire him. Beckett then Seeks represention from injures lawyer Joe Miller (Washington), who is homophobic and at first rejects him but then he decides that its the right thing to do. Tom Hanks won a well deserved Best Actors academy award (then won the same award a year later for Forrest Gump), but I think Denzel Washington was better. Definately one of Demmes best.</fullReview>

Once discovered, the firm frames him for incompetence, and sacks him. In response, he hires a homophobic ambulance chaser played by Denzel Washington, and sues his old firm. Sound good? Well, it's not that good, or nearly as good as it should be. Instead of drama, we're given a politically correct, preachy, propaganda tract. Propaganda is still propaganda, even when the cause is noble. The acting is top-notch, production values are high-end, and the results are?boring.

		<fullReview>PHILADELPHIA - * * * * out of * * * * * D: Jonathan Demme S: Tom Hanks, Denzel Washington, Jasob Robards, Mary Steenburgen, Antonio Banderas"Philadelphia" is a sometimes overbearing but nevertheless enjoyable film about a gay man (Hanks) infected with AIDS, who sues his employer (Robards) for firing him over prejudice. It was the first mainstream Hollywood production to deal with AIDS so openly, and the film, knowing this from the start, quickly becomes way too preachy about coming to accept homosexuality as a lifestyle. Other than that, the film itself is quite entertaining.The film starts out during the early nineties, where attorney Tom Hanks has just gotten promoted by his boss Jason Robards. But when Hanks' character starts to develop the signs of AIDS, his employers fire him from their company and pretend that they did so because he didn't work hard enough. "His work was satisfactory," one of his employers says on trial later in the film.Hanks, realizing this is all a lie (and rightly so!), goes to attorney Joe Miller (Denzel Washington), who at first turns down Hanks' case. I like the part where they meet. Washington: "What happened to your face?" Hanks: "I have AIDS." Denzel's character suddenly walks away to the opposite side of the room, like most of us would upon encountering someone infected with AIDS. Later Washington visits his doctor, afraid that he might have caught the disease from shaking hands with Hanks.After dealing with his homophobia, Joe Miller takes on the case when he sees Hanks reading a book in a public library and being asked by an employee of the library to go to a separate room away from the public. "Wouldn't you be more comfortable in a private room?" asks the library worker. "No, would you?" Hanks replies.The library scene is a parallel of something else. Denzel Washington is, of course, a black man, or African-American. Seeing Hanks being treated with such cruelty makes Washington's character think of his roots, and how his ancestors were treated. That's the real reason he takes on the case. Because he identifies with Hanks.This is where the film starts to get too preachy. It just continues to be consistently preachy about homosexuality. I am not homophobic, but the constant agenda gets tiring.Hanks outplays Denzel Washington and everyone else in his Oscar-winning role, but to tell you the truth I've seen him do better and I wondered if he got this Academy Award simply because of the subject matter at hand. At least he earned it, unlike some other people who have gotten Oscars over the years.In the end, "Philadelphia" is a bit too preachy about homosexuality and our culture coming to accept it. If you look past the message, however, it is a pretty good film, the only other problem being the long stretches in between that account for the film's two and a half hour + running time.</fullReview>

The same with "Philadelphia." Frankly, Magic Johnson's TV announcement that he had HIV was far more moving than this film. Hard to believe it won any awards. Especially feeble are the court room scenes from which Jonathan Demme has managed to drain every ounce of energy. In 2005, Tom Hanks' Oscar winning role as the lawyer dying of AIDS is completely unaffecting. Denzel Washington is stiff as a board, and Jason Robards is a laughable villain.

		<shortDescription>A ground-breaking film and a splendid one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Philadelphia is ground-breaking for being the first major Hollywood film about AIDS and for Tom Hanks receiving his first Best Actor Oscar. The good thing is that Philadelphia is a great, no splendid, film that handles a difficult subject remarkably.It's a well-made film, not one of the most beautiful-looking films ever but it's nonetheless shot with style and grace and the close ups look good and don't feel overused at all. It's also beautifully directed by Silence of the Lambs' Jonathan Demme, he ensures that everything looks good, that the characters remain interesting and that the drama is fully allowed to resonate emotionally, with some lovely subtle touches like in the family scenes.The music fits like a glove, not just the soothing resonance of Howard Shore's score but especially the song choices. Two song choices stood out, the Oscar-winning and very powerful Streets of Philadelphia by Bruce Springsteen and in particular the near-definitive Maria Callas rendition of the sublime La Mamma Morta from Andrea Chenier accompanying the opera scene. The script is very thoughtful and enough to stir up plenty of emotions, it is a touch heavy-handed on occasions but considering the subject matter there was always going to be a chance it was going to happen. Philadelphia also has a hugely compelling and deeply moving story, and that is not just because of having a sensitive subject and dealing with it as intelligently as the film did, but also the numerous powerful scenes. The final scene, Miller intervening when Andy's discriminated against in the library, the 'children on the back of the bus' line, Miller's speech on breaking the law and Andy's expression as he steps out of Miller's office after being rejected are all really well done scenes that get even better on repeat viewings, but the standout is the opera scene, not just the perfect choice of music but it's also such an emotionally powerful scene, due to it being a master-class in close-up acting and how life-affirming it is(not just for Joe in his epiphany moment but for the viewer as well).Philadelphia has a top-notch cast who all give wonderful performances thanks to interesting characters(Miller being the one that progresses the most)and powerful material. Tom Hanks fully deserved his Best Actor Oscar, not just because of the truly brave nature of the role but also, and especially so, the amount of emotional connection Hanks puts into it, not filling the 'gay stereotype' at all. He is especially brilliant in the opera scene and at the end. Denzel Washington has the meatier role and plays it with such authority and compelling poise, also showing excellent chemistry with Hanks, while I appreciated the subdued performance of Antonio Banderas and Joanne Woodward's nuanced turn as Andy's mother. Jason Robards also stands out, underneath the bluff his character is a complete reptile which Robards plays to bone-chilling effect.All in all, splendid film and more than just a ground-breaking film about AIDS. 9/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Look up the saddest films of all time, I guarantee you'll find this. Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington carry this film with astonishing performances that are a trademark in both careers.A homosexual man with AIDS, (Tom Hanks) sues his law firm for unfairly firing him because of his condition, with the help of his homophobic and germaphobic lawyer, (Denzel Washington).It's corny, canny, and patriotic, exploring several themes of HIV discrimination, homophobia, and law corruption. It stays focused on its message, serving it proudly and strongly. As soon as the beginning starts up some Bruce Springsteen, you're immediately surrounded by the Philadelphia environment.Even though I like Tom Hanks's character in Forrest Gump more, I think this is the better performance, possibly in his whole career. He displays the process of sickness in the most gripping way possible that will make you not be able to stop watching. At the same time he's incredibly inspirational as a character who cries out for homosexual and AIDS support. Denzel Washington is super supportive. Very unlikable at the beginning, but learns to overcome his fear of gays and AIDS to understand the importance of friends and the friendly nature of people.All the scenes with Tom Hanks with his family and friends just make the ending all the more sad. I put the spoiler warning on here just in case, though most people should get that he dies in the end because it's AIDS. With that said, the ending is literally unmatched in how sad it is. It's not a struggle because you instantly lose as soon as that Neil Young song starts playing. Don't fight it, you will lose.This film doesn't try too hard to hammer in its message. It just gets it across and tells its story, leaving on a powerful note. Simply a must see film that will inspire you to no end. A trademark for Tom Hanks, and Denzel Washington.</fullReview>

Andrew Beckett (Hanks) is an exceptional senior associate who is suddenly fired. His employers say it is due to attitude and incompetence?two traits Beckett is not known for?while he claims their reasons are lies and that he was really terminated because they had learned of his orientation and/or HIV-status. Beckett hires Joe Miller (Washington), a homophobic personal injury lawyer who he had worked a previous case with, for representation. Excellent performances all around, with a plot that keeps you hooked from beginning to end (which can be somewhat unusual for some courtroom dramas). Despite the well-developed characters played by very talented actors, the sad scenes never really touch you. Based on events of attorneys Geoffrey Bowers and Clarence B. Cain.***?

		<fullReview>Philadelphia will always hold a place in cinematic history, as it is the first major film to really address the discrimination against Aids and Homosexuality. It also was the beginning of Tom Hanks amazing run of Academy nominated film, that may never be duplicated. The message of the film comes across loud and clear, but not quite in the way that the film's producers intended. Andrew Beckett (Tom Hanks) was a top attorney with one of Philadelphia's top law firms, when all of a sudden he's fired. Beckett believes he was set up and fired because he has Aids, but can he prove it in court? As the film goes, it is easy to see the discrimination and stereotypes that Beckett has to face on a daily basis, and weather or not you accept homosexuality, it's powerful ending will make you feel for the plight of any homosexual who suffers from this horrible disease. The majority of this film takes place in the courtroom and centers around Beckett's case against his former employer, and as someone who has studied the law, I can tell you that the case destroyed the merits of this film. There are things that both sides do, that would never be allowed in a court of law, and in my opinion neither side really makes it's case. As far as the legal aspect of this trial goes, it is very subjective and would never lead to the verdict that was handed down. As for the stars of this film, they are the ones that make it as powerful as it was. Hanks gives a performance that was absolutely worthy of the best actor award, as following him and his story is really what gave the film it's reputation. Quite ingeniously, Hanks is paired with Denzel Washington, who plays his attorney. Washington's character is meant to represent how much of the audience felt at that time, as even while representing Beckett, he speaks out about Aids and Homosexuality. The more he works to represent Beckett, the more you can see his attitude change, the same way the audiences attitudes change as the film moves alone. I loved Philadelphia for it's performances and it's message, but as far as the story goes, the trial is the majority of the film, and the trial is completely unbelievable. In my opinion the trial takes away much of the film credibility. The issue and the case should have been more clear cut and the legality of it all should have been easier for the audience to understand. That being said, if you choose to watch this film, you will be hard pressed to find better performances by a better cast, but the story will leave you feeling somewhat incomplete.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delivering A Safely Packaged Message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those Time Capsule Films that is Stuck in the Era when it was Made as Attitudes and Awareness of the Subject, Homosexuality and AIDS, have Changed Dramatically. It was the First Major Hollywood Attempt to Illuminate the Gays and the Disease and in doing so Felt it Necessary to Package it in a Viewer Friendly Picture that Distanced Itself from some Very Disturbing Horrors.The Physical Decrepitation that the Disease Ravages on the Body and the Societal and Personal Prejudices are Touched on Rather Lightly to make it Acceptable for the Main Stream and at the Same Time Deliver some Insight into the Plight of the Lifestyle and some of its Unfortunate Victims.Tom Hanks, Receiving the Oscar, is Shown for Example, as a "One Partner" Gay who Strayed Only Once, and not a Multi-Multi Sexual Partner, that Many Homosexual Males Engage in with Sometimes Hundred of Lovers. Of Course this Ups Our Sympathy for Him. Adding in a Safe and Familiar Courtroom Drama to let the Story Unfold is Another Easy Way Out.But Again, this is 1993, Only a few Years After the President, Ronald Reagan Refused to Even Speak the Word AIDS. So it was still a Very Naive Period to Explore these Things, Especially if a Wide Audience was Expected. Overall it is a Noble Mainstream Effort with a Strong Cast and it was Successful in Shining towards that Dark Corner of Middle America where No One Wanted to Look. Today, the Movie seems Even More Safe and Held Back. That is because there has been a Growth of Consciousness and an Evolution of Thinking that was Mostly Absent in Mainstream Thought. The Film can be Given some Credit, for a Small Contribution for Part of that Education.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie about a reality..it could be anyone with a different problem but the same story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where to begin? For me the most beautiful thing about cinema is the power to insert us in a reality that may have little or nothing to do with ours. If a movie succeeds on doing this, (with of course a touch of fiction that makes reality more, let's say intense and interesting to watch)than it's a great movie to me. I had heard of Philadelphia several times and what it was about, but I never seek to watch the movie. It just didn't click. But the other day it passed on TV and I decided to watch. It turned out to be a great decision! Happilly I never met or knew of anyone with HIV around me (thank God!), but as a young pharmacy student I've a small idea what it means. A small idea because no one that doesn't walk on this people shoes can really understand them. Despite that, Philadelphia led me through a reality of someone living with HIV and the reality of people around him. The story it's amazing and it's told very well. Tom Hanks performance it's just amazing. I don't think I've seen him doing something like this in the last few years, so it sort of explains where he stands now. Overall every performance, soundtrack and scenes put you in middle of this reality: disease,fear of the unknown, challenges, discrimination, above all this comprehension,friendship and love. This movie brought me into this reality, got me thinking and made me feel sorry and at the same time happy for Hank's character. Overall thoughts: It's nice to see that in the 90's some people we're already mind opened, but how much have we evolved since then? As I see it, not much. We know much more about HIV, but the fear it's still present. Concerning the movie, it's not about gay people, it's not about HIV people, it's about everyone who has something different in them and are put aside "gently" and discretely to avoid issues. How many of us wouldn't like to have an hero available to go against this? I certainly recommend it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Essential Film For Everyone.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the first mainstream films in Hollywood to cover the issue of HIV/AIDS, Philadelphia is a sensibly told, brilliantly crafted &amp; strongly performed cinema that's powerful, essential &amp; heartbreaking at the same time and also works as a thought-provoking social commentary that has a lot to say about the society we live in.Set in the titular town, Philadelphia tells the story of Andrew Beckett; a closet homosexual infected with AIDS who sues his former law firm after they fire him when they find out about his condition. Unable to find a lawyer to represent his case, Beckett is compelled to act as his own attorney but eventually finds an unlikely ally in a homophobic lawyer.Directed by Jonathan Demme (known for The Silence of the Lambs), Philadelphia covers a wide range of issues that were prevalent in the community then and still continue to exist in few places but is primarily about an individual's fight against injustice &amp; discrimination. It has as much to say about homosexuality &amp; homophobia as it ends up saying about AIDS.The finely executed technical aspects are entirely in service of its story &amp; characters. Tom Hanks completely throws himself under the skin of his character and plays him from inside out to deliver a performance that's easily one of his finest works. Even Denzel Washington leaves a lasting impression with a committed input and his scenes with Hanks do make up for the film's best moments.On an overall scale, Philadelphia is an engaging, enlightening &amp; heartfelt drama that offers an insightful understanding of the disease it's about while wonderfully exposing the darker side of human nature without pointing any fingers. As informative as it is rewarding, this film is simply a plea for humanity that asks its audience to not make lives harder for people who are having a hard time surviving anyway. An essential viewing for everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film cannot age</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot is simple and the meaning is just as simple. But the film is not interesting so much because of this plot, but because of the high level of human contradictions and inhuman bigotry invested in every sequence of it.A young brilliant and promising lawyer gets recruited by one important law firm in Philadelphia and within some years he is entrusted with one of the most important cases they have ever had in their hands. But within a few weeks he is purely and simply fired for incompetence. The logic of this extremely fast career and the swiftness with which it is broken is of course suspicious. The lawyer is gay and has aids. The lawyer goes to court and all the lawyers he contacts to represent him refuse, including a friend of his, his tenth and last chance. But that's how America was in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Afraid and fundamentally hostile to gay people in the name of anything that could justify their bigotry, and first of all their reading of the Bible.The tenth lawyer finally accepts to represent him because of the Federal Vocational Rehabilitation Act of 1973 that prevents any kind of discrimination for any kind of handicap, provided the work required is done properly. They find some jurisprudence and one antecedent case in which a court accepted to consider AIDS as being such a physical condition that could be considered as a handicap and thus any hostile attitude or any attitude that will not treat such a person as any other is discrimination.The plot is simple, I said, and the case is won with a hefty amount of damages, about 5 millions.The film is very strong because the lawyer will have a final seizure in court and the trial will go on and come to an end in his absence. The sentence will be pronounced, him being still alive in hospital. They all, his family, his lawyer and some friends, convened in his room to celebrate the sentence but he will not survive this evening and will die in the night in the sole presence of his partner. The court decision will not be appealed because you cannot introduce a legal suit against a dead person. The trial became history and jurisprudence, common law as some call it.The acting is of course essential and it is true at times the situations and the hatred of homophobic people make that acting iffy in many ways, skating on the thin ice of the civil war some would like to start to exterminate these agents of the devil gay people are accused of being. But the judge himself, at the end of the trial, when the boss of the law firm is testifying, seems to be becoming less tolerant with their antics and forces that boss to answer some very embarrassing questions, embarrassing for the law firm of course, like the treatment this lawyer and ten of his ship mates when he was in the navy submitted one gay sailor to. Too gross to even quote the script.This film also made history because of its Best Actor Oscar. Public opinion in the USA started to turn in that period after the strict rejection of AIDS as the gay plague and hence, like all plagues since even before Moses, the punishment of God against sin, in this case against homosexuals. But starting only because in 1996 Bill Clinton managed to get the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) passed in Congress. One of the most vicious and pernicious laws against gay people.And only twenty years later (DOMA) was finally ruled unconstitutional at federal level by the US Supreme Court. Twenty long years of legal segregation at federal level. And only thirteen states so far have legalized gay marriage. The road is still long, even if thirteen states are enough to block any possible amendment to the US constitution that requires thirty-eight states to be ratified.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Goodnight, AIDS and 20 Years Pass</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While my people have made vast improvements and strides, the 'F' word ? no, not the four-letter kind, is still unkindly used. The "fear" is still here, the prejudice breathes, the partners are thrown out of the ER and some are still fired. The year is 1993.In 1993, it's only decades past two drinking fountains and, yet, most barely blink when there's a black lawyer, such as the case in Philadelphia. What other's blink less at is that he's blatantly bigoted. Only because it's against homosexuals.Back then, and I lived then, I came out then, I saw all of this and more from personal experience, gays probably had their biggest onslaught of coming out than in the history of the world. What a wonderful, scary and tranquility time it was. It wasn't easy. We were barely accepted as human.Today, it's much better, but not all there. When the percentages of anti-marriage equality are still in the double digits, we still have issues. But, this movie isn't about all that. It's about hatred and fear and men acting like children.Andrew Beckett (Tom Hanks, in his first of two back-to-back deserved Best Actor Oscars) is obviously fired for a couple of reasons, none of which were valid: for being gay and having AIDS. Now, remember young ones of 2013: this is when AIDS was incredibly misunderstood and more than 70% of people were still stuck in the Dark Ages, or homophobia. People understood AIDS then as much as they misunderstood gays. Somehow, homosexuals weren't human beings just like them.As a last resort, Andrew turns to what turns out to be an ironically horrible homophobe, Joe Miller (Denzel Washington) to help prosecute the big and definitely bad law firm who fired Andrew.I love court cases, especially movies about them. The fiction, the better. The hard-to-win ones are the best. This one was incredibly hard to prove and to convince a 1993 jury that gays, namely ones with AIDS, have rights, would be an uphill battle by all means. Mercifully, this movie isn't all about that.It's a story of a good man who made a mistake. It's about a man who needs to change ? sorry, but Joe does. It's about idiot big wigs who need to remember that there's a reason we call the dark ages dark.The performances were excellent, the dialogue, script, cinematography and score wonderful. The two best attributes to this, now almost 20-year-old great film, is the heartfelt finale ? yes, I cried?"Goodnight. See you tomorrow?" and the Bruce Springsteen song, "Streets of Philadelphia." Not just a powerful song in this movie, but an overall masterpiece of lyrics and music.While some of this does not apply today (2013, 20 years later) and the court case seems a bit mild ? I prefer a little more drama, this movie definitely holds up for the most part and shows our history and our hopes of not repeating this. It's recommended as a deep history of recent and dark past.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Philadelphia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Philadelphia is a wonderful film about a courageous man that decides to sue his former employer, a prestigious law firm, for a wrongful termination after they find out that he has AIDS. Andrew Beckett, played by Tom Hanks, has the deadly disease; however, he chose not to tell his colleagues about his disease. Unfortunately, the partners of the firm suspect that he has AIDS after spotting a lesion on his forehead, and within days, Beckett is terminated. Beckett brings about a lawsuit with the help of Joe Miller, played by Denzel Washington. At first, Miller did not want to take the case. Not only did he not agree with homosexuality, but also he was hesitant to work so closely with someone who had the AIDS virus.The theme of the movie seems to be about discrimination, in addition to fear and ignorance to the unknown. Beckett was a future partner of the firm; yet, was quickly fired once the firm found out about his disease. After asking for help from at least nine lawyers, Beckett visited Miller and asked for his help. Miller and Beckett knew each other from a previous case and Miller welcomes Beckett with a handshake, until he found out about the disease. Miller quickly backed away from Beckett, stared at his lesions, and refused to take the case. In a later scene, Beckett is at the library and is asked by the librarian to sit away from everyone else. When Beckett refuses, all those around him left their seats. As we know, AIDS cannot be transmitted through handshakes or sitting next to someone with the disease; however, once someone found out about Beckett's disease, they quickly separated themselves from him.Homosexuality is referred to several times throughout the movie and this motif is the reason for the discrimination against Beckett. As in the movie Boys Don't Cry, Beckett tries to live a normal life and tries to keep his homosexuality a secret; however, once it is discovered that he is homosexual and has AIDS, characters in the movie express their opinion about his lifestyle. In one scene, Beckett expresses his feelings to Miller with the help of an opera song. This scene is a very powerful scene and uses a red glowing light to symbolize the hurt and pain that Beckett feels as a man with AIDS and his pain of the discrimination that he receives. It is in this scene that Miller sees Beckett as more than a gay man with AIDS, but as a human being with fears and thoughts just like his own.I definitely recommend watching this movie. It gives a real insight to the everyday discrimination of people that may be different from others, and their hardships they have to overcome. It gives me a better understanding of the quote, "Don't judge a man until you have walked a mile in his boots."</fullReview>

He insisted that he was not a homophobic and that is how this film emerged. Any film that a filmmaker uses to prove himself contrary to popular belief is bad because the filmmaker is using the film to his own justice. Despite this factor working against him, Demme provides a strong story with Hanks's best performance to date and Washington in great form as well. The acting is what pulls this contradicting act by Demme across and Demme mostly conceals his urgency to not be called a homophobic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Philadelphia" is a pioneer in it's subject. Films involving prejudice weren't that usual in nineties, and fortunately this one has been done-- and in good style. Whilst several of the decade's courtroom dramas were centered in corruption and crime, this one used the subject prejudice to have an employment suit. Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington are very believable in their roles, thought Banderas wasn't that good. In the end the filmmakers chose for the easiest way to make the audience cry; when the protagonist died, they exposed old pictures and videotapes of him in the beach with his family, giving a nostalgic feeling that will probably make you cry or be depressed for big time. Brazilian's biographic movie called "Cazuza" has done the same old trick, but in that one I really had to cry. It was impossible to not feel melancholy with his mother's desperation and sadness..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review of "Philadelphia"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Philadelphia" is the story of Andrew Beckett (Hanks), a promising young lawyer at an upscale law firm. When the homosexual Beckett suddenly contracts AIDS he is fired unfairly fired from his workplace. Beckett then seeks the help of a small time homophobic lawyer, Joe Miller (Washington), to establish a wrongful dismissal case. Now from initial premise and the fact that I had heard Tom Hanks earned a Best Actor Oscar for his performance, I was expecting a fairly memorable movie. And I got one. Tom Hanks delivers one of his best and most moving performances with his portrayal of Beckett. Probably one of the most dynamic roles I've ever seen Hanks take on. He starts out as such a vibrant young man, yet as the film progresses, Beckett's illness does as well. Consequently, the audience witnesses the decline of a seemingly healthy man to a man who's body has been ravaged by an incurable disease. It's really quite heartbreaking. Tom Hanks worked well for this Oscar. Along side Hanks is Washington, who also gives a fine performance as the conflicted lawyer Miller. Like Beckett, Miller goes through a significant change as well - only his soul changes, not his health. It's really quite interesting to see Washington and Hanks work together on screen, as I've never seen it happen in any other film. The film also features a very well written script and a very nice direction from Jonathon Demme. The ending of this film is really quite something, and. . .yeah, I'll say it - the conclusion of this film was really intense for me to watch. Pretty emotional stuff. Overall I felt that "Philadelphia" is a poignant tale that succeeds in addressing many issues that have often been neglected in our time. I felt that it was filled to the brim with fine performances and palpable pathos. It's a great movie that I won't soon forget. Awesome.</fullReview>

And about options. So, it is not only a movie of AIDS victim or homosexuality, It is, in fact, only a mirror. And Tom Hanks is perfect as a kind of Don Quijote. As innocent fighter against the fake definitions, behind any illusion. Twilight of XX century in cruel colors. So, a document, testimony, definition of a world. Without excuses and jugglers.

		<shortDescription>Philadelphia is an extraordinary touching and heartbreaking story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thinking about the word " Philadelphia", I can visualize a beautiful city with greats prodigal buildings and a variety of entertainments. In contrast, the movie Philadelphia shows a sequence of events that contradicts the vision I had at first sight. It is a magnificent movie that reveals the explicit discrimination against a dexterous lawyer; Tom Hanks as Andrew Beckett and his determination on fighting for his rights.Beckett was a homosexual who has contracted AIDS as a result of his multiple partners and unprotected sex. As been a skillful lawyer, his boss "Charles Wheeler" handed Beckett a case of a very significant client of the firm. However, several days after, another lawyer in the firm noticed a lesion in Becket's forehead. The lesion was a skin cancer associated with the disease. Once the word reached out the entire company, all his co-workers including his boss believed that keeping Beckett there would spread out the disease to every one in the company. So Becket has been laid off as a result of ignorance and discrimination in his workplace.Frustrated with the circumstances, Beckett decided to sue the Law Firm, but the firm was a very powerful company and no lawyer in Philadelphia wanted to take the case. One day, Beckett saw Joe Miller (Denzel Washington), on a TV commercial promising to save people's drivers license. Therefore, Beckett went to Miller's office to convince him to take his case. At first, Miller didn't like homosexuals, but agreed to take it basically for the money and reputation he would get after he won it. Several moths past, Beckett won the case but he didn't survive to enjoy the benefits that he acquired. However, he had accomplished his desire of revenge.Philadelphia is an extraordinary touching and heartbreaking story of how a lawyer fired for having AIDS attempts to fight for his rights in court. Despite of his disease and sexual choice, Beckett fought against the discrimination toward himself as an AIDS carrier. After that movie, I believe many people have changed their way of thinking towards carriers of that disease.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What do you love about the law, Andrew?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Andrew Beckett is a gay lawyer infected with AIDS, who in spite of being his law firm's rising star, is fired on a trumped up charge of negligence. Refusing to accept defeat, Andrew manages to enlist the help of homophobic lawyer Joe Miller, whom it's hoped, can prove that the firm acted disgracefully out of fear of Andrew's illness. But can Joe throw off his own prejudice? Can Andrew keep it together as AIDS starts to take a hold?Philadelphia was the film to really bring the horrors of AIDS to the masses. Tho certainly not the first film to deal with the subject, films such as An Early Frost (1985) and As Is (1986) had led the way, Philadelphia is certainly the most memorable of all the mainstream films dealing with the subject.As the years have rolled by, the film's standing has waned some what, gays have renounced the film as over sentimental gloop and various other cinema critics have accused the film of confusing its aims. The truth is that Philadelphia is only really guilty of playing it safe. Andrew Beckett is clearly wronged, and he's clearly a lovely and special man, supported by a complete and loyal loving family. It's the character set up that never really puts the film in any real danger of becoming edgy, even the strand dealing with homophobia is only briefly given credence. However, where the makers do achieve their aims, is with the emotional aspects, something that lifts Philadelphia to a far higher plain in the pantheon of emotional kickers.The tone of the film is set courtesy of Bruce Springsteen's Oscar winning "Streets Of Philadelphia", which acts as a sombre portent of things to come during the opening credit sequence. From here on in the story is content with gnawing away at our heart strings and breaking down prejudice barriers in the name of fair play and adult fallibility's. Part court room drama and part human tragedy, Philadelphia is never found wanting in the engrossing department, something that is in no small amount due to the work of a firing on all cylinders cast.Tom Hanks is always pretty safe company to be in as a rule, but tackling the role of Andrew Beckett required much more than merely charm and a homely appeal. Hanks, winning his first Best Actor Oscar, steps up to the plate here and delivers one of the best performances of the 90s. As AIDS ravages his body and soul, Hanks as Andrew reaches deep down within and has the audience with him all the way thru his ordeal. Alongside Hanks is Denzel Washington as Joe, who if anything has the more prickly role to contend with. It's probably not much of a surprise to most followers of his to say he's on his usual great form here, with a shift in his character's fortitude showcasing the best of the New Yorker's ability. Rounding out the cast, and with equally fine performances are Jason Robards, Joanne Woodward, Robert Ridgely, Mary Steenburgen and Antonio Banderas. Then as surely as Springsteen's opener had set the mood, Neil Young closes the film down with his own heart achingly brilliant "Philadelphia", playing alongside some video footage that finally seals the deal as to why Philadelphia as a movie exists.Revists to the film show up its minor flaws, but as someone who remembers how he, and the other multi sexed audience reacted on leaving the cinema back in 1993, it's the kind of impact that to my mind can never be understated. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good but not a brilliant Jonathan Demme masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm extremely interested in continue visiting Jonathan Demme's work, at least right now I have already another of his films on DVD waiting to be watched: Neil Young: Heart of Gold, and also I want to re-watch The Silence of the Lambs and Stop Making Sense so hope soon I will be writing my humble opinion of those 3 films. Together with "Lambs" this one, Philadelphia, is the most famous Demme film and just like two weeks ago, to be exact on 20 June 2009 I saw Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington as lawyer Andre Beckett and lawyer Joe Miller for the very first time. It was just my third encounter with a Demme film and I have to say I wasn't disappointed at all but I wasn't extremely impressed, not even by the performances alone. For me Philadelphia is a very good film with very remarkable acting (when I said I wasn't extremely impressed by the performances I didn't mean that Hanks and Washington aren't great here, both are simply terrific) but I didn't found a brilliant masterpiece, not that I was expecting one since well, actually I was ready to not like this film and in that way I sure had a big pleasant surprise. The law is simply the law and who knows better that than Andrew, a really great lawyer who just got the assignment to a really important case, a case of one of the most important clients of the law firm for which Andrew works. Certainly Andy is, as his assignment to that case indicates, simply the best lawyer of that firm. "The entire street is clear, except for one small area under construction: this huge hole that is clearly marked and blocked off. You decided you must cross the street at this spot, no other, you fall into the hole, now you want to sue the city for negligence, right?" "Yes, do I have a case?" "Yeah, of course you've got a case". Lawyer Joe Miller is ready for that case, is ready to sue the city for negligence. Miller is the TV guy, famous lawyer who once "fought" a case against Andy, now Andy presents Denzel's character a case, Andy is there to sue those who broke the law and fired him because he has AIDS, is a case that makes sense, they can certainly win, Miller knows that and if Miller even accepted to represent a man who wants to sue the city for negligence when the city clearly did its job right why he becomes one of the bunch of lawyers who didn't wanted to represent Andy? Well you know why. One of my favourites shots is the one that follows Andy from Miller's perspective, where Andy leaves his cap, etc. Miller represents the ignorance, we see him going immediately to see his doctor after he had the meeting with Andy, certainly only to find out, after hearing the methods of infection, that there's nothing to be worried about. But Miller also and simply is an homophobic and pretty much is when he sees the by himself the discrimination against Andy when he goes for the case, sure is an obvious totally expected move, certainly is really satisfying that scene with Miller at a basketball game giving the summons to one of the superiors of the firm. The official statement of why Andy was fired if that he was an incompetent employee and it's ultimately the fact that Andy was assignment to that really important case what convince the jury to go in Andy's favor, certainly there are some other points during the case, the witnesses including the woman that Andy mentions during his third encounter with Miller, the woman who has AIDS and worked with the man of the firm that found out about Andy's disease. That woman, unlike Andy, contracted the decease not because of a sexual activity and she wasn't fired. In the end the personal life of Andy is just that, his life, it's sad and certainly was a blessing for Andy to count with the, always necessary, family support, the strong union of his family and the support of his partner (Banderas). This is a very good, many superb scenes, Bruce Springsteen and Neil Young (I prefer Neil's song), it's a worth watching film.</fullReview>

I had one in mind and got it, and being a bit of a Tom Hanks fan, I happened across this one, and debated on whether or not to get it. Finally, I grabbed it before I changed my mind, and I am so glad I did! I wasn't quite sure what to expect at first, so I sat down to watch this only knowing who was in it and that it was about two lawyers and deals with AIDS. However, by the first fifteen minutes or so of the film, I knew it was going to be a good one. The story is such a powerful one that it shook me, and still has me a bit shaken. The acting in here was brilliant on all sides, and the story is something we can all learn from - everyone is equal. I knew that Tom Hanks had won an Oscar for his role, and after watching this I can totally understand why - one of his best performances I have ever seen.To summarize - brilliant.

		<shortDescription>One of the First Mainstream Attempts to Discuss AIDS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People really look down on "Philadelphia" now for being a heavy-handed liberal Hollywood attempt to deal with a "gay" issue. But I think it deserves a break. It is heavy handed to be sure, but this is one of the first big mainstream movies with popular mainstream actors I can think of to deal with a topic most of mainstream America wasn't remotely interested in hearing about. It was a pretty big risk for Tom Hanks to "play gay," as that's something that's been known to ruin the careers of others. And say what you will about the movie, it's hard to find fault with Hanks' performance. Though much of the material he was given to work with is sentimental, he navigates it ably and manages to give an affecting performance regardless.Grade: B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Acting at its best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You can not stress enough the importance of acting to making a movie successful. In this film you get two amazing performances from both Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington. Indeed this movie displays acting at its best.Hanks portrays the hero of the film, Andrew Beckett, who is fired from his lawyer job due to the fact that he has aids. This is one of his best jobs as an actor ever. Many will say this is his best, I prefer his job in Cast Away and Forrest Gump, and they are not far off. He does a great job of playing a guy who has aids and still wants want is rightfully his.Denzel Washington for me was the star of the film. The fact that his character is homophobic and yet helps a gay man get justice in the end shows great acting. He does a great job portraying a homophob and a great lawyer at the same time.This review is short, but overall I think this is one of the best moview ever, definitely one of the best court films. I recommend it to everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Philadelphia (1993) Philadelphia is a very good film; a film that dared to show the problems modern societies suffered and still suffer with the rejections of homosexuals and AIDS sufferers. The film came at a good time; the 90s were a changing transitional period, where AIDS was on the rise, particularly to homosexual sufferers.However, this film is about so much more. Is about relationships, human bonds and emotions, brought brilliantly through the spectrum of Academy Award Winning director Jonathan Demme and the acting abilities of an outstanding cast, with Tom Hanks (who is mesmerising in his first Oscar Winning performance) and Denzel Washington providing a powerhouse, dynamic performance as the slightly unconventional lawyer who finally defends the character of Tom Hanks."One of the top 5 films of 1993. 4 stars" "A powerful film" 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you face the story in first steps of the movie, probably you feel it like an ordinary movie about gay rights or something alike! but it's certainly a masterwork, full of wise ideas about HUMANITY! Tom Hanks is brilliant as he is in other works.Andrew Beckett is a real Hanks in this movie! Hanks knows what to do to convert this character to a memorable character.you know, specially for us, i mean Muslims, it's necessary to look through such stories, over &amp; over, to find what it's all about when they, in west, speak about human rights! Denzel Washington is really near 2 what we, Muslims, are! and i hope, i hope deep in my heart, that we have the same experience like what Joe miller had!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just got philidephia on DVD and sat in and watched it today. I had already seen some of it already but because of the homophobes i was surrounded by i didn't see the end.So the film is basically about Andy Beckett (Tom Hanks) who has just contracted aids and has been fired from his job. He gets help from Denzel Washington to bring his case to court.Tom Hanks delivers the best performance ever and denzel washington plays his part well.At the end of the movie you definitely will cry. Even if you haven't cried at a movie before you might get very close to tears.Very good stuff from the whole cast.</fullReview>

While the former two set the particular tone of their respective opening and closing scenes, the Shore piece, reminiscent of some Mahler and Debussey music, painted many different pictures in the 4 minutes of play. Just really beautiful music from the former SNL nurse. The performances by Hanks and Washington were superb, great story line and direction. Even Ed Rendell looked decent in this film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Well Deserved "Best Actor Award"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Hanks has spelled his magic again but this time he wasn't alone. Denzel Washington, a well acclaimed actor, supported him in a miraculous way. They both made Philadelphia! Touching the issue which wasn't much known or probably being avoided in 90's through Phialdelphia in this way is just splendid job. A well deserved "Best Actor Award" for Hanks as he left you in the end speechless. Watch this for Tom and Denzel as they unite in one movie but made is a memorable one. A highly recommended movie and it has to be on your hit list, only if you hadn't watched it. Now movie is in the league of other Hanks movies like Road to Perdition, Cast Away, Saving Private Ryan, Forrest Gump, The Green Mile, etc and it could also be considered as one of the best performances given by Denzel. Denzel put an impact on the audience by putting life into his character. THumbs up for both of em and thumbs up for Phialdelphia. As we get a chance to see the greatest actor of our generation "a living legend" Sir. Thomas Hanks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Andrew Beckett, a young lawyer working with a powerful Philadelphia law firm, is on what seems to be a sure path to it's highest echelons. However, when he contracts AIDS and is fired he suspects that he is the victim of prejudice. He confides in Joe Miller, another lawyer, who has his own prejudices, but is determined to help Beckett anyway.AIDS had already been part of the American landscape, not to mention the rest of the world, for quite sometime before a major film studio decided to release a film addressing the situation. Surprisingly it is quite poignant and lacking much of the cheese and careful presentation of new and potentially risky things that has made Hollywood famous. There are few stereotypes and even the "corporate slime" characters get a fair shake at being shown as merely human beings. They may not be the most likable, but still it shows them as people and, as we all know, people are far from perfect.However, the film's most interesting element would have to be Joe Miller. Hanks does give a great performance as a gay man in a difficult situation, but it is with Miller that most people will be able to directly relate. He is the guy initially unsympathetic to and even disgusted with homosexuals. There are several scenes which Miller has many internal and external revelations that are particularly strong. These and Hanks's Oscar winning turn make this more than just a movie about prejudice against homosexuals, but one with insights and observations about prejudice in general. 8/10Rated PG-13 for profanity and mature themes</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just watched this again and forgotten how fantastic this film is...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film when it first came out when I was 13 and all I could remember about it was that it was about Aids and i cried a lot. So when I saw this in the shops for ?5 I thought I would buy it as I have been meaning to watch it again for years.Sometimes when you watch a film from the early 90's you realise how dated films can get - not this film. The plight of Andrew Beckett is as true today as it was 13 years ago. Like some other users have commented, its rare to agree with Oscar but on this occasion the award could not have gone to any other than Tom Hanks. The physical change he made to play the character was visually amazing, but the emotion he put in to this part was so moving and utterly fantastic that he should have won every award possible. I cried buckets all the way through the film as I was so moved by his performance.I think one of the most poignant parts of the film is when Andrew is on the stand in court and Mary Steenburgen's character questions his lesions saying the one he claims to have on his face is barely visible so how can anyone believe that he had visible ones on his face so people knew he had AIDS? Then Denzel Wahington asks if he has any on his body LIKE the ones on his face and he says he has, on his torso. Then he opens his shirt and you the huge red lesions on his chest and everyone in court gasps. It shows the audience how much AIDS ravages the body, and how it would have been blatantly obvious to someone who had had experience with AIDS before as the law company had, that Andrew had AIDS. Its also a very moving, upsetting scene as Tom Hanks plays this character so well you genuinely care about him.Not to be overlooked in this film are Antonio Banderas and Denzel Washington. Denzel Washington shows the irony of a black person being a bigot perfectly (this was an ingenious piece of casting showing that even people who face bigots every day can be ignorant towards AIDS) and his transformation of character in the film as he gets to know Andy and his family is again, moving. I think the scene where he sees Andy dancing to the opera and narrating what is happening is a turning point for him when he realises Andy is just a normal person with the same feelings and emotions as everyone else. Antonio Banderas is also very convincing as Tom's lover - you believe them as a couple which can be rare when Hollywood take on homosexuality - they tend to camp it up a little bit which is certainly not the case with this movie.All in all, I defy anyone to not be moved by this movie. Not only is it a great movie but it also carries a very important message about the danger and ignorance surrounding AIDS. I would recommend this to anyone and it is certainly in my Top 10 films of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie has AIDS, but it will never die</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm gonna explain you my review like if you were six-year-old.OK, this is just a joke. It's just that in every movie, there's a quote that is more outstanding than others. In "Philadelphia", it appears that Joe Miller's favorite expression (although he alters ages sometimes) is the trademark."Philadelphia" stars two of the most impressive actors of today's cinema: Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington. The movie is directed by Jonathan Demme, who previously gave us the multi-Oscar winning "Silence of the Lambs". Demme proves once again that he is one of the most skillful filmmakers of this generation and his profound humanity and powerful emotional moments give to "Philadelphia" a huge greatness.Even if it was made in 1993, "Philadelphia" still looks very revealing in 2006. Homosexuality still is a very present form of discriminatory in today's society, especially in North America. The movie is a powerfully realistic, if not shocking mirror of modern America, especially towards the homosexual question.The movie is about Andrew Beckett, a brilliant and opera-loving Philadelphia lawyer played by Tom Hanks, who is brutally fired from his law firm. His superiors invoke professional reasons, mainly the near-loss of an important file, but Beckett is certain that he was fired because of his homosexuality and because he contracted AIDS. Beckett wants to sue the firm and he wants Joe Miller (played by Denzel Washington) to represent him.At first, Miller refuses, because he is a homophobic. And 'phobic' is not an exaggerated term, because we quickly see a paranoid Miller who believes he could have been contracted AIDS simply because he shook Andrew's hand and he also tells her newborn daughter to never come across homosexuals.However, Miller puts his own prejudices behind and accepts to take on Beckett's case, also because he feels that the law has been violated. The movie then becomes a legal drama, where much of the action takes place inside the tribunal.The choice of Philadelphia as the city where the action takes place is not a coincidence. As explained by Miller, Philadelphia is "the city of brotherly love, the birthplace of freedom" and where the Declaration of Independence was signed, this document that says that "all men are created equal".To make "Philadelphia" such a great movie, director Demme used the most powerful weapon of all: emotion. Emotional moments are present during the whole two hours of the film and each actor, even the smallest one, delivers a solid performance.Hanks and Washington stand above the others and the chemistry between both of them is undeniable. Hanks' Oscar-winning interpretation of Andrew Beckett is almost unbelievable, due to his emotional personality, his physical transformation and the conviction he puts into his role. Washington is almost as remarkable. His sense of humor and irony has been largely noticed, but his transformation from a homophobic TV-advertising lawyer to an almost Martin Luther King-like figure of gay &amp; lesbian rights is the strongest point of his performance.There also are some special scenes which must be highlighted. Beginning with the living room scene in Andrew's parents house. We can feel the interaction in the discussion between the family members. It's very heart-warming and executed with solid professionalism. The hospital scenes where a dying Andrew lies in a bed, barely conscious, and wearing a respiratory mask. And the final scenes in Andrew's apartment where the funeral party takes place and where multiple candles are meticulously placed.There are very special camera shots in this movie. The opening credits are shown over multiple ordinary events happening in Philadelphia. Notable shots include Miguel's filming inside the parents house with a camcorder, which makes it closer to the audience and more personal. There are also Andrew's blurred visions when his disease strikes him in the tribunal.Musical highlights include Bruce Springsteen's opening song "Streets of Philadelphia" and poignant scenes in Andrew's apartment where he is absorbed by the sounds of his favorite opera, Andrea Chenier from Giordano."Philadelphia" is a powerful opera, with very high notes and its lot of strong emotional moments. It is one of cinema's hidden masterpieces and its heavyweight message makes it an excellent ambassador of today's society and its views on the people who are 'different'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>..if you had done a little research on AIDS..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>....you may have had a different opinion of this movie, and you CERTAINLY would have written a different commentary.I was shocked to learn of AIDS, even though it was discovered right here in Los Angeles by Dr. Michael Gottlieb, via "Patient O". Believe me, the "world-class" LOS ANGELES TIMES could have played a much bigger role of notifying the world on this pandemic. There were so many "causes" to identify: when it was finally decided it was a virus, I was further shocked to discover how public officials were so unconcerned, that it would only infect gays. THAT made me think that the common cold is also a virus: does it infect only a certain segment of society? Get real !! Because I made my living for so many decades as an entertainer talking face-to-face with people, I talk a lot. I did just that, for about 15 years. I couldn't fathom that scientists could be so dumb, so I started from scratch - not knowing which way to turn - to expose those who were making "take-it-for-granted" statements.Some way or other, I got my foot in the door - you'd be surprised how many scientists and high-office politicians helped. I learned a lot, right quick. I went to public symposiums held by the doctor who discovered how a certain group of gay men were all infected by a single individual. I particularly remember a symposium I attended - in the then newly-created city of West Hollywood - for nurses and health-care providers. The main topic it was discussing was "what do gay people do, sexually"? In the city of "Boys Town" and heavy hustling on most of its streets? You can be certain I shocked them all by stating "the same things you and your sexual partners do, sexually, but aren't talking about it here". I eventually gave-up - I was writing to scientists all over the world; I had contacts in CDC, WHO, Institut Pasteur (where the virus was originally discovered); Congress; state legislatures - I just had too much data to comprehend.....and knew that by the time I was ready to do the exposure, it would be years down the road, and too late. FINALLY, THE LOST ANGELES TIMES has printed an article about Dr. Tony Fauci at NIH that advises EVERYONE under 64 be tested - 250,000 Americans do not know they are infected. I know people who have been infected for 25 years......still healthy....I agree that "Philadelphia" came too late in the pandemic, also, but knew millions of people STILL are ignorant about it - denial ! I've read every comment. I am going to watch the film again tonight, although it is vivid in my mind. Tom Hanks deserved the Oscar simply by having the courage - or being paid so much money - to do the role; not too much acting going-on, but effective. Can you believe that Banderas, today, isn't even listed in the cast of IMDb.com? I thought he was excellent in the film, as was Joanne Woodward playing the stalwart mother - the whole family was played so well. Those family-members who disown a member simply because he's gay need to see a shrink. How could "Scubergmu" definitely know that gays don't have supporting families ? On comments on Washington, many of them got his character right as being homophobic. However, they missed the point of the library scene - after hiding behind books and seeing Beckett being harassed by a librarian - "did you find a lawyer?" - "I'm a lawyer". He became hooked to take the case by the brilliant understanding Beckett had of the legal data. He didn't suddenly become friendly - he may have even determined this would be a big case and he wouldn't have to spend so much money on TV-ads. His character developed from that point, with the compassionate help of his wife. Washington was superb.Demme's direction was right-on. Is anyone so naive to not know that Hollywood is well-versed in homosexuality ?....after all their cover-ups ? No matter how late in the pandemic this film appeared, it's still a powerful story. That this group of people finally found the gumption to release it deserves whatever awards it earned. Someone wrote "the party" scene had no drag-queens: did you miss "Mona Lisa" ?I could write forever about this film, but feel everyone should get it and study it. One viewing can't give you an enlightened viewpoint. I give it 15-out-10 - so frightening this scourge is spreading, rather-than being defeated. Watch this movie with an open heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He Has Overcome.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We all know the plot of this film. However it is this scene when the leading role, Andrew, explained the opera aria from Andrea Chenir that makes me rediscover the richness of this film.In the anguish, Maria Callas sang "Look, the place that cradled me is burning." However, the music switched from sorrowful to extremely hopeful "It was during this sorrow that love came to me." and "Live still, I am life. Heaven is in your eyes. Is everything around you just the blood and mud? I am divine. I am oblivion. I am the god... that comes down from the heavens, and makes of the Earth a heaven. I am love!... I am love." Andrew's lawyer, Joe, had originally hurried Andrew to practice Q &amp; A, but in the end, he was stunned by Andrew's expression about the opera aria. He then understood that Andrew had reached the state of mind that he had no regret whatever would happen because he had brought the earth love, like the opera aria had depicted. Influenced by this state of mind, Joe went home hugging his daughter and wife, and all the worries in real life were put aside at that moment.Andrew has overcome his unfortunate experience, and even death.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start this off by making one thing absolutely clear; I love law movies/court scene films, whatever you want to call them. This film reminded me that something that's even more important than entertaining court scenes in such a film, is an involving subject, to make you really feel that this case is important, crucial; this film shows, once and for all, that a good story, an important subject, makes a good film if executed properly. This film has everything a good film needs; an interesting and emotionally involving plot, a great cast and good cinematography. The plot is great, and it really makes you care about these characters, as they are likable and humane. The acting is all top-notch, especially by Tom Hanks, who gives a stellar performance as the homosexual AIDS-infected lawyer who is fired shortly after being promoted. Denzel Washington also gives a very good performance, portraying a homophobic lawyer. For the reasonably few scenes Antonio Banderas had, he also gave an excellent performance, as Tom's characters boyfriend. The characters are well-written, credible and most important of all, well-played. They are also very well-developed. The film has a very powerful message, and it delivers it well. It takes a very important subject, and shows us both sides of the argument, something reasonably few films do, and even fewer does it as good as this film. It treats the controversial subject with complete respect for both sides, both views. It's one of the most moving films I've ever seen. I recommend it to anyone interested in the subject, and pretty much all fans of serious dramas. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Over the past 15 years,we've seen the impact of AIDS and how it affects those infected with the disease.It's misconceptions lie within it's myths when it comes to society and ignorance in the way we view homosexuality and AIDS.In "Philadelphia",the issue of AIDS is centered upon discrimination in the workplace. Andrew Beckett,the story's central character is wonderfully played by Tom Hanks as an AIDS stricken lawyer for a mainline Philadelphia law firm,who's railroaded by the prejudicial senior partners of the firm led by Charles Wheeler (Jason Robards).The firm contends that Beckett was terminated for incompetence.However,Beckett claims he's the victim of discrimination,and solicits the services of an "ambulance-chasing" lawyer by the name of Joe Miller (Denzel Washington) to represent him in suing his former bosses.At first,the homophobic Miller declines to take the case based on his personal beliefs concerning homosexuality.It wasn't until he personally witnessed the kind of discrimination that Beckett was experiencing (the law library scene) is when he decided to help Beckett seek justice.At first,it seemed like Miller took on the case for fame and riches,however,there were moments in the film where Miller slowly realized that Beckett was not just a homosexual with AIDS ,but as an individual who's will to survive was uncomparable to anything he has ever seen and reminded him how precious life really is.Skillfully directed by veteran Jonathan Demme (The Silence Of The Lambs),"Philadelphia" is a groundbreaking achievement in Hollywood's first look at AIDS discrimination.The film was essentially dark and somber with a sense of hopelessness for the Hanks character but rose to the occasion in a courtroom where Washington shined in litigation and gave hope to the many others who face this dilemma at some point or another in their lives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful, thought provoking movie! Acting superb!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This week I watched "Philadelphia" again (now for the second time), and I was once again touched by the wonderful acting on the part of Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington. Whether you are or are not a homosexual, we, as human beings, cannot help but be drawn to this wonderful movie. I was shocked to see Tom Hanks as he gradually changes as the disease devastates him, both emotionally and physically, from the beginning of the film to the end. He certainly deserved his Oscar for this role.The most beautiful and heartwrenching scene for me was when Tom Hanks is listening to Maria Callas (spelling, I'm sorry), and Denzel Washington tries to battle with his emotions to help Andy. Tom Hanks' scenes here alone, for me, won him the Oscar. I cried during this passage of the film. It was so heartwrenching the way he interpreted the music for Denzel. Then, watching Denzel's character flee to the safety of his home and his family -- watching him pick up his daughter -- kissing her -- and lying next to his wife --- and the music still in his conscience reminding him of Andy and the torment that he is going through. I think it is at this point that Denzel's character makes a turning point and realizes how precious life is -- whether you are homosexual or heterosexual! For me, these scenes were so beautifully done. The music was so thrilling!!This movie dealt with very serious issues concerning the effect of AIDS on the patient and everyone in that patient's life.Wonderful film! The acting was superb!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In today's world it's hard to find a crowd completely sympathetic to a gay man's plight. Regardless if you agree with homosexuality, regardless if you are straight or otherwise, "Philadelphia" is a magnificent story that exposes our biases and fears in scathing detail. Tom Hanks, a crucial factor in the movie's success--noted by that well deserved statuette--is steadfast and amazing as Andy Beckett, a popular lawyer fired because he is gay--or as the legal bigwigs claim--because he's got AIDS. The hypocrisy and lying that goes on with his firm is probably not limited to just attorneys; unfortunately our society harbors mixed views on homosexuality.It is ironic that the film takes place in the City of Brotherly Love, where Beckett is left unemployed, shunned, and very sick because he is unlike his peers. I hope that continued viewing of this dramatic, powerful film can heighten awareness about AIDS and homosexuality, and perhaps make us a more tolerant people.</fullReview>

It is a miracle to see such a film produced by the (nominally) heterosexual film industry.The movie should not leave a "dry eye" in the theatre. Tom Hanks--as the successful lawyer and the ailing gay man--turns in a performance which is right on the button, as is indeed that of each and every actor, sympathetic or not.The movie depicts a tragedy, but is also not without its consolations--particularly the coming to terms of Denzel Washington through the course of his defense of client Hanks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It had to be made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Philadelphia' is a film that needed and had to be made. Such a large budget production with major stars in the lead roles as gay men led to a great deal of compromising. I suppose this was a 'necessary evil.'The film and arts community is quite familiar with homosexuality and with the beginning of the AIDS epidemic. This film is, therefore, more about homosexuality than it is about AIDS. We have had many many films devoted to people with AIDS but when dealing with both subjects (homosexuality and AIDS) a different light is cast on both.Whether it is because people think of homosexuals being responsible for AIDS or they just feel uncomfortable with homosexuality is debatable.This movie could have been about a homosexual being fired from a job and it would not have had the same resonance. There is a bit of 'pity the homosexual with AIDS' atmosphere to the film.The two subjects are related (in some people's minds). But now that AIDS is affecting the general population, the relation can and maybe should be severed.This movie never really tells us if Tom Hanks employer is prejudiced against homosexuals, people with AIDS or both.So, one may watch the movie and separate viewpoints. Is it about a homosexual having problems, an AIDS patient having problems or both?This is the very frustrating part of this film. That the performers in this film felt a 'duty' to make it is a bit too obvious. That the backers of the film are a bit squeamish is also very obvious. There are no real 'love scenes ' or anything to offend sensitive Tom Hanks or Antonio Banderas fans watching the film. I'm sure that the backers were afraid of driving away their audience with too much realism on the subject.Aside from these obvious faults, the film's production values and acting are faultless. The casting of Mary Steenburgen as the attorney for the opposition was inspired. At one point, she says 'I hate this case.' One wonders why she took it then. But her courtroom demeanor as a gentle yet insidious advocate for the bigots should have won her an oscar. Tom Hanks description of opera to Denzel Washington was a true pice of virtuoso acting. And the writers were (or were not) smart enough not to have given Joanne Woodward more scenes. Every time she appears on screen, it's as if a spotlight is on her alone. This is not done intentionally by Woodward or the director. She is a natural phenomenon and one of America's most underrated actresses. The film is worth seeing for her two (relatively small) scenes alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. It is a triumph for Tom Hanks and the Oscar he received was highly just. It deals with highly controversial subject matter and, without ever becoming "cheesy", melodramatic or sentimental, displays them beautifully. Jonathan Demme has created a movie to be proud of. 10/10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film really impressed me, and was a tale filled with pathos. Tom Hanks portrays Andy superbly, making him instantly likeable and humane, and deserved his acclaim for the role. His partner isn't very believable however, and their relationship isn't really explored. Denzel Washington, meanwhile, is quite convincing and realistic in his attitudes, and is vital to the film's success. Overall a deeply emotional film, rightly condemning anti-gay prejudices, with a truly melancholic ending. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw Philadelphia in 1993, I remember that I liked it quite a bit. On seeing it again on Network TV last night, I was a bit less impressed. Although it has some impressive moments, along with very fine acting by Tom Hanks, it really struck me as being pretty sappy, especially the courtroom scenes. It really struck me as a well intentioned effort by Holloywood to show the mall crowd that gays are "just folks". The family scenes are painfully ungrounded in reality, and I was really annoyed at how Hanks' relationship with Banderas was sanitized so as not to offend. Still, the movie has a lot of merit, too, and the finale is definitely a real tear jerker. One would hope that this movie's greatest contribution was to help remove stereotypes about gays, but I wonder if anyone remembers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Film About A Heartbreaking Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The courtroom drama Philadelphia is directed by Jonathan Demme and stars Tom Hanks, Denzel Washington, and Antonio Banderas. The film takes place in modern day Philadelphia.The film starts off with Andrew Beckett (Hanks) and Joe Miller (Washington) working together in some sort of law meeting, they do not know each other before this and are for some reason in a meeting together. Beckett works for a big law firm and is promoted to become a senior partner, but at the meeting where he is congratulated one of the partners of the law firm notices a mark on his forehead. The film then cuts to I believe a month later where it is revealed that Beckett has been fired and is requesting Miller, a fellow lawyer, to help him sue the law firm that he worked at because he believed that he was fired due to the fact that he was a homosexual and had AIDS. Miller says that Beckett does not have a case due to the fact that he does not have enough information to make that conclusion. After some time it shows how Miller has a daughter and then the two men are at the public library. Miller at first hides from Beckett but then sympathizes for him because a librarian is asking him to go to the private section due to his illness. That is when Miller offers his services to Beckett and the highly emotional film starts to get the wheels turning.The screenplay for this film was highly moving. The characters had much depth to them and I understood how each the leads were feeling. I could feel how Beckett was not only suffering from his terrible illness, but from the people around him who thought he was disgusting and unnatural. Yet I also understood the reasons to why Miller disliked homosexuals and his reasoning for that dislike, but I respected him greatly for putting his personal beliefs to the side and doing what the law says to be correct. The film has some great comedic moments along with its memorable emotional moments. The only problem was that it was somewhat predictable, but that really did not make the journey the film brought me on less enjoyable.The direction by Jonathan Demme was very good for this film. The shots in general were really nothing special, but they got the job done, he succeeded greatly in bringing so much emotion into this film. He has proved that he can get amazing performances out of his actors and has gotten three of the actors he had worked with Oscars. It was not as well directed as The Silence of the Lambs, but still with these two back to back great films one would think he would have a much more successful career.The acting in this film was phenomenal. Tom Hanks deserved the Oscar he received for his performance as Andrew Beckett and this performance is one of the many reasons why he is considered one of the greatest actors. He was just a purely lovable character and I felt so deeply for him. Bravo, Mr. Hanks, too bad you haven't acted this well since Cast Away. Denzel Washington was absolutely fantastic as Joe Miller. He is the most relatable character and was great in every aspect. His performance not getting nominated for an Oscar is another of the greatest snubs in history, yet I do not feel as bad for him since he did end up earning two Oscars so far in his career. Antonio Banderas has a minor role of playing Andrew Beckett's partner and plays it to the best the role can be played. Wonderful performances all around.The score for this film was as well brilliant. It added all the emotion whether it be light hearted or heart breaking. The song by Bruce Springsteen won an Oscar as it should have and the whole into score is exactly how such an emotional picture should be done.Overall I give this film a strong 8/10 because it is very good in every aspect. I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys courtroom dramas or films that are about social problems that are faced in the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Philadelphia Lawyer Fights For His Life And A Life With Dignity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have you ever wondered where the term Philadelphia lawyer comes from? It dates back to our colonial times when in 1735 New York newspaper editor John Peter Zenger was arrested for libel when he printed some really unflattering things about the colonial governor. As counsel he retained Andrew Hamilton who came from Philadelphia and with the court really stacked against him, Hamilton pulled out a victory. The term then entered our lexicon to mean a really sharp attorney that's totally up on his game.Young promising attorney in a white shoe law firm Tom Hanks is terminated abruptly and rather clumsily when its discovered he has AIDS. Hanks had been a shining star in that firm, but he'd been in the closet because as he later testified he saw a rather homophobic atmosphere among the old partners in the firm. When one of the partners spotted the telltale lesion that signifies Karposi's Sarcoma, Hanks was set up to take the fall.Hanks is deteriorating rapidly and is a believer that a lawyer representing himself has a fool for a client. The man he eventually chooses is Denzel Washington, one of those guys you see advertising on television. Washington knew Hanks from previous cases, but is as shocked as everyone else to find out about Hanks's sexual orientation. Washington has a few issues of his own with gay people as well, but he gradually comes around as a believer in his cause and a believer in Hanks's worth and dignity as a human being.Tom Hanks won the first of two consecutive Best Actor Oscars with Philadelphia which was only done once before by Spencer Tracy. With the use of some creative makeup which also was nominated, Hanks turns in a perfect performance of a man deteriorating because of the various illnesses besetting his immune system. It's real, I've certainly seen it enough with people I've known. That's one of the horrible things about AIDS. I know people who were diagnosed with it back in the middle Eighties and are still with us. I've also known those who have deteriorated literally within weeks of getting the diagnosis. Seeing Hanks on the screen mirrored so many people who have passed in and out of my life.Denzel Washington proves one thing about acting said by people like Spencer Tracy that half the job is listening and communicating the fact that you are taking in those words the other player is speaking. When the opera loving Hanks talks about an aria that Maria Callas is singing watch Washington's expressions. Without a word of dialog he's telling the audience what a seminal experience he is having listening to Hanks and how his view of him has come around.Jason Robards and Robert Ridgely play two of the smug senior partners who are really grilled on their homophobia by Washington. Another standout performance is that of Mary Steenburgen who the white show firm retains as counsel. She's a deadly cross examiner and a real match for Washington in court. And Antonio Banderas is touching as Hanks's loving partner who Washington promises to Hanks he'll get the best probate lawyer possible for him when the time comes.Of course the film got the official imprimatur of having none other than the Mayor of Philadelphia, Edward Rendell, make an appearance. Rendell went on to be Governor of Pennsylvania and Democratic National Chairman. I recognized quite a few of the locations in center city Philadelphia from some of my trips there. Philadelphia got one other Oscar for none other than Bruce Springsteen for his original song The Streets of Philadelphia. It was nominated for Best Makeup, Best Adapted Screenplay and for another song entitled Philadelphia by Neil Young.Tom Hanks became the face of AIDS for America and for the world with this film and the Oscar he won for it. And this review is dedicated to a young man named Robert Lynn who was a bartender I knew way back when in Brooklyn Heights who was the first person I know to die from this terrible plague. Back then it was the 'gay' disease and government was frozen in indifference toward those who had it.It's no longer a 'gay' disease, lots of education went into making that fact rather obvious. Lots of people like Robert Lynn and so many more I've known went into the ground before their time before the medicines to control the disease and how it attacks the immune system had to unnecessarily happen. Let's have a film showing the final cure for this terrible thing and in the near future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So Very, Very Right On</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was made when AIDS was still regarded in the light of the 'gay plague' that statistics suggested it to be. The statistics were entirely plausible, but things have moved on.Tom Hanks plays, very convincingly, a young, homosexual, hot-shot lawyer who steadfastly does not want to 'come out' because of the inevitable prejudice, but is forced to do so because of his being infected with HIV and the symptoms becoming evident. Somebody at the office tips the wink and a scam of incompetence is set-up as justification to sack him. He thinks that's unfair.He goes in search of a lawyer to help him, but finds closed doors until a small-time ambulance-chaser - played by ever-reliable Denzel Washington - takes pity and offers to represent his efforts. Cue a court-room drama.Although the movie is well directed, edited and equally well-paced, with largely creditable acting performances from lots of old, familiar regulars; it has an extremely banal script, whilst the plot itself is a predictable done-deal. Formulaic hardly describes it.It looks as though somebody has gone to the props department, taken the sack marked 'cliches' and poured the contents out all over the screen. You know just how it's going to end from the sight of Hanks' very first lesion. The court case is inevitable, and he must win. Though it'll be a pyrrhic victory because he's going to die. The initially prejudiced lawyer will overcome his bigotry and learn to love homosexuals. Instead of just fighting the case for money - he'll begin fighting for JUSTICE! Yeah, man; right on. Everyone in the courtroom (and presumably the audience) will have a 'Damascus' moment.We are shown how sensitive this homosexual man is, by his almost tearful appreciation of a tragic operatic aria, which Washington - being a heterosexual - doesn't understand. His testosterone has apparently deprived him of an interest in opera. We are shown how Denzel Washington's seemingly rational fear of catching a terrible, infectious, and fatal disease is, in truth, just an irrational distaste for the act of buggery. And so on. I have watched this movie 2 or 3 times now, because I like the intellectual conflicts of courtroom drama, but it has become evident how the entire script and conduct of the case has been predicated to emphasise its right-on message, reinforcing the apparent narrow-mindedness of heterosexuals. To this extent it is almost a subtle piece of propaganda. Every effort is made to highlight the hypocrisy of Hanks' former colleagues and in doing so that of (straight) society as a whole. Very little is made of the fact that this 'victim' caught the disease as a result of his own reckless behaviour, participating in lewd conduct with complete strangers, whilst living (and engaging in sexual activity with) a male partner. The partner did not himself become infected. But that was no credit to Hanks' character. He might also have been facing a hideous death as a result of this man's cavalier irresponsibility, his contemptuous and cynical disregard for another's safety. So; it would seem that he can betray his best friend to the extent of perhaps forfeiting the friend's life, but his employers can't betray him to the extent of forfeiting his job. No hypocrisy there then. On another occasion, Denzel Washington, as lawyer, makes a comparison with a paraplegic (the law, it would seem, having inexplicably defined AIDS as a disability). But no counter-comparison is made of the fact that paraplegia is at least neither fatal nor contagious. Hanks's character has also breached the terms of his employment contract by failing to advise the company of a change in his medical condition, but it seems we can draw a veil over that as well. I could go on. At the very least, Hanks' character should be facing charges of reckless endangerment with respect to his partner. Whilst his employers should be free to countersue for breach of trust. But the subject matter of this movie is such that anything less than its wholehearted endorsement is likely to be lambasted as an expression of so-called 'homophobia'. It nevertheless has more the appearance of an advocacy rather than entertainment. I, for one, don't much care for being told what to think.Worth a watch, but far better movies of the genre are to be found. My favourite (at the moment) is 'The Rainmaker'. The case is more convincing and the lawyer jokes are better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Movie That Will Forever Change Your Perspective!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Hanks is among the best actors in the history of cinema and his name always arises in a discussion among seasoned movie watchers when they discuss about the best actors ever. And when one is talking about Tom Hanks, the first two or three movies that one talks about will contain "Philadelphia" as one of them. This is truly one of the most influential movies I have ever seen in my years spent watching movies. The story is about a lawyer named Andrew Beckett (Tom Hanks) who is a gay and has contracted the HIV infection. He is eventually fired from the firm where he works because of this and the movie showcases his battle for justice.When the law firm comes to know about the truth that their top lawyer Andrew is a gay, often visits the gay clubs and in this process has acquired the HIV, they decide to find an alibi in order to "clean" their firm off Andrew. Andrew knows the bitter truth and wants to fight for his rights. And he finds a lawyer Joe Miller(Denzel Washington). One can say that essentially see the movie from the perspective of Joe Miller. He is homophobic and just like most of us, he thinks of them as inhuman people.He is motivated by the magnitude of the case to take it up. He finds himself studying Tom Hanks and his surroundings and then begins to understand that all his inhibitions about gays are so very false. He finds Andrew to be a human being just like any other with the same level of commitment, passion and sincerity. He is exposed to the world of gays and gradually begins to understand them. And as he does, so do we. The movie's biggest strength is change our perspective about gays. The movie transforms our perspective of them from that of seeing them as senseless and stupid to seeing them as human beings just different in certain aspects. We are also taught by this movie as to how this difference between them and us is ignorable.In the middle of the movie, we are show Andrew's lover played by Antonio Banderas. I found this part of the movie to be most beautiful. The bond of affection and love between Antonio and Tom is so wonderfully portrayed with perfect control. There are no hard scenes which could have destroyed the movie. Instead, there is the most difficult to showcase aspect called body language. It is all body language! The relationship between Andrew and his lover is understood from their body language and it teaches us that it is hardly different from the kind of love and affection we all share for each other. We are also shown their families and get a peep into their feelings and attitudes.There are some really powerful scenes in the movie. The scene where Andrew indulges in the opera, the scene where Andrew loses his consciousness in the courtroom. And the last scene really leaves you with tears filled in your eyes. This movie dares to move on tough grounds. And it does a wonderful job. This is a must watch for all people. A very powerful movie indeed!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A really special movie which I'm not tired of watching it again and again, because on the one hand it is perfectly executed, on the other hand touched me deeply. Demme wants to make clear that everyone of us is affected. For that reason he goes through the streets of Philadelphia and shows people from every social layer, in every spot, in every situation, to show that we all are equal when it comes to AIDS. And then, later, in the movie, the characters look into the camera every once in a while. Everybody shall be talked to, it shall be impossible to turn around and look away. Like Kubrick Demme uses the vanishing point perspective and pulls the spectator into the action of the story. And then there is that great song by Bruce Springsteen, "Streets of Philadelphia", the boss wrote a lot of great songs but this one will outlast. It is not able to criticize Tom Hanks' performance, which is simply stunning as is the rest of the cast. At very few moments Demme exaggerates a bit or is a bit too idealistic. But in the end this doesn't affect the quality and substance of the movie.</fullReview>

I had gotten into the movie and started crying about 30 seconds into the scene. It was watching someone in such a vulnerable, pure moment. He has nothing to lose and is just enjoying the opera with every ounce of his human being. Also, I love when the articulate Andrew answers miller's question "are u a good lawyer?" damn, whoever wrote this movie is good. I loved Andrew's answer about how he loves the law. it is awesome when he says how, every once in a while, he played a role in justice being done. The reality of the situation soaks into the entire court room. It is obvious (to almost everyone's deep conscience) that justice has not been done for Andy.

		<shortDescription>A Straight Approach</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>to a touchy topic. A bold move on the part of the movie makers. The term "AIDS" had been around for 11 years by 1992. About 41,000 people died (known deaths) of AIDS in the US in 1993. No doubt,ignorance and fear was rampant as the medical community was trying to figure out what's what. Meanwhile, Philadelphia (1993) is released. It comes across as an honest, straight forward approach. The script was well written and the interaction between the characters was the most honest I have ever seen in a movie. Beckett was employed by a prestigious law firm who thought the world of him until they discovered he had AIDS.This movie is informative as it is thought provoking as well as moving. The script was intelligently written with a straight forward sensitivity to the language. The actors were able to communicate the words naturally with a strong sense of realism. Tom Hanks (Beckett) seemed to represent the anti-stereotypical homosexual and Denzel Washington (Miller) represented the stereotypical heterosexual homophobe, at first. The supporting cast was very strong with some serious talent. Jason Robards as Charles Wheeler, Esq., one of Beckett's former employer) and Joanne Woodward as Beckett's mom.Miller is approached by Beckett to take his case and Miller declines at first. Then after a gentle but firm confrontation with his wife, Miller decides to take the case and then the odyssey begins. If you have not seen this movie, when it comes on TV, do not miss the opportunity.Source: http://www.aegis.com/topics/timeline/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sad, but something everybody should see...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This beautiful, sad movie is, in my opinion, something everyone should see in our troubled times. A revealing story about the struggle of a man with AIDS, this movie was eye-opening. The movie stands strongly against discrimination, and in pursuit of law, order, &amp; justice. The story is very well written, giving life and sincerity to a movie that could have easily been too political for the average viewer. With such a great story, and with the excellent talent of Mssrs Hanks, Banderas, and Washington, I would rate this one of the best hard-hitting dramas of the '90s. Cinematography was good, camera work was interesting, and the pace of the film was right on track. The musical score really stood out to me, adding depth and emotion to the film. Also, Mr. Banderas' performance in this film has increased my opinion of him as an actor ten-fold, and has helped me see things in other films of his. Overall, a touching, sad, and fiercely-charged movie, it is highly recommended and is sure to remain on the 'must-see' lists for a long time.</fullReview>

Tom Hanks' role in the film was excellent; consequently, Tom Hanks is one of my favorite actors. The thought of a homosexual white man with AID's hiring a homophobic African American man as a lawyer was brilliant. It shows the comparison of the two worlds, and explains thoroughly how AIDS is a terrible disease. When Antonio Bandares is with Tom Hanks at the end in the hospital, oh my, that part was hard for me to watch. AIDS and Homosexuality is very abundant in our society today and I think that by watching this movie it will help people understand how serious this illness is. This movie , on a scale of 1-10 is a 16. Believe me, it is worth , " GO buy it NOW!"</fullReview>

Before the film I was so anti-gay and with the opinion that AIDS was self-inflicted, but this film taught me to respect the gay community and be more sympathetic to the disease. Tom Hanks was starring in films such as "Big" only five years previous to this film, and to see just how powerful his performance is here is the mark of a truly great and talented actor. I have just finished watching the movie, and along with the bonus disc with the powerful making of "People Like Us: Making Philadelphia", this is truly one of the most powerful movies of the 1990s. It was 1993. "Schindler's List" was the Best Picture (according to the Academy Awards), but "Philadelphia" was my best of '93. It's emotional, it's funny, it's honest, and it's touching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Philadelphia is one of the best movies ever made the movies about a man (Tom Hanks) who is a lawyer but he got fired because he has AIDs and he hires a layer (Denzel Washington) to represent him in a wrongful dismissal case.Tom Hanks does a great job at acting in this movie and he deserved the Oscar that he won for his great performance and Denzel Washington does a great acting job as well.The movie also stars actors and actress like Roberta Maxwell,Buzz Kilman,Stephanie Roth Haberle,Jason Robards,Bradley Whitford and Antonio Banderas.In this movie there are lots of good scenes like all the court room scenes and the scenes in the end of the movie when Tom Hanks dies and that scene is sad.Over all this is a must watch movie and its worth buying and my rating is 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why did I give this movie 10 stars? I must admit I was a little skeptic about the movie concept in the beginning, but when I saw the 2 actors together (Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington) I was blown away. Their chemistry on set is incredible. And the whole music part in this movie is great. No wonder Tom Hanks won the academy award, but in my book Denzel could also have received it.Antonio Banderas is also in the movie, and it is the first time the audience see him in a great movie, he is doing a great job, and I believe this film helped him become who he is today. I must say this is one of the greatest movies of all time, it is a must see. Watch the movie and enjoy a moment of greatness. The movie went right into my heart, and I will never forget it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Demme delivers once more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its a long time that I have seen this move for the first time. They just released a new SE here on DVD which I thought I should watch again. Normally Jonathan Demme is getting (deserved though) all his credit for the making of Silence Of The Lambs, also a magnificent film, but I cannot stop thinking this indeed was his best film. Personly I think that Philadelhia was much beter, more toching and more close to reality. This one really maked you think about alot of things, and Im happy to see that Demme makes a firm political statement in discrimination and shows the audience its not allowed under and circumstance. A nice touch to know that Philadelphia is indeed the place where Washington, Madison, Hamilton (Jefferson was in Paris &amp; Adams in Londen at that time) and the other founding fathers forged the most liberal state in the world. Their constitution surely would have aplied on this move. Or as Denzel Washinton is saying. "All men are born equal."I though Tom Hanks was as good as he always was and was acting on the level of Forrest Gump, Cast Away, Road To Perdition &amp; Saving Private Ryan. The academy Award commitee occasionaly does seem to recognise real quality by giving the Oscars to the right person.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If everyone in the world saw this movie I think everyone would have a little bit different outlook on life. It is one of few movies that has the ability to move someone in such a way that they change their personal views and values. Tom Hanks scores a ten, and Denzel Washington gives a performance so real to life that almost anyone can, at some point, relate to his character. Philadelphia takes a controversial topic and puts it out there for everyone to see, and while doing this it also shows the truth behind people, how they are afraid, how some must fight, and how people change. It is a true eye opener to anyone who sees it. A must see and a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie worth to be seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I watched the movie for the first time I had had a lot of doubts. I was 12 years. And to me, it is still one of the best movies I've ever seen.It's not only because of the special topic it is about. It's because of the performance of Tom Hanks. I've always been thinking that he is a fantastic actor but what he did in "Philadelphia" was supernatural!! I think you won't find an actor who would also play such a role. Everyone wants to play these straight, successful and happy persons. But who wants to play a gay man with this deadly disease called aids? Nobody, except Mr HanksI also think that nobody else would have been able to play this part. He simply is the best actor we have.But we mustn't forget Denzel Washington. He also does an incredible job. In his performance you can really feel that he absolutely stands for what he's doing.The last thing that makes the movie complete is the soundtrack. Bruce Springsteen's "Streets of Philadelphia" fits so perfectly to that film, it's like a puzzle who gets the last little piece.There are some films that have to be seen. Some films who are special and will be remembered in 20 years. "Philadelphia" is one of those films. Extraordinary performances by the actors, amazing story, great emotion and wonderful music.This movie is worth to be seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The biggest problem about "Philadelphia" is that not one character seems to care about the cause that they're fighting for...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>..."Philadelphia" is a court case drama about homosexual lawyer Andrew Beckett (Tom Hanks) who is fired from his firmed because of his orientation and the fact that he has AIDS. Because of this, he hires bigshot, homophobic attorney Joe Miller (Denzel Washington) to help him win a lawsuit against Beckett's previous firm.The only problem is that the diaogue was weak. Hanks saves himself from a weak role to read on paper, and Washington goes from strong and powerful to boring and melodramatic at times. The courtroom scenes, which are supposed to be intense and dramatic, end up being dull. Everyone just stands around, whispering at each other. The only times they exceed this is when Washington is hit on by a gay at a grocery store and when Hanks listens to some Opera."Philadelphia" could have been a powerful, thought provoking film, but turned out quiet and dull, 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful movie, a must see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT!!! I saw this movie for the first time today, and this is the first time I'm writing a review for a movie here. It is a must-see movie. Simply superb!!! There're different ways in which one can interpret the so-called misgivings of many of the readers here. Guys have complained a lot that Andy and Miguel never kissed in the movie. But did you notice it, even till the last scene when Andy dies, they never said "I love you". Yet there can be no two opinion that their love was so sincerely portrayed by the two actors. I would rather take it to be a deliberate omission that conveys a message. To me, it showed the restriction they felt in expressing their love for each other in public. It hurt me. Another thing I noticed was that they never showed Miguel after Andy died. Even though he is Andy's lover and even though Andy's family accept him wholeheartedly, in public's eye, Miguel has no locus standi whatsoever. Like the scene when Miguel is introduced, i.e., the dialogues in the hospital. The doctor is about to throw him out. These are issues which even now gays and lesbians face. They've been subtly but beautifully brought out. On a personal level, the movie has been a sort of an eye-opener for me. I've never watched a movie based on a gay theme. All the words about enduring discrimination in real life is fine, but this atill definitely was an eye-opener for me. The movie did create a sympathy for Andy and Miguel and portrayed them as sort of victims. But then they were! They were victims of discrimination. And, note this, neither Andy nor Miguel ever asked for any sympathy in the movie. Nor did anyone shower sympathy on them. In many instances where sympathy could have explicitly played a factor, the makers had deliberately resisted including it. The two best examples I can think of have to do with Joe Miller, Andy's counselor: Joe doesn't take up the case because he feels pity for Andy. Also, when one of Joe's colleagues ask him if he is turning "pansy", his reasoning of why he took up the case is very clear. Again no pity involved. But if watching the movie creates sympathy in the viewer's mind and that sympathy leads to a better appreciation of the discrimination gays and AIDS victims go through, then it is every bit worth it. I agree with the fact that not all parents are as open minded as Andy's and Miguel's. But dealing with all those issues will take away the focus of the movie. There are so many gay-related issues that need to be addressed, may be through movies too. But one can't expect all of them to be addressed in one movie. Thats just preposterous. By the way, not all gays want to watch porno and want to get it on or whatever. I am gay and I am so happy for this movie for what it stands for. About the movie itself, the acting was excellent, except in a couple scenes that Denzel Washington felt flat and sort of subdued. May be he tried to underplay but overdid it. Editing could have been a bit smoother. But otherwise the movie was wonderful. My rating: 9.0/10.0</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though Philadelphia was released in 1993, it has taken me eight years to see it, and for that I'm glad. If I hadn't waited to see it, I wouldn't have the full appreciation that I have now. When the movie ended around 10 minutes ago, I had tears in my eyes. I don't get emotional for movies, but this one certainly warranted it. I was touched on a very deep level, even though I'm only 18 and straight. After seeing nothing but mindless movies, I'm thrilled that I finally found one that touched my heart, mind and soul.

		<shortDescription>The Film That Solidified Tom Hanks's Career</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If nothing else, "Philadelphia" cemented the career of Tom Hanks and he has not looked back since. Hanks won a well-deserved Oscar as a gay AIDS patient who is fired from his job at a law firm after his fellow lawyers discover that he does in fact have AIDS. Hanks enlists the help of former nemesis lawyer Denzel Washington to defend him and we see that Washington has to overcome his beliefs in order to defend Hanks to the paramount. Needless to say this is a film which deals with very delicate subject matter. Director Jonathan Demme has never been one to shy away from controversial material. He made "The Silence of the Lambs" work in 1991, but "Philadelphia" does not work as well as Demme had planned. The screenplay shows the struggles of both Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington, but I never had 100% approval of what either was doing. Tom Hanks's character is made to be the victim here, but his lifestyle prior to his firing makes him a somewhat unsympathetic character at times. The same goes for Washington, who has strange views of all AIDS patients in general, but then learns that he and Hanks are really not that different at all. In short the film has a lot of things to say, but is silent at times and too opinionated at other intervals. Antonio Banderas is just present as Tom Hanks's partner. Mary Steenburgen and Jason Robards are portrayed as the villains, but their side of the story is never given much thought. All in all, "Philadelphia" is controversial and well-made, but overall unsatisfying and somewhat difficult to sit through. 4 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grapples with a challenging subject, but fails to really disturb</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you go to see Jonathan Demme's new picture about AIDS victim Andy Beckett expecting a confronting and challenging experience, then you may well be disappointed.Tom Hanks plays the lead in what promised to be the role of a life time for him, yet unfortunately neither the story nor his performance fulfills this promise. Denzel Washington plays alongside Hanks as the personal injury attorney Andy has enlisted to represent him in a case of wrongful dismissal he intends to bring against his former employers. The two leads do give quality showings, but both have been much better. Jason Robards and Mary Steenburgen lend support equally worthy of praise.While Ron Nyswaner's script tackles an interesting issue, it is the controversial topics it seemingly neglects that really let it down, such as the issue of family acceptance which appears to be totally ignored. The Beckett clan seem to wholeheartedly accept Andy for what and who he is without question, hardly a likely scenario. The other disappointment of course is director Demme's failure to create a powerful and impacting movie from the potentially devastating material which he had at his disposal."Philadelphia" is still a good movie however, as it grapples with a subject which was long overdue an audience. It fails to disturb and penetrate its viewers though, which is quite a shame considering its strong cast and professional production. Bruce Springsteen provided a sensational song ("Streets of Philadelphia") and Howard Shore an enjoyable soundtrack.Saturday, March 12, 1994 - Hoyts Forest Hill Chase</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty bad movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You'd think a film with Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington would be a pretty good one, right? Well, I know there are plenty of people who hate Tom Hanks, and I was one of them for a long time. Philadephia was actually why I hated Tom Hanks.People are right to call this movie propagandistic, although several of the commenters below are glaring homophobes (what many others don't realize is that propaganda is important, and that most people believe what they believe through propaganda).What I have not seen anyone mention is how terribly homophobic this movie is. I can't believe intelligent people like Jason Robards, Tom Hanks, and Denzel Washington would ever lend their names to Philadelphia, let alone accept an Oscar because of it. I'm talking about two scenes in particular: the scene where we see Tom Hanks contract AIDS (by having sex in a gay porno theater with the man who is sitting next to him) and by having Hanks's character bring Washington to a homosexual party where everyone is dressed in drag. Philadelphia is basically telling the majority of its viewers that, while homosexuals may deserve rights, they are still icky people who do weird things to get their kicks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This piece of Hollywood trash is totally worthless in terms of presenting any truth about gay life and dealing with AIDS. Now I can see why a director like Spike Lee would object to Spielberg making 'Amistad'. He just doesn't know or understand anything about the subject matter, and I doubt the director here knew much about gays or AIDS. At least he didn't demonstrate to me that he had any more knowledge or empathy than Denzel Washington or his character did. And as for Hanks playing a gay man, well, it was much like Jimmy Stewart in 'Rope'. He had no idea what he was doing. Banderas, who has played a gay man in his films with Almodovar, at least seemed to have some idea. All the other 'gay' men were simply the usual Hollywood stereotypes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this wonderfully kleen-ex-ed, sanitised film for the 'masses', Demme, Washington, and Hanks have sold out. I still maintain that Tom Hanks' best role to date has been in Big; it is a travesty that he could have garnered a best actor award for this role. His acceptance speech at the Oscars was better acting (surpassed only by Gwyneth Paltrow for Shakespeare in Love).Denzel Washington, fiery and at his political best, in Lovefield does not convince as the initially-homophobic-man-becoming-agay's-best-friend.And Antonio Banderas ... well, convince me that you can have a relationship with a special person and not kiss. (Hang on, Demme sanitises the ugly for Hollywood mainstream.) This film is a masterpiece of cliches - it trivialises the important issues, sidestepping them and masterfully avoiding issues. We are left realising that the central character - the opera-loving, former porn-cinema-cruising Hanks - has contracted the virus through some sullied means and can relax. After all, the sub-text of Philadelphia is, 'Shame. It doesn't happen to us.' Us - being the diehard heterosexual population.It is a film that offends deeply. If you want to see a good film about AIDS, try 'And the band play on.' If you want to feel OK about gay men but not have to cope with more than a hug, this is a film for you. You can wipe the tears from your eyes and be happy you are not one of 'them'.On the whole, a divisive, limp-wristed, indefensible film. Make money from illness. Make money from the fags. Be queer friendly. Be oh so liberal. See Philadelphia. Watch the gay man love opera, see him touch his partner on the shoulder. Later see them dance. Be liberated. Be safe. Go straight to the Hollywood Closet. Don't pass Go. Don't think.APPALLING AND PREJUDICED</fullReview>

Denzel Washington starts out as a bigot but is cured by the wonderfulness of Tom Hanks and friends. I could not buy any of these characters as real life people. They were all caricatures.The movie was totally predictable. A wonderful beloved man man with AIDS sues the evil lawyers. Guess which lawyers present a pathetic, incompetent case. Guess who wins. Guess who dies. Guess who is sad about the death.The pacing was very slow. The scene where Tom Hanks explains the Maria Callus aria goes on much too long. In the scenes with Tom Hanks giant family, all the family members have to get in their camera time.Tom Hanks does a great portrayal of a Gay man struggling against bigotry, the effects of AIDS, and the fears of AIDS.

I don't' think so ! I had no sympathy at all. The movie is a bit like the' Pelican Brief ' era, which also stars Denzel Washington. There just wasn't enough quality, and even though it is watchable- there is no great feeling to the movie.

		<shortDescription>Hanks and Washington are the driving force</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I have AIDS." Haunting words from such a sweet and caring man. It's only three words but they leave an impact so great that nobody could possibly prepare for the consequences. These are the three words which define Philadelphia when Tom Hanks says them to Denzel Washington. The movie is about Andrew Beckett (Hanks), a homosexual man dying of AIDS, who feels he was fired from his job as a lawyer because of discrimination against him and his condition. Denzel Washington plays Joe Miller, the attorney who takes Beckett's case. He makes it clear from the start that he does not like homosexuals, but he does love the law and will put aside his prejudices to uphold justice. It isn't a bad thing to say that the highlight of this film is the performances given by these two fine actors.Philadelphia is an emotionally moving story, and Hanks and Washington deliver tenfold in their conflicting roles. Watching their relationship mature throughout the film is a heart wrenching delight for the audience. Because of these two immaculate characters, who seem to be completely opposite but are actually very similar, the film serves as a fantastic emotional treat. The story is rich with moral debate that deals with human nature and our prejudices against those who are different. The law firm that Beckett is fired from claims that they fired him for his incompetence and inability to act accordingly and to the best of his ability. But Beckett firmly believes that it is a deep seated bigotry that got him fired when the managers of the firm found out he had the deadly AIDS virus. This film beautifully raises awareness against prejudice and discrimination and makes a wonderful social statement that needs to be heard. And it is all done by the excellent and believably heartfelt performances from Hanks and Washington.The acting and social statements are the driving force behind Philadelphia. Most other aspects take a relative backseat to the important message brought up in this film. The direction and cinematography of this film seems odd at times and for some reason the director has an obsession with close ups. Hanks and Washington drive the character development of this film and the supporting cast, albeit necessary, don't seem to have the same richness and prevalence as the two leads. I said this is an emotional film, and it is, despite there being a few scenes that seem forced and only established for the purpose of having emotion, almost giving the feeling of force fed emotion. All of these are minor complaints that do not undermined the true integrity of this fine film.Philadelphia is a beautiful film that will be relevant for a long time to come. It has a strong heart that emanates an important message about discrimination and human rights. A great watch, if only for the fantastic performances and the strong ideals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Memorable Film, with Super Performances...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Inspired by the story of Geoffrey Bowers, an attorney who in the year 1987 sued the law firm Baker &amp; McKenzie for unfair dismissal in one of the first AIDS discrimination cases. True Stories on celluloid are magical, because, you witness a true situation in the from of dialogue, and some cinematic liberties.'Philadelphia' is based on the issue mentioned above, and here comes a film that is memorable, sensitive and compelling. Helmed by Veteran Filmmaker Jonathan Demme.Some stories are emotional and Andrew Beckett's story is amongst those. You watch a talented man sulking from AIDS and humiliation, and then fighting for himself. You support him in each step he takes, and try to hold him when he falls down. Your relationship with the would-be-deceased is intact throughout, which makes this saga a memorable watch! Demme's direction, like always, is flawless. One of the most talented filmmakers in recent history! Screenplay by Ron Nyswaner is brilliant, the dialogue are superb. The Soundtrack is legendary, with "Streets of Philadelphia' by Springsteen and "Philadelphia' by Neil Young standing out.In the acting department, Tom Hanks as Andrew Beckett, in a Multiple Award-Winning Performance, is Incredible. Without a doubt, his careers finest performance! Denzel Washington is superb. It's surprisingly to know he didn't even get a Nomination for Best Supporting Actor at the Academy-Awards! Antonio Banderas also does very well. Mary Steenburgen is wonderfully restrained in her part. Jason Robards is remarkable, like always! Joanne Woodward is efficient.On the whole, 'Philadelphia' is a winner all the way, one of the most memorable films from the early 90's. Two Big Thumbs Up!</fullReview>

At the time when this film came out, it was probably considered quite a brave role for Tom Hanks to take on, or Denzel Washington for that matter. They both shine with amazing performances in this important and wonderful film. It follows a gay man who is dying from AIDS in a court case against his former employees for wrongful dismissal, illustrating the injustice and inequality that people who are gay or people with AIDs have to face. Tom Hanks is truly fantastic, it's no wonder he won an Oscar for this performance. I highly recommend this film to others, and it an important one as a stepping stone to other films and even today there is still a stigma around being gay in Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine film doesn't seem as groundbreaking now.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood hadn't done much up to this point with mainstream gay characters and the subject of AIDS. And really there hasn't been all that much done since in terms of landmark cinema, save for maybe Brokeback Mountain and maybe a few others. Maybe it took some serious talent like Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington to drag the general public into see something like this. Now, over a decade later, it doesn't seem nearly as edgy. Is this because society is warming up to gay people, or is it because people have stopped caring as much about AIDS? Maybe both. There is no question that gays seem to be gaining more and more acceptance, but there is also no doubt that AIDS is still taking its toll on society. Though we are closer than ever to finding a cure, it is still taking many, many lives from us. But a cure will be had some day.The film deals with Tom Hanks as an apparently bright young lawyer who is battling AIDS. Early in the film he is given a promotion at his ultra-prestigious Philadelphia law firm, and also assigned a very important case. But no sooner does he get promoted, than one of the senior partners notices a probable Kaposi's sarcoma lesion on his forehead. Hanks begins getting sick and missing work, but he still seems to have the case under control. However, just before the statute of limitations runs out on the case, his work turns up missing. Of course they find it just in time, but the chaos is used as an excuse to fire Hanks. He obviously suspects he is being fired for having AIDS and plans to sue his old firm. Since they are so powerful, and probably due to his advancing symptoms and appearance, nobody but a low-rent ambulance chaser (Washington) will take his case. The rest of the film deals with the lawsuit, and Hanks's deteriorating condition and his relationships with his family and lover.The film works best when it deals with Hanks as a person. His Andy Beckett is an all-around great guy and you will really feel sorry for him. The part dealing with the trial is less convincing since it is so blatantly a case of discrimination that the firm should have just settled it out of court and tried to bury the whole thing. The senior partners are portrayed as basic curmudgeons who could not possibly win over a jury. Another misstep is with Washington's initial homophobia. Any man who really felt this way about gays (especially ones with AIDS) would have likely never taken Andy's case. And there is a really embarrassing scene where a gay man tries to pick Washington up in a drug store. The guy has a football jersey on and is carrying a ball while hitting on Washington. As if the film is screaming at the audience.."See, look! Gay men play football, too!" Really? Never would have guessed that. Anyway, the film is powerful enough, and it is one of Jonathan Demme's better efforts. And Hanks deserved his Oscar. Strange how this film has almost fallen through the cracks since it was made. 8 of 10 stars.The Hound</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, What an amazing, powerful film. This film focused on the very sensitive issue of homosexuality and aids, and discrimination concerning these issues. The acting by every single actor in this film was above amazing but i have to mention Tom Hanks. This is by far one of the best if not the best role i have ever seen him play, what an amazing and talented man. The role of Andy would have been a very difficult character to play, but Hanks completely nailed it. Denzel Washington was again amazing, and i must give mention to Antonio Banderas. Both were A+. At the beginning of this film, I was wondering how it was going to pan out as it was, as i mentioned at the start, focused on very sensitive issues and the social values at the time would have been vastly different to what they are today, but at the end I was nearly in tears because of the way the film gripped you into Andy's situation and how powerful the motif of friendship and compassion was. A very well made film. The character development was at its best and the plot and screen writing was very well done. I also noticed the Mise en Scene lighting in this film which gave the characters even more emotion. I am not quite sure how to put into words, how I feel about this movie and how it moved me. But overall it was a fantastic experience that I think everyone should see at least once in their lives, even if they oppose the issues dealt with in this film. This movie was so very powerful and will touch and move you in a way that not a lot of films can do these days. This is one of those films that you do not come across very often. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most controversial dramas of the 90's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In his first Oscar winning role, Tom Hanks (Big) stars as Andrew Beckett, an upcoming lawyer who is fired from a prestigious law firm. Knowing that he was fired because he has aids, Beckett hires Joe Miller to represent him, and gain justice.Hanks has been dazzling our screens for over 20 years now and his portrayal of an intelligent man who is suffering from aids has to be one of his finest to date. His role in Big was a challenge and a complete contrast to the type of character he plays in this 1993 drama, and come the end of the film, you will have really associated with Beckett, and will be close to weeping.Hanks is helped along by an equally impressive performance by Washington (Glory) as Beckett's lawyer, who has his own personal issues to deal with.The on screen pairing is excellent, and no other two actors could have created such a dramatic relationship and storyline, which was essential to drive the issue of homosexuality to the audience's attention.Set at a time of gay prejudice, Philadelphia grabs hold of the issue and shows audiences how sexual orientation affects everyone, your colleagues and your friends, and does so in a controversial fashion.The script is excellent, and the idea of homosexuality being difficult is driven by Hanks, and the effects of aids and being gay are very powerful and dramatic in the context of this film, making Philadelphia a very thought provoking drama.This film is a true testament to standing up for your beliefs and gaining justice for what you believe in and the context of the situation is exceptionally powerful.After seeing this film, I was shocked to believe that these issues ever took place in the work place, and other people had such thoughts about sexual orientation.Bruce Springsteen's Oscar winning "Streets of Philadelphia" truly sets the tone for the film and will gear you up for one of the most controversial and thought provoking films of the 1990's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An important film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Philadelphia, when released, sought to educate the public on the truth behind AIDS. At a time when uncertainty and fear surrounded this terrible disease, Philadelphia turned on a light. This is in my opinion Tom Hanks' best performance. He plays a HIV Positive homosexual, suddenly fired from his esteemed position within a business. Denzel Washington plays the lawyer that takes up his case. Apart from brilliant performances, the film glows with a skillfully driven narrative and beautiful cinematography. The score also compliments the film beautifully. The Opera scene is possibly the most powerful moment in any film I have ever seen. Many criticisms of this film lie in over-sentimentality, but I believe these views are unfounded - Philadelphia is tragic, but that doesn't make it a weepy. Ultimateley, Philadelphia is about the will to go on and appreciate every moment. Prejudism has no place. I enjoyed this film immensely, its messages are paramount in the age we live in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that makes you keep your eyes open</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without a doubt, one of my favourite movies. Couldn't of been better. A stunning film with a great soundtrack, it could draw tears from almost anyone. Scenes from this movie could make you cry just from how good they are, for how brilliant they are. Definitely one of the best films made. Tom Hanks' brilliant performance rightfully one an Oscar for best actor in a leading role, along with Bruce Springsteen winning an Oscar for the song Streets of Philadelphia. The excellent performances from Denzel Washington and Antonio Banderes give it a great feel; and the direction from Jonathan Demme makes you feel as if your on the set. With some of the most stunningly brilliant scenes from any movie I've ever watched makes this film perfect. This movie will make you keep your eyes open if you haven't slept for weeks; and the only thing that takes away the awareness that your watching a movie, is to think of how brilliant it is.As a recommendation, if your putting off watching this movie. Thinking that you might not like it. You need to just watch it, you won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Haunting,tough to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Andrew Beckett(Tom Hanks,whose transformation and presence in this film is as exhaustive as it was impressive),a once rising star of a lawyer in a Philadelphia firm,is now seeking a wrongful discrimination suit against said firm over his firing. His firm claims he had become negligent in his work. He claims it's because he is gay and has AIDS. Few attorneys want to touch this case. Even publicity hound personal injury attorney Joe Miller(Denzel Washington,underrated here as a solid and convincing counterbalance)is initially reluctant to take this on. But Beckett's determination and heart eventually wins over Miller,and the battle in court over the case,discrimination,homophobia and(ultimately)truth go into play.With pounding,haunting musical numbers from the likes of Bruce Springsteen and Neil Young(among others)and fantastic performances by HAnks,Washington,Antonio BAnderas(As HAnks' passionate lover)and Joanne Woodward(as Hanks' strong mother),this movie is strong enough to chug to a gut and heart-wrenching conclusion and draw in many or most who watch this.Director JOnathan Demme,who took on this film(it is said)because of the flak he received from the Gay and Lesbian community over their portrayal in his 1991 Oscar-winner Silence of the Lambs,heaps it on pretty thick,along with screenplay writer Ron Nyswander,which makes this film hardly an easy watch. But this movie,I believe,is almost entirely about ideas and performances,and this film is rife with them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Four people made this film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even after 13 years this film still brings tears to my eyes. But let's face it, four people made this film. Tom Hanks, Denzel Washington, the Jonathan Demme and Tak Fujimoto. tom Hanks above all was 10005 convincing as the betrayed lawyer who must fight his disease and fight his wrongful termination. Demme made the decision to shoot the film simply and subtle, except for in-your face close-ups and Fujimoto made it so. But Denzel Washington was the perfect counterpart to Hanks' character. Many people don't realize it but Denzel is us, the audience. He represents our transformation as we build a bond built on understanding and empathy. We change as he changes and that makes him a pivotal character in the film. Denzel often doesn't get much love. He is highly underrated, even with his Oscar win. He's only has one or two $100 million dollar films, yet most of his performances have been critically acclaimed.Philadelphia would not be the same without him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful Moving Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie when it first came out. As i grew up in the Philadelphia area ,it hit home quite well. The scenes ,the locations all incredible and moving . Tom Hanks portrayal was so moving, I cried. The opera scene may have seemed too long but think about it.In reality can you put a time frame on someones expressions . It was beautifully worked. Denzel Washington was good in this movie and the scene of him being come onto in the drug store was real . I know that scene and have been in it myself and it showed how most heterosexual people handle it by getting upset rather than saying excuse me I'm sorry I'm not gay . I mean if a woman hit on him and he wasn't interested would he yell at her. The family was depicted honestly , I know gay men who have wonderful loving families who overcame prejudice and loved their children no matter what . So you critics who say that the family was too good to be true ,take note, I'm sure that in real life a family like that it took years to get to what they portrayed in the movie. they loved their son no matter what. Jason Robards was wonderful as the opposing lawyer and I'm sure that this has happened a lot in real life before laws have become stricter on firing because of orientation.We all know how his character felt . betrayed , sickened ,like he had to go run out and get tested and take 1000 showers. And what a shocker to see sweet Mary Steenburgen type against cast as a ruthless defense lawyer . She is so a comedic actress that it was wonderful to see her stretch her acting skills. A few goofs not noted . Jason Robards mentions to his defense team to find out about gay bars that Hanks' character frequented on Chestnut St.At the time of filming there were no gay bars on Chestnut St. And also the gay porno theater where he had his anonymous encounter with another man is not in Philadelphia but rather I believe in LA. Overall a 10 out of 10 - to you naysayers take a hike . The movie was wonderful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would never go as far as Pat Buchanan and say that AIDS is God's punishment for homosexuality but I still retain my conservative Christian attitude towards the lifestyle. I guess I have some more sympathy for gays who must find it difficult to live in a world that is oriented towards heterosexuality. After all it is not their fault that a gene mishap occurred and made them gay. On the other hand homosexuality shouldn't be a lifestyle that one should be influenced to adopt like say a vegetarian diet. In this film, the viewer is clearly steered to sympathize with the Hanks character and Denzel's character is clearly shown to be the recipient of enlightenment from his formerly bigoted views. All in all, a thought provoking legal drama. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed but fascinating social protest movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Earnest, engrossing and certainly brave but in my opinion flawed film giving us mainstream Hollywood's reaction to the AIDS outbreak amongst the gay community. The film makes a strong case against bigotry in general, but for me at times fails its subject somewhat by occasionally using too broad strokes in making its points.I'm obviously watching this film some 16 years now after its original release and would like to think that society has moved on at least a little since then so that some of the repulsive prejudices here wouldn't be tolerated today, but the film maintains its relevance, mainly of course because society hasn't and in all likelihood never will full accept the gay community as equals (consider the US Army still refusing to recruit openly gay soldiers).The movie opens with an almost guided tour of different sites of the city of Philadelphia where people gather, to no doubt bolster the image of the cultural diversity and tolerance of its reputed broad minded populace. It's against this backdrop that Tom Hanks' AIDS-afflicted upwardly mobile city lawyer makes his brave stand against an obviously contrived dismissal. Turned down by every other legal practice in the city when seeking to prosecute an unfair dismissal case, he eventually hooks up with an old adversary, an "ambulance-chasing" litigation-specialist lawyer, the overtly homophobic Denzel Washington to take on the venerable partners of his old firm, in particular the formerly patrician senior partner, played by Jason Robards.Whilst the movie held me throughout and was never less than entertaining, I have some major caveats with the portrayal of some characters and some of the scenes depicted. It's noticeable immediately of course that the director felt unable to show any physical intimacy between Hanks and his lover Miguel, played by Antonio Banderas. That said it took Hollywood another 15 years for its first gay-kiss between men in "Brokeback Mountain" and if to turn a clich, a journey of a hundred miles starts with a single step, then "Philadelphia" played its part, especially when prejudices were arguably more ingrained than today. I liked the idea of Hanks' case being taken on by a black man, obviously no stranger to discrimination but with deeply held bias of his own and enjoyed the movie best in the courtroom scenes, well played by all the principals.The device of the prosecution and defence attorneys directly addressing the jury and hence we the viewers face-on was also effective but against this we get Hanks' frankly embarrassing "drip-dance" to the strains of Maria Callas which is overplayed in the extreme. I could have done with a little of the similarly over-egged family scenes, (especially the "home-movie" footage too obviously tugging at the heart-strings. Worst of all was the over-dramatic collapse of Hanks' character at the crux of the trial, Hollywood betraying its predilection for melodramatic climaxes.Take nothing away from the actors however. Hanks in particular deserved his Oscar for a well-rounded depiction of, if not an ordinary average guy, (an opera loving, city slicker lawyer, anyone?), certainly a believable character, not without fault (tacitly highlighted with revelation of Hanks' one-night stand while still in his relationship with Banderas). Washington, in the less showy and less well-written role of Hanks' defence acquits himself well and the heavyweight turns by the likes of Robards, Joanne Woodward (who doesn't get much to do in all honesty) and the under-appreciated Mary Steenburgen.There are many interesting minor-characters on show whose stories might have borne more scrutiny, not least the sole senior partner who displays remorse for the corporate decision and Hanks' erstwhile colleagues caught between a rock and a hard place in giving their difficult testimony. Special plaudits too must go to the rock stars Bruce Springsteen and Neil Young who contributed the two telling songs which book-end the movie so effectively. Springsteen's lyric, in particular demonstrates a potent empathy (...and my clothes don't fit me no more...") with the subject which often eludes the director on the screen. All in all then, certainly an epochal movie, let down in terms of credibility and ultimately as entertainment by too obvious concessions to the considerations of on the one hand the box-office and on the other, the censorship laws of the day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A powerful account of a fight for fundamental rights</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is about a lawyer with AIDS fighting against his law firm for wrongful dismissal because of his AIDS."Philadelphia" is successful and engaging because it has a simple plot. It does not get distracted by unnecessary subplot, but instead focuses on Andrew Beckett's fight against injustice. He fights for fairness and equality, something that everyone deserves. It is this hard strive for fundamental rights which makes "Philadelphia" so engaging and moving.There are many powerful scenes which are that can easily move viewers to tears. The scene when Tom Hanks is absorbed by the Italian opera, and the final hospital scenes are rather moving. Along with the incredible acting and great physical transformation by Tom Hanks, "Philadelphia" deserves all the Oscars it got, if not more.As for whether Tom Hanks and Antonio Banderas are believable as gay or not, I think people are judging by the usual stereotype of what they think gays should look like. It is refreshing to see a film portraying a homosexual as a masculine, happy and high flying individual.</fullReview>

The film makers didn't touch on AIDS in straight people. I know due to various elements the disease is unfortunately more prominent in homosexuals, but straight people do have it too, and the film could have set off some wrong ideas about the disease. Nevertheless an absolutely brilliant and compeling film, well worth all the awards it got.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>`Politically correct to a fault'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can scarcely believe it myself, but for once I entirely agree with something that Leonard Maltin has written. Indeed it was perhaps sadly inevitable that Hollywood's first film about AIDS would be an exercise in the politically correct that constantly watched its back. That is not to say that Philadelphia is a bad film. In fact is quite a good one. Director Demme should be credited for crafting an interesting and entertaining film that at least doesn't fall into the trap of being patronising to the point of insulting. Hanks is brilliant as the lawyer who is fired by his firm for having AIDS. In his first role after spending his career making comedies, he gives his `every man' routine its first outing, a style that he has been feeding off ever since with Apollo 13 to Saving Private Ryan. Washington too is great as the lawyer who loathes homosexuals, but worships fair play and eventually takes on his case. However the film stumbles over the script, which prevents its from reaching the great heights of profundity which it clearly aspires too. The characters are pretty much all caricatures. Hanks as the innocent, almost saintly gay lawyer out for simple justice from his evil heterosexual superiors (`He brought AIDS into our bathrooms!') while Washington as the nice black lawyer attempting to put the World to rights. We simply don't know anything about Hank's background, his family and lover Banderas are too good to be true and the fact that the audience even sympathises with him is testament to the dignity of Hanks' performance. The film works well given its limitations of the standard Hollywood courtroom drama. But 7 years on, the time is right for a more realistic and gritty portrayal of the issues at hand. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Jonathan Demme (The Silence of the Lambs) has created an emotional story, and it was the first major Hollywood film about the incurable disease Aids. Basically Andrew Beckett (Oscar and Golden Globe winning Tom Hanks) is a homosexual lawyer infected with the disease, and over time develops lesions. He is unexpectedly fired from his job, and he is suing them on the grounds that they feared contracting the disease from him. He is hoping to win the case with the help of homophobic lawyer Joe Miller (Denzel Washington), but over time, he sees that he is like any other (straight) person. As the witnesses give their opinions with Andrew's work, behaviour and health, Andrew's health is declining more and more, to the upset of both Joe and Andrew's partner Miguel Alvarez (Antonio Banderas). Towards the end, Andrew is taken into hospital, just before his victory is concluded, and not too long later, he dies very tragically of his disease, with Joe and Miguel by his side. Also starring Jason Robards as Charles Wheeler, Back to the Future III's Mary Steenburgen as Belinda Conine, Ron Vawter as Bob Seidman, Robert Ridgely as Walter Kenton, Charles Napier as Judge Garnett and Joanne Woodward as Sarah Beckett. Washington is fantastic as the defending lawyer, the supporting cast all do their part too, but of course Hanks steals the show with his deserved award-winning performance. He really makes you believe in his struggle and it affects you so much that you want him to succeed, and his most remembered scene is his praise for an operatic song with passionate gestures. It won the Oscar (and Golden Globe) for Best Song for Bruce Springsteen's "Streets of Philadelphia" (it was also number 68 on 100 Years, 100 Songs), and it was nominated for Best Makeup, Best Song for Neil Young's "Philadelphia" and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay. Denzel Washington was number 28, and Tom Hanks number number 3 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and Washington was number 40, and Hanks number 39 on The World's Greatest Actor, Andrew Beckett was number 49 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes &amp; Villains, the film was 27 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers, and it was number 20 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers.

		<fullReview>I hate to blast this movie because Hanks was so great but...As a gay man I was both horrified and pleased by this film. For one thing, it dealt with AIDS--I believe this was the first movie like that from a major Hollywood studio. Also Tom Hanks was absolutely great in the movie. And it looks good and treated gay men rather well (considering it's a major studio film). Still...this movie does NOT show AIDS as it really is. I've seen friends die of it so I know what I'm talking about. Also there is NO affection shown between Hanks and Banderas (they play lovers). There's one quick kiss and a little hugging--that's it. Heaven forbid we show them kissing! That would disgust people! Also Hanks family being behind him and so noble--COME ON! NO family like that exists! They hired a bunch of great actors (especially Joanne Woodward) but I didn't believe them for one second. Also the anti-gay remarks got to me. Yeah, I know they're trying to make a point but still... And all the gays being stereotypically swishy or noble got annoying. And AIDS is no longer an automatic death sentence.So, the acting is great except for Denzel Washington. It was a good piece of casting (Washington has admitted that he's homphobic) but he's terrible. Maybe it was hitting him too close to what he's really like.If you want to see a true picture of AIDS get "Longtime Companion" or "It's My Party". If you want to see a sanitized, stereotyped, incorrect version of gays and AIDS, by all means see this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unrealistic portrayal...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Hanks' Oscar for this film really galled me. As a gay man with HIV, I found his portrayal of Andrew to be entirely devoid of any hint of the inner - or outer - truth of a human being in this situation. The film as a whole struck me as pablum designed to appeal to a mainstream (heterosexual) audience, disregarding the realities of the lives of gay men. For a more realistic portrayal I'd suggest "Parting Glances" or even "Longtime Companion;" and for those who can take it - it is a truly devastating film - "Common Threads: Stories from the Quilt."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie made it only because it was so PC</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know I'm in the minority here, but I swear the only reason this movie did so well is because the main character(Tom Hanks) was gay and had AIDS. Sure Tom Hanks was a good actor in the movie, I'll give everyone that, but other than his acting what was so great about this movie? The whole movie is just geared around making you feel sorry for someone that is persecuted for having AIDS and being gay. I'm of course not trying to make light of persecutions, but I felt this whole movie lacked any substance. It was just a good actor trying to make you feel sad because of the situation he was in. It was just a shallow movie that lacked an interesting plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>excellent movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Philadelphia was an amazing story to be told, for just like so many other human tragedies, for us the unaffected to be able to see just one example up close and personal. I hope it had some positive impact in creating compassion among the general public and can inspired us.Andrew's lover, Miquel, played by Antonio Banderas. I found this part of the movie to be most touchy. The bond of affection and love between Antonio and Tom is so wonderfully portrayed amazing and beautiful. It is all body language! The relationship between Andrew and his lover is understood from their body language and it teaches us that it is hardly different from the kind of love and affection we all share for each other. My favorite scene between them is when they dance, holding hand together, we can see how much Andrew and Miquel love each other, and the other hand, Joe miller looks at them and understand that love is universal. We are also shown Andrew's parents and family who loves him much.Tom Hanks was fantastic, as usual. Denzel Washington is so good in this role specially the scene where Hanks get him to listen to his favorite opera. This scene is just stunning and touchy. memorable quote "consider me a three years old kid", the last court scenes and the over all goal of the movie which is to say that no body has the right to judge you, destroy your career even if you are dying, and most importantly consider himself a God above your sins no matter what were they and chooses to treat you like crap. I guess this strong message was well delivered to all of us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Propaganda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If this movie weren't about the trendy topic of homosexuality, everyone would have noticed just how dreadful it is. The characters, with the exception of Denzel Washington's, are one-dimensional and cardboard. The performances, with the exception of Washington's and Tom Hanks's, are cartoonish and heavy-handed. This is a piece of leaden propaganda--I would call it "obvious" propaganda, but it seems to have fooled most of the critics. Don't let it fool you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Leftist View of Justice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aside from the political biases that obviously motivated the making of this film, I thought Hanks' character was absolutely flat and showed little depth of emotion. Denzel Washington's character was just a re-hash of all his characters from that era: strident, using the high-strung, clipped-speech, and contrived. The other characters were obviously props to propel the non-homosexual writers' and producers' kid-glove vision of homosexuality, a major criticism that is supported by many of the pertinent reviews here. What was the point of this film? To make us feel sorry for a character whose own immoral lifestyle choices were the proximate cause of his eventual unemployment (and undoing)? The sheer audacity of such an approach made the performances of Hanks and Washington seem more contrived than they already were.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>you have GOT to be kidding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suppose the heartlands of America needed a film like this, and I suppose ultra-liberal Johnathan Demme felt he HAD to make it after the flack he received for the transsexual villain in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, but get real. This movie is idiotic, unrealistic (I know, I know, it was BASED on a true story,) and utterly insulting. You may appreciate the story, you may appreciate the politics, but that still doesn't make it a good film. It's AIDS propaganda for the masses; a film-by-committee if there ever was one. The only amazing thing about it is that it was financially successful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-Acted, Involving Propaganda Piece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who can argue this isn't a superior-acted film and a powerful story.....but, sorry folks, it's the wrong message. This is nothing but a pro-gay agenda propaganda flick. It just packaged slickly.Granted, no one should be fired from their job just because they are gay or have AIDs, for that matter, but this movie only portrays gays as wonderful, caring people while showing people against that lifestyle as mean-spirited. This is just so typical of the ultra-Liberal entertainment business. Talk about "stereotypes!!!" Anyway, all the characters in the movie are interesting ones, especially the two leads, played by Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington, two of today's best actors and closet Liberals. It's an interesting story, too, which begins with an excellent Bruce Springsteen song accompanied by some nice shots of the city of Philadelphia.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sheer drivel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The genesis of this film was Jonathan Demme being harassed by the gay lobby after the depiction of the serial killer in "The Silence of the Lambs." The payback was to make a sympathetic portrayal of a gay man with AIDS (BTW, the same lobby tried to bully Mel Gibson after his portrayal of the effeminate prince in "Braveheart" but Mel is too much of a man to be bullied) This film is extremely preachy and politically correct---as someone noted earlier---the heterosexual white men are the evil crucifiers of the gay guy. And who comes to the rescue? the black guy. Puhleeese. The gay party scene was pretty sickening. And by the way, why doesn't Hanks' "partner" have the virus? I noticed that the GLAAD people have posted like crazy that this is the best film since "Citizen Kane." I also noticed all the usual Hollywood lefties (or should I say "fellow travelers"?) particpated in this film: Joanne Woodward, Tom Hanks, Mary Steenburgen, Bruce Springsteen. I guess Ed Asner, Mike Farrell and Jane Fonda weren't available. Demme should stop the politics and get back to entertaining people. As the L.B. Mayer said "If you want to send a message, go to Western Union." I'll give a '3' mostly due to Hanks' performance.</fullReview>
