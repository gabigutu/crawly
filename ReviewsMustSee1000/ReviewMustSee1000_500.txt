		<shortDescription>Potential!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What grabbed me about this movie was the potential it had. There was just so much that could be done with this dynamite idea. That alone made this an essential part of my movie collection.The movie itself is quite average and while worth seeing, isn't going to knock your socks off. The acting is from adequate to good; the effects were well done and quite nicely not overdone.So it's a fantastic idea that wasn't ruined, but isn't spectacular. The actors carry themselves well and this is a worthy addition to any sci-fi collection (especially those who like the idea of alternate history for mankind - See Alien vs. Predator).I normally don't write such quick reviews, but this is what I felt about the movie and I think that much more would give away too much for those who haven't seen it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amazing story...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stargate is a terrific movie that has produced 2 hit TV shows, conventions and fans from all over the world. This movie started it all. I found it in my Uncle's basement and decided to watch it. It has an interesting storyline tying in Ancient Egyptian Mythology to make it even more interesting. It's about a struggling archaeologist with strange ideas about the gods and rulers of Ancient Egypt. Only one person is willing to believe him, and recruits him for a translator. What they find is even more amazing than they expected.It's a highly underrated movie, in my opinion it's better than most sci-fi movies and very interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my Favorite Movies of all Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't understand why this movie is so underrated. I have seen it multiple times, and each time I get something new from it. It is a beautiful work of art (The Director's Cut is also a must-see, because the added scenes elaborate on a few confusing plot points) Now, I would just like to take a moment and talk about the aspects of Stargate that make it an enjoyable, exciting, riveting, and thought-provoking film.First of all, David Arnold has to be recognized for his masterful soundtrack. He should have won some kind of award, like Hans Zimmer won for Gladiator. David Arnold combines themes of romance, adventure, and wonder the likes of which I have never heard. (And believe me, I am an avid fan of movie music, especially Sci-Fi) I am even brave enough to say that his music in Stargate rivals classic, celebrated soundtracks such as Star Wars (John Williams) Next time you see the movie, pay as much attention to David Arnold's music as you pay to the plot. The opening titles themselves are reason enough to rush to the store immediately and buy the soundtrack. My favorite sequence of the soundtrack, by the way, is (#21 Myth, Faith, and Belief) In the movie, this is the scene where Daniel (James Spader) talks to Ra (Jaye Davidson) It is the scene right before the one where Daniel is *almost* forced to kill the soldiers, including Jack O'Neill (Kurt Russell) that he arrived with.Second of all, this is a VERY believable science fiction film. Most films (like Star Wars, Star Trek, and more) don't have very many ways in which they can actually tie-in with reality. Stargate is in itself a theory. It asks: Where did the pyramids come from? How did the Egyptians develop their gods, and how were they influenced? The answer given by the film to these questions is entirely feasible. Even though the gate itself isn't easy to accept, the underlying theme to the movie is. (pay very very close attention to Daniel and the "seminar" he gives about 10 minutes into the movie in front of other scientists)Third, and last, I would like to tip the hat to Jaye Davidson's performance. His portrayal of Ra is chilling.(although some people don't seem to agree) Just hearing him speak and seeing his eyes glow sends shivers up my spine. He makes a perfect villain, and it is truly a shame that he hasn't been in many other movies.This movie receives from me an easy 9 out of 10. It would have gotten a 10 if it were not for the horrible lack of character development. Jack O'Neill is especially bland, although he does seem to brighten up a little bit in the last scene.See the movie! Buy the soundtrack! And I hope you liked my comments!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid Sci-Fi treat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie. It captured my attention quickly and kept it throughout the movie. It's a great ensamble cast and the special effects add to the movie's appeal, rather than BEING the appeal. The premise is engaging, and gives some very plausible explainations for mysteries that have stumped man for thousands of years. The bad guys are just as engagine as the good guys and that makes the movie all that much more enjoyable.I would give this movie an 8 out of 10. It's not perfect, but good for a very enjoyable movie night!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Interesting And Original Idea</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw Stargate in 1996 I thought it was a great movie. It had plenty of action, excitement and special effects but also a brilliant story.James Spader does a wonderful job as Daniel Jackson and ditto for Kurt Russell as Colonel Jack O' Neill. The villains in the movie are very interesting and were a refreshing change to those we usually encounter in movies.This film would probably be of great interest to those interested in Egyptology or anything to do with the ancient world. It is a thought provoking film for fans of ancient history.All in all, a great movie which spawned an equally great TV series three years later.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid, Original Adventure Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stargate's plot, acting, and score all contribute beautifully to the mysterious ambiance that is the essence of this enthralling and suspenseful film. While your disbelief definitely needs to be suspended to cover some inconsistencies, the atmosphere and action of the movie make it worth your while. Not only does Stargate combine science fiction with history, but it weaves them together in a way that remains exciting the entire film, despite major changes of environment. Upon hearing some major elements of the film, one might think that aliens, ancient Egypt, and atomic bombs could only come together in some kind of bizarre montage. However, this film is strongly plot-driven, and while this does make it typical in some respects, the plot itself is remarkable. Hardly artsy, the score is in many places Hollywood-ish, presenting emotion in a straightforward manner, yet it too is enjoyable. None of the acting is spectacular, but this is made up for by the characters' wholesome qualities and ability to change (however slightly) over the course of the movie. To summarize, while nothing in the film is a complete divergence from the standard, it follows the Hollywood style in a manner that is original enough to make a solid and enjoyable adventure. This is the actualization of the potential within the Hollywood film "template": a good story told well in all respects. [9/10]</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>CLASSIC. Without a doubt.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stargate is one of those great movies that hasn't got the respect it deserves. At first I thought the movie was about time travel since they go to a place that is like Ancient Egypt, which didn't really interest me at all. Then I caught an episode of the T.V. show and got curious. When I saw the movie I was blown away. The special effects were ones I had never really seen before (such as opening the Stargate for the first time). I was getting tired of seeing sci-fi movies where every alien race spoke perfect English and I thought I would experience that until the team met with the villagers which I thought was better. It's always cool to see Kurt Russel kicking ass in films. It was also different to see James Spader play the semi-nerdy guy instead of the asshole he mainly plays. I was also amazed when Roland Emmerich chose one of the simplest villains for a movie, an ancient Egyptian god. I watch this movie every week and I never get tired of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic science fiction with its heart in the right place</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Stargate"'s an exciting, high concept science fiction film from Roland ("Independence Day") Emmerich. With a capable cast, solid script and excellent set design, this is a big-budget adventure for viewers looking for pure escapist fun.The ever reliable Kurt Russell plays the square-jawed, world weary Jack O'Neil, who is responsible for leading the military mission to another world. James Spader plays the brilliant archaeologist, Dr. Daniel Jackson. At the time, this was a different type of role for Spader and he handles the humorous content of his scenes with great success.There's also an appearance by "The Crying Game"'s Jaye Davidson as the evil baddie, Ra. Although Davidson's role is quite small, he brings an other-worldly presence to his part.The score by David Arnold is excellent.A great idea for a movie, I can't help but think the concept would have made a successful television series...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stargate the movie :- superb atmosphreric music, great special effects, excellent cast, intriguing story but - not surprised it launched a successful TV series which has run and run. I cant believe there are so called sci fi fans out there who didn't like it - must be intellectuals!!! I still enjoy the film now 1o years later although disappointed they never made a sequel as it was set up for one. Never really liked the ending - should have included the return to earth. The TV series has moved the story along nicely - even changes to the cast have worked well and i particularly enjoy the dry humour of the TV series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A science fiction which is comparable to the best ones...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't quite understand why Stargate got an average point compared to many other science fiction movies. A wild guess that, it is not a US originated one I suppose. If after all those years it is still a pleasure to watch it then why ? A fine story ( believe it or not ), a fine cinematography and a beautiful soundtrack that stacks into your mind. Roland Emmerich is perhaps one of the best directors and the casting is superb.The visual design, artifacts and architecture are well studied. Though the story could be more mysterious and could leave some imagination to the viewer, it is well told.One of my best science fictions ever. Just watch it, you won't regret it. Or even you may come back here and vote it to raise the unbelievably low point which it got, much less then it deserved.Thanks Roland, you're my man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Revolution In Another Part Of The Galaxy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Taking a leaf from Indiana Jones where someone will one day presumably dig up the Ark Of The Covenant out of storage and see how it works, in the inscrutable ways of the Washington bureaucracy, somebody in the Defense Department has taken an interest in something called Stargate and now want to see how it works. The somebody they sent for is archaeologist/linguist James Spader who deciphers some ancient Egyptian writing and poof, the gate is upright and operational.At that point the military takes over led by a hardnosed professional played by Kurt Russell. He's going through that gate with a team of special forces and with James Spader presumably so they can communicate with whatever life is out there.Stargate is a teleportation device and the team travels through time and space and ends up across the galaxy on a primitive planet where the people worship a being called Ra played by Jaye Davidson. He and his much technologically advanced confederates enslave the rest of the population.To see the changes the earth expedition makes and what the connection of this being to the Egyptian sun god Ra you will have to see this very well made and exciting science fiction film, one of the best films made during the Nineties. I saw it in theater when it first came out and seeing it again on the small screen still excites and entertains me. It's one of those films that with repeated viewing you get still another perspective.I liked best the interplay with Kurt Russell and James Spader. Two very opposite men in temperament and in training over the course of the film gradually gain a great respect for each other. Both deliver performances that would rank in the top five for both these players.One of the ways that Ra keeps his people subjugated is the forbidding of any of the nomadic types that are under his thumb to learn to write or even create a written language. In that culture and in every culture, literacy is the strongest weapon against tyranny. In fact one of the characters makes quite a sacrifice to secure the permanence of the revolution they've wrought on this world in another part of the galaxy that has a strange connection to our Earth. Stargate succeeds at being both thinking person's science fiction and also has enough action and adventure to keep you to the edge of your seat, especially in the second half. It's not to be missed when broadcast, ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Old Fashioned ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw STARGATE about seven years ago and left with memories of thinking that it was in some way an old fashioned movie . I couldn't put my finger on why I thought this was an old fashioned movie but after seeing it again tonight I can perhaps explain it better now STARGATE isn't so much as " old fashioned " , it's just got a rather old type of plot that's versatile . It's almost like a Tarzan movie from the 1940s where a bunch of good white guys ( In movies in those days bad guys were usually white - The good guys were always white ) team up with the king of the jungle in order to fight a bunch of evil slave traders . The story could easily be reworked with a bunch of 18th century good guys led by Errol Flynn getting shipwrecked on an island where they meet noble natives and defend them from evil pirates . Rewatching this movie again after a gap of several years I often forgot that I was watching a far fetched SF blockbuster and thought I was watching a historical drama , something that's not to be taken as a criticism . I also became aware of subtle plot points that I'd missed on first viewing . For example I thought the death of O'Neil's son was so underdeveloped that it was totally unnecessary to include this in the movie but there's a couple of scenes where it is important to the plot later on . I also knew that the movie wasn't going to be an ALIENS type of movie , something the original trailers confused me about . let's face it , a special forces team creeping about a dark pyramid . It's got be similar in tone to ALIENS . If that's what you think STARGATE is going to be about you'll be as disappointed as I was first time I saw itOf the cast Kurt Russell and his special forces group are slightly wooden but I won't criticise the cast since these type of characters always lack flair in these genre movies . James Spader is slightly unconvincing as hero Dan Jackson due to wimpish nature and effette hairstyle ( Was Jackson conceived as a female character ? ) but Jaye Davidson is absolutely superb as Ra . This is the same Jaye Davidson from THE CRYING GAME and I was totally shocked to find this was the second and last feature film he appeared in . According to the trivia section of STARGATE it appears he's difficult to work with but someone cast him in more movies pleaseAs for the Roland Emmerich / Dean Devlin partnership there are a few faults . One is the opening of the script that contains no hook and fools the audience into thinking they'll be watching a RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK type movie which they won't be . The script also contains a few unlikely plot holes such as the special forces team taking some GPS equipment with them something that wouldn't work on a planet where humanity had never been , and also discovering in an unlikely scenario that they won't be able to return to Earth thanks to Jackson . There is a very interesting point to the subtext however and that is that if there is a god it doesn't necessarily mean he'll be benign or good . Food for thought . Thankfully Emmerich doesn't go overboard on the CGI while he also had the good sense ( Say it again ) to cast Jaye Davidson as RaBy no means a classic SF movie STARGATE is solid entertainment and is rather more enjoyable on second viewing</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatly made movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the sort of movie that shouldn't had really worked out but yet it did. Everything about this movie screams B-movie. Just look at the title, read the script, see the characters, the cast, etcetera. Yet "Stargate" works out tremendously fine as great and above all fine entertainment. It's for most part due to the fine directing skills of Roland Emmerich, show really knows to uplifts this movie and its story. This movie also really marked the big breakthrough for Roland Emmerich. Yes, it's true that his real breakthrough movie was "Moon 44" and even though that movie was by no means a great one, it still showed that the director had lots of potential and took the maximum out of the movie. So, "Moon 44" got him Hollywood's attention but with "Stargate" he for the first time really proofs that he can handle a multi-million dollar production as well and successfully, since "Universal Soldier" was only a successful movie in certain circles. If it weren't for "Stargate", then now way we would had had movies such as "Independence Day", "The Patriot" and "The Day After Tomorrow". Some people wouldn't had minded that by the way.Even though the story itself is not that much special, it still has a great and original as well as an intriguing concept, that somehow knows to connect an alien world to ancient Egypt and their Gods. It's a great science-fiction story without ever really getting too 'science-fiction' like. It's uses lots of great and imaginative elements.Once you start really thinking about it, there isn't an awful lot happening in this movie, mostly action wise. Yet it's a very entertaining movie to watch, which is due to the fact that it's made with lots of pace and because of it's greatly and perfectly adventurous concept of traveling to a far off planet. It's a movie that never bores and is a perfectly fun one to watch actually. The movie gets also really uplifted by its David Arnold musical score.The movie is fair enough looking. For 1994 standards the special effects are good, especially for the masks worn by the 'Gods'. But because the movie is for most part set in a dessert like environment it's not really one that jumps out in its looks and actually also really doesn't looks and feels like a multi-million dollar production, even though it is. The movie actually looks and feels more cheap, which is also one of the reasons why this movie has already become a sort of a cult-classic.The movie is greatly cast with James Spader and Kurt Russell in the lead roles. But man, did James Spader look still so much different and younger back then. He's just not the kind of person that aged well. He went from a boyish look in 1994 to an old dirty wrinkly man look now days, even though he'll turn only just 48 next month. Also greatly cast was Jaye Davidson as Ra. He's a true memorable villain and it makes you realize what a great shame it is that Jaye Davidson has never acted in many movies, simply just because he never really enjoyed acting much, despite having also received an Oscar nomination for his debut role in "The Crying Game".Truly a recommendable science-fiction classic from the '90's.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost Twenty Years Later and after Watching at Least Six Times, the Timeless "Stargate" is still a Fantastic Sci-Fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1928, in Egypt, a strange device is found by an expedition. In the present days, the outcast linguist Dr. Daniel Jackson (James Spader) is invited by a mysterious woman to decipher an ancient hieroglyph in a military facility. Soon he finds that the device was developed by an advanced civilization and opens a portal to teletransport to another planet. Dr. Jackson is invited to join a military team under the command of Colonel Jonathan 'Jack' O'Neil (Kurt Russell) that will explore the new world. They find a land that recalls Egypt and humans in a primitive culture that worship and are slaves to Ra, the God of the Sun. But soon they discover the secret of the mysterious "stargate". "Stargate" is still a fantastic sci-fi after almost twenty years and watching it at least six times. The story is intriguing and entwines action with humor and romance. The cast is excellent, with Kurt Russell and James Spade in the top of their careers. The special effects are still great after almost twenty years. And the haunting music score completes this timeless classic sci-fi with a touch of class. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): "Stargate - A Chave para o Futuro da Humanidade" ("Stargate ? The Key for the Future of Mankind")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why didn't they just show the first 20 minutes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first twenty minutes of this movie were extremely promising. Then the whole thing fell apart and seemed like a 'prequel' to 'Independence Day'. I would like to thank our Swedish contributor. I don't speak Swedish and thought that the language used was another 'made up' language that is used in 'alien' films. It's most annoying that these languages are always spoken in sharp, short bursts which have no flow. Why Swedish? If one is going to use an alien language, just make it up or find a language which is less-known. Viveca Lindfors was sadly wasted as were the other actors in the beginning of the film. They just disappeared. I would have much rather seen a movie about Lindfors life from the first discovery of the Stargate. I wonder if she was the Swedish coach? The premise was interesting but the behavior on the 'parallel' world was ridiculous. The cliches flew quick and fast. James Spaders falls in love with dusky native maiden. How many times has this 'instant cross cultural love' been used? What is really offensive about this plot device is that 99% of the time, it's always a white MALE who gets the 'native'.The other cliches were just as bad. When a problem can't be solved, the Americans 'get out the guns'. Guns solve everything. (I am an American.) Jaye Davidson was very good in 'The Crying Game', but his character in 'Stargate' was as weak as the plot and gave no sense of the immense power he was supposed to wield. James Spader was, in my opinion, playing the 'cliche' genius, with a lot of little 'absent-minded' mannerisms which were supposed to make him 'cute'. I didn't mind his hair. Kurt Russell was another cliche. The way to bring him back from a deep and suicidal depression was to send him out on a mission.Then he gets to kill a lot of people, which makes him feel much better. Something that the army would never risk. In the process,he finds a surrogate son in the Bedouin boy. Give us a break!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Passable sci-fi but only if you can swallow the silly plot, bad dialogue and average action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With his 'crazy' views on the origin of the pyramids and his great intellect, Dr Daniel Jackson is the natural choice to join a team looking into the mysterious of a collection of stone tablets that had been uncovered many decades ago. Within a few days Jackson has cracked it and is soon introduced to the true mystery of the whole project ? that of a metallic portal covered with the same symbols and hieroglyphics. Activating it under the watchful eye of the military, Daniel sees the gate open to somewhere else. Joining the group going through the portal, Daniel finds a world like Egypt, full of peaceful people worshiping the sungod Ra. Things go great for a while until, that is, Ra shows up.Having now spawned two TV spin off series (neither of which I have ever bothered with) I suppose this film might have gained a bit of respect looking back on it as the starting point for a relatively successful franchise, but this does not mean that the film has suddenly become a wonderful piece of action sci-fi ? cause it ain't! The plot is silly from the very start and never manages to get over this ? any film that has to have the main character use his dialogue to spell everything out to the audience is on a hiding to nothing from the get-go, and so it is here. Jackson manages to solve the decades old riddle in a day or two, then goes along, then discovers etc etc. All the way the film tries to cover this weakness but it has too many dull moments to really cover it all up. The action is OK but without a decent plot to engage the audience it is really nothing but noisy special effects ? effects that, may I say, have not dated well at all in the past decade.The cast try hard but even James Spader struggles to buy into the idea of him as an action star; he appears to be laughing at the script at times in the early scenes! Russell is cool and has a tough presence but he is lumbered with a poor character who has a lazy 'dead son' thing put on him that he cannot use at all. Jaye 'Crying Game' Davidson makes little or no impression at all and, looking back, is actually less interesting than his own bodyguards! The support cast are all nondescript actors in poorly written roles and few can do anything with their material.Overall this is a fairly average film that makes for passable entertainment but certainly no more than that. The plot is poor and the dialogue is written to match. The action is noisy but uninspiring throughout and the cast simply run around spouting drivel. Not totally worthless but you need to be in a pretty undemanding mood to get any significant value out of this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stargate starts in 1928 in Giza where an archaeological dig uncovers an alien Stargate used to travel between worlds. Jump forward to the 'Present Day' where Egyptologist Dr. Daniel Jackson (James Spader) has radical theories that the Pyramids weren't constructed by the Egyptians, he is contacted by Catherine Langford (Viveca Lindfors) &amp; given the opportunity to prove his theories. Langford takes Jackson to an underground Military facility where no-one has been able to work out how to operate the mysterious Stargate, within a couple of weeks Jackson has it all figured out. A mission is undertaken to travel through the Stargate to a distant planet &amp; investigate the alien world on the other side...This French American co-production was co-written &amp; directed by Roland Emmerich &amp; is a fine sci-fi adventure film that holds up very well even when viewed today nearly fifteen years after it was made which is a feat in itself since a lot of sci-fi dates badly very quickly. Originally the rough cut for Stargate was apparently three hours long, it was eventually released into theatres at two hours long &amp; has subsequently been released in a 'Director's Cut' that adds about ten more minutes to the theatrical cut, having said that I will be basing my comments on the original two hour theatrical version. The script by Emmerich &amp; producer Dean Devlin bases itself on the idea that an alien visited Earth &amp; formed our society &amp; Egypt is a reflection of those aliens, it's a reasonable idea although since the alien planet looks like a desert with Egyptian Pyramids &amp; human beings as it's inhabitants it sometimes feels like Stargate is set on Earth rather than some distant planet on the edge of the known Universe. The story starts off intriguing enough &amp; it's a very watchable &amp; overall enjoyable film but at two hours in length it does drag at times &amp; I wasn't keen on the rebellious slave uprising at the end, it just felt rather clichéd &amp; predictable. The character's are alright &amp; it's refreshing to see an alien planet where the aliens don't speak English, while this maybe authentic you can see why most sci-fi films don't go down this route since lots of alien dialogue without knowing what they are saying does tend to get a bit tedious, I certainly wouldn't want to watch many films where half the dialogue spoken is quite literally alien although having said that towards the end the dialogue starts to be subtitled.Director Emmerich is no stranger to the big budget special effects laden blockbuster &amp; would go on to make films such as Independence Day (1992), Godzilla (1998) &amp; The Day After Tomrrow (2004). Stargate was his second 'big' film after the rather good Jean-Claude Van Damme action sci-fi film Universal Solider (1992), Stargate certainly looks nice enough from the bright sunshine of the desert planet to the dark grey interiors of the evil aliens spaceship. The special effects are generally very good, made before a time CGI computer effects were used for everything Stargate has a mixture of CGI, model work &amp; on set effects which all blend together to make for a convincing alien world. The huge Pyramid spaceship in particular looks very impressive. Apparently conceived by Emmerich during film school in 1979 both he &amp; Devlin were sued by someone who alleged they stole the story from him, the case was settled out of court.With a supposed budget of about $55,000,000 Stargate was a well funded film &amp; it show's with a real sense of scope &amp; scale, it also has that polished Hollywood feel although the scene at the end where Daniel &amp; the girl are transported back down into the Pyramid is very poorly edited &amp; it is actually quite difficult to make out what's happening. Apparently filmed in California &amp; Arizona. The acting is good, I have always liked Kurt Russell but don't consider this to be one of his best films as he gives a largely cold &amp; detached performance &amp; only really becomes the action hero for the last fifteen minutes while Spader is likable enough as the geeky hero.Stargate is a good solid sci-fi film that doesn't quite reach the heights of greatness due to it's length, a lot of pointless dialogue scenes with aliens who you can't understand &amp; I didn't really like the constant bland desert setting that much. Followed by the popular American Canadian TV series Stargate SG-1 (1997 - 2007) which ran for ten seasons &amp; two hundred &amp; thirteen episodes which itself spawned another TV series Stargate: Atlantis (2004) which is still running now &amp; the less than popular Stargate: Infinity (2002) which ran for a single solitary season.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I felt Stargate was an excellent movie with great character performances/interactions. I enjoyed the interplay between O'neil (K. Russel) &amp; Skara and between Daniel (J. Spader) &amp; Sh'auri. I think Russel did a great job as this character given that O'neil's son had died (accidently) using O'neil's own gun {thus O'neil blaming himself} &amp; the fact that his mission was a one way suicide mission from the start{him no doubt a volunteer}. I felt O'neil's overall gloominess/glumness [given the above] were portrayed excellently by K. Russell in this regard. I also enjoyed Spader's role as the friendly &amp; scholarly "dweeb" Daniel and getting Sh'auri in the end {mostly through his own blundering than anything else}. I enjoyed Stargate immensely and would recommend this movie highly to anyone considering renting/viewing it. I enjoy the series SG1 and Atlantis too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>STARGATE should be the perfect movie for me: an interesting premise, grounded in real-life theory (I've been reading Graham Hancock's FINGERPRINTS OF THE GODS recently, and am familiar with Von Daniken's writings) and made with a high enough budget to do the special effects justice.And watching it, it's hard to fault the production. The performances are pretty good, from Kurt Russell's hard-ass soldier to James Spader's nerdy Egyptologist, and the aforementioned SFX are decent. It's just that the film ends up feeling relatively mundane given the extensive set-up; it all turns into an entirely typical good guys vs. the bad guys type film, with little of the intelligence or thought-provoking questions I was hoping for.I'll lay the blame squarely at the door of Roland Emmerich, who has quite the habit of dumbing down his source material (INDEPENDENCE DAY, GODZILLA, need I go on?). Imagine if this had been made by somebody with more interest in the questions raised instead of the size of the guns!</fullReview>

The movie is from 1994 but you'll see good transformations from for example the guards ho can let their helmets disappear in view seconds by pushing a button. The story is about a gate from the past, refound and rebuild. Standing by the military. They discover how it works an can go through the stargate to a world that is on the very end of our wellknown galaxy. There are other people with a (what they think) evil god Ra.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Stargate that is open to new ideas.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Science fiction meets mythological history meets action and adventure. This is the better movie to come from Roland Emmerich's directional heritage, with the Lazarus theme running through Universal Soldier (1992), and the portly extravagance of Independence Day (1996), to the average sized Godzilla (1998), and to the sublime 2004 movie that centres on Earth's final days The Day After Tomorrow.Where The Day After Tomorrow concentrates on the Earths future demise, Stargate on the other hand goes further back, some 10,000 years back, into Egyptian myth and legend, and their cover-up of an alien being that once came to this planet to take its inhabitants for slaves, not by means of ships, but by the use of teleportation. The method of travelling to the ends of the universe, instantly, a quantum leap, from one space to another, as simply walking from one room into another, this is the evil purpose of the Stargate, a tool to transport humans across the galaxy, toward a life of slavery and death.Now, in the present day, and for eons past, the Stargate has been hidden, forgotten, and buried, as time has progressed and histories have come and gone throughout the ages; the Stargate has once more been unearthed. In the hands of the military, this portal, this unique tool, this mysterious device shall once more regenerate and transport those to new and wondrous worlds, those who now share its secret. Led by Col. Jonathan 'Jack' O'Neil (Kurt Russell), he, his team and Dr. Daniel Jackson (James Spade), scientist and Egyptologist, have crossed the boundaries of time and space. These modern-day voyagers' have naively stumbled across the Kingdom of the ancient god Ra. An intelligent, cunning and malevolent aging creature that for centuries has explored the universe, exploiting all he grasps, using the bodies of his people, his slaves, his humans, to regenerate himself over and over to receive eternal life. And so the conflict between Man and the deadly demigod Ra begins, the Stargate is where it began, and with the Stargate, it shall end.Stargate is an interesting flavour of visual delight. Karl Walter Lindenlaub's cinematography and visual effects of the vast deserts and tribal communities that populate this three-mooned planet has us in a sweat quicker than a turkey at Thanksgiving. With a hint of arousal, a touch of depth, and a little pinch of tone and meaningful tenderness, Stargate, at the hands of Walter Lindenlaub has this movie cooked at exactly the correct temperament and texture that many first class cinemas would care to serve. While Stargate wins outright in the visual sense, what lets it down, a little, is its somewhat two-dimensional characters, they seem more reinvented parodies of this sci-fi genre than newcomers to this new world of adventure, the all American war hero, with his cool and impenetrable demeanour, even down to the most ridiculous haircut ever seen. The inexcusable government scientists that insist on wearing wool sweaters that even a charity shop would have trouble selling. Plus their seemingly inept competence at solving simple equations over a three-year period, that has Dr. Daniel Jackson solving within three weeks of his arrival, just a tiny clichéd, but not that important, and not too distracting either, to the narrative.English composer David Arnold, whose work on Casino Royale (2006), Hot Fuzz (2007), the "Little Britain" British television comedy series and the "Stargate SG-1" American T.V. series to name a few, does bring Stargate out of the dark and with it a shining example in what can be an uplifting, exciting and rewarding companion to Walter Lindenlaub vision. Any wonder then that these two professionals, including Stargate's director, have also worked on numerous projects together beforehand.Stargate, the 1994 original movie, has in perspective, been a huge success, not just because of its thrill ride at the worlds cinemas. Here, we have many T.V. spin-off's Stargate SG-1, Stargate: Atlantis, Stargate SG-1: Children of the Gods, Stargate Atlantis: Rising etc, etc, some T.V. shows even producing spin-off's themselves. This is classic Saturday morning T.V. sci-fi fodder, as in the styles of nineteen fifties sci-fi, such as Captain Video and His Video Rangers, Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers. To bring it further up the evolutional ladder, the nineteen sixties gave us Doctor Who and Star Trek. Now, as we enter the new millennium, Stargate and its offspring are entertaining us in front of our television sets. An easygoing default movie that really does contain great visuals and a real sense of adventure that even the children of nineteen fifties and sixties television would not disagree.Sci-Fi is universal as it transcends across the barriers of time for each new generation, that is why Stargate will, and has, lead the way for the next generation.</fullReview>

What also is very special about it is it good balance of effects, realism, acting, story, adventure and action. It just looks so much more realistic then all the other scifi movies these days with all their overloaded special effects. Also i think that this is one of James Spaders best acting performances, at least i liked him in this role most compared to his other performances i saw of him. I really miss scifi movies with such kind of quality, yeah it really makes me sad and this is why this movie is really a masterpiece for its own. I really love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit standard, but a very decent concept to a great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I just want to say that I had never heard of this film before... until the past summer when I was at summer camp when I watched it on a VHS copy. I also heard that this was made the same year I was born and this was made by the same guy who directed Independence Day, Godzilla, and the later film 2012. I watched it because I wanted to see if it would keep me very interested. It did after my first viewing and I personally like it as much as those who gave it a positive feedback. Sure, some of the characters may be unengaging and the story, despite it's decent concept, does have some plot holes and I would've like to see more of the romance between the two characters. Those flaws didn't really bother me at all and I think that this is Roland Emmerich's best film next to Independence Day and The Patriot.The acting on the whole is pretty good especially Kurt Russell and James Spader who had great chemistry together throughout the film. The directing from Roland Emmerich is pretty good and focused, the pacing moves along very nicely, but would've been fifteen minutes longer at the end of the film. The strongest aspects, however, goes to it's compelling visuals and it's epic music score from David Arnold. The look of the Egyptian world along with some nice costume designs is fabulous. David Arnold's music score doesn't have a sci-fi tone to it, but it does have a memorable tune which gives the movie an epic sweep to it. It also has some good dialog especially it's nice moments with the main character and the villain who is quite menacing.Stargate does have a hokey concept, but I don't understand why some people hated it because I think that this is an interesting film and I simply understood that it got a cult following over the years. It isn't perfect, but it's completely watchable to those who haven't seen it yet. So, in my opinion, this deserves a 4/5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A live action version of Disneys Atlantis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is amazing how similar films can be when it comes to plot, predictability, and story line. I liked the direction Roland Emmerich put into the film and screenplay but it felt like there were some areas that were not carefully scanned over thoroughly. There were several things I enjoyed during the running time of Stargate, but there were some drawbacks that should have been addressed at the same time.Stargate is the story of linguist Dr. Daniel Jackson (James Spader) who is on the verge of finding the truth behind the great pyramids of Egypt. Of course, no one believes him, until he is given a special offer that will allow him to prove his theory. Hmmmm....already, from there it sounds like the story of Milo James Thatch from Atlantis: The Lost Empire (2001). Accompanying Dr. Jackson is Colonel Jack O'Neil played by veteran actor Kurt Russell. At first O'Neil is one of those silent characters who is difficult to communicate with but he opens up later on. Thankfully, Russell doesn't play stone-faced the whole time like Todd from Soldier (1998).Along with these two actors, the rest of the acting is presentable. The special effects are average. Nothings amazing nor does it seem really cheap looking so there's nothing to critique there. Looking back on them, they were standard for their time. As the plot continues, Jackson's' group of followers run into distant humans in a far away galaxy. It is there that Spader's character falls in love with the leader's daughter, Sha'uri (Mili Avital), who I will say, looks great. I did like the love story but it left me wanting to see more that it showed.Again this specific plot device runs practically parallel to that of Disney's Atlantis. The difference is that Disney's was more entertaining and with characters that had more personality to them. Sure, Spader played a great nerd and Russell was good as depressed individual (at first), but having a boatload of characters with different accents is much more fun to listen and watch on screen. I also liked the themes that were played in David Arnold's soundtrack. It may not have had sci- fi feel to it, but it did have a memorable tune. In some ways, it bordered on the edge of John Williams but obviously not as epic sounding.Stargate is the film that pushed director Roland Emmerich to the pinnacle of success but the characters within the story lack heart. However, it is supported by a good music and acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Director's DVD comments confirm suspicions.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first part of SG is great stuff, and the music is A+. Heck, I bought the DVD! But once the team hits the desert planet it descends into a lame Lawrence of Arabia rip-off, with many aspects borrowed from better films. In the director' halting voice-over (..sort of..like..you know..) he reveals his fascination with the native people, and the kids, and making them likable, etc etc. Worst part of the movie for me, and he complains that many desert scenes he was forced to cut. I can see where producers, seeing the rough cut, would be concerned. Many plot holes here as well, and the director reveals that they had to make a major change at the tail end of shooting- probably at the urging of the producers. The most glaring plot hole is that you have a 10,000 year old godlike being with omniscient powers who has the Stargate technology to go anywhere in the universe, but he hangs out in a stark spaceship that looks like a Egyptian tomb. Why wouldn't he find the most pleasant planet in existence, and set up a personal garden of Eden, and to hell with the pyramid ship (a dorky and contrived device)? On a technical side, the key dialog between Spader and the God being are subtitled. The director wanted things to be authentic, but it just makes the movie confusing. The take home lesson is that desert cultures and outer space Sci-fi do not go hand-in hand. Remember, Luke Skywalker got the hell off his desert planet as fast as he could. SG wallows in one-to its detriment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gravely underrated movie, that spawned a great franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even if you're not a fan of the Stargate series, this is an exiting Sci-Fi film, with a never tried before idea. Unlike most Science fiction were the characters have to travel around in spacecrafts, in this film they simply step through a wormhole, and saves us the time often spent in other films on space-travel and brings us straight to the action.Another intriguing part of the film is that it is based on the "aliens built the pyramids" idea, which to my knowledge has never been done before. it also takes place in the present day (well 1994) and the main characters consist mostly by military officers from the US Airforce.Personally I'm a fan of the TV series Stargate SG-1 and I prefer Anderson and Shanks in the main roles, but I can't deny that Kurt Russel and James Spader gave us a strong performance and set the basis for the characters of Jack O'Neill and Daniel Jackson.Another great thing is that the film has spawned three spin off series: Stargate SG-1 with the same characters (not same actors, except Skara and Kasuf) Stargate Atlantis and the newest edition Stargate Universe. The Stargate franchise has already started to reach the same size and popularity as even Star Trek or Battlestar Galactica.So for all of you who have just seen this film and liked it, I advice you to take a look into the TV series. Start with Stargate SG-1 the children of the gods, I can assure you'll love it and will want to see more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not many people know this yet, but I'm writing the next Emmerich film. Yes. It's going to have a lead who's a dorky, socially awkward, extremely smart yet ignored scientist of some field that will relate to the plot, which will be something big, requiring a lot of costumed extras and loud special effects, and be set or deal with something fantastic that isn't that closely linked to reality. Seriously though, for using the same basic formula, his flicks tend to be fun and enjoyable escapism. Plus, this marks the possibly unique occasion of James Spader not(!) playing the role of a sexual deviant in the movie he's in. I guess he wanted to branch out. Russell, as expected, nails his part as the hardened military man who does have a heart, and in general the acting is great. The story is interesting enough, and it develops fine throughout. Pacing is good, and this does notably not overwhelm or overstimulate the audience, in spite of presenting a world that we can't directly relate to. Stephen Sommers, are you paying attention? The FX are excellent. This is exciting, entertaining and cool. The action is awesome and not excessive. As for music, this uses a broad, sweeping score, and that works well. The humor is reasonable, the jokes and gags are hit and miss. There is infrequent mild to moderately strong language and a little violence and one or two hints towards sexuality in this. I recommend this to any and all fans of those who made it, particularly Roland. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great premise, slightly flawed execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stargate's central idea isn't entirely original - aliens interfering with human culture in the past being mistaken for gods - but it is handled with finesse. Spader's Daniel Jackson is quite endearing, if a little too "movie smart," while Russell's O'Neil is an interesting, if cliched and slight, attempt to put a spin on the dedicated old soldier standard. Ra, when we finally meet him, is a sight to behold; never has such a feminine young man been so imposing.The sets, costumes and effects perfectly capture the feel of the film; Abydos (the planet at the other end of the Stargate) might look like Egypt, but there's something about it that makes it much more distant than another continent.The only thing which really mars the film are its occasional descents into kitsch, including one of the death scenes later in the film, reduced to silliness by careless use of extreme cliche. While these moments are, thankfully, fairly well spaced, some of the dialogue also contributes, as do a couple of plot holes.But still, Stargate is good solid fun with a bit more thought behind it than usual, and it's a great foundation for the television series that followed - and improved - on the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not JUST that I like all that Ancient Egyptian kitsch. Pyramids, sand, big square rocks, dead languages ... there's also your usual Star Wars style technology, which is equally hard to dislike ... and then there's that creature. It's cute. You know the one I mean: that gentle, extra-large buffalo thing with big horns. If they'd made `Stargate' today, that thing would have been computer animated, and it wouldn't have been nearly so real or so adorable.Okay. Just so you'll know that I'm AWARE how silly `Stargate' is, there's two comments I'd like to get off my chest before I start saying nice things:(1) I don't care how much Daniel knows about dead languages, he can't know what Egyptian speech sounded like - and in any event, it's been several THOUSAND years! Take a Chinese scholar, give him a brief whiff of British speech from a thousand years before the Romans arrive, and then plonk him down in modern-day London. Would he understand a single word spoken by anyone? Of course not.(2) Devlin and Emmerich have a strange idea of academic conferences - they must think that people go to them only to heckle. Daniel never even got a chance to mention the whacko part of his theory; he was drowned out in a chorus of Pshaws almost before he drew his first breath. I'm surprised the audience didn't consist of people with big white walrus moustaches, drinking port.Well, I can forgive a few things like this. Lowering the linguistic barriers I can forgive as a plot device (that could, admittedly have been better handled), and ... well, the whole aliens-built-the-pyramids thing is absurd anyway, and Emmerich comes reasonably close to hitting the right tone to pull it off with some grace. There's poetry in the Stargate scenario. Doggerel poetry, but poetry nonetheless. It's a good job so much of the action takes place on another world. Had Devlin and Emmerich stayed on Earth for too long them I'm sure that, one way or another, they would have turned `Stargate' into the kind of bloated horror that `Independence Day' was (and that `Godzilla' was as well, so I hear). But there's nothing really wrong with the basic story and the clichés - although they ARE weakening - are all forgivable. Besides, the mere look of the film will inspire affection.</fullReview>

While Star Trak is set in space, and deals more of racial sub topics and is more of a political drama based show/ movies. Stargate deals with other planets and Earth, not much in space. and it focus on ancient religion and believes of help from other beings.The story of the rings being used as gate way travel to distant worlds is pretty Awesome, and the film is also very smart on how they achieve communication between all the different species by having them all have some ancient language in common as they all have ancient gods who they fear or believe in.This is an incredibly awesome film, with some really cool action scenes, very well written dialogue and really great acting from Kurt Russell and James Spader</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's 1928 in Giza, Egypt. An archaeological dig unearths the Stargate. In the present, Dr. Daniel Jackson (James Spader) is an ancient Egypt expert but his theory is dismissed by everybody. Catherine Langford offers him an opportunity to prove his work. He is brought to an underground base in Creek Mountain, Colorado. Col. Jack O'Neil (Kurt Russell) is the new military commander of the mission. He is suicidal after his son accidentally shots himself and is the perfect man for the job. Daniel assures them that he can dial a return and Jack leads a team to explore the world at the other side of the universe. It is a world ruled by the mercurial dictator Ra (Jaye Davidson).There are a lot of little problems with this movie. There are little logic problems all over the place. However the basic concept of the movie is so cool. James Spader is terrific as the odd science guy. He has his weird Spaderness and is actually slightly funny. Roland Emmerich overcomes any little hiccups with a rip roaring sci-fi that's a little bit campy. Jaye Davidson only adds to that campiness. The CGI and the action needs a little work. The battles could be better but the design is all there. It's simply a fun sci-fi.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie I've avoided for 20 years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a Stargate SG-1 and Atlantis TV series fan you would think I would have watched this movie long ago. For some reason I didn't think the movie was tightly coupled with the series and I avoided watching it based on a bad preview seen many years ago. I finally forced myself to give it a chance after all this time and was pleasantly surprised to find one of the best Sci-Fi movies I had never seen. The movie is the foundation for the SG-1 show (duh) and ties directly into the first season of the show. The big screen special affects made for a thrilling ride and for once the SG team when combined with the indigenous people represented a sufficient force for an uprising against a foe with more advanced technology. Nice to not have a mother ship carrying 40 times the number of fighters than possible to making the fight a winnable one. So as it came down to the end when the people rise up against RA and they clear the way for the team to beam the bomb onto the ship and blow it to pieces it may have been a familiar story, but with many important differences. RA's forces were not overwhelming so that their being free to get to the bomb/stargate was believable. RA was a kid with the arrogance of 1000's of years experience kicking mankind's rear so it seamed feasible that he would see no threat in the small team. Also nice that being a techno thief of more advanced technologies he would understand what a nuclear weapon was. Overall a good story laying a good foundation for the series. Nice to see the dork version of Dr. Jackson fumbling around with how to speak a dead language instead of just walking up and being fluent in ancient Egyptian making for a more realistic backdrop to the whole story. There were gaps in the story as a movie, but with it being the basis for a TV Series those gaps were perfect so the series had questions to answer and a reason for SG-1 to need to start up and follow up on what happened 10 years earlier given the chance. Quite simply a very pleasant surprise of a movie that after watching 10 seasons of SG-1 and 5 of Atlantis filled in some blanks with the force of a big screen movie that stands on it's own as good entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stargate is a great movie that I do not think is being given the respect it deserves among movie goers and movie fans in general, but especially among science fiction and fantasy fans. Within the genre it is a great work.I know that the subsequent series, especially the animated series and the most successful series (Stargate-SG1, also the first series to follow this original movie) are not nearly as serious as the tone set in this movie.But this movie itself is very good. I think it is a very original concept, the cast is great (Spader and Russell are awesome!) and it has great action and a great story.What more could you ask for?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stargate is a great sci fi series. Most sci fi shows in the last couple decades have all been rehashes of stuff that has already come around or just remakes and reboots like all the different Star Trek spinoffs and ripoffs. Stargate was a new idea with a fabulous new way to travel between worlds or maybe even time, it is not clear until the end of the story exactly what was happening and that is a great thing about it, it is not predictable at all. Russell and Spader are great in this movie. It of course spawned spin off series SG-1 and Atlantis and the latest series in the universe which unfortunately ended on a cliffhanger. Hopefully they will revisit this world and story some more with future projects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice science-fiction entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stargate is, as far as I'm concerned, better than the original TV series, which I've watched a couple of time without really getting interested, but then I'm not a fan.The good. Very imaginative settings and alien technology. Beautiful photography. Nicely paced scenario. Interesting story with a solid background.The actors. Kurt Russell is right in his element, and didn't need to show the limits of his short acting range. James Spader is the most interesting character, and plays it well. Mili Avital is pretty, innocent, and plays her sweet role really nicely. Erick Avari, though, is my favorite of the cast and offers us a very convincing performance as the primitive priest-leader faced with powerful strangers. And finally, you can see some of the antics of French Stewart.The bad. Very low army credibility. The intro village miniature is of poor quality. The special effects are getting a bit old, but they were done in such a way as to minimize the aging and still be well received these days.The ugly. That desert beast puppet is just terrible. The chevrons are flimsy.The result. Good entertainment, recommended to sci-fi fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Colonel O'Neil, why are you here?""I am here in case you succeed."This is the story of the most important discovery man has ever made: the gateway to heaven (and back, hopefully).The movie starts with the introduction of the main characters - obviously enough - and of the main plot. It is the most absolutely fantastic introduction, and the opening credits are captivating, featuring some of the most stunning and iconic art work and musical scores ever created. The story moves fast, there is almost no time wasted, the scenery is great, the premise is intriguing and all the elements for a great movie are there.Alas, as the story progresses past the Stargate itself, the story turns from great to... well... not so great and it loses some of it's appeal but that is OK, because it is obvious that the story was targeted at a younger audience and when I first saw the movie, it was just mind blowing.The actors do a good job, mostly. Kurt Russel is the tough military guy with the ridiculous haircut, James Spader is the cute, brilliant but clueless geek, and the rest are either boring, cliché or not important (Mili Avital is cute, though). There are also some unfortunate choices, which spoil and ruin the feel of the movie, a little.The image is great, the sets are fantastic (well... except for the village of the damned which is... less than fantastic). The music is brilliant, the fight scenes are dumb and... that's it! Oh, wait, there are special effects too, and they are great, really great.Stargate. A good movie that would have been a lot better, if not for some unfortunate choices - and the Stargate series proves that conclusively. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The plot draws on our long standing fascination with Egypt and Aliens, and presents a reasonably plausible explanation surrounding the mysteries of both by suggesting that, indeed, Egypt's past was attributable to the intervention of an alien race, and the artifact found buried in the Egyptian sand is the answer to how it was done.The "hero", Dr Daniel Jackson played by James Spader, doesn't, for my money, come off as a brilliant history professor, whereas Kurt Russell plays well the role of the suicidally depressed Col. Jonathan O'Neil, who discovers there's still life after loss. Jaye Davidson in the role of Ra, is also memorable.Generally, the movie makes a brisk pace throughout, and there's a good mix of action, suspense and drama, none of it particularly exciting however, and the outcome is, as with most Hollywood Vs Aliens movies, entirely unsurprising.There are, as usual, one or two moments which, even considering the nature of the subject matter, stretch the imagination somewhat; for instance where the brilliant Dr Daniel Jackson, after being headhunted by the most eminent Egyptologists in the World to decipher the mysterious and apparently undecipherable hieroglyphics, casts a cursory eye across the runes and declares "There you go." to the utter amazement of all in attendance. Another being when Dr Daniel Jackson figures out that the last hieroglyph in the sequence used to switch the Stargate on just happens to be "that one there" (something which, apparently, couldn't have been discovered by a simple process of elimination in the 80 years since its discovery).Still, perhaps that kind of pickiness isn't in everybody.Overall, if you're looking for a piece of entertainment which doesn't require too much effort, I'd recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When scientists and historians finally figure out the meaning of an ancient Egyptian artifact, it opens a portal to another planet.Stargate was panned by the critics on its release, no A list stars they cried, a plot line that bore a resemblance to a 1970 film called Erinnerungen an die Zukunft, and apparently caught between being an adult picture and a child friendly blockbuster. Those critics were forced to eat their words as Stargate promptly went on to be a monster smash, making $196,567,262 worldwide, and spawning a hugely popular TV series. It is for sure a no brain popcorn piece, suspension of disbelief should be at the forefront of any prospective first time viewer, but it's great fun and snazzy in all its set piece work.Led by square jawed Kurt Russell as an on the edge Colonel, our band of merry men adventurers face peril in their new world via the weather, language barriers with the locals, oh and something a touch more sinister!. James Spader does an impressive turn as a geeky Egyptologist, on who's fate the groups survival may well rest, while Jaye Davidson serves a reminder that yes, he did act in movies many years ago. It's cliché ridden, and most of it is hacked together from far better pictures in the genres that Stargate wants to emulate, but it's dam entertaining and looks fabulous in High Definition. 7/10</fullReview>

Anderson added far to much comedy to the show he was to much of a Mcgyver rather than somebody who belonged in the military. The presence of the Ra was awesome it gives you something to think about especially with spader's presence and theory's in the beginning of film about pyramids and all. One thing I have to admit is that i wasn't really expecting a whole lot from this movie as i just saw it recently and was expecting it to be so much like the television show i thank god it wasn't. If you are a true sci-fi fan or even just an action fan this is o0ne that I would recommend in a heartbeat.

		<shortDescription>Great premise, no disappointments, but no "wow" moments either</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stargate is an incredibly easy movie to recommend.The overall premise is great fun (may contain minor spoilers): The ancient Pyramids may have been built by aliens. The US gov't is in possession of 'the stargate' (found decades earlier but a complete mystery until now) and may be able to activate it. What will we find on the other side? There aren't really any missteps in the movie: no over-the-top effects, exaggerated performances, bad lines, drawn out back-story, etc etc. The movie moves from point A to point B with confidence, without wasting any time or rushing ahead either. It's an even-handed movie where you're always interested in what's happening right now. Characters are believable and multi-dimensional but established quickly. This is not a character-driven movie; instead, your attention is held because you want to know what will happen with the stargate itself.There aren't any mind-blowing scenes or twists either. It's always good but never great. It comes down to this: the idea behind Stargate is an extremely entertaining one, and they never screw it up. What's not to like?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was a movie panned by critics; it was the first movie to launch an official website and one of the many films featuring the bad-ass Kurt Russell playing a character that would later be a cult character in both movie and TV history (a show was made in 1997).Stargate is a time travel movie about a doomed archaeologist (James Spader) who gets a call from an old lady that tells him about this discovery where a portal can take communicate with other dimensions. After figuring out the codes in the hieroglyphics on the machine, Dr. Jackson (Spader) along with Col. Jack O'Neill (Kurt Russell), the military and scientist see that maybe there's a chance to see what's on the other side. O'Neill and Jackson go in with a group of marines and discover that they're part of the other dimension where it resembles Egypt with a god by the name of Ra who comes to hurt the civilians where it's just a matter of time before the expedition team becomes extinct if not finding their way home.The film itself is a bad-ass movie where science fiction fans and those who follow Egyptian history will be surprise that mixing certain elements can make people watch a flick without being disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That Sexy Alien</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Actually I didn't find this movie amusing, all my attention was absorbed into the actor who played that alien Ra. Not because his previous role in that outstanding riveting drama thriller "The Crying Game", but of all this bullshit subject about alien possessed a human body and turn him into sexy creature then left a gate that could transfer things into the universe, he is the only one who seemed visible and made the movie is worth watching. Even that great pyramid flying saucer couldn't compete with his many sexy angles.Wonder if the director or the scriptwriter were surprised at that moment by the sight of that sexy character and found him more beautiful than Cleopatra. So they got confused and totally forgot their previous plans or what(?)...and brought this movie into disaster! See today science fictions or thrillers that more or less were influenced by that sexy character with their beautiful black women (or they thought beautiful), that were curved, mold and formed into roles that were quite similar with that sexy character.With only one cattle picked from novel 'Alien vs Predator' (1989), then shared the rest of the elements in the novel with another science fiction movies. Sigh.... What a pity.But really cool, though. That role must be intended for that sexy character, and that works for me, with led me to wander that this movie actually was made for him. And in the end he was blasted by nuclear bomb. That's cool. Nuke that sexy character and make him/her a legend. Cool!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stargate (the Movie) regrettably falls into the category of what I call "Gung Ho" films: "Send our boys against those gol-darn aliens and we'll give 'em what for!" The story starts out with some promise. Dr. Daniel Jackson (James Spader) is an down-and-out archaeologist who's trying to persuade the academic community that the pyramids and the Sphinx are much older than they appear. Regrettably, he's never learned the art of tact, and callously slays sacred cows by calling into question the findings of accredited historians while offering little substance of his own. While leaving the lecture hall (which has emptied of his entire audience) he gets an invitation from a wealthy old woman, Catherine Langford (Viveca Lindfors) who invites him to work for her in a project which will "help you prove your theory is right".Of course, Jackson proves just that, by solving a two-year-old riddle of a project involving an ancient artifact which has been dated at over 10,000 years (exactly how old Jackson says the Sphinx is). With Jackson's help, the artifact, called a Stargate) is activated, revealing a portal to another world.Enter the know-it-all and universally paranoid military. Personified by Colonel Jack O'Neill (Kurt Russell) who's given [gasp!] secret orders and sent through the Stargate. On the other side, they find an ancient alien who has enslaved thousands of humans to mine a mysterious element which not only powers the Stargate but also a device which gives him immortality. The alien has taken the identity of the Egyptian god, Ra, and plans to destroy Earth. Of course, O'Neill and his boys manage to save the day and destroy Ra in a good ol' nuclear blast and free the slaves.If I sound sarcastic, it's because at best, this movie is a rehash of a well-worn concept in science fiction: deus ex machina, the god out of the machine. Humans masquerading as gods armed with superior technology, is at the heart of a lot of bad science fiction. And despite the rah-rah nature of the movie, that's what this is about. I'm not downgrading the fact that this movie kicked off a very successful show, I'm pointing out that at its heart Stargate didn't have a lot else to say. And for a film to have a lasting impact, it must ultimately ask a very difficult question which we--the viewers--are required to answer, and then justify. Stargate never did that.It could have, though! When Jackson realized that O'Neill had brought an atomic bomb, he could have asked him why, and then heard about the death of the colonel's son. But director Roland Emmerich never allowed his characters to reach for their own humanity. They remained, at best, two-dimensional cutouts.Likewise we were forced to accept the outright evil of Ra without ever hearing his side of the story. Worst all are the glaring flaws in the story itself. For example, if Ra is such a tyrannical creature, who creates and maintains his technology? Such a vast amount of technology would surely require constant maintenance, to say nothing of a gigantic shipyard and hangar to maintain it. If he is a tyrant who trusts no one and rules by fear, who keeps his ship running in peak condition? Who can he trust?More importantly, if the radioactive element (called Naquadah, in the series) is radioactive enough to set off O'Neill's geiger counters then where are the slave's protective clothing? Even a vast slave population such as we see in the movie would soon be dead from radiation poisoning after so much exposure. But this is never explained.In the final analysis, Stargate is a simple "humans beat up on aliens" movie, no different from the director's later film, Indepdendence Day. Ironic that it should spawn a thoughtful series which has surpassed the original. But, the same thing happened with Buffy the Vampire Slayer, so perhaps I shouldn't be too surprised.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best space opera adventure since Star Wars!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find it difficult to understand why Stargate is often forgotten from every list of best sci-fi movies. Any book showing sci-fi history talks about Independence Day or Armageddon or even Attack of the Killing Tomatoes, but they don't even leave a line for this picture.I think Stargate is the best sci-fi adventure or space opera since Star Wars, because it's overwhelming, all it's elements are extremely creative, each new discovery of the characters in the world they find is astonishing, the characters have personal dramas to overcome. It's an alternate history story which combines archaeological Egypt with science fiction in a doubtful, but very much compelling theory. It's not that it could be true... but then again? Could the stone from 2001 A Space Odyssey be true? It's an epic where my favorite items, ancient history, particularly from ancient Egypt, and science, particularly space science, are combined with a major story of emancipation by the people against dictatorship and God, where the people question the existence of God and decide to make a revolution.Despite all the horrors Roland Emmerich has done like ID4, Godzilla or The Patriot, Stargate remains an amazing picture, with a classical direction, all the elements well accomplished, extremely serious developments and without stupid jokes or comedy. Often taken as pure entertainment and not to be seen again, for me, Stargate, which I've seen more than three dozen times, has become a cult movie, but unlike other cult movies I love, such as Blade Runner, 12 Monkeys, Brazil or Gattaca, this film produced by Mario Kassar and created by the minds of Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin is different because almost no one likes it and no one talks about it. Because of that, Stargate has become from an entertaining movie to my real cult movie, the movie that has been banished from the mainstream...</fullReview>

Early on in college, my thirst for ancient Egypt was stoked. My studies of ancient religions, beliefs, and rites combined with my love of archeology, sociology, anthropology, and science fiction literally came to life with this movie. I loved every aspect of this work.This movie had enough imagination to inspire Disney writers, so it would seem. The opening of their "Atlantis," was very similar to the opening scenes of "Stargate." At least, I found them to be nearly identical in feel, and very much alike in content.The entire concept concerning the origins of our civilization were reminiscent of Erik von Dankien's "Chariots of the Gods," creatively presented, and stunningly executed.The pace was good without being plodding. The story line was beautiful and the dialog was natural. Wonderful CG-Eye-Candy, beautiful sets, designs, and wonderful story more than entertain you.I highly recommend the 2 disk Ultimate Edition with added scenes, featurettes, and a beautiful presentation.It rates an 8.8/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***Lots of Spoilers***The story is unoriginal: Taking age old esoteric fantasy of aliens building the pyramids is boring. Re-enacting the archaeological dig from Indiana Jones - Raiders of the lost Ark is definitely not new. Getting a suppressed tribe to rebel against their evil oppressor is so old. Transferring some destructive device to the evil mother ship has been reused by Emmerich himself: here it's a bomb, in ID4 its a virus (Ok, maybe we should call ID4 unoriginal for this one).The characters are unoriginal: everyone of them is a total cliché. Colonel O'Neil, suicidal at first because of a garden variety personal tragedy, then stony faced soldier trying to blow up everything (has been done much better in 'The Abyss'). The egyptologist 'dweeb' Jackson, goofy but brilliant, and his obligatory love interest are templates, not characters. The roles are only remotely more interesting than the cardboard cutouts the producers apparently used as extras in some of the mass scenes. Alright, it's supposed to be an action movie. Why, then, is the final battle so detached? Shooting with rifles at laser equipped fighter planes (and surviving it) is so unbelievable that the viewer disconnects. Having a thousand tribesmen beating up two lonely soldiers of the opposite side is laughably unengaging as well.The umpteenth movie knuckle fight is a big yawn.This movie is lost in genre, there are frustratingly few original ideas here to keep your attention. Emmerich's apparent nickname 'little Spielberg' is well deserved ('little Lucas' would also be adequate).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a little disappointed by some of the reviews I'm reading here about this movie. Not because they pan a movie which I like, but because some of those who pan it don't seem to have paid much attention to the movie while they were watching it.Is it a spoiler to say what the movie is not about? If so, then spoilers start here.1) This movie does not involve time-travel. 2) This movie does not claim ancient egyptian gods were patterned after aliens.Now frank spoilers, what the movie is about.1) This movie is about space travel through a wormhole to another planet. 2) This movie is about an alien who usurped the already-existing identity of one of the Egyptian gods.This movie is a good popcorn flick. It is pleasant fluff. It is visually beautiful, and worth owning. It is also not the movie that Emmersbach (is that his name?) wanted to make when he was in film school.I had the good fortune to see a 'directors cut' of Stargate, which was something like 3 or 4 hours long, and was more graphically violent than any other film I've seen. This film was supposed to be the life's work of its maker--and was worthy of that appelation. However, it was so violent (and perhaps so politically insightful into the abuse of religious and political power) that the critics hated it and branded it with an 'X' rating--for violence, not sex.This rating doomed the high-budget flic to box-office disaster. To rescue the situation financially, the violence--and all the political and religious commentary--of the offworld portion of the film was removed, leaving a nice, commercial, namby-pamby action adventure of no particular insight, but which would be 'nice family viewing for all'. This is the standard version of the film which was seen in most US theaters.If the film seems to lag once it leaves earth, this is why--all the meaning and power of the original work has been censored out of it. What is left is a nice, politically safe, formulaic action adventure.I have a couple of comments, for those reviewers outside the US who felt this film tried to take credit away from the Egyptians for building the pyramids. This 'Ra' was supposed to have usurped the role which already existed. The question of whether he caused the pyramids to be built or was simply present at that time was never addressed. In my opinion, the film countered any possible tarnish on Egyptian ingenuity by the assertion that the ancient Egyptians DEFEATED this alien, despite his technology, and drove him off the planet.I should also like to say that the directors-cut version of Stargate which I saw (which is nowhere available commercially) had 20 minutes of film AFTER the destruction of Ra, in which the social CONSEQUENCES of the American-Cowboy-shoot-em-up mentality were explored--and the director did not shy away from showing that many of the consequences were negative. I suspect the political commentary, as much as the violence, was responsible for the sales-killing 'X' rating in the US.I would really like to see this long, directors cut version (despite all its rough transitions and intermittent, chopped-up musical score) released on DVD. Nowadays it would have received an NC-17 rating rather than the 'killer-x', and I'm certain the film now has enough of a 'cult following' to make the endeavor a financial success.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've had the Stargate DVD beside me for two months before I finally decided to insert it in my notebook and start watching it. The reason I had not watched it earlier were my doubts - I'm not a fan of sci-fi movies and aliens and least but not last of Roland Emmerich (since watching The Day After Tomorrow, which I didn't like at all) so I was quite certain I would be disappointed...THOUGH, this disappointment never came. And why?The main characters: From the start I loved James Spader's and Kurt Russell's characters. Though different as they might be, it's very easy to get to like both of them. Not to mention the acting qualities of both the actors.The ambient: Ancient Egypt, Anubis soldiers, sand and pyramids, aliens, the people in the village, strange animals, all mixed with modern- day soldiers who are entering in this ancient and fascinating world with doubts and in disbelief unawares and wary of what might be expecting them.The story: There are no plot holes, everything is explained to an observing viewer. Not to mention the creators made a movie to an interesting theory.The villains: They could not have chosen a better actor than Jaye Davidson to portray the main villain. A pity Jaye had chosen to leave his acting career, because as many already have said, he could have made a great deal of another great movies with his talent.The costumes: exquisite ones, especially those of the ancient Egypt gods as Anubis and Horus and the main villain.To conclude, it's a movie definitely worth watching, with character development,intriguing plot, lovable characters and great ambient to put the story/theory in. This movie belongs to those I could watch over and over without any fear that I might get bored. It's and always will be one of the treasures of sci-fi movies.</fullReview>

I'm really surprised that nobody ever caught this, they must not have had a military adviser for this film. You would never address an officer by subordinate rank like addressing a Lt. Colonel as Lt. It is common military customs and courtesy to address an officer by the superior rank like addressing a Lt. Colonel as Colonel. You would never address a Lt. Colonel as Lt. so it is an obvious gaff that no one picked up on the mismatch between insignia and the rank of the character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emmerich in a space-desert and it's... OK!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's interesting to come to Stargate about 22 years after it first came out without having seen it before; I didn't have the nostalgia for it that people I know have or had (my wife at one point in her very young life called it her favorite film), and it also comes after seeing everything else that Roland Emmerich (with occasional collaborator Dean Devlin) put out since. The impression that I get from it is that it's clear why it got so many sequels and spin-offs and TV series and books and so on. The premise - and in fact the first half hour of the movie - is terrific and stimulating for a science fiction fan: what if you could get a gateway to other worlds? What would you go to to find? The set-up gives us James Spader as a nerdy scientist (a less overbearing version of what was presented with Matthew Broderick in Godzilla years later) who is plucked from semi-obscurity/mockery as someone who believes the pyramids may not have been made by the figures history has taught us. He's selected to look at some hieroglyphics and... something else - there's a series of stars that makes up a constellation that maps out how we're at an origin point to go into other dimensions. And as it turns out the very device is in the possession of some, uh, government types I suppose, and with the leadership of military man Kurt Russell a team is dispatched to check out what is beyond the Stargate.I was on board with this idea, if only on the basis of 'hey, what can we explore and use as data and so on'. What the characters find is... a lot of clichés and hokum, a desert world that is equal parts Return of the Jedi Endor and Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome with Egyptian 'natives' and then other assorted Star Wars and other "homages" (or plain rip-offs) from other movies, not least of which Lawrence of Arabia and Indiana Jones and so on. This may be all on me though, since this is me as an adult coming to this and having years of knowledge of cinema history... on the other hand, large chunks of this movie are dumb. There's no other way to phrase it except moments show characters and situations with stupid things, though they're still "stupid-movie" things, if that makes sense.So there's some wasted opportunity for something, I won't say 'unique' as far be it from me to expect that from Emmerich, but less expected and hokey. But the story moves at a great pace, despite its wacked and dopey moving parts, and Spader and Russell ground it as two characters you can care about in a sea of people who are walking-talking tropes and types (oh, there's also the element of Aliens with it being a military group dispatched to check out this alien land and the violence they come up against), and things like culture-clash and language/communication barriers and villains with amazing Egyptian masks and sets and all sorts of things.Stargate has parts that work really well in a sea of things that flat-out don't. It may be perspective considering what else Emmerich would do with himself in the intervening years of Hollywood, but there's at least a, shall one say, 'restraint' with what he puts out here, at least when it comes to cheesy Hollywood sci-fi. I won't say it's very good, but it's also not terrible either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Portal Into Another World Like No Other</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a film, I see it primarily as a romance. In the end, a man out of place in one world, finds his place in another, and one man finds meaning in his own world after a very traumatic event. The central force is the romance that one finds in a place across the Galaxy. The film, however, is a stand-alone masterpiece. Emmerich and Devlin team up, and produce a film that works on many levels.The movie is careful to stay away from many of the clichés of most sci-fi movies but also stays away from having characters which are too simple. Both Daniel and Jack (played by James and Kurt) are real people, not cardboard cut-outs, with all the flaws and merits of our own reality. The natives are catch between trying to be friendly towards strangers and not pissing off their Gods. The science and technology used by Ra and his men look very sleek and very real. From the spaceship to the gliders, everything has a touch of old Egyptian myth mixed with advanced alien know-how.With a combination of good dialog, an interesting plot, a creative way to expound upon ancient mythologies, mostly engaging characters and good special effects, "Stargate" is a very entertaining film. Other important characters in the film include Skaara (Alexis Cruz), Sha'uri (Mili Avital), Lieutenant Kawalsky (John Diehl), Anubis (Carlos Lauchu), 'Good Father' Kasuf (Erick Avari), Nabeh (Gianin Loffler) and the leading alien known as Ra (Jaye Davidson), whom ancient humans thought was a God. The only disappointment is the last twenty-or-so minutes where the action is definitely progressing at a breakneck speed, but in all honesty, we never do care about the otherworldly extras enough to get lost in the suspense of saving their planet. However, this is definitely one of my all time sci-fi/action favorites.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deeply flawed, yet often fun, and visually good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all: I love how this movie manages to make a scenario where a linguist somehow is the heroic explorer, much like Indiana Jones put archeology in the spotlight. In fact, a comparison with Indiana Jones is apt, because it's obvious that this movie is heavily inspired by that franchise - although it goes in a completely different direction.I have barely seen the TV-show, so I went into this knowing only somewhat what the stargate is. I love the premise of it, and how it manages to explore both mythology and sci-fi concepts. I can really understand that they decided to make a TV-show out of this.A last note on positives, before I go into the flaws: There's some really neat visuals in this as well, especially concerning the pyramids, and some of the villain henchmen's costumes.The flaws, though, are many and quite bad. For one, all characters are basically idiots that somehow seem intent on making the worst possible decisions. This is a really cheap trick for inducing conflict, it is also really annoying, and condescending to the audience. Most of it could be avoided by better writing. Just as serious is how this movie seems to parallel some big problems with colonialism without really noticing. There is literally a scene where one explorer is sick, sneezes, and then his handkerchief is taken by "indigenous"-like people that has obviously never been exposed to his germs (though the movie does not comment upon this at all). There's also scenes where the explorers give the indigenous weapons and cigarettes. Was it to build up a more direct colonial plot for a possibly sequel? For some reason, it does not feel like it. It seems more like dumb writing.There's also some scenes that have become a bit more uncomfortable due to modern conflicts. There are scenes set in areas resembling the middle east, where kids are handed automatic weapons to fight against what is basically drones.Despite all of these flaws, the concept (and the visuals) makes it worth a watch, perhaps to ponder what could have been?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In comparison with the director's other work... This is something I kind of like</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To me, I never really liked Roland Emmerich's movies. I didn't like Independence Day (although I think that's partly due to every alien invasion movie ripping that off... Which explains my hype for the sequel coming out being stone dead), I HATED his Godzilla movie, Universal Soldier and 2012. All of these movies just seem to have stupid plot points in places. THIS movie on the other hand... While it does have stupid plot points in places, I actually like the story, for the most part.The plot revolves around an ancient Egyptian historian who believes the Ancient Egyptians did not build the Pyramids... Moving on. An old woman decides to use his translation skills to use something found in an archaeological dig in 1928, which seems to be a portal to another place in The Universe. They take a team of military personnel and the historian to the other part of the universe which seems to be breathable and it doesn't have the same symbols they need to find their way back. There they find a place that's almost exactly like ancient Egypt except they can't read or write. It also turns out that the Egyptian Sun god Ra is real, the Ancient Egyptians and these people worship him as a deity and he's slightly more genocidal since the last time he visited. So it's up to them to stop Ra and find their way back home.My biggest complaints with this movie are the hero and the villain. The hero is a geeky stereotype. He just wears glasses, sneezes a couple of times, remarks that it's his allergies and apparently that's all the character you need and his story arc is so dirt simple because "He was a geek before, if he's stopping ancient Egyptian Gods then he clearly isn't the character we started out with, the story arc is complete". And what is so strange is that there is a much better character in there that could have been the lead. Kurt Russel's character is way more interesting and has a much better back story (namely he actually HAS a backstory) so why the geek and not him is a huge mystery to me.I also said I didn't like the villain and it's for quite a few reasons. He doesn't look or feel menacing. I'm almost certain the entire reason for deepening his voice is so SOME form of intimidation can strike it's audience. In short, while I can see the villain working I think the actor doesn't have anything about him that screams "he's godlike" or in anything else such as his costume design. In short, while I have seen a similar villain done well in other things, here - it's not very good.So what's good about this movie? Well, the acting is good considering what they had to work with. I love the cinematography and for the early days of CGI work the effects aren't bad (okay the Stargate itself screams "Alex Mack when she's morphed into a puddle of water" but I think it works in the movie's favour of the Stargate being alien) and I do actually like the story enough that when I don't have so many shows on my "to watch list" I may actually sit down and take a look at the shows.Either way, it's clear people either love this movie or hate it. I'm personally in the middle. I HATE the geek stereotype that seems to dominate every single mid-late 90's Summer Blockbuster and the villain is not intimidating. Although everything else seems to do okay. There maybe a bunch of things that don't add up but this does have good enough things in it to have me overlook some of it. I'd say if you are a fan of Emmerich's work and you haven't seen it I suggest checking it out. If you aren't then I would say it's probably his best movie (which is simply okay) but I'm not sure if you would like it as much as I did or not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Implausible but fun sci fi - good intro to series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this is quite a fun movie but there are some very silly aspects to it. If it is not taken too seriously then it is not so bad.In 1994 the population of USA was over 260 million. Are we seriously supposed to believe that in an unprecedented event (like sending people to another galaxy) the US forces would send a bunch of red neck meat- heads from out of that massive population? These people are a representation of possibly the most stupid, trigger happy people on the entire planet... and these are the ones they send through a stargate! Is this supposed to give hope to high-school drop- outs? The only real exceptions are Dr Daniel Jackson and one of the soldiers (Brown). Even the Colonel seems like a complete meat head; he seems more like a guy who would never get past Sergeant let alone become an officer.Other than that it is quite an entertaining light hearted comedy sci-fi. The length of the entire series that follows this film (we are talking several hundred episodes) is evidence that this was a worthwhile premise. It is a good introduction to a great series. It will be noticed that all the series (even including SGU surprisingly) have a much higher rating than the film.</fullReview>

The performances of the talent is genuine and all aspects have a comfortable sense of participation. I find that very hard today with the heavy use of computer graphics and the number of re-makes that are being made! My expectations of a film are originality and acting performances and I'm sorry that todays' films for the most part lack in both areas! I see a lack of imagination in the story lines as well as a challenge amongst computer expertise and keyboard capabilities; they have a place in movies however Hollywood; use your imagination and stop the remakes! As well, acting is likely the second oldest occupation but there needs to be a re-birth of the human connection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my favourite movies made in the last fifty years, packed with plot and thought, both well-oiled with heaps of corn and leaps of faith but still with an outstanding vision. It seems to be regularly on TV, and I still end up catching it every year or so. It took Star Trek's City At The Edge Of Forever classic from 1967 literally to another dimension?James Spader is a long haired geeky professor who is enrolled into military operation to decipher mysterious ancient Egyptian artifact and help test its present cosmic potential, Kurt Russell is a square haired army colonel helping but preparing to hinder operations if necessary. The theory of ancient astronauts visiting and conquering Earth is taken to a new level ? Hell, you can come away convinced it actually happened that way. Their adventures on the other desert planet all follow on logically, the only jarring note perhaps being Spader's initial performance as an ineffectual dweeb which was OK as a plot device, but at least it doesn't last too long. Thank goodness they had olde cgi cartoonery in 1994, however the story would have probably seen it through anyway. The ripply effect of passing through from world to another was just as effectively portrayed in Cocteau's Orphee in 1949?It has something for everyone, good and bad, emotion and action and could have been just as exciting and entertaining an hour longer - although the ensuing franchise extended it by years. It has a beginning middle and end with no gristle and is almost Art! And for once even the Yanks managed to wade into a foreign land to assist the standard ignorant alien natives with regime change, leave with minimum casualties and leave a probable American outpost only light years away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun, Action-Packed Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stargate is nothing but a good, old-fashioned action film that offers a fun time. It has a solid story, well-developed characters, and a good sci-fi setting. This is one of the early films of Roland Emmerich who directed such hits like Independence Day and the Day After Tomorrow. We see his flair for action and explosive special effects here. I liked this movie because this is one of those films which doesn't require thinking with a overly-complicated plot because all this film does is entertain and it clearly shows that.Emmerich's film is about this device named Stargate which creates a wormhole through worlds. Linguist Daniel Jackson and Special Forces Colonel Jack O'Neill travel through this device to a world resembling Ancient Egypt where they fight the forces of Ra so they can go home and free the civilization from slavery.This film doesn't require strong acting but in my opinion, it does have strong acting. Kurt Russell maintains his on screen presence with his tough persona. James Spader does a good job as Daniel Jackson who is interested in learning about new culture. Jaye Davidson as Ra is very good and menacing as Ra.Overall, Stargate is a great, action-packed escapist film. It reminds me of films of old and all this does is offer a good time at the movies. Obviously, it's not the greatest movie ever but it doesn't have to be. I really liked this film and the premise of it. I was entertained and this features Emmerich at this best. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sci-Fi that's more human</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The big thing about this film is that the "Stargate" is both central to the story, but - compared to Iron Mans suit or Captain Kirks ship - it's actually a relatively minor device in the film, enabling the characters to get to where they're going, without being bogged down in the technical details of traveling to or being on an alien planet. As a result, they can spend their time developing the characters, in particular Kurt Russells Colonel O'Neill, and James Spader as Daniel Jackson. Russell is a grumpy, retired Colonel, with a hair cut that you could sharpen scissors on and sorrowful back story. James Spader is a bespectacled archaeologist and linguist, whose theories on ancient civilizations are laughed at by the rest of the archaeological community. It's not hard to guage that Kurt will beat up any opposition he comes in contact with, while James will want to find out all he can about it, which makes them a good match. Add in to the mix the gorgeous, and not over done, special effects. The sound track that adds to the tension and atmosphere. And a relatively small supporting cast (such that they get a decent amount of screen time), this film has a good mix of science fiction for aficionados and human interest story for those that don't. It seems to be very under appreciated given the dynasty it spawned.</fullReview>

It is the film that inspired the long running TV series of the same name.Egyptologist and linguist Daniel Jackson and Special Forces Colonel Jack O'Neil step through the portal to a world ruled by the evil "god" Ra, who is in fact an alien who has possessed a boy and commands a great army. They must fight and outwit him to free the enslaved inhabitants to be able to return home.The film is action packed and features a great script. The special effects, while slightly dated, still hold up to this very day. The Stargate and portal effect itself is quite beautiful.

The effects were good and no that much of CGI was used but it was the story itself that wasn't my cup of tea.It starts rather good going back to 8000 years before Christ to see some kind of space ship landing on earth. Flash forward to early 1920's to see the discovery in Egypt of some weird objects. Flash forward to nowadays were Dr. Daniel Jackson(James Spader) is brought in into the army to help solving a two year problem, what are the symbols standing on the objects found in Egypt, in comes Col. Jonathan 'Jack' O'Neil (Kurt Russell with a weird haircut) to solve the problem once they see that the object is some kind of Stargate. Off they go into the stargate to another galaxy and from here things go wrong for me. Here we move away from a science-fiction to a story were the white people are the superiors of the black coloured. They need the whites to help them against the Egyptian looking aliens with a god called Ra. Anyone. In comes also a bit of a love story with Dr. Jackosn. Even when the aliens attack it's a bit low on everything. It's a bit of how humanity started and what went wrong with a lot of blah blah and no action. Still, for some it's a classic that spawned a new flick Children Of The Gods (1997) with a whole new cast which leads to the series for ten years long.As I said, the effects were rather good and luckily the monsters and original alien were not done in CGI but there are better SF's out from that era.

		<fullReview>An excellent movie with great cast, original idea and great story.The Cast. Kurt Russell is great as Jonathan 'Jack' O'Neil. He comes across as a great hero during the action scenes but plays the emotional parts well when they arise. James Spader is great as Dr Daniel Jackson and really comes across as the kind of person you'd expect to be teaching students in a university. His character and Kurt Russell's bump heads a few times and you really believe that they're two really different people. Jackson wants to read every piece of righting, discover every little fossil and meet every local which is a contrast to O'Neil who wants to get on with the mission, shoot first ask questions later and perceive everything as a possible threat. The main cast is back by a stellar supporting cast notable Jaye Davidson as the evil Egyptian god, Ra.The concept. Most mainstream Sci-Fi is set on a spaceship, in the future but this movie takes a completely different direction. The StarGate is a ring with thirty six symbols on it which act as an address to a different planet. It creates a wormhole which instantly transports you to another planet. That is a departure in itself but here's the best part, the main villain is an alien who kidnapped humans from ancient Egypt and brought them to this planet. He took over a young boys body and poses as Ra, the sun god in order to enslave the captured humans. Rather than being set in the future where a big bad alien race tries to invade Earth, there is a heavy focus on the past and takes mythology we know about and says 'what if?' which is a really interesting concept.The story. It's a fairly generic story. It's about a team of special forces commandos who go through the Stargate and find the citizens on the planet are being enslaved by an alien in the body of a boy who is pretending to be the Egyptian sun god, Ra. The team set out to overthrow Ra and get home before they're all killed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are many windows to the cosmos and in this 1994 movie " Star-Gate " we see once again it's only a matter of imagination. In 1923 there were many finds in the deserts of Egypt. A year earlier, the famous tomb of king Tutankhamun was discovered by noted archaeologist Dr. Howard Carter. This movie adds a more mythical aspect when tomb explorers discover a huge circular object with strange markings on it's circumference. When the symbols cannot be properly interpreted, a specialist, Dr. Daniel Jackson (James Spader) is called in to help and discovers Star Constelations are the key. Nevertheless the project further proves dangerous and the civilian project goes military under Gen. West (Leon Rippy) and Col. Jonathan 'Jack' O'Neil (Kurt Russell). Once the device becomes operational, the Earth team travels to the far side of the galaxy and meet an extraordinary being called Ra. (Jaye Davidson who is incredible) He explains, he was responsible for Earth's Egyptian culture and it's pyramids. Because he created it, he will now destroy it. The film is a fine example of dramatic special effects and flying action combined. Altogether, the cast, the beasts and it's advance technology combine for a Classic film.

You can trace the pedigree of Stargate straight back to 2001: A Space Odyssey, where the concept of intergalactic wormhole travel was introduced.This movie is especially noteworthy because of Jaye Davidson, who appears for the second and last time in the movies. But after you've exposed yourself to the world (The Crying Game) and played the king of the universe (Stargate), what's left to do? Jaye took the money (one million dollars), his nipple rings and Ra's eye makeup and split.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everything about this moovie looks real good. You wonder if they found some pyramid in Egypt that was pristine and filmed in and around that. The aerial shots above the pyramid look real.The only kind of crappy effects are those in the Stargate control room, the graphics on the monitors are too good for the PCs of 1994, and too lousy for any Military computers (Which are about 20 years ahead of what's available to the public, so I hear). However, the director is using the gadgets in the control room to explain whats going on to the viewer, without having to use up to 5 minutes of Dialogue explaining the operation of the Stargate. Instead, the monitor says "Molecular Deconstruction" and this is worth 15 minutes of Star Trekian dialogue.The story is a good story, but toward the end of the film, too many things are happening too fast, and it just seems that RA is a little bit too easy to get rid of... But then again, the Goa'Uld, although clever with science, are rather stupid when it comes to social behaviours and strategies.If this guy was enslaving these people for 12,000 years, he would be a little bit more of a sonuvabitch. So, I don't buy it that Ra was ready to fly away, but... It was good for the story on film, so they could blow up his pyramid ship, and if anyone notices, the explosion of the pyramid ship is almost the exact same explosion of the moon Praxis in Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country (Actually someone did notice, see the trivia section of this movie).But overall, everything fits. The extended cut has a few shots that should have been left in the theatrical version. One thing that was done very well what that huge Buffalo thing looks like a real animal, I wonder if they took a buffalo and stuck a fake head on it, and how they got the buffalo to accept it.I've watched this film at least a dozen times, and it is still fun to watch. No disrespect for what the TV series has done, but that show is not capable of showing the scope of the material revealed in the original... Cos it does not work on a 25" TV screen.Back then they had not named everything, we did not know that the name of the planet of the slaves was Abydos. Well, just like David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia... We lose the desert when we pan and scan this film.The characters do not fit well on a TV screen, and so, frequent trips back to Abydos via the extended cut of this film are required.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this in the theatre in '94, it was awesome then and 11 years later I must be one of few who prefer the original movie over the spin off television series. Sorry, but I felt having stargates on every other planet kind of cheapened the idea. Not a huge fan of MacGuyver either. In my opinion the movie is far more impressive, possibly due to the superior special effects or the "mystery" of the Earthlings figuring out the gate for the first time.I'm the first to admit there are flaws-- the alien planet has not one but *three* moons which look EXACTLY LIKE OURS; a sloppy FX shortcut in a movie full of otherwise sparkling effects-- but they're forgivable in the face of a truly smart script connecting ancient Egypt and alien life-- only way they might have improved it was maybe to include something about Stonehenge. I'm a sucker for anything about ancient Eypgt so I was a perfect target for this movie. Also, it might be considered a premonition, as far as having the androgynous black/white sequined "king" surrounding himself with young boys... a whole year or so before Michael Jackson started really getting in trouble with the law. Yikes.In short, a great film. Beautiful sets, and fine acting from everyone involved. It's fun to see "Harry Solomon" from 3rd Rock From The Sun (French Stewart) in his first film role too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch the movie before the tv show!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw stargate for the first time about six years ago, and I thought the plot was excellent, a good alternative to the Star Trek/Star Wars battle. I must say, it's great, but watch the movie before the show it birthed! I've been watching Stargate-SG1 for about a year now, and It is above excellent, the best sci-fi out there, but it and the movie have major, MAJOR differences. The second time I watched the movie, all I could think of is all the differences. Watch Stargate, If you liked it watch SG1, but please, watch them in that order! I have to credit the show, though, rather than get hung up on the differences, it mocks them for humor. That's another difference that turned me off to the movie the second time through. Stargate is cold, somber, and serious, but good. Sg1 can be hillerious beyond your wildest dreams. So... movie first, or you'll regret it, trust me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From the Theatrical to the Director's Cut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The quality of the movie, in the Theatrical version and in the Director's Cut, are both good. Tho, I must say that the Theatrical version is better viewed picture wise. When they re-intergrade the scenes that were not in the Theatrical version, sometimes they had 'dust' and sometimes they looked a bit 'old', like on film in which they didn't clean. Specks as well, in variants.The sound is great, I've always thought so. The sound by words to lips in some scenes is off just a tad, but, only noticeable to those who are either looking for such quirks or are looking at their lips for some reason.There is much positive aspects in this film. The story-line and the acting are both entwined very well. As tho both aren't seen yet they are.James Spader does an excellent job as Daniel Jackson, his counterpart on the tv show Stargate SG-1 Michael Shanks does a great job as Daniel Jackson as well, if I was to be asked which I would rather have be on the show or in a continuing sequel of the movie, I would be tongue-tied and un-able to answer for it would almost be a tie between the two.Kurt Russell plays depressed and angry very well, as he does in most of his other films, tho I feel that Richard Dean Anderson does a better job at playing Colonel Jack O'Neil. But, that is in my opinion.The rest of the cast were as well great, especially French Stewart who usually plays comedic roles, tho he did have a few quirks of sarcasm in this movie, I thought his 'dramatic' scenes were justifiable and that he should consider in the future to be in more, I feel they would suit him well. Tho, if he stays in the comedic roles that is good, too.I have only seen Mili Avatal in two movies, this one of course and in Kissing A Fool. She was lovely in that movie, but, I think she is excellent in this one. She has passion and grace, that she puts to the role of Sha'uri.Tho I know of other movies with Djimon Hounsou, I feel his part in this film was too small to make a vivid comment on.Jaye Davidson plays Ra (rah) very well. He is un-recognized barely in his other films.As I mentioned in the sound department, those quirks and also in the picture, but, only on the Directorial version and not the Theatrical.On the Director's Cut some of the scenes re-added in are a bit dirty and the sound is off at times, I feel that put a low mark on the film for me.Tho, the Theatrical version is excellent and clean.Overall, I feel that this movie in the Theatrical release is an 8 out of 10 the Director's Cut a rank lower at 7 out of 10.But, overall an 8.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ancient Astronaut Theorists and Fans are Still Waiting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ancient Astronaut thesis definitively started in the late 60's with Erich Von Daniken, was matured and intellectualized by Zecharia Sitchin starting in 1976, and is here today in a plethora of TV shows, documentaries and extensions of previous works. It is a fascinating and totally believable subject that has limited, if any big screen incarnations. Thus speaks Stargate.The movie starts off great with the whole thing collapsing under its own weight of misunderstanding the concept and turning it into a good looking but incredibly inept military exercise with dull action scenes and unbelievably uninteresting cultural exchanges.The Alien look is outstanding as are the sets, but it shamelessly uses a deep concept and ridicules its insights. It has no taste for the intellect and the cartoonish presentation of the Marines is clichéd and dated. There is still a great movie to be made with this subject matter and if it is handled in a respectful manner it could be the biggest brainy blockbuster of all time. Ever since 2001: A Space Odyssey (which had undertones of the theme) fans of the Ancient Astronaut theory have been waiting and one hopes that Hollywood is listening.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Atmospheric, visually stunning sci-fi adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked it then and I still like it now. "Stargate" is far better, in my opinion, than most of the top sci-fi movies, including the Star Wars. What makes it a great experience is mainly its atmosphere. The visuals are outstanding and special effects are used intelligently for once, which is one of the reasons why "Stargate" remains timeless. The set design, costumes and soundtrack (obviously an homage to "Lawrence of Arabia"), the vast alien landscapes so similar to Earth yet clearly different, make it a classic sci-fi epic with a genuine "otherworldly" feel. There is a fascination and a sinister vibe throughout that will keep you curious as to what's coming next, even if by midway you'll probably know where things are going. There are no weird, stupid-looking extraterrestrials and techno/futuristic babble, which is always a good thing. Roland Emmerich's movies are a guilty pleasure, but this one is special. There's no time like the 80's and the 90's, and maybe that's one of the reasons too. The actors, particularly James Spader, but also Jaye Davidson in a bizarre, delightfully over-the-top appearance, are very good in their roles, and these performances are great fun. This is not a film to be over analyzed; you just enjoy it for what it is: sheer escapism of the best kind, Hollywood-style. There is pure entertainment in its simplicity, and also a certain innocence. It never gets old, and to those who were kids when they saw it in 1994, "Stargate" comes with great memories.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic. Original ideas.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Love this movie, among the few I watch from time to time. True classic (has all the "components"), excellent soundtrack, excellent graphics- and sound effects, original ideas why or how humans came to any certain place. Why pyramids exists or why they're shaped the way they are.Another perspective pictured in this movie is how mankind has been ruled by a demagogue, typically given the properties of a god from the observers perspective. This usually resolves in revolt as people are suppressed, much like our history.Great atmosphere and artistic filming. I especially like the introduction, mid- and ending scenes. The ending feels very much altruistic for the main characters. This movie has same caliber as Star Wars IMO.Some scenes could have been given more time to evolve and not been so cropped as they where. It does give you the impression it had to be cut here and there to fit some framework. Sure, acting could been somewhat better, but elegance is for tailors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amusing but stupid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With an interesting basic idea and a nice cast headed by Kurt Russell and James Spader, this should have turned out a bit better than it really is. The problem seems to be that any opportunity for originality or resonance was sacrificed in favor of bland action scenes. The director of this film, Roland Emmerich, seems to possess little in the way of imagination.Spader plays a scientist who, although he's been discredited by his peers, is drafted to head a major project for the U.S. military. Using his knowledge of ancient Egyptian languages, he manages to open the "stargate" which allows people from our world to travel to the other side of the galaxy. Lo and behold -- thousands of primitive humans are being held prisoner there by a super-powerful alien masquerading as the sun-god Ra.For a basic sci-fi premise, it's just so weird that it's fascinating. But unfortunately everything has been turned into a cliché by Emmerich and the writers. Why, oh why, would the first expedition to this new planet be undertaken by an incompetent newbie scientist and a bunch of soldiers with machine guns? It seems as if no one is taken by the sheer scientific possibilities of the situation. Basically they've taken a somewhat interesting premise and combined it with basic action formula in an attempt to replicate the success of "Predator." That film managed to look expensive by setting itself in a barren jungle; this film looks cheap because so much effort is made to create an elaborate civilization that ultimately feels like a copy of "Mad Max beyond Thunderdome." There is just too much stupidity here to be believed... Spader, although a scientist, never considered that the people might be speaking Egyptian with a different accent until just the right moment when the plot needed him to figure it out. But if only the director wasn't as short-sighted as the characters. His setups hold no interest and this is just totally functional film-making, not any better than a made for TV movie.It's fun however to see Kurt Russell in a sci-fi movie like this, and Jaye Davidson is an interesting choice for the villain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was immediately reminded of Chariots of the Gods, a book written in 1968 by Erich von Däniken, when I sat down to watch this film. It is centered on the theory that many ancient civilizations' technologies and religion were given to them by space travelers who were welcomed as gods.I have seen Stargate several times and I find it to be an interesting concept for a film and thoroughly enjoyable. The cast included Kurt Russell as a typical military type, and James Spader as the Egyptologist that solves the puzzle. The special effects contribute greatly to the film and are not overdone.This is the one that started two TV shows and worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Epic Movie that laid the Foundation to two Awesome Series!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dear Readers,I love Stargate SG-1 and Stargate Atlantis. Both series had a beginning though, and that Beginning was Stargate. I had watched the series before the movie so I had some understanding of what happened in the movie but I still found it cool. Kurt Russell and David Spader lay the foundation for the heroes that Richard Dean Anderson and Michael Shanks embody. Small-time Director Roland Emmerich does his best directing this masterpiece and it's just as good as his amazing Space Epic: Independence Day.Dr. Daniel Jackson has the crazy notion that Aliens influenced the race of Mankind. After being laughed out of a seminar, he's hired by the US Military to translate a tablet and a gigantic ring that was found 100 years ago. He discovers that the Ring is a Gateway to making a wormhole to another planet on the other side of the galaxy. Along with Colonel Jack O'Neil, Daniel leads a team of soldiers into a desert planet with a gigantic pyramid on it. After meeting the locals, who worship the ancient Egyptian God of the Sun, Ra, aliens known as the Goa'uld arrive and begin kidnapping slaughtering the people of the desert planet. To their shock, Ra is their leader. The Egyptian gods were named after Goa'Uld warlords who are currently tearing up the Galaxy and forcing its people to worship them. O'Neil and Jackson, along with a party of locals, lead an attack on Ra's Pyramid Fortress to defeat him once and for all. Signed, The Constant DVD Collector</fullReview>

Overall Stargate is a very good underrated film, and for anyone who hasn't seen it - See It! or the CAMEL will come for U!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Similar to Independence Day, this first offering from Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin (also of Godzilla infamy) starts out with an intriguing concept and turns it into a generic action movie. Not as depressingly stupid as Independence Day, nor as awful as Godzilla, this movie is the kind of movie you watch and laugh at the plotholes, but for some reason you just enjoy it. Surprisingly believable, even though as I mentioned the plot was shot full of holes. Fun, mindless, and not at all boring. There is a Special Edition VHS and DVD available with a little more extra footage, some of which was rightfully left out of the theatrical release and some of which was actually surprisingly good. If you haven't seen it, it's worth a rent on a slow night.Rating : **1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Starring: James Spader, Kurt Russell Where did the pyramids come from? Were they built by the Egyptians years ago, or did they come from some other place? Scientist and linguist Daniel Jackson (Spader) believes otherwise. He has some different ideas as to where the pyramids came from, or at least as to when they were built. He is mocked by his colleagues for his research, and generally thought to be a complete loony.He is eventually contacted by an elderly woman named Katherine who has a special assignment for him, translating ancient Egyptian. Since he has nowhere to go and nothing left to lose and no job, he takes her up on the offer and begins doing some research on a variety of ancient artifacts that Katherine has found. In two weeks he finally finds the key and informs everyone of his findings, that the symbols he's been trying to translate are actually star constellations that plot a course to another point in the galaxy. At this point he is informed about another artifact that was found with the tablets he has been studying for two weeks. Something known as the stargate. It's a giant ring that they have erected on a stand with symbols all along the track inside of it. The symbols are used to dial another stargate, and with the coordinates given to them by Dr. Jackson, they plan to do a little reconnaissance through the stargate.Leading the team is Colonel Jack O'Neil (Russell), a soldier with nothing to lose. A man who gets the job accomplished by any means possible. The plan is to go through the stargate, dial home and go back, but the coordinates for the return trip can't be found. They begin looking for other means of civilization in an attempt to find a way back home while some of the marines establish a camp by the stargate that they came through. Eventually they do find other signs of civilization and make contact.But then something shows up back at the base camp. Something that they weren't expecting. A spaceship docks on top of the pyramid, and strange beings take the marines that were left behind as prisoners. Eventually we learn that these creatures are actually the masters of the people on this world, and that they are in slavery. Since Americans are noble heroes, they help the people on a quest for freedom from their slave life. Plus they have nothing else to do, since they can't figure out a way to get back home.Out of the three movies I've seen by Roland Emerich (Independence Day, The Day After Tomorrow, and Stargate), I think I like this one the best. It's just a good sci-fi movie.Bottom Line: 3.5 out of 4 (worth watching if you're into sci-fi)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That quote from the film just about sums it up. When I first saw this film, the let-down after the promising beginning almost made me give this film a thumbs down, but I find that it grows upon me. What you really should have, though, is two stories. The tale on Abbados (sp?) is very engaging and has quite a good deal of action that actually seems to hang together pretty good! Unfortunately, how we got from the beginning to the main story nearly broke it for me with plot assumptions that you could drive a chevvy through. Still, if you're willing to put aside that 15 or so minutes that just don't make sense when they first crank up the stargate, then you'll enjoy this one. :-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Would See It Again - A gateway that transports you instantaneously across the galaxy makes for an okay sci-fi movie. Add a revolutionary discovery about the true history of the world on the other end of the trip, and you've got the makings of a great movie. Then cast it horribly and dwell too long on stupid action, and you've got a headache. Overall, I love the premise of this just-average movie so darn much that it ends up being an enjoyable watch. Then again my love for the superb TV Series based loosely on the movie might be making me biased.Similar Movie: It's similar to any 90s action movie with a sci-fi twist. Which isn't saying much. However, I will defend it by saying it would have to go down a notch before Jean Claude Van Damme could star in it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this one mostly because I like the three actors mentioned above. I was not disappointed in any of them. They did well with what they were given. BUT...there are better "sand adventures" and "time and space" pictures out there.It was interesting to read the trivia section of the boards and learn that both Spader and Davidson did the movie for the money and pretty much hated it (the film, not the $$) before, during and after making the picture. Davidson had made the ludicrous request for a million dollars to make the film and was given it. He then pretty much retired from film acting (after cashing his paycheck, presumably.)The picture itself ? It starts out promising enough. Lecturer getting no-where (Spader) is asked by older mysterious lady (Vivica Lindfors, lovely and interesting as ever !) to do an unspecified something. He need the money (rather like Spader and this film !) and so he goes where she wants him to. Lots of techno-jargon that is hard to hear and follow. A depressed army man is introduced (Kurt Russel) and he re-appears as the tough-no-nonsense military leader of what started as a scientific expedition. What follows is soldiers with guns and lots of shooting, costumed extras and general mayhem with some sadism and dismemberment included.. Ugh ! Lots of sub-titles try to get the story across but watching the film on a TV they were hard to read and so much of the story was lost.All in all... OK for what it is, I suppose but not my genre and would never watch it again. Goes on the "give it to the thrift store pile".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's had a lot of stick over the years, but Stargate makes for a terrific thrill ride, conveying some of the excitement of Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and Flash Gordon. And perhaps even the John Carter books too.It takes awhile for it to build up, but the set-up is enthralling, a neat spin on the Chariots of the Gods stuff about ancient astronauts and the like.Once Kurt and James are on 'Planet X', they and the team eventually discover humans living a nomadic existence, kept subservient by the sun-god Ra - who turns out to be a powerful despotic alien, but no God. Ra's henchmen too are simply big strong men, who happen to be kitted out with high-tech weapons and equipment.Things take a turn for the worse when Ra shows up, alerted to the activation of the Stargate, and Spader, Kurt and his men eventually find themselves leading a revolt, while at the same time racing against time from stopping Ra sending an explosive present through the Stargate to Earth.Not perfect, a little plodding at times, but fun undemanding entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>amazing 90s Sci-Fi cult classic that spawned SG1, Atlantis and Universe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Love this film. It's aged well, and is the opener for a massive TV series franchise. Basically, Dr Daniel Jackson (James Spader) is called into a military research station to decipher hieroglyphs and other symbols on a large artifact found at Giza in 1928, which is of course the first Stargate and was built by the alien civilisation that created the Ancient Egyptian way of life here on Earth, which have since gone on another planet, where our intrepid explorers go and find a similar civilisation to what the Egyptians might have been two thousand plus years ago on Earth. Their language is similar enough to what Dr Jackson, an archaeological linguist, can reasonably and not-improbably understand, after a few false starts.The film is of epic proportions set against sweeping sand dune vistas and huge sets, reminiscent of the big studio classics, with hundreds of extras who are real people not painted in later. It has an iconic soundtrack that is almost operatic in places, and the costumes, ancient Egyptian similarities and the special effects are just brilliant even nearly twenty years on, and without the prolific CGI we have today! It is visually very impressive, and original. The script isn't great and is really the only thing that lets the film down a point. It's all a bit rushed and staccato at the beginning - the bit on Earth is the least convincing actually. The film manages some humour as well as having you on the edge of your seat for a climactic finale, which is also a little emotive. James Spader is always a good bet, known most prominently for rather seedy, smutty, awkward or fast talking characters (Oh! How I love Boston Legal), he is superb as the academic PhD here; his calm, measured and quiet delivery are perfect against Kurt Russell's buzz-cut macho all-guns-blazing military man on a mission. Jaye Davidson gives a rather scary performance as Ra ("the Sun god") with control and an almost sexual element and effeminacy but also a violence and temper that are only partially helped by special effects. I really loved the acting - possibly the stand out character - of Alexis Cruz as the smart and brave village boy Skaara who makes first contact and is the plucky comic relief! Erick Avari, the village leader Kasuf, is a familiar face now (but perhaps wasn't so much back in the early 90s as this was his first major film role) as is French Stewart, one of the soldiers (3rd Rock from the Sun) and also Djimon Hounsou in an early in his acting career small though perfectly formed role as Horus. A brilliant film, well worth watching for sci-fi, Egyptian, alien, anthropology, archaeology, action adventure interests. It is worth noting that the beginning of the film is in German with subtitles and your DVD language and subtitle options aren't playing up (I stupidly forgot that last time I watched as it had been such a long time since I'd seen it), and also there are subtitles for the plot-important Egyptian dialect conversations too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stargate is overall your adventure story with the flare of the average 90's era Sci-fi movie. I find the story to be very unique and that no one has really tried the approach that the film had taken with blending ancient Egyptian culture with science fiction wormholes and the military. I found the soundtrack to the movie to be quite impressive, and I do think that the composition does not receive as much credit as it is due. The acting was decent for the film and the set production to be very impressive. I did find that there was something to be desired with the character Jack O'neil, who in the TV series gets developed further; however, in this movie he seems to be a very flat character that had the potential for more. True to the style of Roland Emmerich, the military representation was not true to reality in what the uniform, weapons, and other attribute. The film did dive into issues with firearms and children, it was subtle enough no to affect the movie overall.</fullReview>

Story is good, they don't dumb it down too much, they make most of the characters have some intelligence which helps keep the movie moving. Cast is really solid, Spader does a good job back when he played a lot of characters like this. Kurt Russell isn't given much to do but he is solid in his role. Supporting cast is very solid. Jaye Davidson still is an odd choice as RA, but it kind of works. Today they would have cast the Rock or someone for that role. Direction is solid, nothing spectacular. Musical score sounds like the Indiana Jones movies. Special effects are somewhat dated, but not terrible, still better than most of the CGI garbage that you see now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Do I need to synopsise the plot? Scientist James Spader is involved in the construction of a device which opens portals between different planets. A mixed scientific/military expedition marches through the portal and ends up in a pyramid, where it meets a civilisation (second cousins to the ancient Egyptians) which is enslaved to a despot. There is much scientific mumbo-jumbo, a hardline military man who is going through a crisis of conscience, a faction of the enslaved peoples who take to the idea of a resistance movement, a romance between the scientist and one of the slave-y people, connections discovered with ancient Egypt (well, duh) and so on.It never takes itself seriously with the possible exception of Kurt Russell's damaged military man, and his hard performance is no bad thing. But everyone else has fun.And a word in favour of Jaye Davidson's despot, an excellent follow up to The Crying Game for this under-used performer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A solid and entertaining effort by a dependable director. Kurt Russell isn't going to get an Oscar any time soon, but he will always get work, a good, solid actor in this genre. As usual, pacing is critical. I'm surprised that few reviews mention this, especially for action films. Editing is crucial, as is a good script in which the actors don't stand around explaining things to the audience. True, sometimes shot length falls to below 2 seconds, and that gets a little jumpy. Here, the average seems to be about 3.5 to 4 seconds (I couldn't find the info), and that works, just enough time to see the reaction on the actors' faces, not enough to see that they are not communicating a whole range of emotion. Also, the segues and fades are deftly handled. The mark of a good movie, for me, is that I don't get tired of seeing it again, and sometimes again and again. This is one of those movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Few outer space flicks deserve the phrase "out of this world"; this one does!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bumbling, allergy-sneezing, penniless Egyptologist, Dr. Daniel Jackson (James Spader) suddenly gets a nice job offer. This is good news, since his last lecture was a failure, due to his controversial theories about ancient civilization. Presenting the position is Catherine (Viveca Lindfors), who curiously works for the United States Air Force. At a secret enclave in Colorado, Dr. Daniel discovers an Egyptian artifact he never knew existed. It is, as he translates it from the inscriptions, a "stargate", an opening into another part of the universe. The huge spiral has other codes which no one can break. Until now, for Dr. Jackson knows his stuff. With his help, the gate suddenly appears, in a flash of brilliance. A mechanical probe, sent in to take readings, brings back the information that it has entered another planet, very similar to earth, galaxies away. Therefore, a manned operation is planned. Along with Dr. Daniel, the troupe of players will consist mainly of military personnel, headed by Colonel Jack (Kurt Russell). With grit and fortitude, they cross through the gate. Once over, they find pyramids, like those in Egypt, which confirm Dr. Daniel's belief that the huge buildings were not built by the ancient Egyptians. But, they also make two other startling discoveries. Firstly, there is a primitive culture of humans, similar to nomadic Arabic tribes, at work in the mines of the planet. Are they indeed from earth? Secondly, the mineral in question is needed by the ruler of the planet, who arrives in his elaborate spaceship from time to time. He is Ra (Jaye Davidson), the sun god of the Egyptians, who has used the ore as a rejuvenation tool for over 10,000 years. It works very well, as he still appears as a young man, very handsome and lithe. In fact, he was once the last member of a dying alien race who searched the universe for a new body. He found one, one of a young male, in ancient Egypt and took it over. With his help, the great civilization on the Nile appeared and the stargate was established between the planets, Ra's home and earth. Whew. However, problems arose and Ra buried the stargate and fled. Now, he is terribly distressed that modern humans have arrived to upset the apple cart. The American military versus a sun god, just who will win? And, can the Yankees make it back home? This a grand movie that truly deserves the phrase "out of this world". Before it spawned a television series, Stargate was this brilliant film, with a tremendous scope, settings, costumes, musical score, ideas, cast, and visual effects. Its fusion of Egyptology and intergalactic travel is truly awe-inspiring and has to be viewed to be appreciated. That said, the cast is also very fine, with Spader, Russell, Lindfors, Mili Avatel, French Stewart, and especially Davidson doing great work. A star of the much-lauded movie The Crying Game, Davidson was also magnificent here as the imperial Ra, even though he has no English dialogue. Just where did this talented actor go? No matter, his presence is preserved here forever. If you are a science fiction fan or just love quality films, this is one to seek out tonight. Rush out the door, pass through your own gate and speed off to the nearest DVD store.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know Emmerich had other films before this, but this is the one that got him famous. I've never seen the TV shows based on it, but this is a pretty good film. The weirdest thing is, I think it has a story. Roland Emmerich, the guy who made ID4, the Day after Tomorrow and 2012 made a movie with actual plot. The effects are dated, but their still pretty nice by todays standards.The plot involves Daniel Jackson being recruited by the government to start a machine called the Stargate. Then him, Cornel O'Neil and others go through it and land at the other end of the Universe. Unable to get back, they soon meet humans brought there by the God, Ra.I don't like giving away spoilers, so I suggest you watch it. Emmerich is a crazy director, and this is probably his only one with anything close to story, so I recommend it, it isn't Emmerich's best, but it's still good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not really into watching science fiction television shows all that much, but I do like science fiction movies. Probably because they usually do a good job of making a running story where you have to really watch them all to appreciate them and I just can never catch the shows in their proper order. While in a movie they usually present the story and have a conclusion all within the hour and a half to two hours. This one does just that, I feel the movie also ended in a way to satisfy me so I never really had the urge to watch the shows. This one has a strange artifact found and brought to a place where it is discovered to have the power of teleportation. Well they determine that they can send some people using this device so they get a soldier who is seemingly very depressed and a guy who is good at decoding things and is kind of a intellectual type along with other army type guys and send them on to the other side. Well what they first discover is a desert type environment, really not much different than what we would have here on earth. Well they soon discover a group of people who seemingly are afraid of them and at the same time revere them. Soon the soldiers and guy find out why as this strange flying pyramid appears and within it a strange being that has been using these people as slaves and once did the same thing on earth as well. Some good action sequences ensue and while it never reaches super blockbuster type status this one provides enough of the thrills to really entertain as well as have a rather good story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid Sci-Fi experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By the the 1990s it looked like filmmakers could do just about anything when it came to making movies. Some genres require more time, energy, and resources than others and by this time technology had become really advanced, making it easier to make movies like 'Star Wars' and 'Die Hard.' This also allowed filmmakers to use their imagination more since more was possible. This would lead to some pretty incredible films that would take us to some really different and fascinating worlds. Roland Emmerich wasn't new to directing, but was still fairly new to US audiences and so when 'Stargate' came out I don't think anyone knew what to expect. What we got was something pretty cool that has gained a following that's still going strong over a decade later.Pros: A cool, if somewhat hokey concept. The cast is game. A nice, at times exciting score. Excellent special and visual effects work. Fabulous production design. Also some incredible costume designs. Moves at a good pace, especially once the main characters reach the other world. Some of the dopey humor is amusing. A really exciting finale.Cons: Has some major plot holes. Though the performances are fine, the characters aren't particularly engaging. As with most of Emmerich's films, this one feels a bit long-winded and could have been shortened by at least 15 minutes.Final thoughts: I will admit that this film isn't as exciting as I remember it was when I saw it on the big screen, but overall it's held up well. It succeeds in keeping the viewer interested and entertained, while bringing us into a new and exciting world. I know it spawned two successful TV series, but I still wish a direct sequel was made, though the film still stands on it's own pretty well.My rating: 4/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stargate comes on like an ornate action movie with an interesting premise: an ancient archaeological find in Egypt is a portal to another world. Our intrepid military, accompanied by the mandatory nerdy scholar, go through to check it out, and to cut it off. Pretty standard stuff for sci-fi. But that is where the similarities end.The pacing and performances carry us clear of the doldrums of the usual endless sci-fi techno-babble explanations (which it wisely avoids) and takes us through the story with great visuals and elaborate production values without missing a beat. One is transported to this far away world and its struggle in quick time, enjoying every step of the way. No doubt we could find loads of symbolism and analogy in the story and its telling. But, who cares? We are just enjoying the ride.Kurt Russell and James Spader are perfect and polar foils for each other, without hitting us over the head with their differences or back-stories. Viveca Lindfors excellently underplays her role as a connection to the original discovery. Jaye Davidson is delicately menacing as, essentially, the Ming the Merciless character. One only regrets he is not on screen more.A thoroughly enjoyable sojourn in escapist entertainment, incredibly, with not one boring part! See it.</fullReview>

Stargate has excellent direction, pacing, special effects and musical score. The only knock against it, in my opinion, is the unrealistic direction of photography in the lighting department. Some of the scenes are lit almost like TV sets, and a better job could have been done with creating more convincing realism throughout the film. But this movie makes no claims to be art.

		<shortDescription>The beginning of a fantastic voyage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a longtime fan of the Stargate franchise, I will admit that I am slightly biased. However, this movie introduced me to the rest of the franchise and spurred me to watch the show, something that I was not inclined to do beforehand.Due to its relatively low reviews initially, I didn't intend to see the film at the time of its release. I was a kid, and I had just seen Star Wars, i wanted space battles and stuff blowing up and lasers. The movie Stargate is nothing like that, although the show has progressed slightly in that direction. It's about an epic journey which starts with the struggles of an archaeologist whose controversial (and often ridiculed) viewpoints turn out not only to be true, but the foundation of his work sets the tone for the future of the human race. The twist here is that he studies something so old - Ancient Egypt - without the understanding that his work is actually setting the foundation for something far, far more grand.So enters Daniel Jackson, the true protagonist of the film. He is recruited by the US Air Force into deciphering the hieroglyphics upon an eponymous structure known as the Stargate. He discovers that the symbols are six star addresses formed by different constellations which pinpoint locations in space, with a seventh point of origin. Using this knowledge, a team led by Colonel Jack O'Neill (O'Neil in the movie, but for the sake of continuity, leave it as such) along with Jackson ventures through the Stargate and finds a new threat - the ancient Egyptian God Ra is actually an alien lifeform who enslaved the human race in its infancy and transported many to this new world (later known in the show as Abydos).The most defining feature of the show is that, while old and somewhat archaic, sometimes clichéd, it has touching moments which many other sci fi films fail to include. The scene where Jackson and Shau'ri interact, trying to speak to each other without a common language, speaks more than dialogue. His interaction with Colonel O'Neill fairly significantly foreshadows their relationship throughout the rest of the series.All in all, a good movie that has been severely underrated by people trying to judge a film on the standards of hefty CGI, high-flying action, and impatience. It's not perfect, but it is one hell of a ride.</fullReview>

Read about it in Wickipedia. The young man who wrote Stargate took them to court with witnesses to prove he wrote it. He won. They settled out of court. This is how Delvin and Emmrich have the right to do a second movie, if they can come up to the standard the original writer brought to the movie Stargate. I doubt it. I doubt it. When your the type that steals from others to have a good story, your not going to produce a second story to match someone else's work. It would be great if they would go back to the original writer, pay him to write a sequel. That would work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While the acting and visual effects in this movie make it just an average sci-fi film, the story is so original that it's like nothing you've seen before. Not that it was a terrible movie, it was decent, but the plot alone is almost enough to give it a 10/10 rating. It's a real intelligent thriller. You don't have to be a rocket scientist (or an Egyptologist) to enjoy it, but if you are, you will certainly find value in the quality story told here. It's so good, it's almost a waste of a story to make into a movie. This should have been a novel, or a series of novels, as there is almost no way to tell a story of this epic proportion in a 2 hour film, let alone a trilogy of films. Do not confuse this with Stargate SG-1 (though one of my favorite shows), it is not 'corny' at all like the TV series spin-off. I can't say much more, as I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't seen it. It's just one of those movies that you have to just 'experience' the first time, with no bias or prior knowledge of the plot. Seen the TV series? Doesn't help, but it won't ruin it for you either. Definitely a movie worth seeing or owning, and not just for sci-fi and action fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of my favorite "junk food" films. Cool premise. Some very gratifying moments. Unfortunately, it DOES contain at least two grievous technical errors that I'd like to point out:1st - A group of archaeologists has uncovered a gigantic torus buried under cover stones in the desert. Of course, the first thing they do with this ancient artifact is hoist it up on edge (the most physically unstable position for this geometric shape)!!2nd - When the away team travels to this alien planet, the communications equipment they take is SATELLITE BASED! Who's satellites do they plan on using??Apart from that (and the obligatory sacrificial retard), a generally impressive movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT*James Spader and Kurt Russell travel through the Stargate. They land on a planet on the other end of the galaxy. This planet holds many answers as to how the pyramids were made and other tidbits of Egyptian culture. Conflict arises when they upset the "God" of this new world. I was disappointed. Didn't like it. This is a typical problem with science fiction. You have an idea, (Guess where the pyramids really came from? Outer Space! Isn't that cool? Let's make a movie about it!), but it's not enough to sustain interest for 90 minutes. So they're working on the Stargate, wondering what does it all mean etc. I'm sitting there hoping there is something cool to see on the other end of the galaxy via the Stargate. When they finally reach their destination, it's a very mundane world that awaits them. There is barely any action in the flick as well which is also a letdown.I mean, couldn't the Stargate have led them to a planet full of monsters? Or maybe a robot planet? Anything but humanoids under the "Ra" dictator. Oh well. It just didn't excite me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have no idea what Acke in Malmö, Sweden means when he says: "why not get actors with a proper Swedish accent instead of this Swedish with a clear resonance of American..."In the initial scene of Stargate, "Professor Langford" (actor Erik Holland, born in Norway - a country with almost the same language as Sweden) says when seeing the raising of the Stargate from the excavation site in Egypt: "Herregud, vad är det?" ("Oh my god, what is that?"). This he says (strangely enough!) with an accent that could easily pass as the Swedish accent spoken by native Swedish speaking people in Finland. The younger actors reply to his remark is "Jag önskar jag visste det" ("I wish I knew"). I have replayed this scene a couple of times on my VCR and this last comment could definitely pass as a Norwegian or Dane (or anyone else with a very convincing sense of imitating Scandinavians) speaking Swedish.However, it is a mystery why Viveca Lindfors still speaks English with a clear Swedish accent after all her years as an international movie star :)I write this as a part-time teacher in Swedish!</fullReview>

Sadly, this has also turned out to be Kurt Russell's last good movie. He's most likely going to have to establish himself in some quirky independent film, to make himself known again. There are quite a few things I especially enjoyed about this film, particularly the set design. While some of the plot lines had major holes, overall, it was quite enjoyable. I mean, Dave Chappelle and French Stewart in a serious movie. Quite unusual. But one last question to ponder: What happened to James Spader and Jay Davidson?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Sci-Fi Action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched the director's cut of this movie on DVD recently and was quietly impressed. Make no mistake, it follows an action adventure format that we all know - American heroes save the world from nasty aliens. I know what you're thinking - sounds a bit lame right?In a way it is - it depends on what kind of films you like. If you enjoy exciting but implausible action, great stunts and effects, magnificent sets and a dash of humour - Stargate fits the bill. It's no classic and isn't the best movie of the action genre (True Lies, T2 or Aliens anyone?) but it achieves what it sets out to do, and that's the mark of a decent film in any genre. It's certainly better than more recent efforts including 'The Mummy' and the steaming pile of camel excrement that is 'Lara Croft: Tomb Raider.'Don't expect to be blown away completely, as some parts of the movie drag a little and there's the usual sentimentality (hero falls in love, good guys win against the odds etc.) Despite this, if you don't overly analyse it, you'll most likely enjoy it. How much just depends on your personal taste in films.  </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great idea but somewhat plodding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Egyptian/alien connection is somewhat overdone but a Stargate is a nice idea. For some reason, this is a very difficult movie to evaluate. Stargate seems to be the kind of movie that should have existed in trilogy form or two movies at the least and it seems like a lot of material could have been added. The movie is not very deep or developed as a lot of things happen and the world beyond the Stargate gets a pretty quick once over. The characters are a little bland and one-dimensional and the action is ok. Even with all this, though, the movie is pretty enjoyable and feels like a near miss. I just can't get over the feeling that this movie wanted to be about ten hours but was seriously condensed.6.4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a really excellent piece of film. I also love ancient Egypt and anything connected to it, and this really did fascinate me. After seeing it on TV about three years ago I bought the video and now must have watched it a thousand times since then. It's such an intriguing film. Jaye Davidson (Ra) looks stunning (and scarily feminine like as in The Crying Game), James Spader (Jackson) has his character to a tee. I never thought he was any good at acting but he's so annoyingly watchable in this. Those glasses suit him. I'm still not convinced about Kurt Russell (Col O Neill), this really isn't his sort of movie material. And that cute guy from Third Rock, French Stewart (Feretti?) is SO whiny and annoying. Shoot him someone.This is an action adventure movie, with a touch of human emotion that balances it just right. Nice cast and lovely music. It's a shame they didn't just leave the concept of Jackson staying and the remaining 3 soldiers going back. It's a nice ending. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Adventure is rare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is truly an underrated film. As others have said the score is incredible, David Arnold captures the adventure and excitement and the spirit of the film. Although I would prefer to watch Indiana Jones or Star Wars over Stargate, I prefer to listen to the Stargate sountrack over the others. As my summary says there are very few good adventure fantasy films anymore. Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Back to the Future, and now Stargate. Although it certainly isn't as good the above 3 epics, but that doesn't mean that the film is bad. It has all the elements that make a great adventure; 3-dimensional characters, exciting stories, a rebellious uprising against a superior oppresive enemy, classic battles (not the blood-soaked over-the-top action sequences from films like the Matrix or stuff from Ahnuld and Stallone), and that element of mysticism and mystery that gave the Indiana Jones movie their style. There were only two major problems that I found with Stargate: 1) Cliche military characters: the military characters in this film are definately your typicical, predictable and cheesy military movie guys. The main stargate team was for the most part excempt from this with the exception of the first scenes with Colonel O'Neil (Kurt Russel) at the Stargate facility. This is a bit distracting at first, but since they only appear in the begining of the film, it's not a huge problem. 2) Ra: I think Jaye Davidson really pulled off the Ra villain, but I think the writers didn't do a very good job of arousing negative feelings towards Ra from the audience. The goal of the protagonists in this film was to overthrow Ra, and I don't think they made it clear EMOTIONALLY why he was the bad guy. They told us how he enslaved Earth in the past and brougt them to the desert planet and made them mine, and he shot at them a few times, but that was only half-way. Mentally we knew that he was the bad guy and needed to be overthrown but we need to that emotionally. I think the problem was that Ra lived like a king and didn't do anything by himself. He had other people retalliate against the slaves, he had other people fight for him, all the while he was living the good eternal life in his spaceship. In Star Wars: A New Hope, Darth Vader kills Captain Antillees (the Captain of Princess Leia's ship in the opening scenes of the film) and by the end of the film he has killed Obi-Wan Kenobi HIMSELF and personally flown his TIE Fighter against Luke and killed many of his wingmen inlcuding his lifelong friend Biggs Darklighter, and he even fried Artoo-Detoo.But overall I love Stargate. There are just too many movies that are lobbed into the action/adventure catagory that have no adventure at all, and Stargate manages to succeed as a decent adventure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emmerich sure as hell knows his Indy and his Star Wars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a lot that can be said about Emmerich's films. The Patriot was well done, but sometimes a bit ?too much'; Godzilla had some good effects but it also had bad ones, plus a thin script and lousy actors; Independence Day had a lot of action, explosions and brainless entertainment which are all as well good and bad points. Although they were all not great, Independence Day and The Patriot both had some quality in them. They were both well made and had decent scripts. The Patriot on one hand had emotion and worked out characters, where Independence Day had action and entertainment (kind of a theme park ride). This film combines the good parts of both those films, without having in it the bad parts and is therefore easily Emmerich's best (with UniSols a good second) although Box Office Statistics might suggest otherwise. This film just say, hell it screams QUALITY. Everything is great here, costumes, sets, actors, music, effects, the scripts, photography, direction and etceteras, etceteras, etceteras. I think this film should have at least gotten a couple of Oscar Nominations for costumes and music, but hey, WHO AM I???To me it seems, that when Emmerich wrote this one together with Devlin, he really payed attention to what makes movies great. I would take a bet that he watched the Indiana Jones Trilogy and maybe even the Star Wars Trilogy prior to writing this. I mean even if he didn't he sure as hell remembered what made those movies as great as they are (even today).Just as in Indy, the background for this film is formed, by a mysterious ancient culture and a finding in the early twenties of the 20th century. It just promises: ADVENTURE. An adventure that is packed (as was Indy) with a bunch of jokes; action and epic / feel-good music.The Star Wars factor I spoke of earlier which might have been of influence is, that Emmerich created (as Lucas did in Star Wars) a world of it's own. But now only that. He also succeeded in giving the characters depth and emotion and by doing that, he was able to let the viewer (us) be dragged into this spectacle. Emmerich has done something with the genre of Sci-fi adventure, which I have missed since the original Star Wars trilogy and something that will not easily repeated. I must really praise some actors here I feel, but it might not be those, everyone expects me to. Of course, James Spader and Kurt Russell did what they were supposed to, but I feel they only did their job good. There were however people in this movie which did their jobs great and by that exceeded Spader and Russell. I'm talking about Jaye Davidson (Ra), Alexis Cruz (Skaara) and Mili Avital (Sha'uri). Those three ?kids' are excellent in this film and they really stand out above Spader and Russell.8,5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If You've Got the Patience, Give This One a Shot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Read the script for Stargate, and you can see why someone would have liked to have made this movie. It is simply a well written film about rebellion in a futuristic place(a bit like Star Wars?) Yet, upon watching the film, one's opinion of the story may begin to suffer, if only slightly. Although the acting leaves little to be desired, the special effects at times appear too amateur-like, as if this was a made-for-television film. At times it moves a bit slowly as well, and it seems as though they tried to fit too many ideas into one film. Perhaps Stargate would have been better suited for a trilogy. It was easy to shrug off my small complaints however, as the film drew to a close in what I consider a spectacular ending sequence. Science Fiction fans (especially Star Wars fans, such as myself) should give this one a shot, but the movie is not for everyone. Many of the people I spoke to did not speak as highly of this film as I do, saying that it drags on too long and the story is not developed enough. If you have the patience, however, I recommend you give this one a shot.</fullReview>

The theatrical version was NINE-TENTHS of an epic. What a shame, for the addition of just 9 minutes of footage makes all the difference. The butchering of STARGATE to accommodate less than one additional showing per screen per day is the worst travesty since the butchering of THE ABYSS. Worse, when one considers how little running time makes such a difference. In any version STARGATE might not have generated the kind of awe given STAR WARS. However, the film MOST CERTAINLY would have generated at least one sequel and have given the syndicated series an even greater lease on life.By placing an earlier focus on RA (Jaye Davidson), the SPECIAL EDITION gives the character a great deal more weight, and the story advances with much greater suspense and excitement. Later scenes inside the Pyramid, and RA's spacecraft, which I found hopelessly confusing in the theatrical release, now make perfect sense.Home Theater has never been more affordable. I purchased mine for about what I spend in two years of going to the movies . Couple this fact with the recent bankruptcy of most, if not all of the major theater chains, and it may not be long before `Special Editions' are the norm. At that point, we may witness a director's original vision, not a hack job by a studio caving to the National Association of Theater Owners. In any event, anyone who has seen STARGATE owes it to themselves to see this SPECIAL EDITION. Anyone who hasn't seen STARGATE owes themselves the treat of witnessing a genuine epic science fiction film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, Stargate has it weaknesses, but what Sci-Fi moviedoesn't? It was a box office hit and even has a spin-off TVseries, so it is evident that this movie captured the imagination of moviegoers worldwide. Special effects were fantastic as were the costumes of Ra's Guards. Stargate wasn't a success on it's effects alone, the castingwas excellent, the acting above what one comes to expectfrom a sci-fi movie, plus it was just a damn good story. Stargate is a sci-fi classic in the same class withForbidden Planet and the Star Wars Trilogy. Rating 8</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stargate delivers the goods. You've got ancient Egyptian mythology tied in with an interesting concept on who built the pyramids at Giza. James Spader is recruited by the military to decipher strange markings on a stone tablet. He is later shown what was under the stones. A giant metal wheel that when activated, will transport you to an unknown destination. Once the gate is activated, Kurt Russel and team go through to explore what's on the other side. For those who haven't seen Stargate and wish to watch it untainted, I'll say this. There may be flaws in the film, and you may find some things hard to believe, but just go with it. Stargate is an enjoyable film that transports you to the farthest reaches of the universe, and plunges you into a world that is at the same time alien, but familiar.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though the plot was full of holes, I enjoyed this flick. One of the worst things I saw that has yet to be mentioned here, was that Russel and his two lieutenants (and Spader), supposedly experienced military men, stood silhouetted at the top of a dune looking at the alien city, rather than peeking over the top, and sure enough, are soon spotted.The archaeology here is probably all crap, but it is richly detailed crap. You have to hand it to the filmmakers for the sets and costumes. In spite of its flaws, this film is at least somewhat original, something you don't find in Hollywood very often.I have never heard of the long version mentioned below. Sounds interesting. Also, I wonder why the correspondent from Egypt is so chauvinistic about the pyramids, etc., when the current population of Egypt is Arab, and not descended from the ancient Egyptians.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great, watchable film - - whatever . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers!! (imagine red light flashing and siren wailing)Interesting masonic story about aliens creating a great civilization, though a brutal one. Throw in Hollywood's fascination with guns, and you've got the making of a fair to decent B-movie.And that's what this is. The plot makes no sense, of course. Across the universe, in real time, live these . . well. Given the speed of light, we don't know where the other side of the universe is, in real time. What we see in the sky is the image of what happened millenia, eons, in the past. But, that will never stop the true sci-fi buff.And there are the dials and whatchamahavits in the converted silo, tracking probes across . . . the universe, and even measuring the degree of 'dematerialization' when the explorers first set off. It's something to behold - as well as the vacant expressions in the majority of actor's faces in this tale; truly is Hollywood the proper repository and gathering place for the mindless, the spiritually numb and the classic bimbo? Everybody has a place in society, seems the message.Then there's the aliens, and their weird space ship. Apparently, all the space is taken up with sliding panels and banquet halls, or something, because apart from some kids, there seems not much of a crew - else the US Marine explorers, not to mention the fed up villagers pushed too far by the latest retaliatory attack, would not so easily overwhelm a couple two or three recticulated armor guys holding supercharged cattle prods. There would be more ID4 fighter ships and more pilots, more cattle prod guys, prob. even more kids hanging around the throne room. But as it is the whole imposition of imperial rule thing seems the work of a skeleton crew, at best.As for the story, generally, and the f/x, again - interesting. Watchable. Foolish, silly, but really a film you can watch again and again. It is TOTALLY unbelievable. And maybe that's what makes a true and genuine film. The cliches are comfortable. The heroism is canned. The evil is the brutally simplistic god of machinery and technology. Rehashed Egyptian sets from the silent movie era, Shiek of Araby nomads, tyrannical alien invaders with gee-whizmo devices, and of course American marines ready to fall into formation and commence firing - Hollywood people DO love them guns (even if they don't live in Hollywood - maybe it's all just Hollywood in their head).So. Great film. Whatever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tedious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the handful of films to emerge from the sterile gates of MGM in recent years, "Stargate" was a surprise hit at the box-office, even beating more high profile items like "Mary Shelly's Frankenstein." In Hollywood, the verdict was that science-fiction was much hotter than anyone had believed, and a s/f flick needn't be associated with the "Star Wars" or "Star Trek" franchises to rake in the dough. Then again, maybe Kurt Russell is more popular than anyone thought. But let's not overlook the possibility that some filmgoers were simply curious to know how androgynous Jaye Davidson, Dil from "The Crying Game," fared in his second major film role. Davidson plays Ra, the virtual ruler of a distant planet to which a crew led by Russell travels for reasons that may make sense to regular viewers of "Star Trek" (any version), but will likely baffle anyone else.The conflict is provided by the mismatched pairing of the macho, by-the-book Russell and a nerdy archaeologist (or something) played by James Spader who is interested in accomplishing more than his superiors want him to on this strange pyramid laden planet. It is Davidson, who appears only in the film's last half-hour or so, who commands the screen with his curious presence, but the soft English accented voice that perfectly matches his appearance never made it onto the soundtrack. Instead, Davidson is dubbed with a guttural voice apparently meant to accent his other-worldly manner."Stargate" has the kind of special-effects you'd expect from a big budget s/f epic, though none of them are particularly unique. The sets, especially those pyramids, are an eyeful, however. Science-fiction fans may rate this higher than those who, like me, are as enthusiastic about the genre as they are about musicals. Then again, they might not. I found it tedious.</fullReview>

The story was rather original , the characters were interesting and of course the special effects were terrific. It isn't often that Hollywood releases original sci-fi fare, opting instead to financially back material from previous sources such as books or old television shows. This unfortunately proves the theory of bankrupt creativity and the lack of original concept ideas from the studios. When the movie was first released 4 years ago in theatres, it was an unexpected surprise box office hit, ($71 million domestic gross I believe). In my opinion, "Stargate" deserved every penny!No sequels please!</fullReview>

Non military personnel or advisers typically carry an honorary Officers rank, and get that respect from everyone... quite clear the writers have no idea what they are doing... ruined the movie for me, all the high tech does not hide that fact. Funny thing is as far out as this seemed, there is a core of truth in the lost tech of ancient civilizations. Something main stream science and the feds would rather not have as common knowledge.

		<fullReview>I liked this movie from the first time I saw it, as a child. It fired up my imagination, to say the least :) There is ring that transports people to another planet, a scary alien with even scarier guards that pretends he is a god, and lives in a pyramid, and bunch of people brought from earth to be his slaves. And a lot of action, explosions, and drama...That's how i saw this as a kid. I simply loved it, but I never caught it on TV again, and Internet wasn't around then. Then i managed to find it on DVD, and said, I want to see it with grown up eyes, if it really was that good....And, re-watching I found out that it was even better. Now i saw that the acting was great, especially from Spader and Kurt. The directing, well, it's Roland Emmerich, that's enough said....The ideas in the movie are brilliant. First, about the stargate itself, the device that as it turned out, opened a new, fresh way of telling stories in sci-fi. Then, the god being an alien, pyramids being landing sites...Well, i cannot really say more than it's already said about it; the movie is a cult classic, it spawned 3 TV shows, and 2 direct to DVD movies as of today. I regret that Emmerich didn't make it a trilogy, maybe it would be more fitting (I didn't like the SG-1 series much), but I'm happy that we have this nonetheless :) I recommend this to anyone who likes sci-fi, and even to those who don't, because I think it's hard not to find it interesting..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stargate is a science fiction film starring James Spader as a cunning linguist and Kurt Russell as a military action hero with the worst haircut imaginable. After the government has Spader decipher an ancient Egyptian writing, they are able to open a portal which leads to the great unknown. This unknown turns out to be another planet millions of light years away, which mysteriously looks exactly like Egypt.As far as science fiction goes, this one is pretty entertaining. It's not technical enough to scare off the casual viewer, but is original enough to attract even the most reserved of science fiction purists. Are there flaws or plot holes? Of course. Most movies have these things. But you won't find them unless you're looking for them. And besides, where else will you get to see James Spader looking like the kid from those 1980s Encyclopedia Britannica commercials but getting a woman no geek deserves. You know the commercial I mean, where the kid has a report due on space? If you're a conspiracy theorist or believe in aliens as the creators of the pyramids, you're a complete nutcase. But also, this might be the film for you. Because they get to explain the connection between aliens, Egypt and the dawn of civilization. Those plot holes I mentioned above? Your love of conspiracies will help fill those in.But seriously, overall this film had a great plot, good acting, and moved at a respectable pace to keep you in the flow. Unless you have some serious aversion to science fiction or Kurt Russell, you won't have a problem watching this film. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stargate is a good movie, a classic adventure movie where adventurers find a big shiny piece of science, use it, end up somewhere far far away and encounter a dangerous enemy that wants to destroy the earth. Based on Egyptian mythology, Stargate the movie is merely the beginning of an epic that includes two TV shows.With great special effects (especially the guards face masks and the way they disappear into their armour, not to mention the weaponry) and lavish sets, you can really believe that the team has ended up on a far off, alien world.The characters are great to watch in action, especially the interplay between O'Neill and Jackson. Then there's the evil Ra, who sets the standards for the Gou'ald in the TV show.The climatic final fight is nicely done and you get a real sense of urgency with O'Neill being unable to de-activate the nuke and Daniel facing off against Ra.

		<fullReview>The title alone is enough to fascinate those who love believable sci-fi. This movie is not as far reaching as some would have us think. It links fiction with fact, as we know the military have underground sites. Following in the footsteps of "Close Encounter of the Third Kind", Stargate is a great follow-up, bringing it into the 21st century. In the previous movie the beings are consistent with what many believe aliens might look like, and what many think has been happening for years. In Stargate, we see new possible beginnings. This is just one good version with enough special effects and great acting to hope someday this is feasible. It is worth watching, over and over, each time seeing something that was previously missed. Thoroughly enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a fan of the series, I particularly enjoyed this movie because of the striking resemblance to the series Stargate SG-1. The recurrent characters of Skaara and Sha'uri were also very appreciable. The special effects, given the date (1994) of production, were quite enjoyable as well. However, this is more of a movie which is suitable for sequels, although this was compensated by the production of Stargate SG-1. Altogether it's not an overstatement to say that this is a movie well worth a 8/10, which, in contrast to the 6.3/10 it receives at this moment, is a score more fitting a movie of this quality. One of the reasons I'm especially drawn to the movie and series, is the originality of it all, you can't argue that this is one of the most well-thought-of concepts in recent history.</fullReview>

It's a great story that starts out in Giza in 1928 unearthing the alien device known as the Stargate, ending up with an airforce team going through the Stargate and meeting a primitive culture who still believe in the old Egyptian gods. It all seems to be going good thanks to a little pendant given to Daniel Jackson, then the pyramid where the second Stargate is begins to glow a little. There's a low hum, a spaceship lands on the pyramid, and we meet Ra, an alien who rules the planet as a tyrant.Anyone who enjoys sci-fi movies will like this one. great action, funny moments, interesting effects and great music.

There you will experience untold adventure and fall for a beautiful and sexy slave chick.

The premise of the alien using the human race as a fuel supply is another twist on a myth of ancient gods. My only question here is, why just the poor old Egyptians? Why didn't they grab people from all over?And I reckon it works great. Brilliant visuals, fantastic sound (partic on the Director's Cut DVD), and how many movies quote from it?

Simple the plot may be, the premise (though quite questionable to the archaeologic community) is plausible enough to mystify the audience. The effects are good, if not exceptional at the time the movie was made. And the elements used for the movie are enough for the audiences to relate. While personally not being a bonafide critic, I rate a movie on how much it has entertained the moviegoers at the time it was released, or even when it's released in video for the latter generation to watch.

		<shortDescription>One of the finest Sci-fi Gems of the 90's.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the creators of " Independence Day" Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin presents a fascinating and uniquely entertaining Sci-fi Fantasy Epic starring Kurt Russell and James Spader. The movie deals with an ancient Alien Egyptian Ring that has been buried for centuries has been re-discovered and it sends a militant group into another dimension filled with weird creatures and Egyptian-like Aliens who plan on taking over the universe. Highly recommended if you love " Independence Day", this is one underappreciated moive.Other similar movies recommended: The Fifth Element, Independence Day, The Dark Crystal, The Princess Bride, Spaceballs, Big Trouble in little China, Escape from New York, The Mummy, Universal Soldier, Roland Emmerich's Making Contact, Star Wars, Return of the Jedi, The Secret of NIMH, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Highlander, The Phantom Menace, Return of the Jedi, The Mummy Returns, Attack of the Clones, Tron, Starship Troopers and Total Recall.9/10 ( near perfect but only ID4 is Emmerich's best.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stargate. What can be said? The plot is well written and well played from, start to finish. It has become one of my favorite movies. It begins when a large, mysterious ring is found. Scientists try to figure it out, but have a difficult time. In comes Daniel Jackson, who decyphers the symbols. They realize that it is a stellar travel device. Troops, including Daniel Jackson and Colonel O'Niel (Played by Kurt Russel, an excellent actor) From then on, the action begins. But you'll have to see the movie for that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good casting and characters, cinematography</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Masterpiece of artistic expression as well as an above average plot earn this movie much of my admiration. Having grown up on Star Trek and Star Wars, 'Stargate' is a real treat.An unusual role for James Spader, who plays a somewhat nerd-ish linguist Daniel Jackson and becomes involved in a government plan (faulted as it is) to attempt to contact another world through the ancient teleportation device Stargate.Also a notable performance for Kurt Russel, who portrays a venerable military colonel who is 'reactivated' after losing his only son to a freak gunshot incident. A contradictionto some of his other 'shoot-em-up' roles, his character O'Neil has some depth and is certainly worth a watch.Overall, a good casting job as well as some creative cinematography and historical foundation make this a jewel in the sand of teen horror movies and their sequals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The convergence of science and myth is beautiful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a disturbing trend in science fiction movies. More a history than a trend, since it dates back to the 1970's with Star Wars, where it was every bit as disgusting as it is today. They take great sci-fi films and add stupid muppets to create aftermarket opportunities. The big slobbery creature? Is that a snuffleupagus from Dr. Seuss or what?But wait. Hold the presses! Did he say great sci-fi? You bet your Phillip K. Dick. The first half of this film is magical. James Spader is wonderful as the unappreciated genius who can read ancient tablets like you'd read a billboard. He singlehandedly deciphers the greatest mystery of all time; an instruction manual for a space portal left behind by none other than the god Ra himself.The convergence of science and myth is beautiful. The Stargate may be the greatest movie artifact since the Maltese Falcon. When Spader solves the mystery of its operation, what should have been the greatest adventure of all time begins.Once on the other side, we find the obligatory retrograde civilization enslaved by the evil god. A mining colony? Are you kidding me? The last surviving member of an ancient super-race, and they still need to dig ore up by hand? I must admit, the pyramid guards are a brilliant touch, but that hokey village? Please!But never fear, Jaye Davidson to the rescue. The ultimate crossdresser is a supreme being who pulls this movie back from the brink of Sesame Street? Why not? He drips with arrogance and attitude. He's perfect as the menacing deity inhabiting the body of a human boy. Sure Kurt Russell, armed with his crew cut and zippo lighter, is bound to kick his 10,000 year old ass, but not before we see what he's really made of.I would rather have seen a great sequel than the lame cable series that followed, but this movie stands on its own, and does it well. Thank god for DVD. I watch the first half of this movie regularly, skip over the middle, and watch the grand finish. The special edition DVD is much better, not to mention being a single sided disk, unlike the original.It would be a sin not to mention the magnificent Vivica Lindfors, who lends an unexpected style and grace to the film. She passed away a year after the film was released, and her talent and beauty, never fully appreciated in Hollywood anyway, are greatly missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The only film by Emmerich I actually liked!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stargate is the only movie by Rolland Emmerich I actually liked. Independance Day was bad and Godzilla was absolutely horrible, but Stargate is an above-average action film and a good sci-fi movie. The story is a bit rushed, but is still very satisfying, the actors are perfect for there roles and the special effects are very good. Also, this movie takes the time to create an interesting sci-fi universe. It never is as good as movies like Star Wars or Blade Runner, but it should not be compared to those classics. It's also much better than another recent Egypt-inspired movie: the horrible Indiana Jones rip-off The Mummy. That is why, even if it's not a masterpiece, Stargate is a movie that I liked and respect. It's a very good pop-corn movie that is much better than most movies of this kind.7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many things can be said about this movie,good or bad I found it original and simply refreshing. I have watched the movie several times and enjoy it every time. The plot is the main attraction being the stagnate one of the best sci-fi devices I have ever seen or thought about for that much. James Spader is an excellent actor, I like the fact that he prefers to accept roles on low-budget movies, its simply evidence of his great character. Kurt Russell what can I say, you have got to love the man, he knows how to get things going. The rest of the cast does a good job and RA is a great villain. We have action, we have a love story, we have all the ingredients for a movie that will keep us glued to the screen. Roland Emmerich great plot, original and a sci-fi n?1, I especially loved the whole idea of interplanetary travel in mere seconds and the Ancient Egyptian secrets explained. Well done!!!!!!!!

		<shortDescription>Stargate, second-rate, not the first movie you'd want to see tonight.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although it's hardly a good movie, Stargate is yet another one of those movies that I can't completely dislike because I was the appropriate age when I first saw it. With its elaborate special effects and action sequences, ridiculous yet imaginative plot and cheerfully broad characters, this is a movie that speaks to the fourteen-year-old inside all of us. And yes, I was fourteen when I first saw it on the big screen.First of all, this movie is basically a nerd's dream come true, with James Spader playing Daniel Jackson as the quintessential nerd who gets a chance to prove his theories about ancient Egypt when a woman working with the US government enlists his help translating some writing found on a mysterious artifact. Right down to the fact that he leaves his coffee mug perched on a metal pipe as he hurries into a meeting, Spader's performance is pitch-perfect.The whole first act is so good, as we watch Spader at work and the suspense builds toward the opening of the Stargate, that it's almost a shame the movie didn't make better use of the Stargate and give it a bigger payoff. A more profound film might have put the journey into the Stargate at the climax of the story, and the result could have been something like the mind-blowing trip at the end of 2001: A Space Odyssey or the walk into the spaceship at the end of Close Encounters of the Third Kind.But this movie has other ideas, so Spader joins Russell and his presumably crack team of soldiers (we never really learn much about them) on a reconnaissance mission through the Stargate to explore whatever lies on the other side.SPOILERS AHEAD! My favorite shot of the movie comes when Spader and Russell walk a distance out into the desert that they find on the other side of the Stargate, then turn around and see that they've just walked out of a pyramid with three alien moons above it. It's the sort of simple yet striking visual that distinguishes the best science-fiction: it's done in the style of a pulp magazine cover, but it's intriguing and leaves a lot to the imagination.Unfortunately, the movie hits a snag at about the same time Spader does: finding a strange animal, he stands in the exact spot that allows him to be caught in the animal's harness and dragged, seemingly for miles, to the next location required by the script. This is a stupid plot device: I have no trouble believing in the Stargate, but I can't believe that Spader would suffer no serious injury from being dragged through miles of hot sand.A similarly tacky moment occurs when Spader befriends the chief with a Fifth Avenue bar, an obvious parallel to E.T. (not to mention an obvious bit of product placement). Indeed, the more this movie progresses, the more its patchwork quilt of ideas becomes apparent.When the bad guys finally appear, they come with a bewildering array of hardware that, impressive as it is, seems designed not to evoke ancient Egypt but to facilitate the sale of action figures and plastic play-sets to kids. The movie is rated PG-13 for violence, but even so there's something so irresistibly toy-like about this movie that it's impossible not to think that older children were part of the target audience.For the most part, the special effects and action sequences in this movie are still impressive even after ten years, but what's sorely lacking is a strong human element. This movie "loses its way dramatically," according to Leonard Maltin, but it doesn't so much lose its way as it does lack a dramatic hook even from the very beginning.Characterization is a big problem: with the exceptions of Spader, Russell, and to a lesser extent French Stewart's sardonic soldier, none of the good guys in this movie have any real personality. Motivation, or rather its absence, is another problem: we never understand whether the soldiers volunteered for this mission or whether they were assigned to it, or how they feel about their situation in any case.My favorite scene is the one in which Spader questions Russell about why he came on the mission, and Russell simply says that his son died and he no longer thinks he has any reason to live. I had thought before I watched the scene again recently that Russell went into greater detail about how his son died, but my point is that we at least know how he thinks. Far too many science-fiction movies don't even attempt to explain their characters' motivations: just once I'd like to see a movie of this genre that explains why everyone's willing to do what they do.Anyway, like most other Roland Emmerich movies (notably Independence Day) Stargate has a great first act, a progressively conventional second act and a third act that goes overboard on action and special-effects spectacle. Basically the final reel of this movie turns into Indiana Jones and the Temple of the Stargate, with lots of shooting, blasting, exploding, punching and even a little attempted brain-frying thrown in for good measure.Despite its flaws, I actually like this movie better than most Emmerich efforts. It's a B movie like Independence Day, but not nearly as overblown. It's more energetic and imaginative than either Universal Soldier or Godzilla, and it's not nearly as pretentious as The Patriot.I haven't bothered seeing The Day After Tomorrow yet, because at 24 I'm feeling a little too old for the Roland Emmerich world of entertainment. But there are days, particularly when I'm thinking about Stargate, and how much I enjoyed it at age 14, that I wish I wasn't.Rating: 6 (I like it, but I can't quite recommend it.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.There are films whose appeal fades quickly, and this is one of them. By this, I mean that when I saw it new, it had appeal, but in a recent reviewing it had none. Why?It relied on some special effects, the juxtaposition of science fiction and Egypt, and the effect of a rising star.The special effects were satisfying enough when new. Now, they offend by their cheesiness. I think this should be warning to any film: the arms race of effects ensures that any film that depends primarily on them will have a short shelf life. Even the early Star Wars films are already lost -- of no interest except historical.The notion of mixing some scifi device with Egyptian themes was interesting. But they didn't exploit it creatively enough to stand out in the current crowd. Fifth Element did it better. The Mummy movies had richer -- for now -- effects.What really gave this movie its edge was young Jay. Its hard to describe this now. He really thrilled in `The Crying Game,' where he was supported by strong collaborators. We (at least North Americans) live in such an oddly closed world of sex, he was a real novelty. And that novelty gave this movie an edge it does not have now.You may want to see this, not for its intrinsic merits, but as an example of three things that intrigued, but now do not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Stargate' boldly assumes that its audience has the attention span about as long as your hand. I know that a lot of movies ask you to check your brain at the door but this movie asks you to turn your brain off and don't ask questions later. Here is a special effects movie in which the filmmaker's were so concerned with giving that audience their special effects light show that they cut everything in between to the bare minimum.The movie's opening scenes are so rushed and hurried that I barely had time to grasp if any of the characters had a personality. Turns out that they don't, the scientists and the military personnel are dressed in their required outfits so that the viewer can quickly pick up on what their character's position is and move on.Very quickly now: The movie opens in 1928 in Egypt when an archaeological dig uncovered a large stone ring (this scene is so abbreviated that it almost seems unnecessary). Cut quickly to the present day where scientists are still trying to figure out what it is. James Spader plays a scientist that no one takes seriously. He walks into the room full of scientists, quickly writes the formula for the Stargate on the blackboard while the others look on in stunned silence. The military intervenes and we jump cut to the scenes in which all the major players go through the gate and end up in another dimension which doesn't look a million years removed from Egypt. Got it? Good. Let's move on.Now we get to the money shots. Spader and the military lead by Colonel Jack O'Neal (Kurt Russell) step out of the Stargate and never look twice at the world that they've stepped on. I thought I'd missed something because Russell's initial reaction to this new planet is so bland that I thought that the character had been there before.They discover that this world is being pressed under the thumb of the Sun God Ra played by Jaye Davidson (doing a disastrous follow-up to his heartbreaking role in 'The Crying Game'). He dresses lavishly enough and when he speaks, his voice is mechanized with a synthesizer. His voice is so torturous to listen to that I thought that he was wasting his time having his slaves build pyramids when all he had to do was make a public address.The rest of the movie is a lot of gunfights and explosions. There isn't any depth and the characters never move beyond their occupations. 'Stargate' is a very timid movie. Director Roland Emmerich and writer Dean Devlin mount the film as if the audience is going to walk out if they don't get their special effects often enough. There isn't a moment of wonder or imagination or fun, this movie is a rattling can of special effects, gunshots and oh yeah lotsa blow'd ups.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Roland Emmerich directed this Sci-Fi action film as Kurt Russell plays Col. Jack O'Neil, who, along with Dr. Daniel Jackson(played by James Spader) lead a team of scientists and military personnel as they explore a time/space portal that was found in Egypt, and has only recently been figured out, unlocking its teleporting ability, and sending them to a desert world where an advanced race of human-like beings still practice ancient Egyptian culture, only with modern technology. They are a warlike people, who want to use the re-opened portal for invasion, so of course they must be stopped.Good premise is strangely squandered in this spectacular looking but dramatically flat and unoriginal film. Good cast tries their best, but overlong film never comes close to the 'Star Wars" level of epic storytelling it clearly aspires to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's odd that this movie slipped into obscurity so quickly, while spawning a series that has enjoyed years of success.It's a better watch than the TV show version. The cast, especially Kurt Russell, are stronger than their TV counterparts, and take their roles more seriously. The unfolding plot is organized in superior fashion to that cornball comedy/soap-opera theme its TV progeny fell into. The focus is the mystery, and the wonder of what the strange device is.Research and thought are the key here. An odd arc-shaped object is found in the Egyptian desert. It's readily apparent this object is nothing of modern terrestial origin, so what is it? Where did it come from? What (if anything) does it do, and can it be operated? Scientists look for clues to a key to these questions, and this marks the creativity of the story line.The second chapter of the plot has Kurt Russell leading a platoon of soldiers on an exploratory mission that journeys through the portal. What they find is good fodder, although the second chapter is not as strong in presentation as the first chapter. The intrigue and mystery are soon lost and traded for raw military explosions, making the movie lose some steam. To their credit, the actors support the action well enough to maintain your interest.Average yarn, decent entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enter the Stargate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Usually I give 6's to movies that fall short on the entertainment scale, but this is not the case with Stargate. Rather, I give it a 6 cause it feels too short (apparently, I just heard of a 3 hour extended cut is in existence and would really help remedy this).In truth, Stargate is a lot of fun and worth watching. In fact, I watched it twice (again for the commentary).Love 'em or hate 'em, Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin have helped make some of the most entertaining disaster &amp; monster flicks for this generation to enjoy. Pure fun is what I look for in a film every so often when I wanna stray away from the art-house and just watch something fun, and this is something Dean and Emmerich are generally very good at doing.Emmerich's original baby, which soon also became Devlin's, was the original smash hit that took audiences by storm. A mysterious gate found in the 1920s opens up a pathway to another world, but only one man can open it. And when he does, along with a crew of military personal (with their leader shrouded in a shady past), that's where the excitement begins.The special effects, which were state of the art then, are still relatively nice to look at now. Not all have passed the test of time, like the Anubus head changing guards, but for the most part are watchable. The visual quality of the film is reminiscent of films like Jurassic Park, glowy and lighthearted...yet at its core, dark and sinister.Besides the length, another thing that disappointed me was lack of character development for a few of the characters (which technically can be attributed to the length). I felt like the characters were very engaging and had some great moments here and there, but in the end I didn't think they had sufficient time to full develop into really likable characters. Had they gotten the time to do it (or released this supposed cut), I would've shot the rating up to an 8 automatically.The action itself is nothing REALLY special, it's typical Hollywood. But not in a Steven Seagal cheesy kinda way, thank god. Like the special effects, its watchable.Nothing much else to say except I can't wait for the rumored movie sequels to become fact!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a huge Stargate fan. Love the movie, love the show, love the spin off, and it would not have been possible without this movie. In a genre that can so easily be cheesy or over the top, Stargate tip toes this end but stays shy of it in a good hearted, action packed manor. It's refreshing that the aliens DON'T (for once) speak English. It's only through trial and (many) errors that they can finally communicate and its only the linguist that actually ends up being able to communicate. The interaction between O'Neill, Skaara and the other boys brings a bit of 'real life' into the far depths of the universe. Having (spoiler) lost his son by accidental shooting, its refreshing to see that Jack would not be comfortable with these boys fighting the good fight until it is absolutely necessary. Daniel Jackson, a character I love dearly, brings to the movie an air that yes the filmmakers know they are making a sci-fi movie and that it is dangerous but they will poke fun at it. For example, how Daniel's allergies flair up when he travels, including through the Stargate.All in all, I highly recommend this and the series to any Sci-fi loving fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Gate to the Stars and a Desert</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie Stargate, which introduced (sort of) the concept of instantaneous interstellar travel via a gate made more famous by the subsequent TV series, is most interesting in the first half-hour, when the prospect of uncovering the secrets of the device tantalize the viewer. James Spader conveys this curiosity and channels his quest to discover the gate's secrets to the audience. Lindfors is also very good as an elder scientist who feels Spader is the answer to all the questions. Kurt Russell's range as a military officer is limited here; he's introduced as suicidal due to his son's recent death, but is quite stoic and just grim throughout. He's obviously a 'can do' soldier and leader, but also anticipates his later robotic fighter in "Soldier" 4 years later. After the action moves off Earth to what's on the other side of the gate, our anticipation to find out what's there is rewarded by little more than a variation on "Dune"(84) done in more formulaic style.A formula is what partners Emmerich and Devlin present, as is always the case in their movies - successful formulas, to be sure, but nothing to get surprised over. Even if you know nothing about one of their films beforehand, about 20 minutes in you may have it all figured out. Here, the expedition finds a 'desert' world and are soon expected to help the natives against an alien tyrant (Jaye Davidson, his unusual persona taken advantage of). Are we all surprised by such a plot? Of course not. The special FX are pretty impressive, especially the shots of the huge flying pyramid and some of the landscapes. They also have some impressive crowd shots which add to an epic scale of storytelling. But, there's very little emotional attachment to the unfolding struggle - it's all by the numbers and even Spader can't inject much feeling into any of it. The next project, "Independence Day" was probably more successful because our own cities were being destroyed, not some far-off planet we care very little about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ra gay?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyway, we all know that Ra was harboring queer little boys with shaved butt cheeks (and how soft they were!). The question that entire plot rests on is this: did Ra use godly technology to shave the butt cheeks? Also, throughout the movie, Ra's toes were constantly soggy, given the environmental conditions in Egypt at given time, the degree of saturation seems unlikely. Can someone please shed some light on this issue I recently obtained the DVD in hope that Roland wold divulge some information on the sogginess of RA's toed but I was sadly disappointed. Is it possible that Ra survived the blast because if you listen to his roar before he dies there is a tone of optimism. Hopefully he is back to full strength and has maintained the ability to inhabit humans, making way for a promising sequel. My friend and I have mapped the location for Ra's next slave planet and we are sure that it will be optimal for his purposes. On a second note, why did Ra bring so few followers. Surely he would have supplied his guards with at least more powerful energy rods to ensure that he would be able to maintain the necessary force required to keep his people in order. Please write me back if you have any information regarding SG-1 and specifically the sogginess of Ra's toes. As RA says, "Put away your energy rods now! Its almost nighttime!"

		<fullReview>The movie Stargate is a very good must-see combination of adventure, action and science-fiction. With the sf-technology, Egypts mystery, evil aliens and more the movie just appears to be eye-candy (even though it was made in 1994). The plot is a very interesting non-cliché story, that will keep you in your chair through the entire movie.PS:All those who didn't like the movie lack either sense of adventure and taste or simply the brains to understand the story.Another thing is, that it's a shame there is a rip-off, cheap**** series made, presumably as a follow-up on the movie. The series are crap, don't wast your time on them, they'll only spoil the pleasure you got from the movie. (No wonder non of the original cast wanted to participate in them.)</fullReview>

The idea of this movie was amazing and so creative, there was nothing like this when it came out. The acting is really great by all parties and the script is really well done. The people of Abydos and the people of Earth both have goals in mind that they need to achieve. The aliens on Abydos need to free themselves from slavery while the people from Earth need to find a way home. This movie shows that people can over come great odds and achieve what they want need.

		<fullReview>Great idea, specially for an american blockbuster: after all, the egiptians were "aided" by an alien entity, which ends up being Ra, the sun god. The beginning, as this wild concept unravels, is as gripping and exciting as the indiana jones series, and the journey these characters make towards uncharted territory is also something that makes you watch it endlessly. But the movie starts paying the price of explaining its own ideas, and soon the things that make the plot go forward start making no sense. The ones that stroke me the most was the obsession of Ra in exterminating the entire human race when the only danger to him were the humans present in his own planet, and the way the character of James Spader finds the seventh symbol to activate the gate on the other side. Anyway, the movie has its moments, specially the ones that refer to the alternate version of egiptian history. The character of James Spader is enjoyable and is a much needed source of scientific explaining. Kurt Russel is straight-faced as ever, and Jaye Davidson is limited to act as a feline type, which seems obsessed in its own evilness. Some of it is really innovative, therefore it is disappointing to see it succumb to such a common and clichéd third act.</fullReview>

Right up to the moment when it suddenly turned into "let's just shoot everything in sight" film. I also have to say that I am a huge fan of the TV series, which I think was handled much better than the movie. However, for what this movie is, and the actors they chose, this movie works amazingly well. Spader is excellent, though Russell could have been replaced by almost any other action actor. The representation of the language was done very well, something I wish they'd kept for the television series, and the history of the Stargate and the aliens is nicely thought out, and well-grounded in science fiction. I would recommend this film, but only if you don't take it too seriously. Better than R&amp;E's later Godzilla movie, but nowhere near as good as Independance Day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Stargate' follows the adventures of Colonel Jack O'Neill (Kurt Russell) and Doctor Daniel Jackson (James Spader) as they travel to a distant planet through a portal (the titular Stargate) there they discover a culture based on ancient Egypt and ruled by the 'sun god' Ra (Jay Davidson) after befriending the local villagers they try to put an end to Ra's rule by destroying his giant pyramid-ship with a nuclear device. Excellent special effects that still look good even today, good acting from Russell and Spader (and Davidson) and a decent story that holds up, even the little side-notes on Egyptian history and language are fairly interesting as well (accurate or not I wouldn't know). It may not be as good as the TV sequel 'Children of the Gods' or the whole 'SG-1' series but still a very good science fiction film.Rating - 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly enjoyable overall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, let me say that I'm a big fan of sci-fi movies and popcorn flicks, and I also have a fascination with Ancient Egypt. Stargate incorporates all three of those, and I think that's partially why I like it so much. In my opinion, it's great entertainment. Sure, it may not be a deep, highly philosophical movie, but it's not supposed to be. It's a fantastic movie to just sit back, relax, and be transported to another world for a few hours. Just a few quick highlights: Overall, I thought the acting was good. Not mindblowingly fantastic, but definitely good. I especially thought James Spader did a fine job as the geeky scientist Jackson, and Jaye Davidson was excellent as Ra. I also liked Alexis Cruz' performance as Skaara--especially the cigarette-smoking scene. I got a big chuckle out of that one.The score was a big highlight of the movie for me. David Arnold did a spectacular job here.I loved the creature effects! An earlier reviewer said, "If they'd made `Stargate' today, that thing {the Mastadge} would have been computer animated, and it wouldn't have been nearly so real or so adorable." I totally agree with this comment. I'm all for computer animation (for example, Gollum in "LOTR: TTT" was superb) but I think there are some cases when it's just better to have "the real thing," so to speak. This is definitely one of those cases.Overall, I think "Stargate" has just the right combination of fluff, special effects, ancient Egypt, and humor to be highly enjoyable. I give it a rating of three and a half out of four.By the way, if you like "Stargate," I recommend buying the Ultimate Edition DVD that just came out. There aren't very many extra features, but the quality is excellent and definitely makes it worth the price.</fullReview>

Some archaeologists find a strange buried device. The American military play around with it, but can't get it to work, so they call in an egyptologist and next thing you know they have opened up a gate in space to a distant planet.It turns out the Egyptian gods were really space travels who used their god like powers to rule humans. They were kicked off Earth, but on this other planet they still rule.Some army guys and the egyptologist go to this planet, fight the space travelers. Oh my God, does good triumph over evil, you will have to watch this movie to find out.While there is some action, it is really the Science Fiction idea that makes this story work. I think this is why so many people like it.Of course it was perfect material for a spin off series, which in itself was good, but it never really managed to capture of the feel of the original movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*** Possible spoilers ahead *** I saw this movie on DVD years after it's theatrical release, but I still remembered the previews I had seen. Those previews instilled in my mind a vision of a great civilization, highly reminiscent of ancient Egypt, on which the Egyptians had based their society. This movie was nothing like that, and what it was did not make up for my disappointment. Stargate is a generic Sci-Fi flick, pure and simple: Meet the bad alien who was banished from one world only to make slaves of the people on another planet. He's more powerful than the good guys, but maybe, if they all band together, they can use his own advanced technology against him. On other notes, I find it hard to believe that in the period of 4000 years or so that these people didn't manage to rebel against Ra. I mean, 4000 years is a long time. That really bothered me while watching this movie. That, and the fact that, despite Ra's cruelty, none of his slaves even seem to consider a revolt. At least, not until the smarter (though not necessarily intellectually superior) humans convince them there is a better way. Then, of course, there's the stereotypical town leader who can't fathom doing anything differently than what has been done for the last few millennia. And what a surprise! When people try to tell him he's wrong, he throws a fit and says they'll be sorry. And wouldn't you know it, he gets a chance to say, "I told you so," but nobody listens to him because he's still wrong. Gee, I wonder if he'll have a change of heart in the end. And I wonder how long those no-name soldiers will last. And I wonder what the loner scientist who falls in love will decide to do in the end. I wonder if that high-tech elevator will come in handy. Do you think the good guys will make it back home? Couldn't they put even an ounce of suspense in this movie? Oh, and it's a good thing such a highly advanced civilization as Ra's still uses buttons and switches. Otherwise his primitive slaves (and those puny humans) might be at his mercy. (I can just see Ra smacking his forehead. "I could have had a V8.") It could have been so much more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Premise, Poor Execution--*1/2 out of ****.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's imagine you walk through a giant ring that is filled with glowing lights swirling around. The next thing you know, you are being warped through a wormhole to the other side of the known universe. And after all that, you arrive to your destination, and what do you say? "What a rush!"? That's line in "Stargate" that gives the perfect example of what is wrong with the movie. The filmmakers had an enormous opportunity to create a whole universe, but end up rehashing old action movie cliches and one-liners, instead of exploring the possibilities. Certainly, in a more intelligent film, the reaction of travelling across the universe would be much greater, and far more profound. All can give thanks to the Emmerich and Devlin team, who obviously believe that if you have lots of special effects, who needs a plot? "Stargate" had the potential to be a film like "Contact", a film filled with wonder that explored discoveries that would affect people all over the world. But no.Dr. Daniel Jackson (James Spader) is an expert of Egyptian archaeology and hieroglyphics who is hired by the military to decode the writings on a mysterious artifact in the form of a stone ring known as the Stargate. I guess the military already read the script since they were ready to enter the Stargate before Dr. Jackson arrived to decode it, and there was no way for them to discover its purpose by themselves. What is also remarkable is how fast Jackson decodes the writings, and an expedition is under way--all in just a few minutes. The preparations for such an extensive and unexplored travel are handled on the same level as any of the adventures found at Disneyland. One of the crew members is Colonel Jack O'Neil (Kurt Russell), a curious case, since the first time we see him, he is sitting in his dead son's room with a gun in hand as if he's going to kill himself. At that same time he is admitted, surprisingly, back in the military.After arriving on the "other side", they discover an Egyptian civilization that is ruled by Ra (Jaye Davidson), the Sun God. Dr. Jackson, is able to communicate with them, although I'm sure their language should have changed drastically from the Egyptian language 4000 years ago. Not much goes on here, except the usual boring scenes in which the military guys try to blend in the new culture, the scientist falls in love the beauty, and everyone plots rebellion against their evil masters. We also learn that Col O'Neil's mission was to blow up the Stargate along with himself. What about his wife we saw earlier in the film? Does he care how his wife is going to feel, especially after they lost their son not long before? Does the military really send suicidal people on secret missions, even for the purpose of killing themselves along with destroying a prized possession?Let's go down the list of a few cliches in this movie: (1) the "loser" scientist who's hired for a special mission (Notice how when everyone walks out of his lecture, the one person who is interested hides and waits in the car outside, mysteriously, instead of just walking right up to him?), (2) a suicidal soldier in need of redemption, (3) a group of scientists talking a bunch of mumbo-jumbo about writings that they obviously know nothing about, (4) the love story between two unlikely people, who can barely communicate with each other, (5) a piece of jewelry with sentimental value, (6) a bomb with a read digital readout, (7) the action climax where all the good guys beat up the bad guys, and (8) the old line "Tastes like chicken".The filmmakers obviously wanted (and have pretty much stated so) this film to be confused with great classics like "Lawrence of Arabia", simply because of the desert setting, I guess. If this film wanted to be an action film, why did it need to drag us all the way across the universe, only to end up in a fight with the bad guys? If it wanted to be a grand epic, why didn't it explore how the discovery of a Stargate could change the world? If a Stargate was actually discovered, do you think the military would be so casual in destroying it? Not a chance! It would be highly protected, and I'm sure many people would think of exercising the possibility of using it for colonization on other planets. What a difference the Stargate could make for humanity! The film, however, doesn't seem to even see this.The acting in this film is mediocre. This film is perfect for Kurt Russell. He's used to playing such shallow roles. But I haven't a clue as to why Jaye Davidson, after "The Crying Game", would want to take part in this lame story. James Spader is also capable of much better roles. This film was just a huge waste of great potential. Indeed, its story is so cheesy and bizarre that I'm sure we'll be seeing it on Mystery Science Theatre 3000 in the next 20 years. This is a story that Edward D. Wood Jr., the worst filmmaker of all time, would have loved to film, and possibly could have written himself.</fullReview>

The story is ridiculous and completely devoid of atmosphere and the main villain is about as frightening as a hairdresser. The initial premise was weak (why didn't they just keep turning the wheel until it worked?) and the ending was predictable. But the major problem was the trip between the start and the end was so dull.And why, whenever marines appear in a movie, is there always one called Kowalski??On the plus side, the graphics are very good. The flushing-down-the-U-bend travel scenes are effective, and the watery toilet bowl that they climb into is effective. Also I love the guards helmets that fold up very nicely indeed.I haven't read the other comments yet, but I suspect there will be a lot of positive ones because the special effects are quite good. But please, trust me on this, IT'S A BAD FILM. If you are going down to the video store, consider reaching for something else like Independence Day (made by the same people, full of flaws, but a roller coaster ride and lots of fun), Contact (similar space travel scenes to Stargate, but much more intelligently carried out) or even The Mummy, which is about as inaccurate on Ancient Egypt (why do they have pyramids in Thebes...???) but it has more laughs and action on the way.</fullReview>

Good special effects throughout, although the digital morphing effects (retracting Egyptian death mask helmets and the close-up of the stargate vortex) could have been slightly better. I liked the space warp effects seen after passing through the stargate. Production design was very good. Good pyramid spaceship and sand storm effects. Very good creature effects. Interesting feeling of power and massive invincibility, conveyed by the 'hi-tec' Egyptian sets. Good use of humorous situations throughout. Although the film was non violent, there was a feeling of terrible violence 'just around the corner'. Apart from the main 'matter transportation to another star system' plot, other themes involved slavery, regeneration of body after death, a love story, a nuclear bomb (arming and disarming) and ancient 'gods' having vast technological powers.There seemed a lack of surround effects (due to the small cinema I was in?), and there was a lot of predictability in the second-half of the story. The film was not over hyped on release, but I had built it up in my mind to expect a better film.The subsequent TV series (especially from season two onwards) was really excellent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Roland Emmerich made something so cool here, so why did he betray us with "Independence Day"?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Stargate" is unlike anything that you've ever seen. Digging in 1920s Egypt, some people find a "stargate" that transports people to another world. In the 1990s, Dr. Daniel Jackson (James Spader) and Col. Jonathan O'Neil (Kurt Russell) decide to try it out. Let me tell you, what they find is more than anyone would expect, especially given that the "Crying Game" guy is there.Considering that "Stargate" is so interesting, it begs the question: why did Roland Emmerich follow it up with "Independence Day"? He went from having a plot to spending two hours blowing things up. I mean really...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the backing for this movie was for sure not air tight, I can think of many plots that when some one spoke the lingo they didn't get it right and probley didn't pratice as well. Like when Jackson put his hanky in his hip pocket and some kid pulls it out then another [Sakara]says what sounds like NOP IT as in stop it, also when the team wakes up then roams the desert then Jack O' Neal runs in the pymared with the others trailing behind, and if you pump up the volume some you can hear the slave kids say WAIT FOR ME JOHN who is John and whom is to edit the film before distribution. Clearly this movie must be a first for someone or at least someone whom has just woken up because some things should be edited out before the public watches it, like when that horse/buffalo animal drags Jackson to a sand heap, Jack hears a horn blow then the camera looks at him looking up and then is behind him looking at a sand heap. Then the series is worse where as the movie said only HUMAN'S exist but the TV show mentions the: ASGUARD, TOLEN, TOKRA, NOX, FURLINGS, and so on then the TV show has all the gua'lds with glowing eyes while in the movie a creature was in a boy (RA) and his eyes glowed as the creature got mad. What a movie maybe some one should re do it like with Battlestar Glactia which makes the old version really stupid. No wounder when stargate alantis came out there is not a glowing eye anywhere, and I hear they are so despert now (Possiblety low ratings) that they will inter mingle with SG-1. They were planing to make a sequel at the end of season 6, but there has been a S-7, an S-8 could happen and I hear a S-9, S-10, S-11, &amp; S-12 could happen but only if there are shows better then Season Seven.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought it was a good movie for it's time. The only thing wrong with it is that half the movie is in a foreign language and it leaves you guessing as to what they are saying. There are entire scenes of like 10 minutes where there was no English at all. Although they did really well with the body language so a lot of the time it wasn't too hard to figure out what they were saying. Still i think the movie would have been better with some subtitles. Overall I thought that the movie was imaginative and fun. I watched it twice in one day. The effects were innovative and the cast was well chosen. Happy viewing.

		<fullReview>The movie, to put it simply, starts out well but gets very slow and boring before picking up the pace at the end. The musical score is decent but does not carry you through the film. Most of the characters are one dimensional and the plot is very predictable. The special effects were good but nothing that hasn't been done before. The film is technically well crafted and the quality shows on the screen. If you like sci-fi, Stargate is worth seeing once. If you have trouble sleeping, buy the video and you'll be out within 30 minutes. Just put the sleep timer on for an hour or else the last 20 minutes will wake you up again! ** out of ****I've read many of the comments on the board that really have nothing to do with the film. From it being a "Western" plot to say that the people of Egypt needed aliens to build the pyramids to Americans have to solve everything with guns. It was a mediocre movie, not a documentary. The person who wrote and directed this film, Roland Emmerich, was born and raised in Germany where he started his film making career.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted to start watching Stargate SG-1 so i decided i should see the movie its based on first. What a mistake. Stargate is about a gate that can go to different planets and galaxy's. David is a cardboard cutout nerd who is brought in to decipher the Stargate and O'Neill is the cardboard cutout no nonsense midlife crisis general whose son "accidentally shot himself". They go into the Stargate and find an ancient civilization and then the poop hits the fan(i can't really give away any more story without it being a spoiler). I know the film sounds really interesting but i just found it boring and cliché. There are some unintentionally laughable lines and some lines that are meant for comedy but aren't funny at all. Its really boring in my opinion and now I'm not interested in the show either. The best part about the movie was Kurt Russel, i really enjoyed his performance as a no nonsense life sucks general, plus i like him in everything. Save your time and watch something better. 1 out of 5.</fullReview>

A group of soldiers along with a scientist (James Spader) travel to another dimension and land on a planet that resembles ancient Egypt.Once there the group discovers they can't return, that is not until Spader decodes a set of hieroglyphs so they can. In the mean time they join forces with the slaves, and by the end of the film they have fought and defeated the God RA and all is well. This film was predictable right from the start with the typical Hollywood clichés and worn out formulas. Not worth even renting.</fullReview>

The world these people ended up in wasn't very new or original, so it wasn't very sci-fi.

		<shortDescription>Very bad movie, and I bought it too!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen. Too bad too, since visually it was really terrific and the acting wasn't bad either. I am a Kurt Russel fan and I don't think his talents were well used here at all. But two things made this movie almost unwatchable. The main thing was the utterly dopey story. The dopiest movie I have ever seen. I mean SciFi does have some rules, after all, but this story was so dopey, that it interfered with my enjoyment of it. I know what you're thinking, it is a movie after all, but this one went too far. The second thing that bothered me is really a little thing, but it is a pet peeve of mine. You know how when armed men move in on their target, how they always cock their guns? A lot of noise effects from that very threatening click-clack of metal on metal? Not that anyone would ever do that in real life, and it's only a movie, I know, and I can take some cocking of guns at inappropriate moments, if that's what's needed to convey an imminent fire fight. But I have never heard so much cocking of guns in any movie before. I felt embarrassed for the actors. It just went on and on. It even interfered with the dialog. OK, here is this soldier moving in on a target with great stealth until he catches his foe unaware, but still quiet though. Then right before he shoots, he shatters the silence by cocking his gun. I mean, gimme a break.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good premise, wasted opportunity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STARGATE Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)Sound formats: Dolby Stereo / DTSUsing an ancient portal recovered from an Egyptian burial site, a group of US soldiers is transported to a distant planet where they uncover a primitive civilization similar to Earth at the time of Pharaoh, ruled by a malevolent alien creature who plots to destroy mankind.Though successful in its day, Roland Emmerich's empty-headed blockbuster wastes a fascinating premise by locating its principal action within a bland alien civilization ruled by an androgynous boy (THE CRYING GAME's Jaye Davidson), a civilization which crumbles to dust within hours of the arrival of Kurt Russell's gung-ho military team, alongside 'dweeb' scientist James Spader (giving the film's best performance as a social outcast who's redeemed by his experiences amongst the stars). Ambitious in scope and execution, the movie is a production/costume designer's dream, overflowing with hybrid Egyptian/alien sets and artefacts, and Emmerich pulls off a number of memorable 'reveals' (the first glimpse of the eponymous Stargate; the moment when Russell and Spader realize they've actually landed on an alien planet; Davidson's entrance from an ornate sarcophagus, etc.), filling the screen with eye-catching sets and thousands of extras. It's grandiose and watchable, but also hollow and disappointing, and the outcome is a foregone conclusion. Also starring Viveca Lindfors, Alexis Cruz and Djimon Hounsou. An expanded director's cut was released in 1996 (the same year Emmerich and producer Dean Devlin hit paydirt with the mega-successful - and equally hollow - INDEPENDENCE DAY), followed by the long-running TV series "Stargate SG-1".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfortunately anyone interested in Egyptian culture will likely want to turn this off...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie had quite the potential to be something special. Afterall, outside of movies like The Mummy you don't see much about Egyptian culture on the big screen, and this being a sci-fi movie I had high expectations that we'd see some new ideas. Unfortunately it appears its just the Mummy with a slightly different skin...The first time I saw this in theater, back when it first released. I was young and naive but even then I saw through some of its clichéd plot devices. Still, it was hard not to like some of the effects and action sequences, even if they seem completely out of place for this kind of setting. I remember being blown away by the stargate sequence itself, but seeing this several years later I could probably whip the whole sequence up on my home PC in less than a day. Some props for the pretty cool masks that partly explain all the animal headed Gods worshipped by the Egyptian people.Too bad the writers felt the need to disregard any research (would it have been too much effort to hire an Egyptologist to look at actual writings and myths within the culture itself?). Had the Stargate shown us a time when the Egyptians were in full bloom it would've made for a much more enjoyable film than veering into alien territory. Lets take a look at the legend of Osiris and Isis for instance, now there's an area that could bear fruit.On the surface it may appear a great film to show an aspiring Egyptologist (in early teens), and maybe thats OK. But you could equally show them The Mummy and its sequels and achieve the same effect, or better yet just show them some documentaries that go into detail about the real deal!</fullReview>

All of this would have made a decent comedy if the whole film was not so self-infatuated and pompous!At least this film has this quality: it's so ridiculous that if you feel a bit down, just look at it and you'll see how marvelous, clever and precious you are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Culturally insensitive militaristic god-killers save the day, sort of</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is little point to going into depth on the obvious fairy-tale absurdities of individual scenes or actions. Rather, it's better to focus on what this film tells us about its audience's primal conceits: that we have the right, the duty, to inflict our cultural understandings on every other being in the universe.This movie is almost plagiaristically like an episode of the old "Star Trek," in which Kirk and company discover a planetary garden of Eden. In that episode, the inhabitants are simple, have everything they need, know nothing of war or that sex might be evil, and pray to their God, Vaal. On occasion they go to the cave of Vaal and drop off some food obeisance. This seems to make Vaal happy enough to keep these folk in a state of bliss and harmony. Kirk and company don't like this situation, though, because the simple people are clearly "slaves." So, in their wisdom and benevolence, they shoot the Enterprise's phaser banks at the cave of Vaal and wipe it out. Kirk gives the dwellers a little lecture on how they will now learn to make their own decisions and be the happier for it.You can just see the delayed reactions of these former Eden-dwellers once they realized just what their "liberation" meant: toil, conflict, jealousy, eventually undoubtedly crime, poverty, environmental rape. "Oh, thanks a lot, you guys! Yeah, we were simple but we had a preeeeeeetty good life, and all we had to do was drop off a little fruit. But I guess that a couple of pineapples was too much for you guys! All of a sudden we were 'slaves,' and you had to come along and 'liberate' us. Gee whiz you were only on our planet for three days; did that qualify you as experts in our culture? Did it ever occur to you that maybe we don't want to be like you? But, noooooooooo: you knew what was best for us; you couldn't have us bribing the gods to make things nice for us because this meant we had no 'free will.' You guys are JERKS." Oh, but we have come a long way. Just about any child who's received an iota of cultural awareness education could probably tell you that what Kirk and company did was not particularly sensitive and was more than a bit ethnocentric. This Star Trek episode, after all, came to us forty years ago.So what is Stargate's excuse?Toward the end of the movie, the primitive people themselves decide that they can no longer be slaves, and must rise up against their god. As a linguist, I have to wonder where they got this word "slave" from. This is surely a word that would not exist in their language, since all of them, every one, was a "slave" in terms of working for Ra's benefit. The word "slave" would have been synonymous with the word "human." Can you imagine someone on our planet deciding that we had to rise up against "God" and take control of our own lives?Ra is portrayed as evil in a very human sense: despotic, sadistic, with an angry stare and a nasty temper. This is a being who has lived for thousands of years, traveled through every part of space, is so technologically superior to us that it can bend the laws of physics and accomplish nearly-instant intergalactic travel, and besides all that, started earth's culture. One would think the earthlings might be grateful, or at least curious. It might even seem reasonable that this being would be remarkably wise, well read, and not simply a petty dictator of some primitive desert-dwellers. The very idea that a being such as this would be trying to "cheat death" only to live in a barren castle with almost nothing to do for thousands of years, is a bit strange. But more hackle-raising is that this movie applauds when a mentally disturbed human military colonel in his mid-forties takes it upon himself to kill this ancient, super-intelligent, culture-creating being.The reasons for Ra's behavior are never questioned, though they may be godly and mysterious. Even the scientist assumes that what Ra is doing must be wrong, but does not say the obvious, "You are thousands of years old, created my civilization, have been to many galaxies. I have so much to learn from you, and certainly have no right to judge your decisions. What's up?"The cultural arrogance of this movie is not a matter of political correctness. It is a matter of seeing we still believe that everyone should have the same social structure and political beliefs that we have, that we have the right to judge - quickly - and then inflict our will upon creatures who are different from us.In the most optimistic way, I might suggest that this movie is showing us not general human thinking, but general military thinking. In Stargate, the scientific and cultural discoveries are hidden from the masses by a clearly arrogant military structure, acting on its own without any sort of outside perspective or accountability. The first group sent through the gate was a half dozen grunt soldiers who were clearly incapable, by their training, of an interplanetary/intercultural mission. The colonel's preposterous mission was, "If you see anything that scares you, nuke everything." If the film had been a lampoon of this kind of decision-making, if it had taken a moment's perspective for someone to ask if maybe Ra was smarter than the colonel and if maybe the peasants would be happier mining the mineral for Ra, than in possessing guns and the free will to use them, then the whole precept would have been worth it. Sadly, though, the script does not diverge for one single moment away from its applause of the military actions taken, from the heroism of the humans for destroying the social fabric they entered, from the righteousness of killing the god.</fullReview>

That would not be so bad if it was actually entertaining, like the "Mummy". If you want a more entertaining sci-fi movie, watch "Dark City" or "The Matrix". If you want a good action movie, watch the "Mummy", or "Die Hard", or "Terminator 2". There is no reason why you should go watch this movie.

		<shortDescription>Amazing how such a good series can come from such a BAD movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of both Stargate: SG-1 and Stargate: Atlantis, which is probably because I was exposed to both of those series BEFORE seeing this unfortunate mess of a movie.The story told here is that the stargate was discovered in the 40's but it took over 50 years for someone to come along who could figure out how to use it. The person who does so is an archaeologist named Daniel Jackson (James Spader), who discover that the symbols on the gate can be used to call up the "address" of a planet. Scientist Catherine Langford, (Viveca Lindfors) discovers that the gate sets up a "wormhole" through which people can travel great distances in almost no time at all. The military takes a keen interest in the gate, and sends Jackson through with a military unit commanded by Col. Jack O'Neil (Kurt Russell). Unfortunately, once they arrive on the planet at the other end of the gate, Jackson is not certain if he can figure out how to send them home, causing the rest of the unit to become understandably, but unsympathetically, annoyed with him. Jackson also discovers that the planet is populated with humans who speak something very close to ancient Egyptian. He is able to communicate with them, and they befriend the Terrans. When their God, Ra (Jaye Davidson) returns, he is less than thrilled with the Terrans, and punishes both them, and the natives for helping them. However, both the Terrans and the natives have more than a few tricks up their sleeve for dealing with Ra.While the story is as well written as any plot for the series has been, that's about where the similarity ends. The acting in this film is simply atrocious. Russell is a talented man, but his O'Neil is so bitter that I could feel no sympathy for him. Spader as Jackson was just annoyingly dorky. Things were not helped by the ever annoying French Stewart in a mercifully small part. Most offensive, however, was Jaye Davidson as Ra. Prancing around like a spoiled adolescent girl, Davidson's Ra was more ridiculous than menacing. Oddly, the only really good acting in the movie came from those playing the natives of the planet visited. Erick Avari, Alexis Cruz, and Mili Avital all turn in fine performances.While the concepts of the film were interesting, the execution was unforgivably poor, which is only further highlighted by how well the television series has been done. Hard to believe that something this bad spawned something so great.</fullReview>

The actors have very little to do with their roles and do little to impress.Making a break from the sadomasochistic kinky sex genre, James Spader portrays a very boring character (unintentionally of course). After a string of big hits, Kurt Russell gives an OK performance as the man's man of the group but could do with better material than this. That dude from `The Crying Game' (whoops, better not reveal the ending) is over effeminate in a role that should have been conceived so flamboyantly. Nothing seems to fit perfectly to make this a complete puzzle. The dialogue is `techno talk' which no one can understand. The special effects are fairly shoddy, giving how good they could have been.So `Stargate' is an inferior sci-fi adventure that could have been done a lot better. It easily watchable, but also equally missable to say the least. My IMDb rating: 4.7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A complete WASTE of a good idea ! This couldn´t have been worst imagined !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STARGATE, now that´s what i call a disappointment !I used to think ROLLAND EMERICH, could become one of my favorite sci-fi action movie directors, despite always looking like he was trying to become the next JAMES CAMERON, particularly after previous movies like " MOON 44 " and "UNIVERSAL SOLDIER " ,which seemed more like attempts to recreate the Cameron style.Always lacking the feeling from its movies.Nevertheless i thought this german guy could become much better.I was expecting great things from STARGATE. The theme is one of my favorites ever in mysteries or science fiction. Ideas for a story about extraterrestrial gods in acient cultures are everywhere in books, articles, essays, documentaries, you name it. So i was expecting a very good story in this film.Instead what did we got ?!! A completely banal screenplay about good guys against bad guys with the usal romance bits and cardboard superficial characters, hollywood style once more.This story is so poor that they didn´t needed to build such great sets to film it. This could have been a B movie with mate paintings all over or it could have been set anywhere in the world or it could have been any kind of movie that it wouldn´t have made any difference.This screenplay never seems to have been written to serve a good sci-fi story, it seems written to show special effects and action scenes. The theme of the movie is just an excuse to show different spaceships. Nothing more !The first 20 minutes are fabulous, but then again every ancient mystery is revealed seting the atmosphere, and what´s left for the rest of the movie are battles and chases that could have been part of any type of story really.So this story it´s completely underdeveloped, and it becomes totally predictable right up until the final confrontation with the bad guy and through out to the end of the film. I was completely bored watching this and very disappointed too. I tried to watch this several other times, but it doesn´t get any better. It gets worst.Rolland Emerich and Dean Devlin missed a great oportunity for creating a fabulous sci-fi story here, but then again after i´ve seen " ID4 " and " GODZILLA ", i get the feeling that they don´t have any personal imagination at all and they couldn´t have done a better STARGATE, even if they tried. Their imagination is so crummed up with visual fast food cinema references that i´m not expecting any good surprises from them anymore.This movie is a complete waste of time and money. Don´t see it.It´s boring and suffers from a total lack of imagination.Get a good ancient misteries book instead. Believe me it's that bad.Even worst than the Tv series based on it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie sucks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is terrible. Unfortunately a short review usually indicates ignorance, however the reason for the brevity of this comment is because the movie isn't worth the effort required to enumerate its flaws. Halfway through the movie we watched it in 1.5 speed, and I'm glad. The movie is extremely poorly written, and the dialog seems to be written for children. It is long and is composed mostly of explanations for obvious plot points. Everything is mediocre. I am amazed that this movie even earned a 4.NOW TO FILL UP SPACE:Don't WASTE YOUR TIME!HONESTLY, AFTERWARDS YOU ARE GOING TO WISH YOU PLAYED MONOPOLY OR SOMETHING</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was intending to give this film a proper write-up but there is just nothing to say about it.It's just plain booooring... from start to finish.It's an interesting idea for movie, granted, I just didn't care about any of the characters. I didn't like the ones I was supposed to like or dislike the ones I was supposed to dislike, I simply did not care about their situation at all.There's nothing overtly bad about it, it's just a non-entity. I found myself doing the ironing during this movie - that's how boring it is.The only vaguely interesting facet of this movie is David Arnold's score, which rips off/alludes to (test of your cynicism here) John Williams' Star Wars scores more times than I could count. I always thought he only ripped off/alluded to John Barry - which he does infinitely better.Oh, and Kurt Russell's haircuts are hilarious. At the start he has this sort of pseudo-surfer mop going, but later sports a classic military short-back-and-sides look with a an upright flat top. Made me chuckle every time he came into frame...Other than that, avoid at all costs. An utterly unmemorable waste of two hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>AMERICAN SHIT !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WAW, hail to the American soldier, just one soldier but kicked the ancient Egyptians' ass even if they were aliens. Just a bunch of barbarians, those Egyptians, they can't build any pyramids, aliens did it and convinced the Egyptian barbarians that they were Gods and they were their kings and forced them to work on those three pyramids. But the makers of the shit (sorry I mean the film) forgot some little things; like all the temples and graves and palaces in Egypt. The Egyptian civilization is not only three pyramids (You can visit the Concord square in Paris and take a look ), are they all by aliens? So what about the history written on the walls of those aincent buildings, it discribes all that history in detail! King Tut was an alien? So what about his body which is still good and with flesh and bones until now (You can see it yourself at the Egyptian musiom in Cairo) and what about his detailed story which is written on his grave's wall, and his properties which were found with him in his grave and by the way he died young at the age of 15, that's why they found dolls and play stuff with him. What about those kings who made big wars (With swords not planes) like Rameses II, and many others (And also by the way, the three pyramids were built by three successful, well-known kings and were built with stones like any ancient building).What about the Egyptian religion? What about 3000 years of a documented history beginning 5000 years ago? The makers of the film wanna erase all that ... OK, if so, me too - I don't believe the Roman civilization existed and Julius Ceaser was an alien, and let the Italians prove he wasn't ... Isn't that ridiculous?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful typically american sentimental shallow drivel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If the other contributer was seriously describing this dogs mess as the best movie ever then he is really the saddest person ever. It is distinguishable from all the other all american gung ho drivel only in its awfulness.As for you who see links to the bible and mystical symbolism .. as you yankees say .. get a life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stargate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing this as a kid, and I knew I had to see it again because I could not remember any of it, including the fact that it is from director Roland Emmerich (Independence Day, The Day After Tomorrow). Basically Egyptologist (translator of the language and hieroglyphics) Dr. Daniel Jackson (Secretary's James Spader) is brought to an underground military base to decode symbols on an Egyptian cover. He decodes them as star constellations, and they are able to activate the alien device known as the Stargate, and lead by Air Force Col. Jonathan 'Jack' O'Neil (Kurt Russell) and Jackson, a team go through the gate, travelling across the known universe to a distant planet. At first it seems like just a deserted desert area with this little temple housing the gate, but soon enough they come across the near culture. For a while they seem to get on well with this civilisation, and Daniel learns to talk their Egyptian language more properly, but this friendship is threatened by the villain who has banned writing and drawing, so the people cannot find out that he is pretending to be the Egyptian sun god Ra (The Crying Game's Jaye Davidson, in his second and last film before returning to his original job as a fashion designer in London). Daniel wasn't aware that O'Neil had brought a nuclear weapon to this world, with orders to destroy the gate when their mission was complete, and unfortunately Ra has plans to destroy their Earth. In the end, everyone stands up for themselves, the bomb is recovered, and they blow Ra with it, and everyone goes home except Daniel, who is happy staying with his love interest Sha'uri (Mili Avital). Also starring Viveca Lindfors as Catherine, Alexis Cruz as Skaara, Leon Rippy as General W.O. West, John Diehl as Lieutenant Kawalsky, Carlos Lauchu as Anubis, Blood Diamond's Djimon Hounsou as Horus and The Mummy's Erick Avari as Kasuf. The special effects are impressive, the depiction of travelling through the gate and being hurtled across the universe at the speed of light is one of these great achievements. The film also has a good plot, good characters, it is just a fun and enjoyable adventure. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not much to this flop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I usually like the time travel theme, but this turkey was the exception. A group of special forces toughs, and a scientist go through some kind of time and space warp into a parallel world. For my money they could have went through the warp and stopped the film right there. Coulda saved me 2 hours of intense boredom. What a loser, dog of a picture.</fullReview>
