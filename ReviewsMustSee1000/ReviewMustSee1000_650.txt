		<shortDescription>from someone who's mentally ill...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really identify with this movie, and with Joon. I myself am mentally ill (in fact, disabled by it). I don't think it matters that her mental illness is unspecified... so many mental illnesses overlap in real life, and often DO go unspecified even if the person is counselling.I am mentally ill and (as birds of a feather flock together) know many people who are also mentally ill. As for it being representation of what it's really like to be or live with a mentally ill person, you can't really lump such an experience together. Mentally ill people vary just as much as "normal" people do.Some of the details in this movie are great. They depicted Joon as a rounded character, a creative, sensitive, intelligent person. This is often the case with mentally ill people. I love the eccentricities of the characters. I think the details, writing, and everything about this movie are just wonderful. I've seen it many times.Most people who I know who have seen this movie adore it. I think it's great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>funny *and* realistic (whatever others may say)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this movie with almost no expectations. Now I own it and have watched it more times than I can remember.I have heard that this movie caught a lot of flak about not being "realistic" about mental illness, and not providing a diagnosis for Joon, etc. I think that it is more realistic for the "average" person with a mental illness than any other movie I have seen on the topic. There was no theme of "being institutionalised forever" and there was no unrealistic expectation of a "cure".The character of Sam put it best when he said "Aside from being a little mentally ill, she's pretty normal." I think that's the best quote I've heard in a movie, on that particular topic.I also think there is a reason for there being no stated diagnosis of Joon. She personifies those of us who can't get on with the things we want to do in life because of a mental illness and treatment getting in the way. She does it very well, down to the mannerisms. If she were to be labeled, say, obsessive-compulsive, or post-traumatic stress disorder, or schizophrenic, or bipolar, then the universality would be taken out of it and it would suddenly only apply to people with one certain label.This movie did wonders for my family. Upon watching it, we all said "That's us!" and learned to laugh at ourselves and the situations we got into. It offered me a lot of hope -- what more could I want than to find an understanding and eccentric friend to love and move into my own apartment, away from the mess of hospitals and doctors? It still makes me laugh every time I see it, and "Joon" has become a household word... I recommend this to anyone, particularly anyone with a mental illness, and their families -- it might lighten things up, but it certainly doesn't skip over the bad parts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BENNY &amp; JOON seems, at its heart, to be an allegory about the different ways people can be out of touch with their fellow human beings, and the ways in which that dischord can be healed.Benny owns an auto shop and takes care - both financially and physically - of himself and his sister Joon after the death of their parents. Other than weekly poker games, Benny's is a life of servitude, and this is the source of his isolation. He longs to be free to have other relationships, but is wracked by guilt at the idea of leaving Joon in anyone else's care.Joon is an artist and is also mentally ill, a schizophrenic who has good and bad days and who depends on Benny to provide routine in her life. She has run out every housekeeper to be found in town, but cannot function without assistance and supervision. The film does a superb job of differentiating between mental illness (from which Joon clearly suffers) and stupidity (which is not a problem she faces). Into their lives comes Sam, a cousin of one of Benny's poker buddies. Through a clever conceit, Sam moves in with Benny and Joon. Sam is undereducated, partially illiterate but a comedic genius who studies Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton, knows catalogs of old movies, and has perfected the art form (kudos to Depp for the grace and conviction of this part of his performance). Like Keaton and the great silent film stars, Sam rarely speaks to communicate, and this combined with his illiteracy condemns him to be considered stupid as well. The great sneaker quality of Depp's performance is to show that Sam is always watching, always listening, and that he's no dim bulb by any stretch. In Sam, Joon finds a person who makes her laugh, lives by his own rules, and cares for her deeply. In Joon, Sam finds a woman who appreciates him as he is, but he also knows a relationship with her is taboo. In a particularly revealing scene, he asks Benny, as one man to another, "How sick is she?" We know he is wrestling with his feelings for her, but Benny does not, and his offhanded answer comes across as callous and almost mocking.While the handling of Sam and Joon's budding relationship may seem trite, and the humor applied to Joon's illness might seem cruel, in my experience the people who make those judgments know little about living day to day with a mentally ill - not to be confused with unintelligent - human being. There is deep and abiding truth in the idea that laughter and love can cure the incurable; people who seemed unable to function before can make great strides when they are shown trust and respect. And although the psychiatric issues were glossed over in this film, it has at its core an honest message of hope. One of my favorite films, for Depp and Masterson's outstanding performances and a true depiction of imperfect people on the journey to becoming whole. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I doubt that I can add much to all the good things said about this film. Acting is superb, as is writing and direction, which keep the story from ever seeming "cute". It is never condescending about mentally ill; I love line where Joon corrects Benny's score keeping of a ping-pong game:" the mentally ill can count, you know". Both serious and comic, like life. Imagine, a good film without violence, drug life, car chases or sex. See it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Johnny's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say that I think Benny &amp; Joon may be one of my favorite Johnny Depp films, along with Edward Scissorhands and Cry Baby. Unfortunately, you don't hear too many people talk about B&amp;J the way they do Johnny's more high profile films, like Pirates of the Caribbean. This film is wonderful because it manages to tell the story of two mentally ill characters and never make them helpless victims. Instead, at their worst they're merely troubled and interesting characters, and at their best they're absolutely charming and heartwarming. Of course, Depp shines with his spot-on Chaplin impressions, and Masterson and Quinn are in top form as well. The real miracle of this film is that it is able to tell a story laced with realism through a whimsical lens, and it walks the tightrope of making one feel good without blatant reassurance. You believe Benny and Joon love one another without a gratuitous sex scene, (only a beautifully sensual one), and the viewer subsequently falls in love with everyone because this is a fine example of the way characters should be developed. Bravo to all involved!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Incredible Johnny Depp Performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you read this one exactly as it's written and take out the Depp character it can play accurately. It would never be a big movie like that (it wasn't big anyway) but it would be consistent and good. But insert Depp's character (and Depp's way of playing this character) and you have something entirely else. The title holds only if you don't have Depp in the movie - for this movie is all about Depp. He literally steals the show. I don't know much about Depp, what I've heard he is a somewhat weird character, but if you look at what he's done - Scissorhands and this movie as two examples - you have to wonder if you're not looking at one of the truly great actors of the day. The diner scene with the two dinner rolls, the tray of dinners, the Wurlitzer and Julianne Moore; the kitchen antics; the jack-in-the-box scene - simple but still; the 'mail a letter to momma' scene - look how Depp totally creates his character; and the park scene: this is great stuff. Is it about Benny and Joon and their ability to cope with their situation? Maybe. But moviegoers might remember this essentially 'feel good' movie as only another incredible Johnny Depp performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Favorite movie of all-time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Benny and Joon" in a dollar theatre when I was 12 and a half and my family was going through some difficult times. I had always liked movies before, but they were just an occasional treat and I never really paid attention to actors or directors or the like. After seeing "Benny and Joon" I was in love with movies! I can't pinpoint what it was about this movie that touched me so, but as an insecure, nerdy little 12 year old, it gave me something I needed. I have learned a lot about movies since then, I can name most actors and directors and I know all the production company logos, which makes me a little TOO happy ;) A lot of movies have come and gone since I first saw "Benny and Joon" and there are plenty that I love, but, for me "Benny and Joon" will always be tops and always have a special place in my heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sparingly and compactly made, an excellent sweet film. I found myself laughing out loud, along with my 15-year-old daughter. The sequences with Johnny Depp in the park were delightful and fun. I also found the portrayal of Joon very sympathetic and real. Aidan Quinn was just right in his role of Benny, restrained and compassionate, with just the right amount of yearning to be free. I was touched by the scenes of Benny and Joon's parents' death. Johnny Depp was, as always, original and amazing. He is so elastic. This movie shows a very sweet, innocent side of him which is rarely seen elsewhere. His flexibility and physical prowess are astounding, as are his gentleness with Joon and the sympathy with which he views her. I think my favorite scene may be the last one, where the two of them are in the kitchen ironing cheese sandwiches! Sweet, fun movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Original, Romantic, and Fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have fallen in love with this film. It is a classic love story between two lovable, quirky characters Sam and Joon. Benny and Joon has serious elements in its portrayal of Joon's (Masterson) sickness and how it affects her relationship with her brother, Benny (Quinn). This melancholy feeling is soon overshadowed by the magical aura that Sam (Depp) brings to these troubled siblings giving the movie an overall light-hearted and fun feeling.The characters in Benny and Joon make the film truly original. Johnny Depp's portrayal of Sam is amazing. He hits the mark with his off-the-wall performance that brings exceptional charm to the story. Mary Stuart Masterson's portrayal of the mentally ill Joon is also spectacular. Depp and Masterson have undeniable chemistry in this movie. The quirkiness of their characters complement each other while Aidan Quinn's portrayal of Benny keeps the story down to earth with his sensibility that contrasts Sam and Joon's eccentricity. In short, this is a romance you won't want to miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really good film!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was surprised at how much I liked this film, I guess that I could somehow relate to the characters. Masterson's Joon is an awfully sad character that I really felt bad for, so was Depp's Sam, but they worked so well together, and had so many wonderful moments that made this film work. Anyone with a heart will enjoy this sweet little film. The only mistake was the relationship between Aidan Quinn and Julianne Moore, that just didnt seem to fit into the rest of the movie. Still, its a sweet and warm hearted film that everyone should enjoy. My rating: 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sweet romantic comedy, Johnnny Depp gives a very memorable performance!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember when I was a kid I was just so in love with Johnny Depp, you wanna know the reason why? Benny &amp; Joon, this movie was just so awesome to me and it was so romantic and sweet. I didn't see the movies for a few years, so I decided to buy it when I saw it on sale. Re-watching this movie brings back so many memories and I still love this movie so much. Even though it's cheesy and predictable, this is just a charming romantic comedy. The reason why is because it does have something different, the main love story has two characters who are complete opposite, but find that happiness in each other, they also remind another what real love feels like. Johnny Depp plays Sam, based off of Buster Keaten, he pulls in great physical comedy and made this movie magical and enjoyable, believe me, Benny &amp; Joon is a fun story that any one could fall in love with.Benny and Joon are brother and sister, their parents died in a fatal car accident when they were just children. Benny has promised to take care mentally ill Joon. But when Joon walks in on a card game with Benny's friends, she joins in without Benny's knowledge and wins something big, Benny's friend's cousin, Sam. Sam goes to live with Benny and Joon, his physical gags charm their hearts and brings in Ruthie, a waitress who Benny is just in love with but doesn't have the courage to admit it. But the plot thickens when Sam and Joon fall in love and over protective Benny intervenes.Benny &amp; Joon is one of those rare memorable romantic comedies, while the rest of the cast like Mary Stuart Masterson and Aidan Quinn both pull in heart warming performances, it's Johnny Depp who takes the movie; a time when he was pretty much just known as Edward Scissorhands, he took something different and made it work. His scene in the park with Benny and Joon is just so wonderful and funny. I would recommend Benny and Joon, it's a good movie, terrific actors, and has a fun and catchy soundtrack, this is a movie not to miss.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True Brilliance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hey, as the owner of over 600 DVD's, and by far most of those from top movie lists, I can honestly, easily put this movie in the top 60 of all time. Including all the movies I've seen and aren't worth owning, B&amp;J lands neatly into the top 2-3% overall.It's a simple fairy tale, but simple neither in its creation nor execution. The layers of theme and the reality and originality of characters, so well performed in every way, almost put it beyond genre, and certainly it is neither a comedy nor a drama. It precedes and predicts smart dramedies of the later 90's and beyond.But the tale's most significant moral, so subtly and honestly delivered--one real reason this movie stands out--is the prescient confronting of our society and culture's treatment, both legally and personally, of the so-called mentally ill.Finally today we are beginning to acknowledge how disgustingly medieval is our approach to mental illness via heavy drugging, chopping of brains and nerves, and even electric shocking "patients". Add to that the fact, highlighted in this movie, that our supposedly free society takes away any personal control from either the individual or the family when someone has been labeled "mentally ill" and gives that control to the pscyhiatric organizations (not to any legal or governmental body, you notice).It is estimated now that all these "mass control" methodologies, originated by Germans mostly in the early 20th century and polished in Nazi Germany and under Stalin, will be eliminated in the United States within 20 years. This movie has helped contribute to that motion and heralds a major positive turn in our society from the long trends of worsening education and rising crime that began when pscyhs were given control of our educational institutions and our mental health methodologies.The obvious, demonstrable fact is that changing the way one acts toward a person--any person--to a positive from a negative will assist them in improving their own ability to live their life. (Negative being absolutely any motion or communication that compromises or reduces their own control, confidence or positiveness toward the future). Many people are not even "insane", but just individual enough to cause the established mental health industry to label them with a disease so they can prescribe drugs for them. The old joke, "Are there really more insane, or just more definitions of insanity?" applies.Like Joon, simply being treated with dignity and as a regular person is all they need to lead a successful independent life--they really weren't a big problem until someone said they were and kept telling them so. But even without the tremendous significance of this thematic message, the movie is extremely clever and subtly entertaining. The DVD contains an excellent and different little piece where John Schwartzman, the cinematographer, comments over about 20 minutes of makeup and lighting tests of the lead characters. Much better than the usual 20-minute "making of". His comments plus the director's commentary give an excellent context for how the movie was conceived and made, and shows that they were well aware of the issues and challenges they faced. Of course, I believe they met all those challenges exceedingly well and produced a timeless little classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Depp continued his early nineties love of starring as offbeat characters, the type of characters that most actors would avoid taking on for fear of embarrassment or losing credibility. It may be true that very few actors have the ability to carry off such characters with skill, and make them believable and charming. Depp is the master of these roles, and in Benny and Joon he again proves his great talent and versatility. He may be the big name, and steal most of the scenes he is in, but the surrounding cast and story make it an enduring film of bittersweet romance, comedy, and tries to prove that there is hope for all of us when it comes to love.Benny and Joon were orphaned at a young age, and Benny has spent the greater part of his life looking after his mentally ill younger sister. Joon is slightly unbalanced and sometimes gets herself in trouble by burning things and causing 'public disturbances'. Benny works as a mechanic in a garage, has never been away from home or had a proper relationship as he feels he must always look after Joon. Recently Joon has been getting more unstable leading Psychiatrists to advise that she be put in a home under care. Benny wants to live a normal life but cannot leave his sister. Joon is an incredibly smart and talented young woman but would never ask to be put in a home. On one of their regular poker nights Benny's friends play cards with Joon as Benny is late. The stakes are high- a week's washing, a troll toy etc. One friend puts his newly found cousin Sam in the pot, a 26 year old who can't read and spends his time watching movies and emulating Buster Keaton. Joon loses, and Benny has a new house guest. At first he seems odd, but as time goes on he proves to be a source of goodness in the household, and Joon falls for him. Sam also manages to get local waitress and B-Movie star Ruthie involved with Benny. However, when Benny finds out what has been going on between Sam and Joon he is furious, leading to Joon being committed. Benny realises his mistakes and asks Sam to help bring Joon back.Above all this is a warm hearted tale with some good performances. Depp is superb when getting up to his supposedly unusual antics, Masterson manages well with an equally difficult role, and Quinn holds it together with his subtle performance of a character who must cope with the weirdness around him. Moore provides fine support as Ruthie, and there are a few funny moments. The film does not push for laughs or heart-felt tears and therefore is quietly charming and should hopefully leave most with a feeling of good-will afterwards. The director deals with mental illness as many before have, that it makes a person more lovable, and whether or not this is true it does not get in the way of the plot. Joon does not seem that different from everyone else, and Sam is a born entertainer, but a spontaneous one who should not be put on stage. It may be too slow and subtle for some, and it doesn't have the look or emotion of Edward Scissorhands, but it is nevertheless a fine movie and one which is destined to have a cult following.8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sweet, simple romance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Benny &amp; Joon is a relief for anybody tired of overtly sexual and predictable romances where all the attraction is in the physical aspects of the relationship. There are perhaps three swear words in the entire film; the whole thing is a sweet family romance.Benny is a car mechanic whose entire life is dominated by caring for his sister, Joon, who's mentally ill. One night in a poker game with Benny's friends, Joon loses...and what's been bet is a cousin. Thus the eccentric Sam comes to live with Benny &amp; Joon.Don't fool yourself into thinking that this movie is all about Joon and Sam. It's not. It is, as the title proclaims, about Benny and Joon. It's their love story. Not a romance-love; a family-love. They are all they have. The whole movie has a dreamy feel to it, with quirky characters and a left-of-center soundtrack. The directing is superb, and the acting is spot-on. This is a serio-comic character study with more comedy than seriousness. A must-see for anybody who counts themselves a movie fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's delightful to watch the power of love and friendship resolve difficult issues. The cast is wonderful. I love when Sam swings from the rope and Joons face lights up! You feel sorry for Sam when he falls, but his understated, "ouch...ouch" is pretty funny. The comedy balances the drama beautifully. The music is memorable.Continuity comment: When Joon comes down for dinner, salad and spaghetti ("in that order?", says Joon). At the table her knee is showing and in the back and forth dialogue with Benny her knee is covered by her dress and then uncovered. The peanut butter jar is also turned slightly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A highly underrated movie with a shining Johnny Depp. He is simply one of the best actors of our time. It's one of my all-time favorites.This movie deals honestly and caringly with Benny (Aidan Quinn), his mentally ill sister Joon (Mary Stuart Masterson), and Sam (Depp), who comes unexpectedly into their lives. It is at once laugh-out-loud funny, honest, and touching.I've always appreciated that Joon's character is treated as (as Sam says) a person who is normal, "except for her mental illness." The situations are just a tad this side of wacky, but they feel very real.Seriously, if you haven't seen this movie, watch it. The writing is spot-on, the stars shine, and even the bit players (from Dan Hedaya to CCH Pounder) make the movie all the more memorable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fabulous movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this movie last December in a friend's house, but missed the first 45 minutes of it! I now own it on DVD &amp; love it to death!!! The story surrounds Benny &amp; Joon Pearl, two siblings who have lived together since the accidental death of their parents in a car crash. Benny (Aidan Quinn) works as a car mechanic, but finds it difficult to form a long-term relationship with any woman he meets as he must care for his mentally ill sister.One night while playing cards with Benny's friends, Joon (Mary Stuart Masterson) loses her hand but wins Sam (Johnny Depp), who is an avid silent movie fan and is also dyslexic. He moves in with Benny &amp; Joon for what, at first, looks like a night but turns into a permanent stay. Benny thinks this may be the answer to all his problems &amp; it will also avoid him putting his sister in a group home, as he doesn't like those sort of places.Unfortunately (for Benny), Sam &amp; Joon fall in love (&amp; I would be madly in love with him too if I was in her position! *lol*), but I better not give away the rest of the story for those who haven't seen it! The strong message that I got from this movie was to "accept people for who they really are inside". I felt so sorry for the way Joon was treated by her brother but was so happy when Sam came into her life, as he didn't see her as mentally ill, but as a normal human being. I wish all human beings were seen in the same way! The performances in this movie are absolutely outstanding, but Johnny Depp's was the best (&amp; funniest!) &amp; I would love a person like Sam to be one of my best friends! This movie had me smiling from start to finish &amp; I loved the comedy routines in the park - I couldn't believe it was Johnny himself doing all those stunts in that scene! I won't ramble on for much longer, but I will say this: PLEASE SEE THIS MOVIE! IT IS SWEET &amp; FUNNY &amp; YOU WON'T REGRET IT!Thanx for reading my comment!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought it was an amazing movie. I loved it. It's very cute and extremely funny. Sam is a great example of Johnny Depp and his weird, crazy, off-beat kind of characters, and personally one of my favorites. Joon is incredible. She's believable but also bordering on the fantastical and some of the time you can't even believe there's something wrong with her. (some of the time being the key phrase) Ben is a brilliant character, pretty much the only truly grounded one of the lot. He's the typical over protective brother, wanting to save Joon from all the world's pains and heartaches and problems. The struggles between Benny and Joon and between Benny and Sam are heart-wrenching. It's a wonderful, funny yet slightly sad story about the weird shapes and sizes land brands of love. The actors bring to life very colorful, believable characters. It's one of those movies I don't mind watching over and over again. A last note for anyone watching it in a family setting, with younger kids, the f-word is used, once, about an hour nd 10 mins. into the movie. Just as a heads up.</fullReview>

It did not make fun of the mentally challenged but portrayed them as they are, human beings with feelings and desires and goals. Johnny Depp's character was a great tribute to the talents of Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin on a subtle level and was enjoyable to watch. I highly recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really cool!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is not only funny and one of the best films ever but also is unique and has Johnny Depp in it. Johnny Depp plays the weird but wonderful, whimsical (that word describes him on the box OK) misfit guy who although is illiterate and 26 is charming in a stupid kind of way. Anyway he charms his way into Joon's heart. Joon is sort of a bit mentally unstable but funny and original and interesting. Her brother Benny looks after her. He is cool but so overprotective. Johnny Depp gives a full and fun performance yet heartfelt and cute. It really made me think about how I would really love a guy like the guy Depp plays!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Johnny's best performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the movie that I first saw Johnny Depp in... I remember seeing the previews and wanting to see it because I thought that Sam's character was so well played. I would soon find out that it was only ONE of this amazing man's great portrayals. Johnny really makes this film great, because it does touch on such serious subject matter... it could perhaps be seen as taking those subjects too lightly, but he plays Sam very appropriately. He really could have been a silent film star himself because he is wonderful at using facial expressions. They are clear, but realistic (not forced or overdone). Johnny Depp provides both comic release, and serious tone when appropriate... nothing he does is gratuitous, all actions and expressions have meaning and bring the character to life. I think it is quite fitting that Benny tells Sam he is talented &amp; should really do something with it. It's what the informed watchers of Johnny have always known... Johnny Depp is as talented as he is good looking. And he practially plays himself in this role, which is why it's one of his best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Homage To The Little Tramp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though his character is very much the center of the film, its star Johnny Depp left it out of the title. Benny&amp;Joon is a brother and sister played by Aidan Quinn and Mary Stuart Masterson. Depp's character is Sam a man much influenced by Charlie Chaplin who comes into their lives and changes everything in this very gentle comedy.You have to give credit where it's due, Johnny Depp knew his talent, knew his worth, and was determined not to be pigeonholed as a teen idol that he was from his role in 21 Jump Street. He's created one of the widest variety of bodies of work there is out there for a player and has both defied type casting and retained being a box office draw. In fact only recently and I'm sure the money was too insanely good to turn down was he repeating parts as Captain Jack Sparrow.Benny is your average working man who has a garage and paints and repairs cars and he's concerned about his sister Joon who is mentally disturbed. He's the only family they both have, but her antics have left him with no life besides work and minding her. Part of his restricted social life is a really penny ante poker game with his cronies who all know him and his situation. They bet other things besides money. William H. Macy bets a weird cousin who has come to live with him and he loses Johnny Depp to Quinn.But this very gentle soul who could be a cousin of Depp's Edward Scissorhands sparks something in Masterson. Depp's always doing his Charlie Chaplin shtick, but you don't mind it because he's so darn good at it. Anyway Quinn might just be able to get a life of his own now and fill it with Julianne Moore with whom he'd like to get something going with.The year before Benny&amp;Joon came out, Robert Downey, Jr. did his most critically acclaimed role as Charlie Chaplin in the film Chaplin for which he won an Oscar nomination. I'm willing to bet that Johnny Depp must have been up for the part and Benny&amp;Joon just might have been his way of showing who was a better Chaplin.And I'm also sure that Benny&amp;Joon is also Johnny Depp's way of a nice homage to one of the screen immortals he admires. Either way this quirky, but gentle comedy about life is a wonderful film and worth many viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An endearing story with an endearing cast that becomes like a family to you as you watch them</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone that I've spoken to that I say I just saw Benny and Joon always say the same thing...'Aw, I love that movie.' Benny and Joon just has this endearing quality and it was almost immediate that I recognized this quality. The trio of the main cast, Benny, Joon, and Sam, are absolutely astounding and truly hold the story together. With funny, quirky and memorable moments with a very passionate and emotional plot both from a family and romantic stand point. Best of all the chemistry is just phenomenal and the film is truly something unique and fun. It's light hearted but serious enough to make you think. Although described as comedy I think I'd have to label it a dark comedy because it definitely has this very dark undertone dealing with Joon's illness and Benny's life taking care of. Regardless of the tone, the film is fun to watch and very moving.I will steer away for a moment from the title characters and talk about Sam played brilliantly by the amazing Johnny Depp who certainly has become something of a phenomenon since this film but has always been a diverse and brilliant actor. His eccentric and touching portrayal of the strange Sam is just amazing to watch. He definitely steals the show and the rest of the cast is terrific so it really shows their acting chops to go up with Depp in this performance. His physical comedy and his performance in the park is truly astounding. Aidan Quinn is Benny, the hard working, blue collar older brother who wants nothing more than to care for his sister above all else and at the expense of his life and his romantic life. Quinn is always more of a quiet, more subtle actor and Benny is the type of character that is perfect for him. He does a terrific job and shows some real emotion in the role. Mary Stuart Masterson is really terrific as Joon, the carefree and determined girl who suffers from something of a social disorder. I am almost sure that her disease is never specifically mentioned and she does a great job of portraying both sides of her illness. She's intelligent and pretty and just a terrific character. Julianne Moore and Oliver Platt round out the cast as Quinn's love interest and best friend respectively. Small roles but important and they both do a decent job.For whatever reason I wasn't 'blown away' per se by Benny and Joon. It was cute and fun but really didn't go to any amazing depths with the characters. Most of them had a surface issue and it never went any deeper than that. It wasn't a story about a girl suffering from a potentially debilitating disease but rather the interaction between the three main characters and their wacky relationships. Depp's character was supposedly completely normal, not suffering from any disease other than being strange but it was almost an over performance because he certainly didn't appear normal whatsoever until more so towards the end. No matter how you look at it Benny and Joon is cute and fun and you won't be disappointed. It's something of a cult classic and for good reason. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>superb comedy and drama with excellent performances.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this is by far, one of my favourite films. Mary Stuart Mastersons portrayal of Joon is heartwarming and realistic, which is so often not the case when films portray mentally ill characters.Sam (Johnny Depp) provides a lot of the comedy in the film and the scene in the cafeteria where he shows some silent movie tricks is excellent. this part stays in your mind for a long time afterwards as its just so original and unusual, but again, expertly shown. this is a typical Johnny Depp part as its offbeat but still very human and shows people who aren't the norm in society.Benny (Aidan Quinn) was also brilliant as Joon's brother. he shows a very 3d character who's not just Joon's carer but an excellent character in his own right.all of the characters are established and thought through superbly. the amazing thing about this film is the way it shows amazingly heartbreaking scenes such as the death of Benny and Joon's parents and Joon's mental instability, but also manages to be heart-lifting and comedic and leaves the audience with such a sweet taste afterwards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not the first dramatic comedy themed around mental illness, but it is almost certainly one of the funniest and most touching. The characters are imaginative, convincing, and well-explored; the presentation is appropriately emotive. The plot, however, has a bit of a slow start, but persist with it, and you'll be rewarded.Benny (Aidan Quinn) is a young man who is watching his life slowly pass him by. He is trapped in his hometown, constantly forced to worry about the safety and wellbeing of his sister, Joon (beatifully played by Mary Stuart Masterson), who is mentally ill. Torn between his thirst for life and his love and concern for his sister, Benny is finally persuaded to begin searching for an asylum for her. At this interval, however, he finds himself playing host to a friend's cousin (Johnny Depp), an eccentric and active young man who makes fast friends with Joon. The story unfolds in an emotive and colourful fashion, and makes for quite a memorable cinematic experience.It is acting, however, that makes this film a good one. Quinn and Masterson are both wonderfully deep and emotional as the leads, and put some heart into what would have otherwise been a rather bog-standard script. Depp inserts a pervasive element of zany, unpredictable humour, an aspect that he has come to play recurrently in recent times. Julianne Moore and William H. Macy are solid, convincing supporting characters, providing a good background to the theatrical virtuosity of the others.Stick with BENNY AND JOON. It may seem a little lethargic at first, but will grow into a touching, memorable and thoroughly enjoyable film. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical, wonderful, quirky Depp in a unusually sweet romantic comedy ?SPOILERS?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Johnny Depp is absolutely, positively fabulous in this film. His take on the character "Sam" who falls for a mentally ill woman ("Joon" of Benny and Joon) is sweet and quite lovable in this film. It's been said he modeled the character after Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin, as he often emulates other real life people. Well, if that was his intention, he excelled.There are so many touching moments in this film, they're too numerous to mention. Benny's loyalty and love for his sister, the tender, innocent love between Sam and Joon and all the in betweens. And it's quite funny. Depp "performs" throughout the movie and we are delighted with laughter and tears. A scene worth mentioning, the counter scene at the diner with the twinkies...dancing twinkies...hilarious..AND Depp swinging from the building across the window with his hat (would you expect anything less from Depp?) This is a great film for all to watch, young and old.It's a story about hope and love, loyalty and letting go..Mary Stuart Masterson is a master in herself in this movie. She held her own against Aidan Quinn and Johnny Depp. A wonderful treat. Get it for yourself or kids, sit back with some popcorn and get ready to laugh and cry, this movie will make you do both.8/10* Don't miss this one. And if you're a Depp fan, add it to your movie collection, you won't be sorry..it's a film you can watch many times...Hat's off to Johnny again!!</fullReview>

(Style) is probably the wrong word but anyway, the meaning behind that word that i am using is the innocence used in this film to triumph over the prejudice towards people who are not considered normal, in this case meaning Joon and Johnny depp's character in this film. Also the power to interest me and a story that keeps it's innocence. They really should make more films like Benny and Joon! To promote the equal judgment of all people.

		<shortDescription>Simple Simplicity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is just a joy to watch each time because it is so simple but with just dash of odd that you cannot help but smile. The movie does nothing out of the ordinary but what it does it does very well. Depp is very much like his Edward Scissorhands role acting as if he is seeing the world from a different perspective than the rest of us. Adian Quinn is very convincing of struggling with the desire to have a new life but also fulfill his the commitment he has made to care for his sister. Mary Stuart Masterson does a fine job of performing as a stuggling mentally ill woman. Some may say she goes from one extreme to another by seeming perfectly normal and than going into a fit of madness but it can be that way for borderline cases and Materson makes you feel sympathetic for Joon's plight in a very classy fashion. Juliane Moore, is fine in her role of as the focus of Benny's "complicated" romantic interest but her personality pales in the comparison of these other strong actors who playing even stronger characters. I cannot help but wonder what someone like Fran Drescher of "The Nanny" would have provided in this role. One could argue that Moore provides an anchor of normality to the whole thing but almost every other actor in this movie was a bit over the top so why not complete the set. Oh well, guess that's why I am not casting movies, right?Thanks for reading my review.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a generally "pleasant" film, or even "cute," as some women might put it....but not more much. It's definitely a "chick flick." It was another early vehicle for Johnny Depp to play an oddball, something he's done ever since (and done well). He's fun to watch here, too. A highlight is his impersonation of some Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin routines.Frankly, I didn't care for the rest of the lead characters, those played by Aiden Quinn (too blasphemous) and Mary Stuart Masterson (nice at first, but then pouts all the time which gets tiresome). Quinn's girlfriend is also a brat.If you like Depp, then this is worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Some cultures are defined by their relationship to cheese."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a tendency to watch films like this from a certain distance and on a different level than I think the casual viewer would. That's because I have two adult children who have struggled with mental illness, one more severely than the other. Both are functional now but one always wonders how or when a future tipping point might occur. With that first hand perspective, I didn't get a clear sense that Joon (Mary Stuart Masterson) was all that sick - "because you know, ..., except for being a little mentally ill, she's pretty normal." That was Sam's (Johnny Depp) analysis, and I think he got it right. There were only a couple of episodes where Joon acted out abnormally - the one time she got angry with Benny (Aidan Quinn) over Sam, and later on with Sam on the bus. But on both occasions, one could understand how a 'normal' person might react the same way.So with that said, I saw this more as an eccentric little love story, with maybe Sam being the challenged character more so than Joon. I mean seriously, Benny won (lost?) him in a card game, when have you ever heard of that happening? It's Sam who helps the viewer understand the point of view that eccentricity and being a little 'off' isn't always such a bad thing and that maybe there's a little room for a quirky character in everyone's life.So maybe it's not a great movie, but you'll probably remember "Benny and Joon" a lot longer than the last action adventure you just watched. It doesn't need over the top chase scenes or mindless explosions to put it's message across, and you come out of the experience with a nice warm feeling that things just might work out if you apply a little love and understanding with the crazy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Barfi!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Searching round online for a friend recently, who was after any info related to a Bollywood movie called Barfi!,I was surprised to discover,that the new Bollywood title seemed to have been greatly inspired by a near forgotten 1993 Rom-Com Drama starring Johnny Depp.With being very interested in discovering where the Bollywood movie took its inspiration from,I decided that it was a good time to pay Benny and Joon a hopefully special visit.The plot:Finding it increasingly difficult to look after his mentally ill sister Juniper "Joon" Pearl,Benjamin "Benny" Pearl decides to pay a visit to the family's doctor (Dr.Garvey),in the hope that she can find a solution so that Benny can continue to look after Joon and keep a grip on his job as a mechanic.With having always been impressed with how Benny has coped with the pressure of looking after his sister,ever since their parents tragically died in a car crash 12 years ago,Dr.Garvey advises Benjamin that it might be a good idea if he allowed for some "space" to be created between himself and Jupier,by allowing Joon to go into a group home.Feeling uneasy about Garvey's suggestion,Benjamin promises her that he will think about the idea,quickly leaves Garvey's office,and heads home to Joon.Giving up on finding someone who can take care of his sister so that he attend a weekly poker night with his work mates,Benny decides that for the first time ever,he will take Joon along to the poker night.Pleased to see all his workmates and Joon getting on with each other,Benny decides to leave the table so that he can sort out some food.Returning to the table,Benjamin is shocked to find out that Juniper is playing an intense game of poker with a work buddy of his called Mike.Demanding that the game is stopped,Benny discovers that he is to late,when Joon reveals her game-losing hand.Prepairing to pay up Joon's debt,Benny is left speechless when Mike tells him that the bet does not involve money,but instead involves Benny having to take care of Mike's mentally ill cousin called Sam.View on the film:Showing signs of what could have been if he had not had a terrible double knock-out in his film career with Diabolique and the infamous 1998 box office bomb The Avengers, (which,in the guys defence,was re-cut against his wishes by the studio)director Jeremiah S.Chechik uses long,elegant zoom takes which allow the natural chemistry that the actors/character have with each other to be placed right at the front of the movie,with the long tacks also allowing for subtle changes in the body language from each of the characters to rise to the suffice.Along with the classy,long zoom takes and filling the soundtrack with some prime Grunge cuts, (with one of the highlights being a song used from the great band Temple of the Dog)Chechik and cinematography John Schwartzman keep any dark colours firmly isolated to the movies one flashback scenes,so that they can scatter the film with light colours,that along with connecting to Joon's interest in art,also gives the film an irresistible breezy atmosphere.Keeping away from the traditional route of Rom-Com Drama's where a boo- hiss baddie does everything to tear the characters apart,the excellent screenplay by Barry Berman and Lesley McNeil instead shows each of the characters to be flawed,but good hearted people,with the terrific group of supporting actors (William H.Macy,Oliver Platt and Joe Grifasi) emphasising the tight-knitted community that Berman and McNeil build in the screenplay.Taking things in a pretty original direction by making Benny and Joon brother and sister instead of lovers,Berman and McNeil show the family bond to run strong between each of them,with Joon trying to sort out a date for Benny,and Benny doing his best to handle the problems relate to Joon's mental difficulty due to how much he cares about his sister,which also strongly makes the important,non-preachy central message of the film that people with mental problems or learning difficulties should be treated with the same amount of respect that others receives.Shuffling into the film with the spirit of Buster Keaton in his wings,Johnny Depp gives a splendid performance as Sam,with Depp performing a number of eye-catching,Keaton inspired stunts himself.Along with the impressive stunt work,Depp also does very well at showing Sam slowly break out of his timed shell,as he finds himself,initially unknowingly building a strong connection between Benny and Joon,with Joon's mental problems allowing Sam to feel that he has met someone who he can deeply relate to.Placed at the heart of the movie,Mary Stuart Masterson and Aidan Quinn each give great performances that compliment Benny and Joon's strahants and weaknesses,with Quinn giving a big warm hearted performance as Benny,who he shows is starting to feel distraught over being unable to find a away to deal with Joons difficulties,and Masterson showing Joon trying to deal with her mental problems,with the help of her loyal brother Benny and "new" family member Sam.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joon (Mary Stuart Masterson) is a mentally troubled lady who is in the care of her brother, Benny (Aidan Quinn). Benny runs a car repair business so, during the daytime hours, he hires housekeepers to keep an eye on Joon. That's because she is prone to setting fires or other objectionable behaviors. The latest housekeeper has terrible fights with Joon and leaves. As he begins looking for a replacement, Benny suddenly finds himself winning the services of a young man perfect for the job....in a poker game! Sam (Johnny Depp) is a kind but slightly weird person with an obsession for old movies. He accepts his new job guarding Joon. However, Joon is pretty and Sam is a looker. They fall in love. But, will Benny and the mental health advocates allow the relationship to flourish? This is an exceptional love story between two unusual people. The script is a thoughtful and thought provoking look at mental illness and mental patients' rights and needs. Masterson, Quinn, and Depp are marvelous as the principal players. Julianne Moore, in an early role, is very good as a waitress who becomes entangled with the problems of the troubled trio. The setting on the west coast is lovely and the costumes just right. If you love love stories, you will be happy to find this film, yes. But, it's out of the ordinary looks at filial love and young love will have everyone cheering at the end.</fullReview>

If you want a sweet, funny comedy when you just want to chill out, then "Benny and Joon" is the film for you.I figured since it was one of the few Johnny Depp films that i hadn't yet seen and thought that i should. He seems to effortlessly make you love Sam, the slightly quirky cousin who you can't help but smile at and want to keep for yourself.I recommend this film to any Johnny Depp fan who hasn't seen his comic side, the man is a chameleon and also to any one who just needs something to put a smile on your face.This film has won a place in my heart.</fullReview>

Sorry, but I'm limited to a mere thousand words. Suffice to say that any stretch of film longer than 30 seconds from the opening credits to the end credits could easily qualify as a "favorite" scene. But when all is said and done, I think not enough has been said about the performance of Mary Stuart Masterson as Juniper. What an incredible insight she had about her character, and the chemistry between Joon and Sam was letter perfect. But if cornered and threatened with an endless loop of (insert title of just about any TV sitcom Here) I would have to break down and say that the combination of the songs "500 Miles" and "Wasted" with the accompanying scenes were very special, especially with the grilled cheese cooking lesson.</fullReview>

Director Jeremiah Chechik may have a somewhat mixed track record("The Avengers" anyone?),but he wisely keeps a light touch on this story,and the work is well-served for it.

		<shortDescription>Sweet and charming but still makes you think</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The one thing that particularly strikes me about Benny and Joon is that none of the characters are pigeon-holed. You can't just say Benny is 'normal' and Joon is 'crazy', to use her brother's word, and I think that makes the film interesting. It also brings up my favourite theory about sanity and insanity - how does someone know they are sane enough to make judgements about other people's sanity?None of the characters are stereotypes. For instance, Benny's attitude to his little sister is very complex. He wants to be responsible for her - he'd do anything to avoid having her institutionalised - and he does care about her. In the absence of their late parents, I am inclined to think that Benny has become the parent to Joon. One scene that sticks in my mind relating that is when they are talking together just before she goes to sleep at night - it's more what you'd expect from father and daughter than brother and sister.On the other hand, it also strikes me that - although Benny can accept that Joon has psychological problems - he sometimes uses that as an excuse not to understand her at crucial parts within the film. Joon herself is no one-dimensional character, either. It's not explicitly stated that she has some form of mental illness but you know it within ten minutes of the film starting, yet that doesn't stop her being very bright. She's a lot more intelligent than Benny gives her credit for - it's as though Benny finds it easier to think of her as the child she was when they lost their parents.I've seen Johnny Depp in a number of different films now, and I can honestly say that - if I didn't know it was him - I never would have thought he was the actor playing Sam. This character is extraordinary, a very physically comic character who can evoke sympathy for himself while saying very little at all. I certainly don't think he's in any way psychologically unbalanced - I actually think he's probably highly intelligent.The interaction between Sam, Benny and Joon is also interesting - it seems that, at the bottom of Benny's dislike of Sam's relationship with Joon, is this jealousy that Sam can connect with his sister in a way that he can't. After one particular development in Sam and Joon's relationship, it's touching that - on hearing Benny come home - Joon disappears off to her own room so that she won't be found with Sam. She obviously values her brother's opinion that much that she doesn't want him to think badly of her.On a more technical note, I have never seen so much colour (or seen anyone make such a mess) at the beginning of any film before. There are some well-framed single shots - for instance the shot of Sam on the train reading his book - and I think the instrumental music is very effective in suggesting the slightly odd nature of the relationships between the characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely Magical Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Benny &amp; Joon is a sweet story about a brother who has been caring for his sister since their parents' deaths in a car accident. The car accident, parents' deaths and noise that accompanied the accident has callused Joon (Masterson) to be mentally ill. Joon causes housekeepers to quit because of her sometimes bizarre behavior. Benny (Quinn) plays cards with a group of friends (Hedaya, Platt and Grifasi) and they play "for keeps". Benny is late one evening so Joon plays and wins "Sam" (Johnny Depp) who has been staying with Grifasi and driving him crazy. Joon and Sam soon discover that they belong together. This is a wonderful movie with a wonderful story, well worth watching for that alone. But beyond the story is Johnny Depp's magnificently entertaining performance of tender touches, wonderful facial expressions and brilliant Buster Keaton-like skits that put this movie into the category of one you want to own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie has a lot of depth for the viewer.... Sam's cooking, acting, and desire to learn are stand out scenes. Benny's lack of "his own self" time, the first time in Ruthie's apartment, and strong desire to make his home situations work. Joon's mental illness, yet she grasps many things missed by normal people. The whole story line is awesome.... imagine? One that is not profane or sexual based! I had to watch this movie twice to really see the breadth of it. I enjoyed quite a bit more the second time and plan on recording it. I came to appreciate the many spontaneous moments contained the second time around.</fullReview>

Johnny Depp is a perfect for the role of Sam and the story is one of utmost beauty and comical value.The movie is both funny and deep and includes cameos from Oliver Platt and Julianne Moore.

		<fullReview>Benny &amp; Joon is a movie that we all have long since forgotten about. I just recently purchased the DVD and have seen the beauty in the amazing performances all over again. Johnny Depp is magnificent in his portrayal of a Buster Keatonesque character. Mary Stuart Masterson does a wonderful job playing Pearl Juniper who is slightly mental. Everything about this film begs for it to be a classic. With the help of colorful supporting characters like Oliver Platt and Julianne Moore this story really comes to life right in front of your eyes. The color throughout the movie is also very well planned. Especially the scene in the park next to the pond. When you watch it you'll know exactly which shot i'm referring to. So if you haven't seen the movie yet, or just haven't seen it for a long time....go out and rent it ASAP.~Heather~</fullReview>

Since I myself have been diagnosed with a mental illness, I can totally sympathize with Sam and Joon. People have this mind-set that all mentally ill people are drooling, crazed idiots that do nothing but weave baskets! Let me tell you, they are SO,SO,very wrong! These people are severe cases....we are not all like that!...like Joon says "Don,t under-estimate the mentally ill....we can count!" I can really relate to this movie, and I do love Johnny Depp oh so much! Everyone should see this movie. Don,t miss out on an excellent movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the first movie for me to see that was filmed in my local area and it was the start of my compilations. I've started collecting movies filmed in or around Spokane, WA. The hate scene in Riverfront Park is probably my favorite. This is cute little piece that touches on mental illness. There are many good scenes and lots of Spokane landmarks like The Milkbottle Cafe where the infamous tap dancing donut scene takes place. The train sequence is filmed in North Pend Orielle County on the Lions Club train ride loop. The train rides are still ongoing up in Ione, WA. I'm actually surprised this movie has gotten such a low arithmetic vote.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb in its simplicity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Benny and Joon is the story about a brother (Aidan Quinn), who takes care of his mentally ill sister (Mary Stuart Masterson). When I first heard of the plot line, I thought it sounded a little boring, almost like one of those after school specials, when they teach you about the hardships of being mentally ill, or the fortune that may come to you if you are kind. When I did see the movie, it blew me away! I now own it, and watch whenever I can.It starts off showing the audience into the everyday life of Benny and Joon. From Benny's reactions to Joon's demands and her constant outbursts, we see that he is having a deep inner conflict with himself. He is a good brother, a responsible person, and a fine gentlemen.Then Sam comes in (Johnny Depp), who is nothing like anybody has ever seen. He brings comedy and goofiness into Benny and Joon's life, almost spoiling their everyday routine. Depp's performance as Sam is probably one of his best. He has a knack at making the characters he plays seem so realistic, that you feel like you actually know him yourself. From cooking grilled cheese with an iron, to performing street comedy with a hat-- which by the way is so real, it's almost like watching Buster Keaton or Charlie Chaplin perform right in front of you-- he blows the audience away, making the film seem more original then it turns out to be.The film is simple (no action, or violence, or supernatural events), but it really hits a spot in your life, making it seem more than what it appears. I give it an 8 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Benny &amp; Joon is one of my all-time favorites! I was particularly impressed with the manner in which Joon's mentally ill character was portrayed. I've worked with schizophrenic women and have always been awed by the scope and depth of their personalities. I have also been puzzled by most people's perceptions and treatment of such individuals. People are afraid of someone different than themselves and while this is a normal response to unfamiliar situations, it limits our intrapersonal experiences. We are not clones. People come in all colors, shapes, sizes and with each is a particular personality set. We are all UNIQUE. Viva la difference! Eh? It's a shame that we all are not as open and giving as the character Sam.</fullReview>

I admire Johnny Depp's attempt at Buster Keaton and feel that this film will lead to interest in Buster Keaton films such as The Cameraman, which is chock-full of slpastick comedy. The scenes of the tap-dancing bread and imiatation of a cheesy horror flick top my list as some of the most funny and impressionable scenes in this film. I recommend it to anyone who wants a good love story that also happens to be a good laugh.</fullReview>

Johnny Depp once again does an absolutely stunning performance in this movie, on the role as a sane but creative character who falls in love with a mentally ill woman.I just happened to be browsing movies on Netflix when I came across the movie. It said Johnny Depp starred in the movie. The description sounded interesting, and if Johnny Depp's in it, then I'll take it! When the movie arrived I put it in my DVD player first thing. Throughout the whole movie I had my eyes fixed on Johnny. (Can't help myself.) He does a stunning performance!! Mary Stuart Masterson also does an INCREDIBLE job on her role. Same to Aidin Quinn. I will tell you, I have never seen such better acting in any other movie in my whole entire life!!! This movie rates an 11 in a group of 10. ;) Benny &amp; Joon is my favorite romance/drama/comedy movie. Love ya, Johnny!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should have been called Benny,Joon and Sam too</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>* Terrible * * Below Par * * * Not Bad * * * * Good * * * * * BrilliantWARNING *POSSIBLE SPOILERS*It was in 1993 that the world's box office tills were ringing like they hadn't rung before.This was down to the fact that Steven Spielbergs multi-million dollar dinosaur movie 'Jurassic Park' was breaking box office records world wide to become the highest grossing picture of all time.It's a film that would ultimately pull in over $900 million world wide. It's any wonder then that this modest little movie,'Benny and Joon' which was released in cinema theatres around the same time managed to find an audience.After all with the likes of the Mel Gibson,Jodie Foster Comedy/Western 'Maverick' and Arnold Schwarzeneggers 'Last Action Hero' failing at the box office it was some wonder that this managed to pull in some cinema goers.The fact however that this was a low budget movie may have worked in its favor, considering it would not have had to rake in a vast amount of cash to break even.While the likes of 'Jurassic Park','Last Action Hero' and so on relied a lot on flashy special effects and amazing stunts to pull in the crowds.'Benny and Joon' relied more on good old fashioned story telling that came from a fresh and original script and a good cast of talented actors.The movie told the story of Benny and Juniper(Joon)Pearl(Aiden Quinn and Mary Stuart Masterson),a brother and sister who live in a small town.Benny who works as a mechanic and runs his own garage has had to make some sacrifices in his life to try and look after Joon as she is mentally ill.This means that the devoted brother who is in to his thirties has had no time for a relationship with a woman and is therefore unmarried.The fact that Joon has driven away every house keeper that Benny has employed to watch her and the house while he is busy at work has not helped matters for him either.Then one night when Benny is playing poker with some of his pals. One of his so called pals ropes Joon in to the game when her brothers back is turned. Mike(Joe Grifasi)bets Joon that if he wins the next hand, that she and Benny must take Mike's eccentric cousin Sam(A wonderful Johnny Depp) off of his hands. Of course what happens is that Joon loses much to Benny's dismay when he finds out.Benny though begrudgingly takes in Sam to live with them.Sam proves to be a rather odd individual who is iliterate and models himself on the silent screen legends Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin. He mimics their most ingenius, physical comedic routines and even uses them to do the house work in Benny and Joons home.Benny is of course against Sam from the word go but events take shape so that Benny meets and falls in love with a beautiful waitress named Ruthie(Julianne Moore).Meanwhile, unknown to Benny a odd little romance begins to develop between Joon and Sam.The over protective Benny as you can imagine will not be best pleased when he finds out.This is a lovely,quirky little movie. Something in the vain of 'Harold and Maude' but with out the black adult humour.This is the story of an odd relationship that somehow works even though one of the movies protaganists is mentally challenged and the other is a bit off the wall.What makes the movie work so well are the performances from a great cast.Aiden Quinn who is a wonderful actor makes for a sympathetic and likeable lead while Mary Stuart Masterson gives a gentle,cooky child like performance in the challenging roll of Joon.The movie ultimately though belongs to Johnny Depp whose performance as the eccentric yet endearing Sam is simply breathtaking.Depp who is one of Hollywoods most versatile actors manages to mimic the brilliant routines of Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin with uncanny ability.His facial expressions as he performs every prat fall is so much like those kings of the silent movie era that it's quite scary.Only one other actor who have witnessed on celluloid has managed to do this and that is Robert Downey Jr.Depp however is aided by a good script that was penned by Barry Berman and Lesley McNeil.The way these two screen scribes manage to have Sam perform his routines during the most everyday routines of visiting a cafe or taking a walk in a park is ingenius in it's simplicity.It's partly down to their talents as writers that Sam is such a real and engaging character.Berman and McNeil also take on the brave and difficult task of creating a light comedic Drama/Romance that deals with the rather tricky subject of mental illness.They at once treat the topic with the warmth and sensitivity that it deserves and are not afraid to show the dark side to the illness in what is for the most part a rather up beat movie.Joon is treated as a person and not someone who should be mocked.Her unique relationship with Sam also is a subject that is treated with odd dignity and pathos.Berman and McNeil also make the wise choice of down playing any hints of a sexual relationship between the too which might have hindered the movie.Any Physicality is in the gentle brushing together of the couples faces or in the holding of hands.Final recognition must also go to Julianne Moore who gives a lovely performance as Ruthie, the waitress and former B-movie actress who falls for Benny. It's Ruthie who Benny wants but even though she is what he wants he feels she is unattainable.The loyal brother feels bound by his duty to his sister and though he wants the lovely waitress so badly, his sister Joon is always stamped on the back of his mind.Ruling his conscience.It is however the growing romance and it's normality that creates a wonderful parallel to the eccentricity of that which grows between Sam and Joon.It is only in the movies denounment that Berman and McNeil botch things up. Benny is forced to ask for Sams help when Joon is admitted to a mental institution after she freaks out on a bus with her quirky boyfriend.Benny and Sam sneak in to the hospital as the mechanic is barred from seeing his sister.Benny only wants the chance to try and reconcile with his sister with whom he has fallen out of favor with.Its what occurs between, Benny, Joon and her Psychiatrist Dr.Garvey (CCH Pounder)that stretches credibility.The final decision she makes when it comes to the mentally ill Joons well fare asks for us to swallow something that is quite hard to digest.a shame rally as what has gone before was so good.The movie sadly ends on a note that just doesn't quite work and asks a fair amount from the audience believe.Plus the movies title of 'Benny and Joon' is a bit misleading considering it's also very much about Sam as well as the two siblings.But that is a minor fault.That said this is still a lovely little movie.A far cry from the multi-million dollar blockbusters that hit our screens every year.Its not perfect but in retrospect it's a good deal better than some of the overly hyped popcorn movies that don't always meet with our expectations.If you like your movies to be a little quirky and different then I would suggest you look no further than 'Benny and Joon.'Robs Rating:* * * *</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>B&amp;J, but mostly Depp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this movie. I've seen it at least 5 times and I still love it. It's not a great film (altho' Depp's performance is great). It's not entirely logical, but since when did that matter to Hollywood? This movie has something many movies lack (and it is a serious flaw in those movies): an inner coherence that trumps Logic for the Literal. This film is not trying to show what it's *really* like to live with schizophrenia (altho' I think it deals with the subject respectfully--Joon is depicted as an intelligent, creative and somewhat haunted individual, which is what many schizophrenics are like. And anyone who has ever lived with someone who is mentally ill or emotionally disturbed can tell you that the experience is tragedy and drudgery and, at times, wildly funny.) But I digress. The point of this film, I believe, is to gently show us the healing potential of love and art. Not necessarily in that order.Masterson and Quinn are both fine actors, and their performances here are excellent (one of Aidan Quinn's best, I think.) But Johnny Depp is simply remarkable. His physical presence and grace are unequalled by anyone I can think of, even Steve Martin. He has frequently taken unusual roles and turned potentially disastrous films, like Dead Man, into very good ones. B&amp;J is another example--in the hands of a lesser actor this film could have fallen victim to its own sentimentality. Depp has made ordinary pictures (From Hell) well worth going to see (though even Depp could not make The Astronaut's Wife watchable) and has turned reasonably entertaining films (Pirates of the Caribbean) into very good films indeed, simply by virtue of his performances. As he has matured his ability to inhabit his characters has deepened, and people as different as Raoul Duke (Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas), George (Blow) and Jack Sparrow (Pirates...) come to life through him.Johnny Depp is one of the best actors around, equally adept at drama or comedy. In fact, given his range, he may be the greatest actor working today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**CAUTION: may contain spoilers**I first saw this movie on TV one night, a long time ago. I barely remembered anything about it except that I liked it, so when I saw it was on TV again, I made sure to watch it.WOW! I had forgotten how moving this film is. Joon's mental illness, while never classified as specifically this or that, is still realistically portrayed. Mary Stuart Masterton's portrayal of the character evokes a range of emotions. While watching this movie, I laughed at the humor, but cried at the very real dark moments. And dark moments there are; this movie is far from sugary-sweet. The scene on the bus still gives me chills.I am a huge fan of Johnny Depp; it's a rare actor that can express as much as he can without using words. Although this talent of his is probably best shown in Edward Scissorhands, the character of Sam is another perfect vehicle for him.Aidan Quinn was good as Joon's brother, Benny. He played the protective older brother perfectly; he and Joon had real chemistry on the screen.And, of course, the romance involved serves to remind each of us that, hopeless though it may sometimes seem, there is love waiting for each of us, no matter what our problems or disabilities may be.</fullReview>

A woman I know who has been hospitalized several times for mental problems loves this movie. She says it's about time someone treated people like her with love and acceptance instead of with fear, pity or revulsion. This movie never falls into the trap of considering either character pitiable; they're just at different points but both far out along the curve compared to "normal" people.

Mary Stuart Masterson was perfectly cast in the role of Joon, portraying her mentally infirm character in a sensitive and sympathetic way. Johnny Depp was superb as Sam especially in Buster Keaton mode. This movie is perfect grounding for those unfamiliar with Depp's talent and charisma. He uses his eyes and facial expressions to convey more than words ever can. The finest actor of his generation. I adore the scene set in the bathroom with Benny taking a shower and Sam (Depp)sitting in the bath. When Benny informs Sam that Joon hears voices in her head this delightful look of recognition comes across Sam's face and it is clear that he and Joon have much in common. The scene where Sam swings past Joon's hospital window is very moving and full of hope, not too mention the fact that the camera catches Depp's profile at his most beautiful.

		<shortDescription>Love is for Everyone.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a sweet, tender and funny movie. It just goes to prove that love can find everyone. It seems to me that Joon and Sam react to love in a more honest way than a lot of so called "normal" people that I know. And the love exists on many levels. No one can ever say that Benny does not love his sister greatly, even though, at first, the love leads him to do some misguided things.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An auto mechanic named Benny is a devoted and adoring brother to his mentally ill sister, Joon. They exist well enough until Joon loses a poker game and both she and Benny have to take in another players cousin, Sam. Sam is quirky and eccentric, his antics falling in with those of the great Buster Keaton. Operating as house keeper, Sam quickly settles in and wins Benny around, but as Sam and Joon start falling for each other, things start to take a rather different course.When a film has a character win another human being at cards, it's either going to be a dark nasty piece or a whimsical tale. Benny and Joon is the latter. Apparently chided for its poor portrayals of mental illness {tellingly tho, Joon's illness is not identified} Benny &amp; Joon just about survives the pit fall traps because of its engaging cast. Johnny Depp as Sam is utterly beguiling while Mary Stuart Masterton {Joon} is sweet and affecting in what is after all, the difficult role. Very much a serious story cloaked in the afore mentioned whimsy, Jeremiah S. Chechik's film has some things to say about overcoming obstacles and the need for human connection in sometimes trying circumstances. But most importantly it dares to suggest that something as simple as treating the supposedly mentally ill with respect, warmth and dignity just may garner important and life changing results???? I can't honestly say I could be tempted to watch this film again because it's an oddity that seems confused to what it primarily wants to be. If indeed the makers themselves from the off had a course in mind for the story and how it panned out? But it does have a lot of supporters and it's not too much of a stretch to understand why, warm, quirky, and maybe important? 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was a great movie. To me the movie would be loved by thousands upon thousands of people. I lend it to my Tio, they watched it, and loved it. It was an amazing movie. It is one of my favorite movies. Johnny Depp was great in the film along with all the other characters. They performed really well. I don't remember it coming out because I was very young at the time. I feel that this is the type of the movie that you can watch overs and overs without getting bored of it in less than a week. Everyone who worked in this film probably gave all they had in putting this film together. You can tell by the first time you watch it, that everyone did a tremendous job. I recommend this movie for all ages and groups.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Benny &amp; Joon" is about Benny and Joon Pearl, a brother-sister team still living together years after their parents died. She is mentally ill and so he takes care of her, but it has quite the negative impact on his life, we see him turn down an invitation to dinner from a beautiful girl so he can tend to Joon. He's not doing very good, and his friends (and Joon's psychiatrist) urge him to put Joon in a group home so he can take care of himself, but he is a very kind, empathetic man and so he doubts it.The roles are played by Mary Stuart Masterson and Aidan Quinn, and this, by itself, could've been the plot, but then the writer throws a fastball at us: at an unusual poker game Joon "wins" a friend's roommate/cousin. The cousin is Sam (Johnny Depp) an illiterate, quiet young man who's main goal in life seems to be to live as Chaplin or Buster Keaton. Sam isn't bright, but he is a barrel of unrequited goodness, and on his first day with the Pearls he cleans their house.In many a different movie Sam would've fixed the Pearls lives while he stayed with them, but this movie is original, and so Sam has flaws of his own. He can't read or write (but he tries hard at it) and doesn't seem to understand the importance of Joon's condition.Sam may not fix their lives, but he does kind of initiate the process of helping them. Joon falls in love with him, yes, but that alone doesn't save her, she needs her brother too, and the healing isn't completely done by the end of the film.Benny is pretty much the main character, and we see him as he reacts to the two kooks romance, and even has a romance of his own, with Ruthie (Julianne Moore) and ex-actress who is now a waitress at a nearby diner.But the movie is realistic (in a way, anyway) and all three of the main characters' lives have not been perfected by the end. We are merely seeing a very important part in their lives. And it is fun to watch.The best scene of the movie comes around the middle, when Sam spontaneously breaks into a Chaplin/Keaton style act in the middle of a park while everyone stares in wonder (including the audience). Depp is magical and so is this scene, and it is worth the movie alone.The performances are a high point too, Masterson, Quinn and especially Depp are masterful in their roles. All three of the characters are lovable, even at their low points.The movie is a joy to watch, and its quirky comedy is fresh and fun, everyone who loves good films with big hearts should watch.7.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>adorable artsy fartsy love story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS: I saw B&amp;J around the time it came out. I remember going to the local record store and buying the sound track afterwards. I was 13/14 or so... when i was 11 i had just learned to juggle (and begin performing) so there can be some obvious connections made as to why I love this movie. I recently watched it again and took away some new feelings, while revisiting some old ones.Depp is great in this movie, he plays his character half sane, half with-it. He is extremely soft spoken and communicates mostly through imitations of slapstick comedy routines, aping Chaplin, Keaton(Buster), among the more well known. In this way it comments on silent film. Though the film is a talkie, the love shared between Sam and Joon Pearl, is a silent yet deep one, cooked under the warmth of an iron. The movie is also the dramatization of collage, thus invoking dada, surrealism, fluxus, and various 20th/21st century art movements / techniques. Playing cards for random house-hold items, and of course SAM's entire character and existence in this narrative, are case in point. As a performer, one learns how to cut, flip, spin, collage, and imitate (copy... think xerox)... Another movie in which this is also shown is FUNNY BONES 1995 (Jerry Lewis, Oliver Platt (Eric in B&amp;J), and Lee Evans (who would be the equivalent of Johnny Depp's character). There are probably more, i need to think about it, but these are wonderful studies on performance, the role of the performer, as well as the lives behind these great entertainers. Yet, with Benny and Joon, what we get is as a somewhat melodramatic love story.The movie is not a super amazing awesome film, but it deserves an 8 out of 10. As I remember the movie reminds me of a time in my life before I discovered the punk community, when I saw glimpses of an alternative / arty / different than mainstream world. This movie somehow fits into that era, at the moment when the word alternative went from being used accurately within a community to describe their artistic endeavours, to the present when "alternative" as been co-opted and is now the norm (to continue on this time-line... it also seems as if we are passing that moment into the now, which is a blending of the two the mainstream and marginalized communities to the point where the margin and mainstream are both accomplice... yadda yadda) anyway... You can imagine they were listening to Nirvana on the set, (there is something very Washington (state) Oregon-ish to the whole setting??) or maybe i am imagining things, either way the film is somehow born of the time. With B&amp;J you have a sappy love story, which is more or less the main plot, and on the other hand you have some wonderful examples of this trickster (joker) character of Depp's who just shows up in the movie and is a perfect match for our "matchless" Joon. It is also the story of Joon's brother and his ability to let go off his past (which involves the losing of his parents, after which he takes on the responsibility of caring for Joon.... could the death of their parents been a contributing factor to Joon's instability?) and move on to enjoying his own life and the life of Julianne Moore's character Ruthie. The end scene when Benny lays the flowers for her (them) in the doorway is especially sweet, as it shows us he is ready to move forward. ... not interrupting their "silent" moment.Another wonderful tidbit, is that in the end, Sam is totally content and wants be Joon's partner, as opposed to Benny's dream for him of touring and performing for people. He is happiest being with Joon, she is his greatest audience. Our art-hero shines brightly in this small-town, in-love and living with Joon, working at the movie store, hanging with the fam.(gratuitous star fawning) Oh the "woman customer" played by Lynette Walden is totally hot (in the most grunge rocker STP, Dinosaur Jr., Nirvana, Polvo way)!!! she could come back stage to my show anyday!!! amazing!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie on DVD in a shop and bought it merely because it had Johnny Depp in it. I'd never seen it before and so sat down last night prepared for some light fluff.But, although the plot (mentally ill girl with overprotective brother who exist alone after the death of their parents) may seem familiar, the performances in this movie make it something truly special.Depp, Masterson, Quinn and Moore are perfectly cast and watching their relationships grow is a delight.There are very few movies that can make me laugh out loud when I'm by myself in my loungeroom but this one managed it several times. As far as I'm concerned, it's worth seeing for the mashed potato scene alone.Looking at this movie and considering some of Depp's other choices, you have to wonder if he's one of the most underrated actors around. I don't think there's any other actor I know who can so totally immerse himself in a role as Depp can.So lightweight romantic comedy? Yes. But also poignant sweet story which has me still smiling this morning as I write this. There's nothing wrong with a movie just being 'nice'. But this one is 'nice' with a backbone. Simply told and lovely to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Touching and Sweet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Benny and Joon" tells a simple, touching love story. The love is both romantic, and familial. The story is set in an abbreviated family consisting of two young adult siblings, Benny, a successful mechanic, and Joon, his mentally ill younger sister. Most of the time Joon is fine, but occasionally she flips out, becoming abusive and violent or just very weird. In caring for Joon, Benny's life is slipping away. He has some male friends, but no girlfriend, and no life outside of his job, caring for Joon, and a little poker with his friends. In a poker game, Joon, sitting in for Benny, loses big; the penalty being that Benny and Joon must take in a friend's cousin, Sam, as a boarder. Sam is learning disabled, and an eccentric; he models his appearance and mannerisms after Buster Keaton. Sam and Joon provide the romance part of the story. The drama is supplied by the growing pressure on Benny to institutionalize Joon; for both her and Benny's betterment.There is no drug addiction, crime, spies, or car chases in "Benny and Joon". It is just a gentle, romantic tale, told well. I recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mediocre three man show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is about a young working man who has to take care of his mentally ill sister. Their relationship is changed when there is a surprise visitor staying with them."Benny &amp; Joon" concentrates more on the dynamics between people. I did not find Benny or Joon sympathetic at all. I was fascinated by Sam though, I think Johnny Depp did very well as an likable but eccentric person. The film is a three man show, not much else happens, rendering the entire supporting cast to being entirely unimportant. It is a pity, as Julianne Moore and William H Macy's roles were so redundant that they could have been cut out altogether without affecting the story. On the whole, the film is just mediocre. Nothing much dramatic happens as it is interpersonal dynamics driven.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Half-baked, but Depp is superb</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*MINOR SPOILERS*A self-consciously quirky addition to the romantic comedy genre, there are a great many things wrong with Benny &amp; Joon. The question of mental illness is raised, but never answered or examined. It is then used as a basis for humour, in poor taste. Then there are the glib plot lines that fail to go anywhere: Benny's new-found respect for Sam, potential careers for Sam and Joon, the question of reconciliation. The characters are poorly rounded, the scenarios false. On the plus side: there is Johnny Depp.Perhaps the most gifted actor of his generation, Depp has a deft and wonderful skill for caricature, which can be comic or dramatic. More often than not it is both. In Benny &amp; Joon he plays a young man of questionable mental health who is obsessed with the comedy of Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin. He recreates a handful of Keaton's routines (though unfortunately none of his more outrageous stunts!) and in a bravura sequence in the local diner, performs Chaplin's Dance of the Rolls (from his 1925 film The Gold Rush). Depp's performance is not central to the action- he is on the periphery, a beautiful sideshow to the melodramatics of Masterson and Quinn- but it is his film. Having bought the DVD before seeing the film (I am a huge fan of Buster Keaton and also admire Chaplin and Depp), I still watch it from time to time. However, it is only Johnny's routines that I watch, fast forwarding through tantrums, tears, self-pity and artificial nonsense to the park, where a man chases his hat... again... and again... and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favorite movies..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first, I had mixed feelings about this movie. As a person who had experiences with being labeled as a mentally ill person and who knew friends who had mental illnesses as well and weren't able to do certain things because of it, I saw two sides to this movie. One side is a bit over the top, but the other side is a great and positive message.The actors did their job very well in this movie, but the script has some flaws, specially on Joon's side. Sometimes, you feel that Joon's character was overdone, specially when she gets out on the street with the mask or when she drinks her strange cereal shake every morning. It seems like these traits was added for humor, but there's nothing funny about Joon's character. She was very well acted and believable in my opinion, and I usually dislike phony characters very much. This is no usual romantic comedy, which is a movie genre I usually dislike. The relationship between Joon and Depp's character is very sweet and brings the positive message to this movie. This message tells us that everyone can do what they want if they set their heart to it, and that a person like Joon can love and make decisions for herself. It also tells us that anyone can take control of their life if they want to, and that they don't have to adapt to society's rules to be happy.Sure, it's not the smartest movie around, but it's a heart-warming movie with great actors and fun characters. This movie is meant to be cartoony and light-hearted, and not to be taken TOO seriously except for it's message. This is another thing that I liked, but that probably a lot of people weren't able to see. The only advice I can give if you're going to see this movie is not to see it through the eyes of an intellectual critic, but through the eyes of an emotional person.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film, though by no means a masterpiece, is quite a bit better than most seem to think. The cast is excellent, particularly Depp, Quinn and Platt. Masterson is quite good, although at times, her character is treated as an afterthought. I suspect that part of the reason this is less well thought of than it deserves is that it's a quiet, off-beat romantic comedy with characters a bit too odd for most people's comfort. Most people don't react well to "different" in real life, let alone films. Very well-done and worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Benny and Joon stars Mary Stuart Masterson, Johnny Depp and Aidan Quinn, and it's an okay movie, but the subject matter could have been a TV movie of the week just as easily as a silver screen release. Joon is a mentally ill woman who is taken care of by her brother and an endless line of caretakers. She "wins" Sam(Depp) in a poker game, and soon discovers love with the goofy and offbeat character. Quinn is her brother Benny, and he is first reluctant to take Sam in, then angered when he is told of their relationship before finally seeing the need to allow Joon to grow up without his constant direction. Depp is marvelous as Sam, and does a wonderful job in the physical comedy parts of the film as Sam is a devotee of movies, and imitates the comedy stars of the thirties.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Yet another film implicitly about film, again through the device of characters who live partly in a fantasy world.You have the character that lives partly in the film world of the silent greats who finds his place in a video store. The supposition is that he will become an actor.As with the `before' actor, you have the `after' actor, here someone who was in a movie, but returned to real life in Spokane. Just so we don't miss the dual personality theme, the movie she is in features Julianne as two sisters.That's the `before and after' characters. In the middle -- presumably in the summer of discovery, we have Joon. Predictably, she is schizophrenic, and someone who works in image. One assumes her straddling of realities makes her a better painter.This structural conception is rather clever. But the writer and director don't have the skills to make it really sing. Masterson can't make up the difference. What's interesting is how Depp And Julianne Moore step up to their characters.Depp is quite capable of playing several characters at once. Here he plays the charming goof the director wants, the man (as comedic presence) the goof wishes he was; and the man behind the mask showing a wink. He's something, but not precisely controllable. He seems to need weak directors. If he has a strong but dumb director (like Hallestrom), he's loses fire. Here, he's hot.Julianne did this very small role while in her Vanya exercises, filmed the next year. She was also prepping for Altman's "Short Cuts." In those two films (and in others since), she plays several levels simultaneously. Only Cate Blancett and Kate Winslet and Julianne among film actresses can do this. Shows here too. Watch when Depp first plays her playing the horror movie role and tease out the layers: she sees an actor (Depp) acting an actor (Sam) acting an actor (Keaton) acting an actor (Ruthie) who is acting (the horror sister), and reacts on all layers.The writer intended to use the common metaphor of trains going through these layers: `Training,' get it? but he missed.</fullReview>

Johnny Depp performed excellent - as always. His character was super weird, but cute and lovely too. Sam and I have something in common. I envisaged a parallel between us. We both love old movies. Person (me too) is always satisfied when he see something in common between characters and himself.

And Benny's life is stuck in neutral taking care of Joon.MSM is playing Joon as an unabashed quirky character. It doesn't feel authentic. She's supposed to be problematic, but other than the fire thing, she doesn't seem to be that big of a problem. Same goes for Johnny Depp. He's already innately charming. It doesn't fit that he's driving his cousin insane. This is a cute movie where Johnny Depp is having all kinds of fun. There is a more dramatic romance from Benny and the waitress Ruthie (Julianne Moore) if they could let it out. Sam and Joon generate not that much heat. Until the third act, there was little drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sweet film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lovely little film, beautifully made and depicting mental illness in all its complexities extraordinarily well. I.E. mentally ill people are NOT stupid.At times it is laugh out loud funny and the scenes with Johnny Depp in the park are magical.Aidan Quinn was brilliantly cast as the caretaking brother - a fully rounded character, now and again railing against the responsibility of taking care of his sister, Joon.The trauma of the parents' death was well done. This could have been significant in Joon's instability but thankfully, there were no 2 X 4's.Sam, channelling Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin, is a delight.And Joon's studio - what a great room! A wonderful fun film. Would watch again.8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a shame that this film is not very popular. At least I only know very few people who have watched this wonderful movie. But it is really worth watching, as the story is beautiful and heartwarming; the music is lovely; Mary Stuart Masterson's, Johnny Depp's and Aidan Quinn's acting is brilliant; there are scenes that are unforgettable; sad, funny, extraordinary and touching moments; and this film makes you love mentally ill people. It shows that they are 'normal', sometimes they just do things in a different way than we do (e.g. making toast or cleaning the house) and that they can have amazing talents that you would never expect.Benny&amp;Joon is definitely one of my favourites and I recommend it to everybody who does not necessarily need a lot of action etc. in a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Johnny Depp headlines this eccentric film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Benny &amp; Joon" remains distinctive 20 years later for its handling of mental illness, choosing boldly not to preoccupy itself with a clinical approach and instead to focus on its impact on relationships. But really, it's Johnny Depp who makes it a memorable film.The least interesting of the three main characters is the protagonist in this film, Aidan Quinn's Benny. Benny is the blue collar older brother of the mentally unstable Joon (Mary Stuart Masterson), an artist prone to fits including throwing things and pyromania. Both are adults, but Joon obviously needs to be cared for as if a child. After her most recent caretaker quites, Benny finds himself forced to think about sending Joon to a living community, but plans are stalled when an unusual young man ends up in their lives.Sam (Depp) is an eccentric, a young man who models his behavior off silent film star Buster Keaton and performs various physical comedy gags both on purpose yet also intuitively. He charms Joon and after awhile even manages to impress Benny, but he slowly starts to complicate the dynamic between brother and sister.Depp's performance exhibits Keaton but also Gene Wilder ala "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory." He's a joy to watch and an absolute natural when it comes to quirkiness. Although audiences had a taste of his talent in "Edward Scissorhands," it's this film where he shows just how excellent of a physical actor he is, foretelling of his eventual mainstream success.Interesting that Depp gets top billing in the credits when it's a film mostly centered on how Benny will deal with Joon. Perhaps "Christmas Vacation" director Jeremiah S. Chechik didn't realize until into filming how great of a performance he was going to get. Regardless, the script from Berry Berman and Lesley McNeil certainly didn't account for it. We spend too much time watching Benny mishandle Joon as well as his personal life despite his good heart and best intentions. A side plot he has with Julianne Moore as the waitress Ruthie completely detracts from the characters that should be getting more screen time, and it's frustrating because their conflict is handled with such immaturity on the part of both characters.With Joon's disorder not diagnosed for the audience, Masterson has little to draw upon for her performance, but she endears us to Joon with a wide-eyed approach whenever she's not throwing a tantrum. Her preoccupation with a man who also has his quirks but wears them so proudly makes a lot of sense, but we don't get to see their relationship blossom with so much of the film spent following Benny around.It's unclear whether writer Berman intended to have the other characters who aren't Joon make poor decisions about their lives in order to make a point. On one hand, such a notion would be wise and true to a certain degree, but on the other, the decisions are so rash that one has to question the authenticity of the characters."Benny &amp; Joon" mostly sees all its conflict underdeveloped, but the story generates enough curiosity to last the length of the film (though it could really be shorter). Depp's convincing and unusual turn brings a certain life, energy and most importantly memorability to the film, a comedy angle that the film sorely needs. Its approach to conflict is not serious enough to consider it a drama, but it's not nearly romantic enough to be considered a romance. Understandably, it's remembered as a comedy.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com for more</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Swooning over Joon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Today "Benny and Joon", a 1993 romantic comedy, is mostly remembered for an oddball performance by actor Johnny Depp, who plays a young man with a fondness for impersonating silent Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton routines. Depp can't touch Chaplin or Keaton, but his character is at times heartwarming. Depp fangals adore the film, particularly the way Depp risks life and limb for his woman, sticking by her side no matter what. The ladies love it.The film features an early performance by the always interesting Julianne Moore. Like Depp's character, hers is a meta-roll, Moore a good actress playing a bad actress who gave up bad acting to be a good waiter. Most of the film is filler, but Moore and Depp elevate things. Depp would make a career out of playing oddball characters.7.9/10 ? Worth one viewing. See "They Might Be Giants" and "A Thousand Clowns".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Food used in the diner sequences actually came from The Shack Restaurant, the production company could not afford the Shacks asking price (as this would interrupt the daily business and taking away $1000's of dollars from the business) for the use of the Restaurant so it opted for the Milk Bottle and Fergies, so the production people used food from the Shack and drove it to the other two diners. The other goof is the ambulance seen says Deer Park Ambulance which is about 30 miles away from downtown Spokane where the scene takes place. My husband was an extra on this film and also a stand-in for Oliver Platt and Waldo Larsen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where Are These Movies ?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm asking honestly ! This is nothing but sweet and simple stuff. Nothing was complicated or forced. It's a movie to give you one heck of a romantic time, innocent fun, and feel good mood. Everything is tame and perfect. I can go talking about it non-stop..While my 4-year-old cousin loves the bang bang movies; namely the action ones, watching countless of Jackie Chan's or else's, he never actually completed any of them. Strangely this time, while being not a bang bang movie, he completed it and surprisingly loved it! I recall his admiration towards that "guy who irons the bread".The story is so easy yet delicate. Where were these stories back when I was searching for one to make my graduation's project while studying in the high cinema institute?? Rather where are these movies in cinemas or even TV ?? Why the hype goes only for the action, the horror, and the gross-out comedies ??!! I think it must be a ROMANTIC COMEDY with A-LIST STARS and SEX SCENE just to secure a big production, an international publicity, and wide releases. Well, damn on Hollywood then!The thing that I didn't like about such a movie was the vague characterization of Sam or Buster Keaton's greatest fan. Why he was that nice nut-job ? However, on second though, why not? Let's deem it part of this movie's magical simplicity. It has the tenderheartedness of a bedtime story. So I think it would be so rude to ask why Grumpy was grumpy in Snow white, as long as he ? with the entire story ? was a pleasure.Though, still that critical side in me doesn't wish to calm down. So I believe that there wasn't much of a conflict. The problems of the story lines were very few. And the solutions were always facile. Yet it's this movie's character. And why not to make an angel cake of a movie ?! Why everything had to be intricate to be great ? On some level (Benny &amp; Joon) has the old silent movies' unaffectedness, or even naivet, running in its veins. As you see, every try from my side to locate anything wrong with it ends up being denied. Something in me wants just to fall in love with this movie ! Finally, we need this movie, and anything like it, to be capable of living or standing the living in this life we're going through. I can't imagine anyone hates it. But even if let me tell them this : How anybody can refuse a movie where the climax of it is about a lover who climbs a building, and swings over it, only to "see" his love ?!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Remarkable film with an Incredible Performance by Johnny Depp...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Written brilliantly by Barry Berman &amp; Lesley McNeil, Filmmaker Jeremiah S. Chechik's 'Benny &amp; Joon' is maybe the best film we could get when it released way back in 1993. A Fantastic Script, turned into a Fantastic Film.A unique romantic-comedy about misfits, the film looks so-so real at times that you actually feel it's all happening near you. 'Benny &amp; Joon' is Clap-Worthy work.... a film that maybe not be high on entertainment, but a film that goes beyond entertainment. 'Benny &amp; Joon' has 1 major plus point, in fact the biggest plus and that is of course is the Legendary Johnny Depp. He's Incredible throughout. And yes, the way he makes Grilled Cheese Sandwiches is quite interesting to watch. Mary Stuart Masterson is excellent as Joon. Playing a mentally ill character with great, great understanding. Aidan Quinn is superb as Benny. He's in character in every scene. Julianne Moore is wasted. On the whole 'Benny &amp; Joon' is not to be missed for it's strange, but everlasting beauty. Two Thumbs Up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Benny and Joon Delight!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Benny and Joon is one of those feel good movies driven solely on character development and good acting. Johnny Depp is magnificent in this film. His character is simple yet complicated. No matter what film Johnny Depp is in, he's always terrific in good character development even if the movie stinks. The relationship between Sam and Joon is heart felt, innocent and always put a smile on my face. This is a good clean movie that should be seen by all. This was the first time I've seen this movie and it was great to see and recognize some great "Before they were stars" talent. Aidan Quinn was a joy to watch as the protagonist/ Antagonist. Julianne Moore as the love interest for Aidan was a delight. Oliver Platt and William H. Macy in small but good roles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that will make you smile</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw 'Benny and Joon' almost completely by accident, since I'd never heard of this film before. And I didn't have too high expectations, so I couldn't have been more shocked by how much I loved this movie. Having rented it, I went straight out to buy it and have seen it tons of times and still can't get enough.This is the most original storyline I've ever seen and really, really works. Joon, is mentally ill and has been in the care of her older brother since their parents died 12 years before. But just as he is beginning to worry about her safety after she kicks out yet another one of her housekeepers Joon loses at a poker game where one of Benny's friends has bet his irritating cousin. In comes Sam, a kind, sweet and extremely eccentric man and both their lives are changed in ways they couldn't have ever imagined.To me 'Benny and Joon' is a great movie for lots of reasons. The characters in this (partially Depp's 'Sam') are among the most likable characters in any film I've seen. All three of the main stars I think did I wonderful job in this. The relationship between Sam and Joon was just lovely, and despite Joon's mentally health, what kind of girl wouldn't want to be her just so you can kiss and cuddle Johnny Depp? With brilliant performances, a beautiful romance, laugh-out-loud comedy, heart wrenching drama, wonderful weirdness and a film that is granted to make you smile no matter what kind of day you've had. What's not to like?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my favorite movie ever. It will always be my favorite movie. In fact, every time I watch a movie, I compare it to Benny &amp; Joon. Sounds weird, I know, but it's just my way of rating movies.Benny &amp; Joon has everything I would ever want in a movie; comedy, romance, drama, and an awesome script. I mean, I don't think I ever heard a line and thought to myself, "Well, that was a stupid/useless line. Why would they put that in there?" In fact, this movie has some of my very favorite quotes. And also, I couldn't stop laughing at everything Sam(Johnny Depp) did! He was just so dang hilarious. Him and Joon seriously make the perfect couple.I suggest that everyone should watch this. I don't think I know one person that didn't like it that I recommended it to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost as tasty as chocolate.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was sifting through the $5 crate of DVDs at Wal-Mart- something that I try to do every time that I visit the entertainment section of the store- seeing if there was anything there that might catch my attention. There was the usual array of old Ashley Judd movies and obscure suspense titles. Then I saw it- Benny and Joon. I quickly scanned the back for the synopsis, figured it might be an OK watch, and tossed it into my basket.I'll admit that one of the main reasons that I got the movie was because of Johnny Depp. He is one of the most versatile among the top actors now, rivaled only by Christian Bale. I had always been curious about his older pre-POTC works, so I saw the movie as a great opportunity to check him out. He was anything but disappointing in this film. It's hard to believe that the same man playing the quiet, eclectically talented and unbelievably cute young comedian outcast Sam is as equally convincing as the drunken, drawling, and flamboyant pirate Jack Sparrow. Yet, it seems that with Johnny just about anything is possible.Of course, we can take nothing away from the other actors and actresses of the film, who played all of their roles terrifically. Mary Stuart Masterson gives an unbelievably believable performance as Juniper (Joon) Pearl. Ruggedly handsome Aidan Quinn is great as the almost-burnt-out, but patient and caring older brother. Julianne Moore and Oliver Platt both played their supporting roles well.What can I say? This movie seems to transcend all clichs with incredible ease. From my movie viewing experience, the leading lady of any romance is either a lovestruck teenage girl or a working class mid-twenties/thirties woman who has been burned too many times and is trying to hide it. The leading man is someone who the director hopes will be perceived as a gorgeous hunk by every female watching the movie, and he either hides his love behind a cold, sarcastic exterior or is a classy, confident flirt.The characters are a big part of turning those stereotypes on their head. Joon Pearl is extremely artistic and intelligent, with a sometimes sharp tongue and an eye for detail, but is forced to depend on her older brother because of her mental illness. Sam, who is also smart and talented in his own peculiar way, was never acknowledged in this by his parents or the cousin that he lived with, and was hampered by his struggle in learning to read and write. Benjamin Pearl (Benny), a car mechanic fitting the resident romance movie "gorgeous hunk" stereotype, struggles with the decision of either abandoning Joon to a group home as both his friends and psychiatrist have advised or continuing to sacrifice his freedom and the chance for a romance of his own for her.The story doesn't seem like one that would make good romantic comedy, and yet the characters fit in perfectly to make it one. The movie is such a paradox, as it almost seems to make fun of and exaggerate the character's particular weaknesses and quirks, yet was still so sensitive, heart-warming and believable. It is also a breath of fresh air from the one-sided view of love that romance movies and romance novels seem to propagating. They nearly always ignore the true, sacrificial love like the kind that Benny shows towards Joon, in being completely patient and undemanding towards her at all times. Joon and Sam are also this way in that they care deeply for each other, despite the fact that each of them has their own unique disabilities. The romantic moments of the movie are not disgustingly fairy-tale like. There is no long flowery dialogue and exaggerated music. Sam and Joon, although more than likely in their early or mid twenties, are completely ignorant when it comes to romance and are almost child-like in their interactions with each other. It was impossible for me not to grin.Undoubtedly, this is one of those movies that will probably be perceived in one of three ways; as a completely silly, utterly unrealistic piece of garbage; as a rare artistic gem; as a movie whose only impact was confusion. My verdict is "rare artistic gem", even though it took a little bit for that to sink in. For, despite the gigantic grin on my face at the end of the movie, I was hovering between considering it silly fluff and just feeling plain confused.One thing of note about the movie though, is that it does deal with everything in a short amount of screen time. Today, the movie would probably be longer and try to delve a little deeper into Joon's unique psyche. Maybe it would have explained how Sam ended up living with his cousin anyway. In the end, though, the fact that the movie was still such an enjoyable ride makes me wonder if we even really need to know.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reading some of the reviews slamming this film makes me want to smack my head against a brick wall or three, so instead of getting frustrated, I've decided to simply fire back in its defense. Here goes nothing...Now, this movie may not be on the same level of grandeur as the Godfather or the Lord of the Rings, but that is precisely why it has such a loyal following in the first place. There is no gratuitous violence, no blatantly erotic love scenes, no overused plot cliches, and the script wasn't constructed from the same four swear words. In a world of cookie-cutter films, filled with over-the-top portrayals of our "reality", it is nice to see a small, light-hearted fantasy erupting in the center of a very familiar, suburban reality instead.The entire story is quite masterful, if considered for a moment. For one, the plot hones in on the bond between Benny and Joon, a brother and sister, and not the latter's romance with Sam, like so many other films would have done.In short, Benny, a struggling auto mechanic, is a bit frustrated, but basically content to care for his mentally disabled sister, until everyone around him starts to plant the idea in his head that she is infringing on his right to a happy, care free life. He starts to believe what they tell him until they meet Sam, who treats Joon like a normal human being instead of a nuisance, causing Benny to realize that while she isn't like everyone else, that isn't necessarily a bad thing. As seen in the "grilled cheese" scene, he begins to understand the way she thinks, and as the movie progresses, she and Sam start to look more sane and intelligent to him than the "normal" people he has surrounded himself with for years.The fact that this scenario, in its most basic form, is so easily related to the average middle class citizen, who works hard to make ends meet and is faced with the constant battle between fulfilling their own desires or sacrificing this to stay loyal to their loved ones, makes the story even more poignant and likable.The aforementioned feat is also carried off by the superb performances turned out in this film. Aidan Quinn, once again, plays the down home, mashed-potatoes-and-gravy, country bumpkin to a tee...though considering his role history, I'm beginning to think that this is the extent of his skills... Mary Stuart Masterson yelled and screamed, but I wasn't exactly buying the fact that she was mentally ill or enjoying her performance much, so I have simply concluded that she was just really temperamental and she was having an off couple of years instead...she gets an A- for effort... As usual, Johnny Depp brought forth another great performance and was nothing short of lovable as Sam, recalling the vaudeville talents of THE slap stick master, Charlie Chaplain. His character's love for Joon is so innocent and entirely unconditional, which makes it all the sweeter for us at home. I know I wanted a mail-order Sam at the end...But what makes the acting really stand out is the adorable, tongue-in-cheek humor that was injected into this script by the screen writers. Everything just seemed to capture that spirit of being a bit left of center and loving it, which, in turn, leaves the viewer feeling refreshed and invincible as the credits roll.This film is a gem in so many ways, and it is truly a pity that so few have taken the time out to appreciate it for what it is: An extremely well-made, feel-good movie, that doesn't have to be over the top to make a statement.</fullReview>

It shows Joon as being mentally ill (she hears voices), but she is smart and well educated. And she is functioning at a higher level than she does because Benny has always sheltered her. It shows Sam as being sane and intelligent, but totally uneducated. Everything he knows he has figured out for himself (ie: making grilled cheese by using an iron). They balance each other. Mary Stewart Masterson did a frighteningly good job of portraying a crazy person. Johnny Depp is the master at conveying emotion and thought thru facial expressions.</fullReview>

Despite scenes with Aidan Quinn, Julianne Moore, Oliver Platt, and Willam H.

		<fullReview>SPOILERS -- There is nothing the writer/director/producer team did before or after that would indicate they were likely to produce such a fine film as "Benny and Joon", so named for the polar opposite brother and sister characters played by Aiden Quinn and Mary Stuart Masterson. But the film is about neither. Instead, it is about the healing power of having someone like Sam (Johnny Depp) come into your life. A secondary theme is a playout of the common concept that to be creative, you have to be quirky (Joon and Sam), while being logical (Benny, the caretaker and mechanic) carries with it the mandate that you also be dull, unimaginative. I forgive this minor failing because the film is so well done.Joon (Juniper) is called "crazy" by Benny when he gets frustrated. But we, the audience, see that Joon is not crazy at all, just mildly emotionally challenged. In fact she is very smart, so much so she loses a hand in poker and "wins" for herself and Benny the care of Sam, who was the cousin of one of the friendly gamblers. She had noticed Sam in the neighborhood, often sitting in a tree, and was obviously intrigued by him. Later, when they met, she said, "You're not in your tree." He replied, "It's not my tree." That's the kind of smart, fitting dialog in this story.While Benny and the social worker are debating whether Joon is too much for Benny, and perhaps should be in an institutional environment, Sam become a positive fixture in her life. She finds her "soul mate." They experiment with kissing. He teaches her how to make grilled cheese sandwiches with the iron on the "wool" setting. He does tricks with his hat. He is an accomplished mime. Sam gets a job at the video store. They fall in love. Benny breaks out of his dullness, finally starts paying attention to the local waitress Ruthie (Julianne Moore). All catalyzed by Sam, who in the final analysis is the most well-adjusted of the bunch.The music is well-chosen, mainly whimsical, with good use of clarinets and oboes. Other actors with smaller but important roles are Oliver Platt, Dan Hedaya, and William H. Macy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Benny &amp; Joon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood has often been accused of trivialising metal illness, but here it really takes the cake. Sam, as portrayed by Johnny Depp, is a certifiable nutcase who nevertheless has memorised routines by the likes of Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin, which he repeats to general acclaim. What he doesn't have though, is any distinguishable character trait other than acting odd and dressing funny... this is not a fully realised individual, but an amalgamation of ideas and quirks some writer put together because they thought it would be cute. Well he is... if you're a brainless teenage girl, who doesn't care about realism and just wants someone to salivate over. The rest of us hopefully will see him as the unimaginative, paper-thin construct he is.As for Joon, she's a mentally unstable girl who is either as sweet as pie or a rampaging loon, depending on what the plot demands of her. She lights fires, smashes up a lot of stuff and talks in incomprehensible riddles. We see she might have been affected by her parent's death at a young age, but would the change be THAT dramatic? Her brother Benny is at his wit's end... she lives with him, and looking after his sister has stopped him from fulfilling any of his ambitions in life. He's about to stick her in a home for the disabled. Then they win Sam in a poker game (don't ask) and everything turns upside down.My major problem here, as you may have guessed, is the inconsistency of the characters. They arrive on screen, establish their personas... and then do or say something so contrary to what we've noticed before, they lose almost all credibility. It's not like they were too complex to begin with, so if the screenwriter can't even keep to within those simple parameters, then he doesn't look too clever. So, while it may be a lot of fun to see Depp emulating scenes from classic silent pictures, the fact remains he and the people around him lack basic credence to the viewer hurts the proceedings. There are genuinely sweet moments, and some hearty laughs to be had. Just not enough to make up for the feeling of disassociation I felt throughout.And if I hear that bloody Proclaimers song one more time... *Grr* 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This one felt good for my heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I should have wrote this review about a month ago when i first saw the movie however i kept just putting it off for no reason. So Johnny Depp is the " man " I'm serious and this film shows his acting skills through dialogue , feelings , emotions and movements. I know its not like his other more popular movies like Pirates of the Caribbean , Edward Scissorhands and others but this one has a special place. This movie is all about loving each other and taking care of another person like Benny was trying to do for joon - I was trying to figure were his mind was at for majority of the film and I'm glad of the outcome because you could tell what his feelings toward Sam were overtime of the film. Joon was very interesting herself - mentally ill yet so artistic seems only right her and a guy like BuStEr kEaToN ( Sam ) would have a connection. I also really liked the scene of them trusting each other and feeling comfortable enough to make real love with one another . In my opinion it was great not seeing private parts it was not needed for the movie , If they would have shown skin it would have seemed to romantic or to open or to pushy or trying to hard for that scene.Its so obvious that Depp did a great job as this quirky / silly / warm hearted / caring / unique character. Benny &amp; Joon's actors also give a good performance I'm not sure how well Aiden and MsM ( Mary s masterson ) would / have done in other movies but in this one they do well and even better when in scenes with Depp. Also I loved the song " 500 miles" they used in the beginning and ending which matched perfectly and had the song in my head all night ! This movie has an amazing three characters and actors -1= some what plays the straight man Benny who changes - 2 = mentally ill yet creative Joon and 3 = wonderful and different one of a kind Sam a guy like buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin ,soundtrack great and overall a happy movie with tons of laughs till the last scene. My family ( even my mom who dislikes a lot of movies loved this one) - especially the ending of this quirky / cute / comedy movie. I recommend this movie go watch it !!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Johnny Depp Classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During my Johnny Depp film binge I discovered Benny and Joon, a charming little piece that left me tingling with optimism and warmth long after the credits rolled. Johnny Depp again transfigures himself into another quirky yet endearing character: a dyslexic young man who channels his shyness through his jaw-dropping imitations of Buster Keaton, and finds his soul mate in Joon, a girl who suffers from a mental illness, maybe schizophrenia. She cannot get along with anyone besides her protective brother Benny, as she is prone to panic attacks at the slightest provocation, which includes the former housekeeper having smelly hair. But throughout the film, we see, as Depp's Sam sees, that despite her mental illness she is a strong-willed, bright, and beautiful individual who may be more independent than her brother presumes. Not that Benny is an overbearing hover-copter; we see how concerned he is for her happiness and well-being, sacrificing his freedom and romantic pursuits to give her the best care possible. You can't help admiring him (his good looks and steadfast love for his sister) and wishing he were your older brother. All three characters are marvelously portrayed, and the plot, though somewhat predictable and cheesy, ends in such a hilarious and sweet note that it makes the whole movie experience delightful. Not too melodramatic, but not the typical Hollywood fluff either, this rom com will leave you contented, with just a tad squeeze in your heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>flawed movie about a difficult subject</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not surprising that so many people who identify themselves as having mental challenges love this movie. It's nice to think that an older brother would drop his life to take care of you, no matter what your behavior is, and then his attention would be supplemented and supplanted by a quirky love interest like Johnny Depp. I want to see the film five years later after Joon has burned down their second house or apartment. The line I felt was most authentic in the film was Depp's character asking Quinn's character?"just how involved is she?" Meaning, what are the real parameters of her behavior? Is she really just quirky the way she was portrayed on film or are there going to be points when Sam is going to be too overwhelmed to properly care for Joon. How much of a real danger could Joon be for herself and anyone who takes care of her for an extended time? It is a cute fairy tale and for those of you who want to think that other people will come out of the woodwork to take care of you because you deserve to be taken care of?well, this is a fairy tale. Joon can't compromise. As long as Depp's character doesn't actually need Joon to be supportive of him or have understanding for him the relationship will be fine. (supportive isn't just making doe eyes at someone, its being able to put off personal pleasure to benefit someone else. Sam can do that for Joon, Benny can do that for Joon but can Joon do that for anyone else?) During the course of the movie it is made clear that Sam is used to not being listened to by other people. I have nothing but sympathy and praise for the Benny's of the world who step up and take care of a love one who is mentally challenged. I'm aware of mentally challenged couples who make a go at being married and having families, but I wonder how many social services they need in order to function? The machinery that some commenter's here are so negative toward is the only safety net that many mentally challenged clients have. A certain number of families do give over care of their loved ones to the state and then complain if that care is not up to their imaginary high standards. Bring them back into your home and don't suffer them to be taken care of by paid strangers, then.And Depps' character does make clear in the film that the routines he is doing were authored by Chaplin and Keaton. He responds to Aidens' character that he can't make money off the routines because he didn't create them. This wasn't a bad movie, this was a flawed film that serves a need for people who want this particular fairy tale but it does a disservice to the caregivers of mentally challenged persons.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You need me to be sick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know that I have commented on Johnny Depp's versatility from Pirates to Sweeney Todd to Before Night falls, but I had my breath taken away from his role in this film.He was a sort of free spirit that came into the life of schizophrenic Joon (Mary Stuart Masterson), and transformed her with love.Until he arrived, her brother Benny (Aidan Quinn) ran her life for her. It is not meant to be completely critical, as there are many who run the lives of the mentally ill and developmentally disabled out of love and a misunderstanding that everyone is capable to run their own lives to some degree. After all, he gave up his own chance at freedom and love to care for his sister.But, Sam (Depp) showed him that he can grow and let loose and allow Joon to live her own life.It was a funny, tender, and very sweet film, with Depp just blowing me away.It also featured many other great stars as support.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my all-time favorite movies. Three excellent, poignant, intelligent performances by three talented performers. A sweet storyline that sings of both childlike innocence and mature love... A man weighing obligation and family duty over love and desire... And Johnny Depp making mashed potatoes with a tennis racket and grilled cheese with an iron.This movie will make you laugh, make you cry, make you think...and leave you with a peaceful, warm feeling as only a truly thoughtful and well-written romantic comedy can deliver.From the interesting music to the goofy antics of Johnny Depp's bizarre character Sam, the movie captivates the audience and holds them entranced in the simple, small little world of these multi-faceted characters.Watch this movie A.S.A.P. It's definitely worth your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Writing with left then right hand has meaning, not a mistake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam is dyslexic. He could also be a natural left-hander who was told as a young child to write right-handed.In any case, his writing is like a child's. He does it slowly, uncertainly, and like some children hasn't even figured out which hand to use. When I saw him write with one hand and then the other it made total sense to me and helped to portray his struggles. (Plus, Depp is an excellent actor who puts a huge amount of thought into every nuance of his character. He wouldn't just write randomly without thinking about why he is switching hands.)I totally love this movie. Sam is so sweet, a pure and noble soul. I love his compassion and his simple acceptance of people. There is a quiet spiritual feeling to this movie that stays with you for a long time.The theme song "500 Miles" is wonderful and an appropriate expression of the love, determination and devotion of the story. Johnny Depp did an amazing job of studying Buster Keaton and learning many of his comedic techniques. I think Depp is the most versatile actor anywhere.I also always enjoy Aidan Quinn. He's sexy and down to earth.</fullReview>

Does anyone know if that is true? If it is, I'd like to see it and wonder if anyone can tell me how to get my hands on a copy without buying it. I have checked a local video rental store and also our local library, which loans films. No one seems to be able to help me find it. The person who told me that the scene is from "The Kid" did not seem to be really sure if that was the correct movie. Can anyone help me figure this out? Thanks.</fullReview>

Benny is an eccentric man, misunderstood by many, funny, and playing his way through life. When the two have a chance encounter, they become intrigued by the other. Benny makes June laugh, and together the two teach each other about life. All the odds are against them and June's brother tries to stop their relationship. Sometimes love cannot be stopped and they overcome all the obstacles around them. A tear jerker, will make one laugh and cry.

		<fullReview>This movie is a touching and heartwarming display or the affection shown between two people who are considered outcasts by society. Sam who is considered "stupid" and "wierd" because of his choice not to talk when it is not necessary and his inability to read or write is actually a funny and sensitive man who's love of movies and his eagerness to learn leads to a deep connection between him and Joon a mentally ill woman who, because of her illness(which is actually mild) has lead a sheltered life of routine and painting.... but when the two fall in love will that love be allowed to endure... or will Joon's over protective older brother, Benny, severe all connections between these two young lovers and prevent them form living their lives as they see fit.i really really enjoyed this movie, i first saw it ,after a break up with my ex boyfriend, when my friends came over in an attempt to cheer me up using Johnny Depp as a lure... i must admit that their descriptions of how adorably cute he is in this movie were totally accurate his pro trail of Sam as a misunderstood intelligent and charming young man where undoubtedly one of the best performance i have ever seen... and Aiden Quinns performance was also a spectacular one he displayed Benny's wistful dreams of being able to go out and have fun instead of "letting his life pass him by", but he also loves his sister very much and feels he cannot leave her in an institution is one which touched my heart ... this is definitely a movie that is good for giving out warm fuzzy feelings and one that i would highly recommend!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is one of my all-time favorites. A "must" for any weird person like me who is looking for something he could relate to. Johnny Depp never struck me as a 'stunning' actor. Then I saw 'Benny &amp; Joon'. That reversed my opinion: he is definitely my favorite actor (I also recommend "Finding Neverland" and "What's Eating Gilbert Grape", among others). The music also gets a 'thumbs up', with tunes like John Hiatt's "Have A Little Faith In Me" and The Proclaimers' "I'm Gonna Be", which became a pop hit after being featured in this film. If anyone told you that it was a 'chick-flick', they're wrong (I've never been a chick-flick fan myself). Sure, it's not "Movies For Guys Who Like Movies" material, but it is definitely one of the truly essential movies of its decade.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warm hearted fun, Depp is superb.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Benny and Joon is a charming romantic fairy tale about two of societies' outcasts that fall in love.Joon (Mary Elizabeth Masterson) is a talented artist who suffers from a mental illness which makes her prone to mood swings and outbursts of anger. It is her older brother Benny's (Aidan Quinn) job to look after her, which means his social life is often on hold and his love life is non existent. That is until Joon wins Sam (Johnny Depp) in a poker game, a fellow misfit who also does not fit in with societies expectations of how to behave. He is then taken on as a housekeeper by Benny who warns him about Joons unpredictable behaviour. However Sam's novel approach to housework and his delight at the world around him soon allows him to connect with Joon on a deeper level than her brother can understand; but time is running out as Joon's doctor strongly recommends that she be placed in a home, which Benny gradually begins to accept as his desire to live his own life, and his inability to deal with Joon, increases. The cast is excellent, with superb performances from all involved, including powerhouse support from Julianne Moore, Oliver Platt and William H Macey; but it is Depps mix of childlike wonder and joy of living that engages us so thoroughly. His antics beautifully encapsulate the magic and charm of Chaplin and Keaton, combined with Depps own skill at adding a hidden depth and soul to whatever character he plays. The film does have its flaws. Perhaps Sams' eccentricities, such as his passion for old movies, his Chaplinesque routines and his novel way of ironing toasted cheese sandwiches, replace any depth to the character, and perhaps the film trivialises mental illness. However it is not trying to make any serious point or statement other than that to deal with life it is often our insanity that keeps us sane, and one of the best things in life is the chance to fall in love, and be loved in return. A thoroughly enchanting film that will make you want to be spontaneously romantic and appreciate all the little oddities and endearing quirks in yourself and your loved one. In this messed up world we are all a little mad, and the best we can hope for is to find someone as crazy as ourselves and cling on to them forever. Besides, any film that starts and ends with the Proclaimers Celtic tones is all right with me.</fullReview>

Great movie, funny entertaining, great to watch as a pick me up from daily activities. Masterson greatly portrays a woman battling mental illness. The acting is true and believable. The movie reminds us that others are capable of so much more then we generally allow them. It allows us to take a look at how the other side feels and reminds us not only to love those around us, but to believe in all that they are capable of.

		<shortDescription>A Movie Worth Owning!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Benny and Joon first came out when my daughter was eight years old and she immediately fell in love with Johnny Depp. Now she is 19, and still watches it every few months or so. The first time I saw it, I thought it was cute but paid little attention beyond that. Over the years this story has grown on me until now I appreciate it almost as much as my daughter does. I think it is well worth owning.The plot is multifaceted, but my favorite aspect is the ability of two people to recognize qualities in each other that no one else can see. They bring out the best in each other because they have complete faith in each other. The beautiful John Hiatt song, "Have A Little Faith In Me" is a perfect expression of the sweet relationship between Sam and Joon.I also think it is interesting that even though Joon is supposed to be the one who is mentally ill, Benny actually uses her as a crutch and an excuse not to face life. In the scene where Joon tells him, "You need me to be sick", she shows insight that few of the "sane" characters display. It made me do some thinking about what it really means to be insane. In the end, they both are healthier when Benny learns to allow Joon to take responsibility for herself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok, first of all, if you don`t like romantic comedies, you won`t like Benny and Joon. This isn`t the type of movie you`d see with your boyfriend because it isn`t an action movie. Personally, Benny &amp; Joon is my favourite Johnny Depp movie(Pirates of the Caribbean is my second). He`s wonderful as Sam...even when he`s not talking you can tell what he`s feeling and thinking through his actions. He`s adorable!!! The movie is about a mentally ill woman named Joon who lives with her overprotective brother, Benny. One night Joon decides to play poker with a couple of Benny`s friends (without Benny around). One guy bets his cousin (Sam, Johnny`s character) because he can`t stand him and Joon loses and is obligated to bring Sam home. They end up falling in love and the rest is history. It`s such a cute story and is not slow at all, I couldn`t keep my eyes off of the screen! Mary Stuart Masterson and Aidan Quinn do an incredible job but once again, Johnny Depp steals the show...I can not state enough how incredible he is. So if you like romantic comedies you`ll absolutely adore this one. And Johnny just makes it even better. My favourite part is the bun dance, the grilled cheese sandwiches, the mashed potatoes and `swinging by the window`. See the movie and you`ll understand. I give it 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting idea and many interesting parts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The idea of BENNY &amp; JOON is pretty good. Adult brother (Aiden Quinn) and sister (Mary Stuart Masterson) live together because the sister is mentally unstable and he needs to look after her. However, over time, it's obvious he can't control her and they both need space to grow--but Benny cannot bring himself to admit this. Being so inextricably intertwined isn't good for either of them. Into this less than idea situation appears the rather child-like and bizarre character played by Johnny Depp. This oddball is a bit like Chaplin and Keaton combined and it's obvious he's addicted to these silent comedies, as Depp nicely recreates the dance with the diner rolls Chaplin did in THE GOLD RUSH.Overall, the biggest plus was Depp's strange but endearing performance. This, combined with the basic plot idea do make the film worth seeing. Unfortunately, two elements really distracted as well. First, exactly what sort of mental illness Joon has is rather vague and strange. In some ways she seems to have a combination of schizophrenia and an intermittent explosive disorder---but at other times she seems reasonably normal. Secondly, and this REAALLY irritated me, is that at least three times during the film they had long musical montages that seemed more like music videos than part of a film and they really came out of nowhere--looking more like padding than anything else or perhaps the film was being deliberately marketed solely towards teens.Still, it's an agreeable little film--just don't expect a lot of magic.</fullReview>

One day through a game of poker they get an addition to their household, an extraordinary personality Buster Keaton imitating Sam.The movie gets scores from me for being more extraordinary than movies usually are, but I can't say that I loved it...For once, people seem to love Johnny Depp as Sam. I must be one of a few but he seemed very irritating to me. Johnny with his eyes bugging out and half open mouth was annoying me way too much. I actually think he was the worst part in the movie.Another thing is that it is not funny. Really, not at all. I maybe laughed once or twice watching it, so when people say it is hilarious I really don't know what they mean.And finally, they failed in the mental issue department. Mental illnesses are all different. and having one doesn't mean one is dysfunctional and incapable to have a relationship, this is what the movie tries to show us and it is a great message. But the thing is with Joon I have trouble noticing that she is one of those who can live without their brother or doctor looking after them. Her normal moments are shown but more than that she seems always to have her issues and those are not small things but setting things on fire and having a huge meltdown that Sam is incapable to control. So to me he seemed like a creep taking advantage of a vulnerable person more than anything.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Benny &amp; Joon is a romantic comedy film about how two eccentric individuals, Sam and Juniper,also known as "Joon",who find each other and fall in love.It stars Johnny Depp,Mary Stuart Masterson,Aidan Quinn together with William H. Macy,Julianne Moore and Oliver Platt.It was written by Barry Berman and Lesley McNeil; and it was directed by Jeremiah S. Chechik.Benny runs a small car repair shop. He must also take care of his mentally ill sister Juniper, better known as Joon. After losing a bet, Benny is forced to bring another eccentric into his house.His name is Sam, the cousin of a friend. Not inclined to conversation, Sam expresses himself by performing Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton routines.Not surprisingly, he immediately hits it off with Joon. As Sam and Joon fall deeper in love, Benny for the first time in life experiences the pangs of jealousy.Good acting,funny plot and great characters.Although there are some problems in the script and directing,the performances of the cast overshadowed them particularly Johnny Depp,who did extremely well as a physical comedian.His portrayal of Sam is delicately touching, a maladjusted waif with both soul and grit.Watch this for his performance alone.Added to that,Mary Stuart Masterson resists the temptation to soften Joon. That in itself made this movie compelling and worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Benny and Joon Would Reach the Moon ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The part for Johnny Depp was tailor-made. As a Buster Keaton look-alike and showing amazing talents, Depp would go on to a career with strong performances as way-out characters. This film is no exception.A very challenged mentally ill woman finds love with the Depp character. Her protective brother can't see it until he realizes that he also has a life to live-in this case with Julianne Moore.The film proves that mentally challenged people can find happiness under certain circumstances. If possible, they must be given the freedom to pursue this.Moore is excellent in the role as the mentally challenged woman. Her total breakdown on the bus was a scene of rare quality.As the brother, Aidan Quinn is totally sympathetic in the part.There are certainly comical breaks in this challenging film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something for Everyone!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Summary:It's the 1990's. The music is freakin' amazing. We've got a painter (Joon), a car repairer (Benny), &amp; a fun eccentric played by none other than Johnny Depp (Sam) who are thrown together all mixed up sideways &amp; topsy-turvy like &amp; voila! Movie magic.Review:With lots of tasty ingredients: drama, romance, comedy, quirky charm, not to mention Johnny Depp (who cleans, swings, and is all-out brilliant) and Aidan Quinn (so, so good), what's not to love?Sam is a fabulously great character that brings life to the film and to Benny &amp; Joon. Depp's performance is pitch-perfect, especially how he channels Chaplin/Keaton with ease. If you like either of those two slapstick goofballs, you'll get a kick outta this.Definitely one to add to your netflix cue (or local library for us cheapskates).8/10</fullReview>

A mentally ill girl joon and her brother benny's lives take a turn when sam comes into their lives,, under very queer circumstances..... Joon falls in love with sam who does quirky things and has a knack of messing up situations... and as the story unveils through various events,we get to know all the characters better and in a way connect with them..Johnny Depp is awesome as usual,, the innocence and dedication with which he carries the character of sam is exemplary....Mary is completely believable as Joon... so if u need a refreshing cute story, go for this one</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not exactly what I was expecting C3</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A brother tries to look after his mentally challenged sister and when they win a friend's cousin in a poker game, a relationship occurs between the sister and the cousin. After this, the movie really goes downhill. Johnny Depp's character is really outgoing, but Aidan Quinn (the brother) kind of gets in the way of the pair. If she was being looked after, doesn't matter who it was looking after her, you should be happy about that. Also, I really didn't see much of a problem with Joon, except that she screamed when things didn't go right; hey, don't we all?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Innocent and odd romantic comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Innocent romantic comedy that's at least mildly entertaining for the most part, but it probably helps if you like Johnny Depp, which I do. It's a bit odd and contains a large bucket from the fairytale trough, but better than a lot of other movies that have attempted to be wholesome, romantic and entertaining. Not for those that like their movies hard edged, but then again why would they be watching this in the first place? Probably a good date movie for teens/young adults. If I don't hear that damn Proclaimers song again for a thousand years, though, it'll still be too soon. How 'bout walking five hundred miles in another direction, eh mate?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Benny &amp; Joon (spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Benny &amp; Joon was a very unique, whimsical film. I have never seen Johnny Depp play a role like this, but he did an excellent job playing Sam. Besides him being extremely hot ;), I found his character very amusing/entertaining. Both the scene in the park, and the scene in the diner with the bread roles, was hilarious. He did a great job portraying a Buster Keaton "maniac". I think Johnny Depp is one of the most talented actors I've ever seen; the characters he plays are very eclectic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>whimsical and painful by turns -- SPOILERS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's an odd love story; it's unusual to find one in which a mentally-ill person really does fall in love. Quinn and Moore seemed bland compared to Depp and Masterson. Masterson shone out in parts, but it was Depp who entirely stole the show. I love how I couldn't make up my mind about him--was he crazy too? Or just suffering from dyslexia? Or very intelligent but masking it? Or a naive buffoon who happened to wander into the right kitchen? Or maybe all of the above? Completely loved the idea of making grilled cheese sandwiches with an iron (it makes perfect sense, and I loved the ensuing discussion), Buster Keaton reincarnated in the park, "Mommy?", and making mashed potatoes, all of which was entirely sold by Depp's performance. A bit strange, but then, that's the movie's appeal. I'd definitely recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies of today</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a classic movie fanatic. I find it hard to appreciate post-mid-sixties films very much, because against the lush backdrop of hundreds of old films with depth and meaning and class, the modern films look like rhinestones among the diamonds. Benny and Joon is an exception. Along with "Somewhere in Time", I have actually watched this movie more than once and really like it. One definite plus is the fact that the four-letter words are down to a very bare minimum - I hate hearing people talk like that, and here it only happens once that I recall. (Not that it needed to happen at all, but anyway). Also the love scene is not graphic - it only shows them kissing. I really like Johnny Depp's character being so devoted to Joon - he really loved her. See this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good for a Hollywood film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would say this film was pretty much a clich. Two strange people fall in love in this mainstream society. But there were some interesting aspects: for example, there was not too many mushy-mushy moments of verbally expressing love (I really can't stand that in films!); also, the actors were believable and did not over do it. But overall, the film didn't give any insight on new ideas and just focused on a standard topic of "forbidden love", and was pretty much predictable all the way till the end just like all Hollywood films. As a Johnny Depp fan, I don't regret watching it, but it is not a movie I would recommend to anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny romantic comedy...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1st watched 8/15/2007, 7 out of 10(Dir-Jeremiah Chechik): Funny romantic comedy with the king of these type of movies, Johnny Depp, playing a lovable soft-spoken natural mime who encounters a mentally ill young lady named Joon, played by Mary Stuart Masterson, who goes thru everyday pretty much the same until he comes along. Aidan Quinn plays Benny, Joon's brother, who is over-protective and feels responsible for her after their parents' apparent death in a fire. Benny is getting to the point where he's not able to handle Joon alone and carry out a normal life, then Depp's character comes along and things appear to get better. But when Benny finds out that there is romance between Joon and Depp's character, he isn't a happy man. The rest of the movie focuses on how Benny is able to relinquish his control over his sister and let her explore her own life despite her inefficiencies. Despite it's serious sounding storyline, this is a very light-hearted piece of entertainment and that's why I think I liked it so much. It doesn't try to solve anyone's problems it just shows us how to deal with them positively. This is not just for Depp fans but also for those who like lighthearted cinema with a little twisted characterization thrown in for good measure.</fullReview>

Benny makes June laugh, and together the two teach each other about life. All the odds are against them and June's brother tries to stop their relationship. Sometimes love cannot be stopped and they overcome all the obstacles around them. A tear jerker, will make one laugh and cry.

		<fullReview>This flick is an unusual one... What I mean is that for a romantic comedy its different. Its not the usual foray into boy meets gal and they get it together through all the struggles. Its a story of a brother called Benny and a sister called Joon. Benny leads a mundane life much of which is spent looking after his mentally ill sister Joon. Along comes Sam who makes changes to both their lives in a way which opens their eyes to the world. Its an original flick with a great cast, although all are overshadowed by Johhny Depp as Sam. The Buster Keaton 'wanna-be' who carries not only the heart of the film but also gets the laughs! Its a brilliant film which starts slowly but as soon as you connect with the main characters you become hooked. Its not a laugh a minute but then nor is life...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this movie. I watched it because of a growing interest with Johnny Depp, but found all the principal characters to be very good in their roles. Here was a cute movie about relationships that managed to tell the story without a lot of foul language and gratuitous sex (although the implied sexual relations was totally unnecessary to the storyline). I would have liked some background on the Depp character to explain why he is the way he is. It was never clear to me whether he also had mental health issues similar to Joon character. But this is a minor complaint; all in all, I liked the movie and hope to see more like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Daft but heart warming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Benny cares for his sister Joon who is emotional unstable and very artistic minded. At a friendly poker game he loses a bet to look after a friends sibling who turns out to be Sam ? a young man who expresses himself through the routines of Chaplin and Keaton. Joon and Sam begin to fall for each other but Benny refuses ? will love prevail across logic?Romantic comedies are always light meaningless things by a rule. However Johnny Depp films are usually more than that. And that's the case here, even if it has some real flaws. The plot challenged me because I didn't think two unstable people should be together at all and I felt for Benny who was stuck in the middle of these two. However it still manages to be sweet and quite heart warming -?even if it is silly and not really logical.Depp is not as good as he usually is and I didn't feel he suited this role, however he did do a good Chaplin impression. Masterson used to be one of my favourite actresses and she's good here. Quinn is the strongest simply because he is the straightman and holds the plot together through all the eccentricities. The quality of the rest is assured as it contains Platt, Hedaya and Macy ? who else do you need ? even if they're underused.Overall it's a bit daffy but it still manages to be sweet and quite enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A story about two siblings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the heart of 'Benny &amp; Joon' is the story of Joon, a mentally ill young woman, and her older brother Benny, who takes constant care of her and, while complaining about how much that complicates his life, actually uses the obligation as an excuse for the fact that his own life is going nowhere. It's a story that's simple, realistic and painfully honest. It could have made for a touching little drama if only Chechik made a clean decision that that's what the film is about.Unfortunately, 'Benny &amp; Joon's biggest asset is also its undoing, and that is the wonderful and charismatic performance of young Johnny Depp. Depp enters the scene almost halfway through as Joon's love interest, the mentally unbalanced but extremely charming Sam who chooses to model his personality (or lack thereof) on silent comedy stars Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton. Sam swoops Joon off her feet and disrupts the delicate balance of the siblings' relationship, which forces Benny to face up and decide whether he can let Joon go or not. Depp is terrific in his role; in one extended scene where he showcases his slapstick abilities he proves just how much of a screen personality he was and why he became one of the most bankable movie stars of the 90's. The problem is that he's so charismatic that he can easily fool the audience (and often does) that Sam is a romantic hero rather than a disruptive, chaotic presence; that this is the love story of Joon and Sam, rather than the story of Benny and his coming to terms with his own life decisions. What's worse, Depp's charisma emphasizes just how pale and unimpressive Aidan Quinn is in the role that should have been the lead.It's not a bad film; it's a pretty and touching little drama, wonderfully scripted. On the other hand, Depp's scenes are a pleasure to behold. But the contrast between the two is what ultimately makes it a failure. It doesn't help that Chechik can't quite make up his mind about how seriously he's taking Joon's mental illness, which is played for laughs a bit too often.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't expecting too much from this but it turned out to be a lot more heart warming and touching of a movie then I would've thought. The story is about a girl with a mental illness, her protective brother and a slightly child like man-child who is talented in a Buster Keaton kind of way. This is a role unlike anything else you've seen Johnny Depp in. Mary Stuart Masterson has a very well layered role and Aidan Quinn plays her protective older brother. Julianne Moore in one of her first roles plays a waitress at the local diner who's a failed actress who's come home from an attempt in Los Angeles that didn't go as well as she had hoped.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another vapid "chick flick" - except for Johnny Depp.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A perfect, almost stereotypical example of a "chick flick", this film would be a great movie for a second or third date - a chance for a guy to show how sensitive he is, while inside being bored out of his mind unless he's finding plot holes big enough to drive a truck through. Once again, Aidan Quinn enhances his reputation as a "woman's actor" by appearing in yet another film that no man would voluntarily see. Mary Stuart Masterson is forgettable as the mentally ill sister, as is Julianne Moore as the love interest for Quinn.The movie's only saving grace (and indeed the reason I watched it) is Johnny Depp. His performance steals the show, which makes one wonder why they titled the movie "Benny and Joon" since he plays neither of those characters. His natural charm and easy grace shine through brilliantly, as does his remarkable ability to play both dramatic and comic scenes with equal ability. Even this early in his career, it must have been obvious that he was destined for bigger and better things. I found myself looking for his unique characteristics that would come to full bloom in such films as Pirates of the Caribbean. Depp seldom disappoints, and he certainly does not here. But the movie itself will be dismissed as pointless by most guys - including myself.Make it worthwhile - Watch it with a girl, or not at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film like this could have made a great drama but instead the screenwriters made it into a comedy. The very subject matter is not supposed to be comedy material. Aidan Quinn portrays Benny, the overprotective older brother of Joon (Mary Stuart Masterson), a woman who suffers from a mental illness and has a habit of wandering around and unknowingly being a nuisance. Johnny Depp unnecessarily costars as Sam, a silent screen comedy loving drifter who attempts to disrupt the peaceful family balance between the siblings. Implausible and occasionally offensive.

As for the story, two crazy mixed up kids find each other and love. Oh yeah, one happens to be suffering from mental illness and has a overly-protective brother. Sounds like a sure-fire winner to me. We can also thank this film for foisting Julianne Moore onto the critical radar (unfortunately). At least she didn't take her clothes off in this one.
