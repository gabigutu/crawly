		<shortDescription>Not just for teens, this is...well...awesome...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I understand why teenage girls would like this movie--the thrilling rush of new found deep friendship tied together with nascent sexuality and all that comes with it...the defying of the confines of the world around them...the incredible power of unfettered creativity and self-delusional belief...What's amazing is that a jaded thirty-something man like myself would consider it to be his favorite film of all time. Peter Jackson shows a deftness in handling interpersonal characterizations and blending in amazing special effects in a way that seems so natural...so fluid...that you while you're awed by what you see, you're not so aware of the process that you're distracted. The oh-so-1993 effect of "morphing" is used better here than any other film (save, perhaps, Terminator 2--but in that movie, the morphing WAS the film...when here, it is merely one element.)The direction is exemplary. The cinematography is awe inspiring. The script is sharp. The acting...down the line...is superb. Melanie Lynskey delivers a brave performance--giddy, childish, frightening, sexual, clouded... She's everything Christina Ricci pretends to be. Kate Winslet--hyper-bright and wonderful...her performance here reminds you that her "Titanic" performance was "sunk" (sorry!) by the extremely poor dialogue she was given. Her character's overly cheerful demeanor is a mask that covers her disappointment in her parents--but it's extended so far that it no longer seems like a mask...it seems to be a force of nature that drags Lynskey's Pauline along for a dangerous ride...a ride that Winslet's Juliet is in no position to control. There are crisp performances from all of the supporting cast as well.Jackson should be listed with Gilliam and even Lynch when it comes to directors who can achieve a glorious, if dark, vision. The fact that Jackson's movies (save for "Meet the Feebles") are mainstream accessible--in ways that Lynch, especially, could barely consider (although "The Frighteners" was painfully overlooked by the US market)--makes me wish that he'd try his hand at more mainstream material.Imagine what a Peter Jackson "Titanic" would have been like...and compare that to what a James Cameron "Heavenly Creatures" would have been like and you get my point. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disturbing story told with imagination and confidence by a talented director and lead actresses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Juliet Hulme moves from England to New Zealand with her parents, she meets Pauline Rieper ? a rather disaffected girl who is happy to have a friend. As they get to know each other, Pauline is pulled into the fantasy world of Royals and scandal that Juliet has written. However as the two fall deeper and deeper into the characters they have created, their relationship becomes ever more intense and their parents step in to separate them. Facing a geographical separation, the two plot to take revenge on the adults who seek to split them up.At the time of release I remember thinking that this was an unusual film for Peter Jackson to have made given that he was more of a gore merchant as I was aware. Watching it not it still feels like a strange film for him to have done, but now it is for different reasons ? that is, that he has made one of the biggest trilogies of all time? etc! Ignoring his previous and later works, this is a great little film and it acts as a showcase for Jackson as it shows he can be imaginative and also sensitive when required ? certainly coming to this on the back of Bad Taste, I had low expectations on how he would do it but he did it. The true story is adapted from Pauline's diaries and, while it must be impossible to see how they saw the world, the fantastic fantasy worlds we see here are better than the probably quite repressed world they had in mind ? from this film I saw the two as being more insular and self defensive than the elaborate fantasy scenes would suggest. The film did well to depict their relationship, immediately having worrying signs but being the sort of thing kids do ? and the killing hinted at by the film's opening is brutal and unpleasant ? we are never allowed to side with these people.The direction is great, creating normal domestic scenes with the same confidence as it uses full size plastic models within the fantasy sequences.The cast also do well, in particular two great lead performances. Naturally Winslet gets all the kudos for her character is ott at times and spins wildly emotionally ? a hard role to carry off but she does it very well and showed great promise (even if she looks too old for the role in my opinion). Lynskey impressed me much more as her role was more controlled and was delivered a lot better by an actress who looked like a shy, embarrassed little girl. Both were great for different reasons and they are a big reason this film works so well. Support from the likes of O'Connor, Kent and a few other well known faces are also good but there is never a question about their role within the film ? they are supporting the main two.Overall I imagine this film will get a audience boost now as lots of LOTR fans go trawling through Jackson's back catalogue to see what else he has done (boy are they in for a surprise!) and I'm glad more people will see it.The direction is great and it delivers a complex story in a colourful and fanciful manner, but the main praise should go to the two lead actresses who deal with really difficult characters and do so in a confident and believable manner ? even if the material means that many of us will want to find what they did abhorrent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Beautiful Haunting Story Of Teenage Obsession</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lesbian murderers ? I'm sort of guessing that I might not like this movie very much . No doubt we'll be seeing some polemical do gooder film maker with zero talent making a movie where anyone who gets murdered by the gay girls probably asked for it because they were a rabid homophobeThat was my abstract opinion of HEAVENLY CREATURES when it was released to some critical acclaim ten years ago , with much of the acclaim going to writer/director Peter Jackson whose previous gory horror comedies I'd enjoyed . Yeah the guy was talented I remember thinking , but in a liberal climate we'd no doubt be hearing a myriad of excuses via the film for the girls crime and it was this attitude that stopped me from watching the movie until it was broadcast on BBC 2 tonight I was fooling myself if I thought Jackson was going to make a bad movie . This is another piece of heart melting , intelligent movie making from the Kiwi genius and I'm sorry for doubting Jackson for a moment . What Jackson has done has made a movie where it's difficult to think of the two protagonists as " lesbian lovers " , Pauline Reiper and Juliet Hulme are two teenagers who love each other full stop and the screenplay doesn't once make any excuses for anything that happens , we're not supposed to feel disgusted by their relationship , we're not supposed to feel that they are victims in any way and we're not supposed to feel that a conservative , homophobic society is to blame for what happened . Jackson deserves much credit for making an amoral movie without an agenda , it's up to the free thinking audience to make up their own minds on the case. Take for example the murder of Mrs Rieper who kindly takes the girls to a tea house then for a walk in the countryside . It's difficult not to notice that if she'd been an uncaring cruel dragon with absolutely no conscience the girls wouldn't have had an opportunity to murder the woman .It's also a movie that captures the spirit of being a teenager in love . When for whatever reason you have to say goodbye to your first love it's the end of the world . You'll do anything to stop it happening - ANYTHING - and you won't forgive anyone who caused it to happen . Fantasy sequences similar to the ones shown here are also a staple diet of the teenage mind and if you disagree with me you're either being dishonest or you're under twelve years of age . Believe me this movie reminded me , perhaps a little too much , of my own teenage angst Jackson also deserves credit for his casting Melanie Lynskey and ( A then totally unknown ) Kate Winslet as Pauline and Juliet . Neither of them can be described as strikingly attractive and you do have to worry who we would have got instead if this was a Hollywood production , but they play the star crossed lovers with absolute conviction , as indeed do the rest of the castHEAVENLY CREATURES is beautiful , haunting , thoughtful and incisive . With the exception of Martin Scorsese I rate Peter Jackson as the world's greatest living film maker and HEAVENLY CREATURES is the first movie that showed the true greatness Jackson is capable of</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderfully imaginative and well done film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Heavenly Creatures' is not your average film; it's done with a technique that is not common in the business, and therefore has been both criticised and praised. The technique is used by not just filming a story and it's actions, but by actually showing the side of the girls' vivid imaginations. This was done through the elaborate sequences of the girls' fantasies. This way of filming shows how the pair justified the crime they commit, a vital part of the story. The plot itself does not trail far from the true story, except for the fact of inferred lesbianism between the two girls. (Something the real-life Juliet Hulme has vehemently denied) So it's anyone's guess as to whether or not which possibility is the truth.Visually, this movie is stunning. The landscape of Christchurch and the surrounding area is beautiful, and adds a sense of authenticity to the film. The voice overs are extracts from the real Pauline's diary, and explain very well what exactly is going on inside of her head. All in all, a very good portrayal by all of the actors (obviously on the part of Melanie Lynskey and Kate Winslet) and the music is exquisite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shocking ... Riveting ... Unforgettable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Heavenly Creatures, based on a true story, is written, directed and produced by Peter Jackson of Lord of the Rings fame. This film captivates, catching you off guard.Jackson sets the audience up in the beginning by focusing on the tranquil, predictable world of 1950s Christchurch, New Zealand. Before long, the peaceful world is exposed for what it is, repressed. Two teenage girls, Juliet and Pauline, befriend each other at a private girl's school. They find out they have a lot in common. Sharing a world of fantasy and make believe, leads to an insane reversal. Their fantasy world becomes their reality.Once they cross that line, their otherwise superficial, conventional world is turned upside down. All the repressed dysfunction surfaces. Ironically, Juliet's mother is a psychotherapist who doesn't see her daughter's neurosis becoming a psychosis. Eventually, Pauline and Juliet go off the deep end, drowning in their make believe world. By the end of the film, they do the unthinkable.Kate Winslet is superb as Juliet. The rest of the cast is outstanding. Peter Jackson does a masterful job of capturing the essence of 1950s religious repression in New Zealand. It could be England or American in the 1950s. Heavenly Creatures will appeal to anyone who enjoys psychological twists and turns.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kate Winslet is Oscar worthy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is astonishing. Really, I rank it tied in first place as the best film of 1994, shared with PULP FICTION.Peter Jackson's masterpiece (thougth I love the Lord of the Rings films) is definitely HEAVENLY CREATURES. It's a challenging film, very difficult to watch at times. But it brilliantly captures the brightly burning, constantly changing, wild emotions of these two intelligent and creative but seriously damaged teenage girls.Sarah Peirse as the mother is incredible in her role. Melanie Lynskey reaches such a depth with her character...I actually think it's a bit frightening how good she is. And Kate Winslet...ahhh KATE WINSLET! At first glance...the performance might just be blown off as over the top and amateur. But that's only at first glance. Look closer, and stay with it, and you will see what amazing things she has done with this character. It's a remarkable achievement unlike any other acting I've seen in any film of this kind, which is to say a true life crime thriller.Heavenly Creatures is, and I say this with absolute certainty, the best true life crime thriller ever made. Because instead of trying to be a classic thriller with cheap tricks, Peter Jackson gets you inside the twisted minds of these two girls, and whether you hate them in the end or not, you completely understand why these girls did what they did...and that it was doomed from the start. Kate Winslet is just brilliant. WHY wasn't she given every award under the sun for this?!?!??!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Heavenly Creatures is a stunning film, surprisingly coming from the gore-maestro Peter Jackson. It follows two girls, Juliet Hulme and Pauline Rieper, who start talking to each other in a P.E. lesson. Over the days their friendship progresses, until they become good friends, and spend time with each other discussing actors, listening to records, and playing dress-up. The acting from Winslet and Lynesky is absolutely terrific from the beginning, Lynesky playing a moody young girl, and Winslet playing the happy, inventive young lady, who is a dab hand a clay modelling and painting. As the film continues, Juliet and Pauline's friendship becomes more and more stronger, as they begin to spend practically every minute of every day with each other. Sarah Peirse give a fine performance as Hilda Hulme, Pauline's mother, who by this time in the movie has become more than a little concerned about the bonding of the two girls. The ending is unforgettable. It is brutal and shocking, however the minutes leading up to the end are beautiful, complete with a spine-tingling, haunting choir music soundtrack. This movie is a beautiful, moving experience, which should leave you tearful by the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heavenly Creatures (1994)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While watching Heavenly Creatures, we bring ourselves to sympathize with two unlikely heroines, and then they betray our trust by committing an unthinkable crime; by the time the film has ended, we feel as if our emotions have been chewed up and spat back out to the degree where we don't know WHAT to feel anymore. Heavenly Creatures is either the greatest act of manipulation ever put on film or a brilliant masterpiece about the dark side of life: personally, I think it's a little bit of both. Either way, I'm still trying to get my pulse to return to its normal rate. Director Peter Jackson (who before this had only made a number of cheap nasty horror movies -- Bad Taste and Braindead being the most popular --, but later became one of the most talked-about film-makers as a result of his film interpretation of The Lord of the Rings) does some remarkable things with bringing this horrendous true story to the screen: not only is this one of the most amazing motion pictures I've ever viewed, but it is one of the most important films to date. Period. Pauline (Melanie Lynskey) and Juliet (Kate Winslet) have developed an inseparable friendship whose intimacy is questioned by their strict parents -- Pauline's being the most stern. As their lives (and our sentiments) are suddenly torn apart, they decide to run off together -- but this could mean having to murder someone. I will not go any further in describing the plot (and I fear that I may already have said too much), not because I want it to surprise you, but because this film is so powerful that I would be doing a disservice to it if I tried to describe it in mere words. Written by Jackson and his real-life spouse, Frances Walsh, the screenplay for Heavenly Creatures is nothing short of remarkable (it even garnered the Academy's attention, earning the film's singular nomination). We both hate and love the two main characters, but most of all we just want them to be happy, to which Jackson and Walsh ask us the question, "at what cost?" Their scenes together -- ESPECIALLY the joyous ones -- are drenched with an unbearable amount of foreboding hopelessness that makes the inevitable conclusion even more tense. In her debut film role, Kate Winslet displays much of the potential she fulfilled later on in her career, but Melanie Lynskey (who has only achieved modest success since) deserves an equal amount of praise -- if not more. By the time we're sucked into the story (which doesn't take long), we forget that they're even acting, and our eyes are peeled to the screen with a voyeuristic intensity that is utterly discomforting. Jackson's direction is simply stunning: his visual depiction of the girls' surreal alternate universe is altogether mesmerizing. Heavenly Creatures is both fascinating and repelling in a way reminiscent of David Lynch's Blue Velvet. But after having written all this, I am still brought to the ultimate conclusion that words cannot contain the experience of viewing this film. There are only a few films that were genuinely painful for me to watch (Neil LaBute's In the Company of Men and Kimberly Pierce's Boys Don't Cry among them), but this is certainly such a film, and I would not recommend it to the faint of heart. This is not a movie you enjoy (and if you do, you should seek psychiatric help), but it is one you will never forget; I know I certainly won't.Grade: A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Looming Darkness.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on a true story that took place in New Zealand in the mid-1950s, "Heavenly Creatures" is one of those films that seems tame at first glance, but is full of explosive devices. Co-writer/director Peter Jackson (of "The Lord of the Rings" fame) crafts a highly-disturbing motion picture about two teenaged girls (Melanie Lynsky and Kate Winslet, in the role that put her on the cinematic map) who have a highly potent relationship that is based on their love for literature and their love for a conjured-up fantasy world. Their intense friendship borders the line on a deep obsession as the two become inseparable. Their parents believe that lesbianism may be part of the partnership. Even though there are dream sequences and undertones aplenty to point to that, the girls' friendship does not go that way in real life. As others try to separate them for good, the girls come up with a devious plan to destroy who they feel is the major culprit (Lynskey's mother, played by Kirsti Ferry). The movie goes into a dark place and its somewhat sweet candy-coating tries to hide the fact that this was a truly major incident in a time and place where things like this just did not occur. Jackson was going for something like Peter Weir's equally disturbing "Picnic at Hanging Rock", but ends up creating a film that runs rings around that disappointing work. Jackson's smart direction just enhances a really intelligent Oscar-nominated screenplay. Kate Winslet does truly steal the show from Lynskey who was meant to be the real focal point of the production. A good film that would lead to even better works for the major players involved. 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peter Jackson needs to go back and start making movies like this again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In retrospect, you'd never know this is a Peter Jackson film. Not after becoming familiar with his recent work, anyway. "Heavenly Creatures" contains all the subtlety and nuances that his later work desperately needs - the graceful arc of the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy, despite its critical lauding, doesn't hold a candle to this film.Melanie Lynskey plays Pauline, a young girl who, along with her best friend Juliet (Kate Winslet), often envisions herself in fantasy worlds and alternate realities. The two girls' parents become so worried about their fantasies that they separate the two girls - but, in a fit of rage, Melanie and Juliet plan a dreadful revenge.Most shocking of all is that this story sounds like some lame supernatural thriller that would be on a made-for-TV special, in which the girls share some kind of psychic connection - but it's not like that at all. It's a true story, and it's handled quite delicately.The performances are, for the most part, very good. Winslet shines in one of her earlier performances and displays raw talent.Overall, watching this I couldn't help but be reminded of how talented Peter Jackson used to be, and how lately he has succumbed to making, for lack of a better description, Hollywood shlock. I liked "Lord of the Rings." I liked "King Kong." But this is better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie on a whim. I had no idea what it was about. Earlier in 1994 I had taken a chance on a movie called "Momma's Boys" with Jamie Lee Curtis, and it was absolutely horrible. But this time the whim paid off.The movie is edited and directed with a touch of genius. The opening scene is a preview of the climatic scene in the movie. "Good Fellas" also used this technique to create more suspense when the scene is repeated in the normal flow of the movie. The direction and editing mirrors the mental state of the two girls that nearly become one. Kate Winslet's tremendous emotional depth appeals to those of us who are afflicted with the malady of hyper-sensitivity. The other girl, whose name I forget, does rather disappear in her presence, but Winslet's character is supposed to be the driving force, and Winslet, like all great actors, makes the performers around her shine. Because Winslet is the leader of the pair, it is disturbing when the lesser character leads them to do the most unthinkable -- matricide. The victim of the girls is the most tolerant of the four parents, which creates even more shock when the crime occurs. I was more unhappy with Winslet's character's parents because they don't seem to give a whit for their girl. Feeling alone, the two girls find family with each other, but they take it a bit too deep. They escape into a shared fantasy land where all people become moving golden statues. It is very surreal with Mario Lanza being the golden hero of the dream world and Orson Welles, the claymation villain.This movie took me to another world in a different way than I had previously experienced with any movie. I loved it. To me it is a 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cinematic injustice....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A decade has come and gone since 'Heavenly Creatures' first graced cinema screens. It brought its director, Peter Jackson, and the second leading lady of the film, Kate Winslet, immediate international recognition. Unfortunately, the main leading lady, and indeed the real star of the movie, Melanie Lynskey was a victim of the film's global popularity. She received no publicity of any kind, particularly here in Britain, and remained every bit of the unknown she had been, prior to being discovered. To this day, Lynskey remains unknown in the United Kingdom. She, along with Kate Winslet, brought a hell of a lot of talent to bear when she became her character, but she was treated so shabbily by the people who could have elevated her career, as they had done with Kate Winslet. Her portrayal of Pauline Parker was the most visible sign of her talent. The scenes of friendship, love, passion and their shared hysteria as they commit the murder of Pauline's mother were a testament to Frances Walsh's belief in Lynskey's acting ability. She should have been rewarded with the kind of international success that Kate received. She got nothing, but three years of career-destroying obscurity. Yet, like her friend Drew Barrymore, she came back. Unlike Drew, Lynskey is still flying too low under Hollywood's radar. US and UK celebrity-based magazines have to start noticing and acknowledging her presence on the movie scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a tale of two girls, with a certain passion for life, and each other</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Heavenly Creatures may be the best film I've seen so far from Peter Jackson, even after having gone through the Lord of the Rings, King Kong, even Dead-Alive. His film is loaded with so much that it's hard to classify it as one specific thing, and its psychological complexities make it something special. One way to describe the picture is that it's about the stirring friendship-cum-relationship of Pauline (Melanie Lynskey) and Juliet (Kate Winslet) in 1950s New Zealand. Another way to describe it is showing the other side, the much darker side, of a coming of age story, where youth have to come to terms with realities, with horrific results. And even another way is that it's another in a big line of independent films that work on the relationship between fantasy and reality, or rather the practical need for abstractions to try and not get too close to the mundane, and then the all too hard to accept realities around the characters.But there's another way to describe it too that I like best, and that also marks it as something even more special than some might realize- it's one of those rare, sensational takes on what it's like to be in that dreadful cocoon of an age at 14 and 15, when hormones go completely insane, parents are more of an enemy and force to be reckoned with than a helpful, compassionate side like when younger, and at times the world seems like it could end at any moment if something changed for the worse. This is where I think Jackson strikes it hardest and most fulfilling, even as the other descriptions are not un-true at all. In this case, Juliet and Pauline are at that age, and when they first meet they first connect very strongly, being outsiders in their class, though completely in tune with their fantasy life of romanticized worlds, knights, an opera singer, and (some) male movie stars. But this becomes complicated more once they first get briefly separated due to Juliet's illness, and when they meet again there are suspicions from both sides of the family ('homosexuality' is shown in a close-up shot of the mouth of one of the father's saying it, as if it's like the plague), and the dysfunctions of Juliet's side end up drawing things to its very tragic end.Along with the substance being at a very high quality, of a script that deftly combines the elements of lush fantasy mixing and matching- sometimes without discerning- through a powerful subjective viewpoint, mostly through Pauline, there's unexpected scenes that are touching. For example, there's a scene where she reluctantly loses her virginity to a boarder, and through this she keeps cutting back and forth in her dulled state to clay knights. This is a motif, I suppose, that is expounded upon alongside the narration from Pauline, which adds her subjectivity to a fault. And all the while the objectivity becomes pushed aside, or at least is questioned. What is it to be so different from how everyone in this 1950s time views their uncommon bond? Whether they are or aren't lesbian is up for debate, it's left ambiguous even when its put up-front in the last twenty minutes. And all the while, Jackson directs it stylistically with the same verve he had with his early films, though balancing the wild fantasy with the grounded reality; he's even playful with it, however dark, which includes a great tip-of-the-hat to Orson Welles and the Third Man.All the while, too, the performances by the two leads are stellar. It's actually shocking to see Lynskey not get better roles since, as her Pauline is totally defined and made real and, at least in some sort of emotional way at times, relatable or sympathetic. Winslet, meanwhile, has one of her best here, as the more outward one personality-wise of the two, who is even more immersed in the fantasy than Pauline, but has a vulnerability that is crushing. Everything combines together then- the direction, the writing, the performances and the actual mixed psychology behind it, and it becomes quite memorable. It's not a very easy picture to watch at times, and its implications are disturbing, but it has more guts and determination to tell its story full-on than many others I can think of. A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kate's Big Break</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a huge fan of Kate Winslet, she is my favorite actress of all time, simply because she is possibly the most honest. It seems like she has the most natural talent and when she has a role she embraces it, recently I had a message from a IMDb user who asked me if I saw this film and if I hadn't, I should due to the fact that Kate was amazing in it. I also noticed it in my "1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die" book, so I had passed it over at Hollywood Video and figured to give it a look. I noticed also that it was directed by Peter Jackson who is now more famous due to the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, but I thought this film was really over looked and one of his finest. It's incredibly unique, artistic, and disturbing in some ways.Pauline is a out cast at school and she meets the new girl, Juliet, together they find out that they have a major thing in common, a wile imagination. They want to write a story together, they go as far as to call each other by their story names and spend time with each other constantly. But the parent's concerns grow more and more as the girls become a little more... "obsessive" of each other. Juliet's parents wish to send to her Africa to live with her aunt, but Juliet and Pauline do not want to let go of each other, and Pauline sees only one obstacle keeping them from seeing each other, her mom. So they devise an evil plan to get rid of her mom, permanently.Heavenly Creatures was incredibly unique and an amazing film. I couldn't believe my eyes watching this film, it was so interesting to watch, especially being in these girl's minds and imagination. Kate and Melanie had great chemistry and Peter Jackson made this film into his own. I would recommend it for movie buffs and definitely if you want to see how Kate got her start, she was amazing.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peter Jackson'a most successful early movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The next time I write in this diary, mother will be dead. How odd, yet how pleasing."This early writing and directorial effort by Peter Jackson and starring a young Kate Winslet is an odd one to pin down. Especially odd, since it's based on a true story (which I didn't know until the film was over). It's about the intense friendship between two girls living in New Zealand. One is sullen and withdrawn, the other, a wealthy transplant from England, is outspoken and draws attention with her very presence. Both are intelligent, imaginative, and share a similar casual darkness in their personalities.&nbsp;As their friendship blooms and grows more and more intense, their parents (this being set in the 50's) begin to suspect an unwholesome aspect to their relationship. When the threat of separation arises, the girls swiftly and resolutely settle on a grisly solution to their forced division: murder.The movie shifts in tone often, from a sort of coming of age story, to the fanciful world of the girls' imaginations, to their rage and heartbreak at their parents. Kate Winslet was pretty good, but you could tell that she was still finding her way and confidence as an actress. I found the plot to be rather dull at the start, but it grew more interesting as it continued on to a rather abrupt ending.&nbsp;Interesting is a good word to use describe Heavenly Creatures, as a whole. It held my attention, even during the parts where I was a little less than entertained. It's unflinchingly dark in some aspects, and innocent and childlike in others. I'd recommend it to most just based on the fact that it's something different, and there's merit in that. It's well-made, also, I just found my interest fluctuating too often to give the movie a higher score.&nbsp;And how does Kate Winslet look almost exactly the same today as she did in 1994? Now that's a topic that's interesting enough to make a movie about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Besides being, to me, a fascinating although eccentric look at an example of every day life in 1950s New Zealand (one of only two or three places in the world that I have wanted to visit all my life), Heavenly Creatures is also the first movie that really shows that talent of Peter Jackson, which may have been overshadowed in his previous career by the sheer quantity of blood and guts that he packed into his earliest films. I have read that a lot of people were initially put off by the premise of an intense loving relationship between two teenage girls, but it should be noted that their relationship, if sexual at all, is sexual in a purely symbolic way. If nothing else, Jackson has made a stupendous achievement of making a film about this relationship and completely preventing any sense of eroticism from creeping up. The movie tells the shocking true story of two teenage girls who crushed the skull of one of their mothers with a rock, and what led them to commit such a heinous crime. My understanding is that the story is told with a great deal of creative liberties, but the focus is on a kind of friendship that few people ever find. Two girls with strengths and weaknesses that perfectly complement each other, who run through the world at full speed giggling with glee as if unable to understand the pure happiness that they feel when they are together. Soon, various events come in the way of their friendship. Melanie Lynskey plays Pauline, and Kate Winslet, in her first film role, plays Juliet, who is noticeably horrified when her parents bring up the prospect of leaving the country for a mere three weeks. While separated, they write each other elaborate letters, describing events that take place in an imaginary world that they have created together. When the separations become longer (and more obviously because of parents' misguided (?) concerns about a homosexual relationship), their efforts to remain together become more and more desperate. As they say, never underestimate the power of stupid people in large numbers, or even the power and danger of a couple of teenage girls bent on maintaining their friendship. People are dangerous in groups, even groups of two (I realize, just this second, that tomorrow morning I have three classes of university students preparing to give final exam presentations in groups of two and three. I hope I haven't made a horrible mistake!!). Complicating matters for Pauline and Juliet are four wildly unhelpful parents. Juliet's mother is distracted by her disintegrating marriage and futile affairs while her professional father is benevolent and professional but both hapless and helpless, while Pauline's mother is over- controlling and militant about her discipline, and her father seems to just want the whole thing to go away. The parents and the children are pulling in opposite directions, and they pull harder and harder and harder until finally the rope snaps, as it must. There are a number of truly impressive and memorable sections of the film, such as the presentation of the imaginary world that Pauline and Juliet have created together, particularly the clay characters that populate it. These things make it a movie that is difficult to categorize but easy to remember, and they show a sense of visual style that Jackson later went on to develop even further in the Lord of the Rings films and King Kong. Some say that he will never be able to top the Lord of the Rings movies, but personally I think he still has a few things up his sleeve. We can hope, anyway.Note ? it's well known that the real life Juliet has been revealed to be the successful murder mystery novelist Anne Perry, which is a perfect ending to her story (although I would have expected Pauline to become the writer). Also, Melanie Lynksey has had a surprisingly successful acting career, appearing in many successful films, including a periodic role as the slightly crazy but immensely attractive Rose on 2 ? Men.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps the premier concern of modern filmmakers is locating somewhere in the film exactly where the film-making process is. This is often incorrectly called irony, self-reference or the odd construction of reflexivity. I call it 'folding' and it seems to be everywhere and often in rich and engaging forms. Moreover, it seem to be a central concern of the Australian performing arts community. I imagine it can be traced back to a single person in the seventies on Bennelong Point.So much of what we have gotten from this tradition has enriched us all, not the least of which are the actresses who master folded acting. That's where we get a portrayal of a character and another simultaneous portrayal of an actor portraying that character. Sometimes the 'character' in these two portrayals isn't quite the same. Three mainstream film actresses today can do this. Two are Australian, and one is Kate.This is her first film, and it is no surprise at all that the filmmaker has chosen to build a structure that is a representation and is about representation. The original, true story is about two girls, enwrapped in mutual fantasy, probably enhanced by the flush of sex, whose fantastic adventures get out of hand. From this, Jackson reshapes it all. It is now a film about films. Now the girls' fantasy world is a Camelot driven by forces in film. They write. They sculpt characters, based on film characters. Those film characters come 'alive' and form a world in which the girls live in parallel with the real world. So far so good.But Jackson goes further. Some of the film prototypes are simple characters: Mario Lanza-like. Simple glamour with no pretense or irony. But there is the amazing Orson Welles also. Orson is not pretty, he is not direct, he is a folded prototype himself. The two worlds conflict, and that conflict is reflected in each world. In the Borovnian ('borrow'-nian) world, this is a conflict between two clay figures: the Welles and the Lanza, the winner getting to bed and impregnate both princesses. In the 'real' world, the conflict carries over to the two houses, and even within Juliet's house between the bookish metaphysical father and the sexy 'psychologist- but touchy-feely' mother.Welles was the one who reinvented the ordinary flat world of film into a melange of folding techniques. The film world since the late forties has been a combination of struggles and syntheses between the forth world of Welles and the simple dramatic stage of Griffith.Even the very young Kate surfs and exploits these levels with aplomb. Even as a teenager she gives us messages from each of these folds - not at precisely the same time as Julianne would later, but strongly nonetheless.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film is "Heavenly"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Years before he would turn his eye to adapting J.R.R. Tolkien's literary masterpiece, director Peter Jackson made a critical splash (if not a commercial one) with his film Heavenly Creatures. The film brought to screen a real life event in 1954 New Zealand where two girls committed matricide when the possibly of being separated from each other was inevitable. While it may not be as flashy and crowd-pleasing as the Lord of the Rings trilogy, Jackson's skill as a filmmaker is on display with Heavenly Creatures and proves he can work outside of the fantasy-action genre.Early in the film, we are introduced to the characters of Pauline Rieper (Melanie Lynskey) and Juliet Hulme (Kate Winslet, in her first major acting role), two girls who meet at the girl's school they both attend in Christchurch, New Zealand in 1953. The two quickly discover they have much in common: childhood illnesses that prevent them from participating in physical activities, a love of the arts, especially literature, and the opinion that Mario Lanza is the "world's greatest tenor." As their friendship blossoms, the two develop a fantasy realm entitled The 4th World, where the great creators go after they die. They also begin writing an elaborate fantasy novel, generating elaborate backstories for their characters and shortly find themselves referring to each other by names from their fantasy stories. When Juliet contracts tuberculosis and is quarantined from the general population, Pauline writes to her as both her real self and her imaginary character. As time passes, the girls begin to fantasize that their fictional world exists, populated by life-size versions of the clay sculptures they have created for their stories. The closeness of the two doesn't go unnoticed by their respective parents, with Juliet's father (Clive Merrison) beginning to suspect that the relationship between them is becoming "unhealthy" (read: homosexual). The parents begin to attempt to separate the two, but the girls have become almost incapable of functioning without the other. Pauline comes to the conclusion that, after Juliet is intended to move to South Africa, that she must remove the obstacle that prevents her from staying with her friend: her mother.Heavenly Creatures is very much a story of two isolated outsiders finding a kindred soul in the world and quickly building their entire existence around the other. Pauline is a frumpy, slightly homely girl who is known to scowl and put herself in the corner of a room. Juliet is much more outgoing and contemptuous of authority, correcting her teachers and performing a different lesson than the one assigned. But their commonalties outdistance their differences. Pauline has a bad leg, Juliet problematic lungs, so they spend their excercise hour sitting on the bench, talking to each other, dreaming up their fantasy world. Juliet was separated from her parents for much of her young childhood, Pauline's parents must focus on running a boarding house. Never before have they found another person so in line with what they think and feel, and are naturally drawn to each other. But their relationship is not exactly right: they disappear into their fantasies, envisioning themselves as princesses but their imaginings begin to crowd out the real world, which they find too cold and uncaring. It is easy to see why the two form their bond, but it is also easy to see that they take it too far. Unable to cope with an existence without the other, this clouds everything around them. At the same time, Heavenly Creatures is a tale of parents that are unaware or unconcerned about their children's needs. When Juliet is quarantined to the hospital, her parents go on a multi-week trip to England where her father, a respected professor, can attend a conference. Pauline's parents try to block out her growing sexuality, including an interest shown by a boy who is staying at her parent's home.The film is based, in part, on diaries kept in 1953 and 1954 by Pauline. She relates in cheerful and excited tones the approaching event that the two decided they must undertake when it is obvious that Juliet is leaving: the murder of Pauline's mother. They lead-up to the event is one of slow, building tension, as we view two innocents about to perform an act completely lacking in innocence.Jackson displays his affinity for a wild, moving camera even here, filming many sequences in a style not typical of a drama, in some cases to relate the freewheeling nature of the girl's flights of fancy and giddy good time while in the other's company. On the acting front, both Lynskey and Winslet are standouts. Lynskey portrays Pauline's depth of introversion and opening up with her friend expertly. Winselt produces just the right amount of arrogance and surety to give Juliet the appropriate superior attitude when necessary, but eventually this gives way to trepidation as she begins to realize the depth and scope of the act they are preparing to undertake.Heavenly Creatures is a tale of innocence and friendship taken too far, pushed beyond the boundaries of normalcy. Juliet and Pauline's sin wasn't homosexuality (the film suggests it to some degree, but hardly makes it certain), it was becoming blind to the world outside of their isolated bubble long after it was too late. For those who found Jackson's Lord of the Rings triptych engrossing, they would do well to check out Heavenly Creatures.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My All-Time Favorite Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must preface this review by saying that "Heavenly Creatures" is my all-time favorite movie. I say that mainly because certain aspects of it remind me of my own youth. I am not a lesbian or a murderer, but I enjoy writing and had a few close friends when I was younger that shared my passion. We created characters and whole worlds, and yes, even the occassional alter ego. Watching "Heavenly Creatures" brought a tear to my eye because I could relate to the close friendship of Juliet Hulme and Pauline Parker. It also made me cry because of where they ended up and also how unfairly their friendship was viewed by their families.Every time I watch this movie, I want to jump into the TV and stop the characters from their heinous actions. I want the movie, and their true lives, to end up differently, but of course that never will happen. This is a bittersweet film that is filled with sharp dialogue (some of it coming from Pauline Parker's actual journal), as well as amazing actors. I think Melanie Lynsky, who plays Pauline, has yet to get the recognition she deserves for her awesome acting skills, and Kate Winslet is 100 times better in "Heavenly Creatures" than she was in Titanic (the movie for which everyone seems to remember).To sum this up, "Heavenly Creatures" is a unique and incredible film that will tug at your heartstrings while breaking your heart at the same time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So many only know him for his newer work (Lord of the Rings Trilogy and King Kong) and have yet to appreciate the genius he is. Heavenly Creatures may not be his best work or most critically acclaimed...but it is brilliant and masterful. It demonstrates his creativity, willingness to break the mold and passion for making a movie what it should be...entertaining. Even matricide. Kate Winslet is brilliant in her role and so is Melanie Lynskey. It almost makes you pity the real life people they were portraying. I don't know if Jackson was trying to make you have a heart for what these girls did or if he just wanted to share the story from their perspective, but it would not have made sense from any other view than the girls. The journals they kept explained their insanity and makes you wonder why they didn't get more time. Only in America, I guess. This is a wonderful piece of work. My favorite of all of Jackson's movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We all know Peter Jackson as the man who directed the Lord of the Rings Trilogy: but his early days as a director of horror-comedies. His 1994 drama Heavenly Creatures, based on a real-life murder, was his first step away from that genre and show what else he was capable of.In 1952 Pauline (Melanie Lynskey) is a social outsider who does not get on well with her peers at her school in Christchuch, New Zealand. But at the start of the new term she befriends a new student, English girl Juliet Hulme (Kate Winslet). Both had childhood illnesses and they bond through their imagination, their creation of a fantasy world and have a love of music, particularly Mario Lanza. But their friendship slowly turns to obsession with each other, becoming extremely close, they find it hard to separate fantasy from reality and their fantasies become more and more violent. Mixed with their personal troubles their parents try to separate them, resulting with them planning a murder.Heavenly Creatures is a wonderfully made film and it was very Kubrickian in its approach. The lighting and use of shadows, colours and camera movement made the film look very much like Stanley Kubrick film and this was the type of story that would interested the man. The use of narrator also felt very similar to how Kubrick would let us know the thoughts of our main character. This film does have a great feeling of being like A Clockwork Orange, Lolita and The Shining, even though they are different films. We got the suburban setting of Lolita, the out of control youths from A Clockwork Orange and the theme of insanity and fantasy from The Shinning.On the wider front of Jackson's direction it was faultless. The pacing was perfect (I watched the 95 minute cut), the special effects were great for the time (this was Weta's first film) and it blended well with the film. Despite the low budget the special effects worked well and shifted between light and upbeat to dark and creepy. There are excellent camera moments and editing trick to shift us from the world of reality to fantasy and it was fitting for the situation as the girls were loosing their minds or using their imagination to enact violence fantasies.There are a lot of themes and ideas being explored in Heavenly Creatures. The most obvious are obsession, insanity and mental health, the parent-child relationship and friendship, even if the result is detrimental. But there are other themes about adolescence, about how it was changing and there was little understand of this period. We see how adolescence is a period of transition, from the two girls having fantasies which turn darker and they start to embark on more adult ventures, even at their young age, but also making them vulnerable to being exploited. There is a lack of understanding and this was film was set in a period where we are children or adults and no in-between. There is a clique of attitudes and psychology of the period as well a look at differing of parenting approaches.Heavenly Creatures was the first film for Winslet and Lynskey and there were of course there excellent in their roles, playing two hardly complex, troubled girls. Both are very bright and imaginative and you can easily believe in their friendship and relationship and how unusually close they are. The adult actors too were very strong throughout and there were no weak links in a film about two teenage girls taking a very dark turn.If you consider yourself a Peter Jackson fan then you need see Heavenly Creatures. Other wises Heavenly Creatures is worthy film both as a piece of dramatic storytelling, visual filmmaking and a thematic piece about obsessions and unhealthy relationships.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Heavenly Creatures" is one of the most powerful and disturbing films I have ever seen. It's made by Peter Jackson no less and is filmed in almost all the exact locations the real friends were. What makes this film so disturbing is the somewhat funny and "fake" over-the-top beginning being juxtaposed with the really harsh and realistic ending leaves a really chilling impact on you. What makes it all the more disturbing is that this actually happened, and apparently one of the friends is a celebrated crime novelist living in Scotland!The visuals are eye-catching and really go deep into the twisted minds of these really, almost too close, friends. One is played by Kate Winslet (in her first every role woo!) and the other is some unknown Aussie (or should I say New Zealander) both play their parts really well. Everyone is over-the-top for the most part and it really does work. Peter Jackson invites us in to their friendship and we as an audience sort of begin to understand what the girls are like and the horrors of the ever being apart.The screenplay is extremely impressive, with the interesting narration from the girl's actual diary. But, what's most impressive is Peter Jackson's directing. When the film comes to it's climax (the whole film is a build-up which is what makes it so clever and interesting) I really did feel nervous for the mother, she just seemed like such a typical mother and Peter puts us into their shoes so you can only imagine what the girl's are thinking. I was left bemused and shocked. The murder is so realistically done it's frightening and left me cold. That's why I can't give it no less than a 10/10.Peter Jackson's "Heavenly Creatures" is a highly unusual, but extremely absorbing psychological drama. It keeps you fixed on their friendship until the very last scene. I think it is a film that will certainly stick with me thanks to it's striking visuals and intelligent screenplay. Peter shows us that he can't only just do fun, mindless, gorefests, but he can also do disturbing, mature, dramas (with some hilarious comedy as well.) If you see "Heavenly Creatures" on BBC1. Hit record!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The New Zealand cinema finds its own "Picnic at Hanging Rock".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To celebrate my 700th review for IMDb I turn to another of my favourite films. "Heavenly Creatures" was is the film which first brought to international attention Peter Jackson, later to win fame as the director of the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy. It is based on the notorious 1954 Parker-Hulme murder, committed by two teenage girls in Christchurch, New Zealand, and is told from the viewpoint of the girls themselves.The two girls, as depicted in this film, are very different. Juliet Hulme, originally from England, is from an upper-middle-class background, the daughter of the distinguished scientist Henry Hulme, a professor at Christchurch University. She is attractive, outgoing and with a self-confidence bordering on arrogance. (Our first view of her comes when she puts down her French teacher, who has made a grammatical error in a sentence written on the blackboard). Pauline Parker, a native-born New Zealander from a working-class background, is shy and withdrawn. (I use the name by which Pauline became known to the world, although before her trial she was known either as Pauline Rieper or Yvonne Rieper, and was variously nicknamed by Juliet "Charles", "Paul" or "Gina". Pauline's nickname for Juliet was "Deborah", pronounced in the old manner with the stress on the second syllable).Despite their different backgrounds the girls quickly become first close friends then lesbian lovers. What the film makes clear, however, is that their relationship is based upon more than just friendship and more than just sexual desire. One thing they have in common is an extraordinarily vivid imagination. Both harbour the ambition to become writers and they have invented the imaginary kingdom of Borovnia, complete with its own Royal Family and citizens; much of their time is taken up with making clay models of these fictional characters, or acting out their adventures (Their nicknames Charles, Deborah and Gina are taken from this Borovnian mythology).Even more importantly, they have rejected Christianity in favour of their own religion, based around the "Fourth World". (The other three worlds are presumably Earth, Hell and the conventional Heaven). This, conceived as a place of "music, art and endless pleasure", is a sort of super-heaven available only to those of superior artistic or spiritual sensitivities such as the girls imagine themselves to be. (They regard themselves as "heavenly creatures, hence the title). Those artistic figures whom the girls particularly admire, such as the tenor Mario Lanza or the actor James Mason, are regarded as "Saints" who will have their place in the Fourth World. (Pauline's attempt to canonise Orson Welles, however, is vetoed by Juliet, who regards him as repulsive). A central tenet of this religion is that it is possible, through mystical experiences, to access the Fourth World for brief periods during this lifetime, something they refer to as "Finding the Key".Another shared link between the girls is their rejection of their social backgrounds; Juliet rejects the hypocrisy and conventionality of the bourgeois Hulmes, while Pauline despises the Philistinism of the working-class Riepers. Both loathe the stifling conformity of their school and the educational system in general. What gives their relationship its strength, therefore, is the ability it gives them to escape from their mundane everyday world into a blissful alternative reality through shared mystical experiences. Their parents, who fear that their daughters' relationship is becoming "unhealthy" -fifties euphemism for sexual-, are seen as obstacles to the girls' happiness. Although all four believe that the girls need to be separated, the girls come to see Pauline's mother Honora as their main enemy, and therefore come up with a plan to kill her.The film introduced two hugely talented young actresses, Kate Winslet (who has of course gone on to become a major star) and Melanie Lynskey, who is not quite so well known. This was Winslet's first film, and in my view remains her best- a quite sensational debut- but Lynskey deserves as much credit for its success. The contrast in character between the two girls is emphasised by their different styles of acting, Winslet vibrant and passionate, Lynskey intense and moody. Also deserving of credit are the four actors who play the girls' parents. Although they may have seemed to Pauline and Juliet like monsters, they were in reality two quite normal couples, bewildered by and unable to cope with the intense love which had grown up between their daughters.What makes "Heavenly Creatures" so remarkable, apart from the acting, is the ability of Jackson and the scriptwriter Fran Walsh, who is also his wife, to enter into the imaginary world of the two main characters, both their "Borovnian" stories and their visions of the Fourth World. This is done by elaborate fantasy sequences, in which Juliet and Pauline run through a New Zealand countryside which is now the home of unicorns and butterflies the size of eagles, and in which their clay Borovnian figures come to life, all to the strains of Mario Lanza.Most films about real-life crimes, although there are exceptions such as the excellent "Ten Rillington Place" are either earnest and preachy or dryly factual. "Heavenly Creatures", however, falls into neither of these categories. It is, in my view, the best-ever true-crime film (and best-ever film about lesbianism), distinguished by a literate script, great acting, especially from its two young stars, and above all some truly imaginative direction. It is a film which shows how characteristics which in themselves might seem admirable- love, imagination, religious sensibility- can combine to produce a sort of madness leading to a brutal and shocking crime.Peter Weir's "Picnic at Hanging Rock" is often cited as the first great Australian film, marking the moment when the Australian cinema came of age. (That film too also involved a group of teenage schoolgirls with mystical, quasi-religious tendencies). With "Heavenly Creatures" the New Zealand cinema has found its own "Picnic at Hanging Rock". 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>New Zealand screenwriter, producer and director Peter Jackson's fourth feature film which he co-wrote with New Zealand screenwriter, producer and lyricist Frances Walsh and co-produced, is inspired by the Parker-Hulme murder case from 1954 which took place in Christchurch on the South Island of New Zealand where the film was shot. It premiered In competition at the 51st Venice Film Festival in 1994 and is a New Zealand production which was produced by New Zealand producer Jim Booth (1945-1994). It tells the story about two 15-year-old students named Pauline Parker and Juliet Hulme who meets at a girls' secondary school in Christchurch during a summer in the early 1950s. Pauline and Juliet becomes best friends and creates their own secluded imaginary world, but when their parents begins worrying about their behavior and the nature of their relationship, they try to separate them.Distinctly and finely directed by New Zealand filmmaker Peter Jackson, this rhythmic, biographical and fictional story which is narrated by and from the two female protagonists viewpoints, draws a distinct portrayal of a malicious and unruly friendship between two aspiring writers. While notable for its naturalistic milieu depictions, sterling production design by New Zealand production designer Grant Major, cinematography by New Zealand cinematographer Alun Bollinger and fine costume design by New Zealand costume designer Ngila Dickson and use of sound, this character-driven, narrative-driven and fairy-tale-like psychological thriller depicts two interrelated and in-depth studies of character and contains a great score by New Zealand composer Peter Dasent.This darkly humorous, significantly atmospheric and remarkable coming-of-age indie from the early 1990s which is set during a summer in 1954 in a city in New Zealand, is impelled and reinforced by its cogent narrative structure, substantial character development, eccentric characters, fine editing by New Zealand film editor Jamie Selkirk and the prominent and brilliant acting performances by New Zealand actress Melanie Lynskey, English actress Kate Winslet and the fine supporting acting performance by New Zealand actress Sarah Pierse. A surreal, sensual, inventive and wickedly romantic crime drama which gained, among numerous other awards, the Silver Lion Peter Jackson at the 51st Venice Film Festival in 1994.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film caught me by surprise. I am not really keen on Peter Jackson and am not entirely interested in his fantasy or horror films even though I admit the man has a great imagination and an inspiring ability to realise his massive concepts on the screen. I respect that ? but Heavenly Creatures is a completely different kind of beast of a movie that is just crazy good. Revolving around two high school girls who develop a deep, special friendship, Kate Winslet gives the performance of her life as a very charming new student and her delivery really makes you want to be her friend. Jackson is really able to control the audience's responses as the story progresses ? you feel a sense of sadness when you realise that this friendship is going to end very badly and then with that final shot, absolutely dread and horror as you wake up and realise how far gone these two girls were in their own fantasy world. I also have respect for Jackson for crossing over his interest in horror and fantasy into this drama ? the make up and special effects are really cool and complement the actors as the line between reality and fantasy is blurred. It really helps in getting the audience to have an experience that mirrors what Melanie Lynesky feels throughout the film rather than just being a detached observer. If I had to pick my "most" favourite film from this list I can easily see Days of Heaven or Heavenly Creatures being the first film I think of. Watch it today!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantasy, Murder and the Loss of Innocence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Heavenly Creatures is one of the most terrifying movies I've ever seen, thanks to a good combination of aspects: Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh's screenplay, which is clear but complex; the acting by Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskey; and the ordinary way it was shot, emphasizing the relationship between the characters instead of the gruesome aspects of the story itself.Pauline and Juliet are two adolescent friends who make up fantasy worlds and live apart from the real one. They invent, develop and live in their inner worlds, creating their own vocabulary and shunning everything else, to the point it seems they're just one person.Their parents don't like this and so forbid each girl from seeing the other. Being two unhappy people without much outside their shared world, they decide to do everything to save it from disappearing. So they murder the mother of one of the girls.The movie plays mostly as an intimate drama about growing up and the usual confusions of adolescence. But little by little Jackson begins turning it into an unsettling experience. It becomes disturbing to see how dependent each girl is on the other and how far they'll go to protect their warped happiness.The murder scene is one of the most disturbing I've ever seen, thanks to the realistic and ordinary way it was shot, showing the girls' insecurity in the act of murder, the somber play they chose for the murder, the method of murder and the unbearable screams of their victim. It's a scene that won't leave the viewer's mind for a long time.All in all, this is a great movie, which shows what a great director Peter Jackson already was before reaching worldwide fame. It's a thriller, it's a drama, but above all it's a movie to be remembered forever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peter Jackson Before "Lord of the Rings"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before he was known for the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy, Peter Jackson made this fascinating movie about two friends who submerge themselves in a fantasy world of their own creation with horrifying results.I know I'm in the minority, but I wish Jackson would go back to making movies like this. His love of special effects is clear even in this film, but the effects work at the service of a story about actual people living in the actual world, and the results are far more compelling than anything to be found in all 50 hours of the "Rings" trilogy.Before she was a household name, Kate Winslet appeared in this, and gave a marvelous performance.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The absolute opposite of Bad Taste!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite being a huge fan of Peter Jackson's splatter-classics "Bad Taste" and "Braindead", this ultra-stylish and distinguished period drama felt like a welcome surprise and it more than clearly indicated how Jackson is an extremely versatile filmmaker, rather than just a sick puppy with an unhealthy interest in severed body parts. "Heavenly Creatures" is (very truthfully) based on a notorious real-life murder that took place in New Zealand during the 1950's. Two teenage schoolgirls, whose intimate friendship quickly got rejected by all the adults surrounding them, brutally killed the mother of one of them. Rather than purely building up towards this ultimately grisly and disturbing murder, Peter Jackson surprisingly dedicates a lot of time and effort into re-enacting the close friendship between Juliet (a clever and eloquent English immigrant) and Pauline (an introvert and docile local working-class daughter). From their first encounters in the schoolyard, over their development of common tastes in movies &amp; music, to the eventual fleeing into their own utopia-world known as the Fourth World. Kate Winslet ? in her debut ? is amazing as the headstrong Juliet, who drags Pauline along in her fascination for crooner Mario Lanza and eerie actor Orson Welles until both girls become dangerously inseparable. When the parents then begin to worry about their daughters' wayward and peculiar behavior, the girls bring out their daydreaming to the real world, with very deadly results. "Heavenly Creatures" is a very powerful film! In case you still have any doubts regarding the subject, it's not just the story of two lesbians versus the rest of the world, but a truly gripping &amp; tasteful drama that masterfully captures the prudish life-styles of the 1950's and puts genuine acting talents into the spotlights. The end sequence is harrowing and very unsettling. Jackson's previous films "Bad Taste" and especially "Braindead" all together featured approximately 500 gory massacres, yet not one of them felt as painful &amp; intense as the sole murder in "Heavenly Creatures". Excellent movie with great acting, great atmospheric tension and dazzling music. Highly recommended to all the true fans of cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two Amazing Performances-A True classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is one of my all time favorites. While to some the mixture of the fantasy sequences might be a bit much, the overall script, cinematography, music, and performances are simply AMAZING. I guess what I find so incredible about this film is the way Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskie give such complex, layered, believable performances at such young ages. I think Kate Winslet is just an amazing actress, but her performance in Heavenly Creatures was in my opinion far superior to that of hers in Titanic. (not that I didn't think she was excellent in that a well) Melanie Lynskie is also just outstanding &amp; while I have seen her in bit roles in films such as "Coyote Ugly", she is unfortunately very underused in Hollywood as she seems to bring her "A" game to every project she is in. If you want to see a movie that is intense, compelling, tragic and with Oscar worthy performances than do not miss this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Back in the days, not many of us would have believed that Peter Jackson directed something like this. This is one of the most beautiful movies ever made. Jackson's debut, Bad Taste, and the follow-ups Braindead and Meet the Feebles are legendary splatter-classics, not even close to Heavenly Creatures.Before a quite well known trilogy Jackson directed, he also made movies named Frighteners and Forgotten Silver. Frighteners may be the lowest point of his career but Forgotten Silver is a real masterpiece. So the best works he has done are also the least known.This movie is based on a true story. It's about a murder, that happened in New-Zealand a long time ago, committed by two teen aged girls. But what is attractive in the movie, is the beautiful fantasy world these two girls have created in their minds. Girls are played by Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskey, and they do the roles of their lifetimes. As they are homosexuals, their parents try to separate them, but it doesn't feel like an option for the girls.This is one of those films I watch every year, and the video cassette I got, is in pretty bad shape already, but I haven't found a DVD yet. When the DVD appears on stores, I'm going to buy it the second I see it.And I do hope that Peter Jackson would come back to make movies like this, instead of King Kong (which I liked, but anyway...)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Different.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>POSSIBLE SPOILERS!When i say different i mean different to what Peter Jackson had done before this. He may now be the hottest directorial talent around now (with a little trilogy by the name of Lord of the Rings giving him a push in the right direction) but before all that he was notorious around the cult circle for his excessively gruesome yet incredibly funny horror/splatter movies.As entertaining as these movies may be, they are not cinematic gold like Lord of the Rings or this gem that he churned out in the early 90's. In fact it was this type of movie that proved to the world that Jackson can be a mature and adult film maker if given the right material (another example would be Steven Spielberg and Schindler's List).This film takes place between the years of 1952 and 1954 and focuses on two young schoolgirls that develop a bizarre friendship in which they create a fantasy world that only they know about. When their relationship appears to become something more than just mutural friends their parents try to put and end to it by separating the two, ending with tragic results.As with every Peter Jackson movie the film starts off with his usual bravado and energy with the performances played out with his slightly OTT take on the world. There is not a bad performance in this movie, and it also displays Jackson's ability for spotting new talent (this was Kate Winslet's first big role).However when the relationship starts to take a turn for the worse, Jackson shows his talent as a great film maker. The performances become more subtle and eerily precise as the truly shocking reality of what will happen starts to unfold. The leading ladies become more disturbing than any screen psycho to date, with the added oomph that they are just children.The ending is the icing on the cake for me and i know that'll sound sick and sadistic to anyone who has had the pleasure of seeing this film, but it just proves what a disturbing picture this is. It shows how far, too far can go and how strong the relationship was if, in the end, it would lead to murder to keep them together.This is a movie that is endlessly watchable. Definitely a more mature and adult film than the rest of his cannon (apart from LOTR of course) and it also showed the start of what would become a truly great talent that would dominate Hollywood ten years later. There are not many films today that can be funny, compelling, heartbreaking, chilling, disturbing and beautiful all at the same time, but this one pulls it off with effortless ease.5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrible as hell, but beautiful as heaven</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's really amazing how a story can be horrible and beautiful at the same time. "Heavenly Creatures" is a movie that proves it really can.The story is full of fantasy, drama, friendship and strange elements. The combination of personal drama, extraordinary fantasy and suspense thriller keeps you interested.Besides the story itself, there are also other factors that makes this movie extremely worth watching. Director Peter Jackson is pulling the strings the whole movie, and his direction is like the cherry on the strawberry pie: it's an extra 'golden touch' on "Heavenly Creatures".And we must not forget the great acting. Sarah Pierse is fine as Mrs Rieper, and Clive Merrison is cast-iron in his role as Mr Hulme. And then there are the two unique leading girls, Melanie Lynskey and Kate Winslet. Lynskey does very well in her very complicated and isolated role as Pauline Rieper, but Winslet exceeds everybody with her fantastic, compelling and terrifying role as Juliet Hulme.The special effects are really "special" and contribute to the film's pretensions, and also the music does his bit. The movie gives you a little nasty feeling in the stomach, but at the end you know, that you've just seen a really unique film.To me, "Heavenly Creatures" was a unforgettable watching experience. Just a quarter ago, I've ordered the DVD of this film. And I can't wait to see "Heavenly Creatures" again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A frighteningly true story of twisted friendship</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This probably has spoilers--so watch out!Peter Jackson is now best known for his "Lord of the Rings" Trilogy, but this movie, I believe, helped establish him as the right director for that gigantic undertaking. It is creepy--maybe because we know that this story really happened--and as we watch the changes in Pauline and Juliet over the course of the movie, the girls become more and more frightening. Another distinctly eerie aspect of Jackson's film is the entries taken straight out of Pauline's diary. At first mundane and typical of a teenage girl, eventually the diary reflects just how monstrous the girls had become--quotes like, "it was a perfect day to kill Mother," and, "It seemed like she knew what was coming, and wanted it," are so sociopathic it is impossible to see the little girl in either child again.I watched the movie as part of my Philosophy Goes to the Movies class, and the comments afterward focused on the friendship between the two girls. We asked, "What went wrong?" Obviously something did in their relationship--somewhere along the way, a line was crossed by the two. Jackson does a fine job of immersing the viewer so much in the normal suburban lives of the children that the viewer can't exactly pinpoint when the relationship went murderous. I know many young girls who had the same sort of relationship during their teenage years, but none of them became murderers. Jackson never comes and and blatantly tells the viewer what it is that forces the girls to kill, he leaves that open to interpretation--maybe it's the anti-homosexual constraining society, maybe it's the sociopathic nature of the little world they created only for the two of them, who knows? Many young children create imaginary worlds, and large amounts of adolescents have homosexual tendencies during puberty--yet not all turn out to be killers. It is a tribute to Jackson to not take a stand on exactly what caused the girls to turn to matricide--many other filmmakers would force their opinion on the audience--Jackson lets our own psyches try to comprehend the girls' motivations."Heavenly Creatures" is a disturbing movie--I recommend it to anyone who has only seen Jackson's Ring Trilogy, or who enjoys odd human dramas. It is sure to make you shiver--especially when you learn that Juliet is an established author writing none other than murder mysteries in England. For another good scare read her biography, and pay special attention to what she learned as a teenager.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is polemic,strong and yet great.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based in a real story, Heavenly Creatures has the great direction of Peter Jackson years before Lord of the Rings become a success. Pauline Yvonne Rieper and Juliet Hulme, are two teenager girls in the 50's, a very conservative time. Juliet is from the upper class,already traveled around the world, and comes from England to study in the same Conservative catholic school as Pauline, a girl from a lower class, with an anti social behavior and moody. They two become close friends,specially because they both have many similarities: They don't have any friends, they had a hard childhood,needing to be in the hospital with special cares because of their diseases ( Juliet with tuberculosis and Pauline with poliomyelitis)they both enjoy operas and have a lot of creativity. Pauline starts to like Juliet's lifestyle and nice warm family, the life of a upper class where they have freedom to go out together to movie theaters and at the beach (different from her mother Honorah, who was always annoying her,and making her help washing the dishes,cleaning the house and help in the pension). Juliet for the other hand, a pretty and intelligent girl,liked the way Pauline was always giving attention to her and her stories, besides being always there for Juliet,giving her a support.(different from her family, who were always traveling for many places and letting her alone. In her childhood during the war, Juliet says that she was sent to a hospital in the Bahamas to take care of her tuberculosis, being 5 years without seeing her entire family!) Their friendship becomes even stronger and they were so immersed into each other that it became impossible for them to imagine their existence without the other's presence.But some problems starts to begin: Juliet stay sick again with tuberculosis, making the girls being distant. Juliet's dad and mom are going to get a divorce. Dr. Henry Hulme starts to notice how close his daughter and Pauline were,with intimacies like sharing the same bed, taking bath together and being closed in the room all the time with their stories and ideas. Pauline's mother Honorah was worried as well, even taking Pauline to a psychologist, where she is analyzed with homosexuality.Then, life for them turns into a hell, with Honorah always fighting and arguing with Pauline ,not letting her stay too close to Juliet, and this one, for the other hand, needing to be sent to south Africa because of the tuberculosis. Afraid of their separation, the story has a tragic and sad ending, with both girls killing Honorah (who in their imagination was the 'problem'to be solved. Pauline thinks that if she kills her mother,she can go with Juliet to South Africa) and going to the jail, where they could never see each other again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great, understated, enthralling drama, based on a true story.A few years before Peter Jackson sold out and started making 9-hour 3-part fantasy movies for kids and nerds, he made this great drama, which is still, to date, his best film.Set in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 1953-54, the movie tells the story of two friends, schoolgirls with incredible imaginations. This, and their friendship, shapes their lives, and the lives of those around them, though, ultimately, not in a pleasant way.Great build-up by Jackson. You see the relationship between the girls develop, and how their imaginations grow more and more active, blurring the lines between reality and fiction. Quite funny at times too.Superb performances by Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskey in the lead roles. Winslet was only 18 at the time and this was her first cinematic role. She is fantastic - her exuberance and funny-yet- nonchalant antics are a sight to behold.Good supporting cast too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Heavenly Creatures is Peter Jackson's (of The Lord of the Rings fame) BEST film! Before Mr. Jackson was a multi (3 of em!) Academy Award winning filmmaker he was already an Oscar nominee for this movie.Heavenly Creatures is a very small independent New Zealand film that few outside of the movie meccas of Los Angeles and New York City saw, knew about, or had access to upon its original release in 1994.Heavenly Creatures contains very-grim, difficult subject matter that is perhaps all-the-more troublesome because it was based on a startling 1954, real-life event. It is a compelling, mesmerizing, bone-chilling, stunning and astonishing piece of film that I must say is one of the best I have ever seen (and I have seen A LOT of movies). The film is about two highly imaginative and intelligent teenage girls, Pauline Parker and Juliet Hulme played by two actresses making their glorious feature film debuts: the great Melanie Lynskey (Up In the Air, Sweet Home Alabama, Ever After) and a sensational Kate Winslet (Titanic, Sense &amp; Sensibility, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind) in two captivating, stars-are-born performances whose intense, potent friendship draws deep concern from both sets of parents (and for good reason ... ask Mrs. Parker!).The girls saw themselves as "heavenly creatures" who, alone, were able to enter into a magical realm -- the Fourth World -- populated by beings (Kings, Queens, Princes, roguish knaves and giant butterflies) of their own creation. New Zealand was shocked and stunned by what came from this friendship that was going to be terminated as Juliet was going to be forced to leave Christchurch, New Zealand (with her father) and live with relatives in South Africa (as he returned to their native England). Actual diary entries of Pauline's help construct and recreate the horrific sequence of events that lead to the gruesome climax of the film that takes place in a peaceful and serene Christchurch city park.The scene is both visually and audibly unforgettable as it is a beautifully sequenced/choreographed descent (in more ways than one) into a park valley by three individuals that is scored by Puccini's slow and innocent, beautifully enchanting "The Humming Chorus" that hypnotizes the viewer until it is marred by a crunch/thud, some blood-curdling groans and several more crushing shrieks! And, again ... this is ALL based upon true, actual events! I have never seen a film like this before (it is beautiful, imaginative, grisly, unsettling and dark) -- and it is awe-inspiring (at the artistic-level) knowing of the talent found in front of and behind the camera. Heavenly Creatures is a divine 42 out of 10.It is most definitely NOT a movie for all audiences; but for those who enjoy film (REAL film lovers) it must not be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on the murder of Honora Parker and her daughter's diary, 'Heavenly Creatures' tells the harrowing story of two teenagers, Juliet Hulme and Pauline Parker Rieper. It's a character driven film that starts off with Pauline as an odd teenager who's a bit of a social outcast. Enters a new English student who's vivacious, funny, creative and 'gets' Pauline. This marks the start of a friendship that turns into a disturbing bond leading to tragic consequences. The story stays focused on these two key characters, delving into their psyche while also showing how their relationship with others affect them. The voice-over is a brilliant touch as those are read from the real diary, adding some authenticity, while providing further insight into the girl's mind.Peter Jackson has been known to be a very imaginative director and he beautifully uses his imagination in this film, especially in the fantasy sequences of the teenagers. 'Heavenly Creatures' was made before the CGI revolution and yet the fantasy scenes look so surreal. In addition, the excellent cinematography and score help set up the atmosphere. Jackson has always been fond of his country and once again he has captured the natural beauty of New Zealand effectively.Melanie Lynskey and Kate Winslet are terrific in their very first performances. They bring a certain freshness and sincerity (as they themselves were teenagers at the time) in the way they play their characters. They are supported by a strong cast of actors, especially Sarah Peirse.'Heavenly Creatures' is vintage Peter Jackson before the 'Lord of the Rings' buzz. As stunning as it is to look at, it's not an easy film to watch but certainly a worthy one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was both really shocked and mesmerized at this film. The film is sort of an open-minded story about a real-life event, told in a fantasy genre. Peter Jackson's direction is simply phenomenal. The way he tells this story, he does not want it to be a regular thriller, or fantasy, he lingers in both. He manages to create a sort of scary, yet beautiful account of this event. The way he captures the girls' imaginations on screen is simply spellbinding. The characters themselves are brought to life so effortlessly, so magically realized, thanks to the magnificent screenplay. Melanie Lynskey and Kate Winslet are so great together. Their chemistry, their power together, it is so well captured. But it is Kate Winslet who shines more. This was her first big movie role, and I believe it is what started her amazing movie career. She is simply magnificent. She steals every scene she is in. She was robbed of an Oscar nomination for sure. The cinematography of the film is also what caught my eye. The camera-work is done differently than other films. It is so magnificent though, but it might annoy some people who like 'steady' shots. Overall, I cannot really out into words how extraordinary this film is. It is enough just to see it. It is probably one of the most memorable films of 90s. One of the most haunting. It is a must-see, and probably Peter Jackson's masterpiece(It is altogether more affecting than the Lord of the Rings)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>powerful depiction of increasingly delusional teenage friendship</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Heavenly Creatures" is the film that brought Peter Jackson his most mainstream acclaim before a suite of little films which you may have heard of, "The Lord of the Rings". It's the story of teenagers Juliet Hulme (capably played by Kate Winslet) and Pauline Parker (expertly played by Melissa Lynskey) who became increasingly close and created a virtual world in which they seemed increasingly involved. Their detachment from reality culminated finally in the murder of Parker's mother, a hard-working housewife (thoughtfully and sensitively played by Sarah Peirse) who was very concerned about her middle child's increasing involvement in an all-encompassing, baffling relationship with Hulme. The acting here, most especially from Lynskey and Peirse, is very good. It is difficult to ground oneself as a real person in such a fantastic case, but Peirse and Lynskey, as well as Winslet do that expertly. Lynskey's Pauline is the quieter and more pliant, to outward appearances, of the two girls. Lynskey captures Pauline's introversion with body language that conveys the fact that there is a lot going on inside her, but that she doesn't feel comfortable talking about it. Peirse plays her mother Honora, and like any mother of a fourteen or fifteen-year-old girl, she casts about for ways to remain connected to her while also allowing the girl to become an individual. Peirse's Honora seems very decent, hard- working, and concerned about her daughter. However, she is also aware, at a deep level, that something is not right with her daughter and her relationship with Hulme. However, it seemed to me that because she is less-educated than Hulme that she could not articulate the nature of her concerns as well as the Hulmes could have done (but did not). Winslet is also excellent as the more outgoing and seemingly more well-adjusted of the two girls. She is the leader, the girl who would be blamed for kids' exploits, because she would be the one to lead the way. However, in spite of Juliet's outward vivacity, when she is left by her parents to receive treatment for tuberculosis while they go to England for a conference, the depth of her pain seems deep. Her parents do not recognize this and it seems to me this is one of the biggest reasons for this tragedy. In reading the comments, this does not seem to have been widely addressed as a cause of the tragedy, but to me it seems clear. Juliet, for all her outward bravado, is still a child and obviously needs a lot of attention, or at least quite a bit more than her parents give her. Her mother (well-played by Diana Kent), a psychotherapist who believes that the vast majority of problems will work themselves out, does not recognize the exception to this (questionable) rule going on right beneath her nose. This (wilful) ignorance might have cost Honora her life. Her husband Henry (played well by Clive Merrison) is an academic whose professional obligations keep him from seeing what is going so desperately wrong with his daughter. Both the Hulmes, it seemed to me, bore more responsibility for the girls' rapidly increasing separation from reality. They both had more professional expertise which could have enabled more plausibly, their intervention in this tragic situation. That said, that is not to excessively blame the Hulmes over the Parkers but simply to point out that the Hulmes might have had some of the tools necessary to address the particular challenges which the girls had created via their fantasy world. Peter Jackson's imagination, as revealed in his direction of some wryly self-aware splatterfests, could well be a significant reason why he got this job. He recognized the power of imagination, whether used for good or ill. His performance on this movie is almost certainly the main reason he was entrusted to bring the "Lord of the Rings" books to the screen. The girls conjure up a world with its own religious traditions, monarchy, mores, ancestry, and regional rivalries. Jackson, while the girls become increasingly detached from reality, depicts the world in terms of their alternate reality, rather than what is actually happening around them. The merging of fantasy and reality is very skillfully depicted. Jackson deserves a lot of credit for not allowing such a fantastic story to dominate the direction of the film. He expertly balances the growing friendship of the girls, the relevant elements of their lives with their families, and the efforts that both families made to address the problem, as they understood it. In the movie, as the girls get further and further removed from reality, whether they know it or not, their fantasy world is increasingly depicted by Jackson and his staff as the site of much of the action. The subtle way in which the fantasy world is increasingly the location of action, at least as seen through the girls' eyes, is perhaps Jackson's great accomplishment. He definitely deserves a lot of credit for envisioning a story in which such a graphic action is the centerpoint but yet grounding the film, still, in a tragic, recognizable reality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Teenage soul mates Pauline (Melanie Lynskey) and Juliet (Kate Winslet) live in a world all their own. But this world is under constant siege from adults interfering with their increasingly somber whims and vagaries. The girls find themselves stalked by faceless demons and clay-clad monsters; we never really learn whether it's all just inside their heads. Orson Welles haunts their life like a ghost, risen from the dead partly by way of vintage footage inter-cut with Jackson's own material, Carl Reiner style. But "Heavenly Creatures" provides entirely unexpected thrills well beyond its unique cinematography and editing. Anything but mere child's play, the plot (based on a true story) is as engaging as it is unsettling. More than a decade after its original release, it also provides an opportunity to travel back in time and witness Kate Winslet's big-screen debut in one of the finer samples of Peter Jackson's work. Her spirited performance helps you forget the truckloads of crap she has appeared in since, and makes you want to revisit "Eternal Sunshine" or "Romance &amp; Cigarettes". Seen with your kids, "Heavenly Creatures" might even help you bridge the gap in time and imagination when you had thought they were lost to you forever. Notable guest appearances by Stephen Reilly as Mario Lanza and Jean Guerin as Orson Welles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Heavenly Creatures is one of the most fascinating films I've seen in a long time. The story is unique, to say the least. It's the true story of two girls, Pauline Parker(Melanie Lynskey) and Juliet Hulme(Kate Winslet) who have an unusual, obsessive relationship to the point where they're rumored to be lesbian and get broken up by their parents, enraged they decide to get back at them.What's interesting to me about this movie is how ambiguous it is. There's very little that actually gets explained directly to the audience. Sure, the logical reason they killed Parker's mother is because they didn't want to be broken up but their psychological reasonings are never really explained. In fact, this is one of the hardest reviews for me to write because it's so unique and open to interpretation but I'll try my best.I think the question this movie is trying to raise is should you listen to what society says or should you be who you really are. We don't see every bit of their lives but I assume that these girls prior meeting each other were social outcasts and loners and in a way, these girls were made for each other. They bond with each other extremely well because they're both highly imaginative, curious girls who have never been allowed to show who they really were because of the rules society had back then for how girls should behave. So when they hang out together, it's like they are freeing themselves of society's rules and entering their own world of storytelling, Mario Lanza(a tenor they idolize), and imagination. But their bond may have been too strong for each other because there was very few girls like them so they end up obsessing over one another to the point where the parents feel this relationship is unhealthy and decide to split them. But the film never really tells us whether or not, these parents are doing the right thing. It's all up to the viewer. Later on, the girls start planning out their murder and when it happens, it's one of the most disturbing murders ever filmed in my opinion. It isn't disturbing just because of how violent it is but more so because of how personal this murder is. They didn't do it to some stranger for money, they did it to someone they knew for a long time out of anger and frustration! And there's a moment where you see how Parker really regrets going with this decision, when she first strikes her mother with the brick, she starts tearing up. I read somewhere she didn't shed a tear in real life but that was a brilliant decision on Jackson's part as director and it adds a lot of nuance to her character.I think Jackson's directing feels a little too artsy in some scenes. He made this after making low-budget horror-comedy films like Bad Taste and Braindead and I think with this film, he was really trying to establish himself as a serious dramatic director but some scenes do feel unnecessarily artsy.But the thing the movie gets perfect is the two girls. Not only are they acted excellently, but they have a lot of dimension. It could have been easy for Jackson just to make them misunderstood, innocent people and while they seem to be like that in the first half, they also are portrayed as extremely sensitive and perhaps maybe a little mad. But once again, the film doesn't tell us how to feel about them, it lets us decide on our own.Another thing I appreciate is the camera-work. Sam Raimi's been listed on Wikipedia as one of his influences in filmmaking and it shows here because of the way he shoots his scenes and it looks excellent. Sadly though, his later films had abandoned this style of camera-work.Overall, while Jackson's direction can seem a little too artsy at times, the film is wonderfully-acted, well-shot, and beautifully ambiguous so I'm gonna give it a 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shocking friendship.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Jackson directs this film based on the true story of two young teens that carried out the most notorious murder in New Zealand history. HEAVENLY CREATURES is based on the diaries of Pauline Rieper Parker(Melanie Lynskey)a 16-year old school girl that enters a very strong friendship with new classmate 15-year old Juliet Hulme(Kate Winslet). The two have a relationship that probably blurs the borderline of obsession; constantly together and creating a fantasy world in which they believed to live. There were intimations of insanity and the most shocking...lesbianism. The girls planned and carried out the bludgeoning of Pauline's mother(Sarah Peirse); proving to stop at nothing to protect their friendship.This comes very early in the careers of Jackson and Winslet. It is the introduction of Lynskey that draws the most attention. The two girls between scenes and throughout the shooting of the film would interact with each other as their characters. Lynskey is better known currently for playing Rose on TV's Two and Half Men series starring Charlie Sheen. When comparing with research of the actual murder in 1954, this film is very dead on(no pun intended). And it is uncanny how the young Lynskey resembled Pauline. In supporting roles are: Diana Kent, Clive Merrison and Simon O'Connor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stark, vivid and harrowing; all the more unsettling through its honest emotional empathy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is an odd societal catharsis film viewers seem to achieve through the billing "based on a true story", as if by watching the cinematic re-creation of emotionally raw subject matter, further truth may be extracted from the circumstances or social closure may be obtained. This theory becomes skewed by the average cinematic use of the term, as many Hollywood productions simply take the "true events" tag as a framework for mainstream exploitation of real tragedies for entertainment purposes. But then there are films like Peter Jackson's Heavenly Creatures, which take potentially combustive subject matter, and rather than exploiting it for sensationalist entertainment, actually make a genuine attempt to mine the situation for emotional truth and nuance, taking a gruesome tragedy and turning it into a transcendent emotional portrait, all the more astonishing in the process. While Heavenly Creatures might have ended up a routinely melodramatic albeit morbid thriller, the endless innovations and quirks of director Peter Jackson transform the unsettling story into something infinitely more compelling. Unlike the majority of such cinematic murder mysteries, geared around cheap shocks and a consistently building sense of tension, Jackson's film is a true rarity through his willingness to allow the viewer to enter into the minds of his protagonists, sharing their dreamlike euphoria and hysteric fantasy world. What makes Heavenly Creatures truly eerie and unsettling is the intoxicating sense of delirious happiness throughout, evoking discomfort not from overly contrived ominous foreshadowing but from aligning the viewer with the characters depicted (with unsettling use of extracts from the diary entries of the real life Pauline), demonstrating their mental fragility in a compassionate but uncomfortably credible fashion, making the abrupt shift to visceral realism and violence all the more jarring and emotionally devastating. The uneasy immersion is aided by the enormous amount of care and attention devoted to visualizing the girls' fantasy world, exquisitely realized by pre-Lord of the Rings fame Weta workshop's brilliant character and set design, making a realm of 'clay people' come alive with commendable humanity and immediacy, while never abandoning the fantastic trappings, powerfully backed by the soaring musical score of Peter Dasent. Such attention to detail and moments of welcome humour (the girls' strange fixation with Orson Welles) makes empathy with characters who could have been dismissed as a pair of deranged psychotics in the hands of a less sensitive director becomes not only possible but almost inescapable. Jackson contrasts the relationship between the two girls with his candid portrait of repressive 1950s New Zealand, revelling in the delights of a much needed friendship fraught with honest emotion and imagination (while leaving ambiguous overtones as to the proximity of their relationship), before subtly increasing the tension, transposing the intensity from joyful to uncomfortable and subsequently manipulating the viewer's emotions to a disconcerting degree. The remarkable premise is truly brought to life by the astonishing performances of the two leads, both making their motion picture debuts, yet delivering more disturbingly powerful performances than most critically acclaimed actresses twice their age. The utter humanity both coax into their roles despite the sinister overtones makes the viewer's heart break, seeing the two not as monsters but as tragically mislead adolescents grasping desperately for companionship but getting carried away. As Pauline, Melanie Lynskey gives a performance of vastly further complexity, breadth and believability than the average cinematic social misfit child, her softly wounded expression hinting at the turmoil underneath and her diary voiceovers are truly stunning and chilling. Kate Winslet is similarly stunning as Juliet, her slow transition from defiant rich girl to being hysterically transfixed by her fantasy world is a truly masterful one, hinting at the superb performances yet to come. Sarah Peirse also delivers a fantastic performance as Pauline's compassionate yet traditionally repressive mother, and Peirse thankfully resists the temptation to make her character an outright villain but merely an honest human being bound by social conventions and concern for her daughter.Few films striving at such daring aims as Heavenly Creatures are met with such success: not quite a biopic and hardly a murder mystery, but more of an honest portrait of a genuine friendship between two lost souls, whose intensity grows to potentially out of hand dimensions, all the while refusing to sensationalize the inevitable tragedy. Fuelled by the simply stunning performances of the two promising young actresses and Jackson's quirkily irrelevant yet vividly accurate direction, the film proves a perfect example of masterfully wrenching emotional storytelling, one worth examining for any in search of a draining yet fundamentally human drama.-9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So Brilliantly Clever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie really brings back the memories of NZ in the 1950's. The case caused a furore in the newspapers (tv was years away). In our house the descriptions of the trial were removed from the paper before the young teenagers in the house could read them and learn of such perverse goings on, and it was not really until I attended University in Christchurch in the sixties, that I became familiar with the case. At some stage most students took the trip to Victoria Park to " see where it happened".Peter Jackson has bought it all back brilliantly, from the portrayal of the Girls' High School at the start, in the contrast between the homes of the two girls, to the fatal outing.Am adding to this review (2011) as I have just read the newly published book, So Brilliantly Clever (a a quote from Pauline's diary) by Peter Graham, which adds a great deal of background to the story, as well as revealing what happened later to both girls. For fans, a great read and answers a lot of questions. Rather disturbing too to read of the girls' smirking &amp; giggling through the court proceedings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Modern Classic From Peter Jackson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After making a big impression on the horror genre with early gross-out splatter-comedies like 'Bad Taste' and 'Braindead' ('Dead Alive' USA), Peter Jackson's first step towards mainstream success was a major achievement, and probably one of the best independent films of the Nineties. Set in Christchurch, New Zealand in the 1950s, it tells the true-life story of two teenage girls ? Pauline Parker (Melanie Lynskey) and Juliet Hulme (Kate Winslet) ? who form a dangerously obsessive relationship that ultimately leads to a shocking and tragic conclusion.Not only was this a major turning point for director Jackson, it also introduced cinema-goers to the talents of the beautiful Kate Winslet, who impresses in her big-screen debut. The cast is uniformly impressive, however, with the relatively unknown Melanie Lynskey giving an outstanding performance in the central role. The direction and pace of the film ensure that the interest is sustained throughout, with many funny moments in the early scenes, and as the two girls immerse themselves in a world of fantasy and make-believe, Jackson creates a fairytale world, filling the screen with surreal and hallucinatory images. Although the film has always been acclaimed by critics, it went largely unnoticed by mainstream audiences on its release, possibly due to the more 'arthouse' qualities of the film, and the lack of big name stars. If you haven't seen it, however, I urge you to do so - forthwith! Balancing moments of comedy, drama, fantasy and, ultimately, shocking and brutal violence, this is one of the most satisfying movie experiences one could ask for. Truly, a modern classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exquisite, Disturbing, Painful Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those movies which is impossible to write spoilers for, because the events are based on a true event, yet the scenes as filmed elude easy description.It is important before viewing this to realize that this is based on the true story of the obsessive love of two young girls in New Zealand whose obsession leads them to murder. What must have fascinated the director was HOW two young girls so long ago could commit such a monstrous crime, and justify it in the name of love. The director proceeds to fascinate us with what must have gone inside the heads of these two as they discovered love, passion, fear, and a growing desperation that led them to commit this ultimately senseless and pointless crime. The most fascinating and frightening part of the movie is the imaginary world these girls create for themselves, that carries them further and further away from reality, as they come to rationalize any behavior in the name of their love for each other. The movie is a love story that turns into a tragedy, and proves in the classic Greek tradition that the worst tragedies are the ones that we create for ourselves. Describing the movie would be pointless. It is a visual wonder as the man allows us inside the heads of, and even to feel the intense passions of, two 16 year-old girls whose pure love leads to a heinous crime; that innocent love can turn into obsessive passion, and lead to an unspeakable act that will ultimately destroy that love, is the most disturbing element of the film and has stayed with me since seeing it. This is an absolute must-see for any lover of thoughtful cinema. You will never think of love in the same way again. Nine out of ten stars.P.S. I had to look up the real-life girls who the movie is based on; they are NOT like the two girls in the movie! If you do a search based on their name you will find them, and their appearance is very interesting; one looks like a sweet-natured, ahem, airhead, and the other is so masculine, down to hair and clothing, I thought I had made a mistake and looked up the wrong name. I would never want to cross paths with this girl, and I am a pretty big guy! Eerie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Heavenly Creatures" is a movie about two completely insane girls, brilliantly played by Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskey. The story is truly amazing. It's unbelievable that two girls can make up such a world and really start living this imaginary lives..The directing was also very good and the music was excellently chosen. When they were about to kill Pauline's mother, the two girls weren't the only ones who became a bit nervous, I was completely nervous too.Both actresses and Peter Jackson did an excellent job and delivered a movie who really brings you into the fantasy world of the girls. Peter Jackson and Kate Winslet have afterwards proved many other times that this movie wasn't a coincidence and that they are both very talented.This movie is really worth seeing. If you should read a story like this somewhere, you just wouldn't believe it, but this movie really makes you understand how such things can happen in real life. You really see Pauline changing through the story caused by the influence of Juliet. Really amazing movie. A must see! 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Incredibly Shocking Film About the Development From Normal Person To Killer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***1/2 out of ****Two girls come running out of the forest screaming and drenched in blood. The reason why is because they just committed a murder. This is the start of the film. From there on, the film flashes back to when the girls first meet. They start an intense relationship with each other. They become too obsessive over each other and their relationship. When someone tries to separate them, they decide to destroy the person.Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskey make unforgettable performances as the two girls who are obsessive over each other. The film suggests a lesbian relationship, but I don't really think this is the true case. These two girls obviously really admire each other, and even if they were lesbians, everybody would react the same way because it's a creepy situation. The film is very much worth watching.Peter Jackson, director of some of the goriest films ever made such as BAD TASTE, BRAINDEAD, and, one of my favorites, MEET THE FEEBLES, has done a wonderful job of bring the two girls fantasy lives to life. Do watch this film. Even though it is really creepy and disturbing, it is highly worth watching. This is the kind of movie that everyone should see at some point in their life, preferably when you're young.Rated R for violence and sexual content</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Juliet and Pauline are two girls that become very good friends in a brief period of time, and I couldn't, exactly, understand why. Winslet's character is an arrogant teenager that enjoys being seen as the smartest one. Pauline, on the other hand, seems to be some ordinary girl with some strong anger towards her parents, and the plot never really reveals the reason for it. She's also a naive girl when it comes to sex, which can be noticed in the scenes she shares with an older boy. Even thought a lot of people considered it to be a great film, I didn't like it that much. In my opinion, the plot is too slow and contrived, reason why I felt bored during almost all the way through. However, I'm gonna admit that the final scenes are surprisingly intense and hard to be seen, but that's the only "great" moment in the whole picture. "Titanic" was really a better choice for Kate Winslet...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing . . . but brilliant.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forgive my ignorance but when I saw 'Heavenly Creatures' I had no idea that it was based on a true account. I guess that says something for the movie, which is pretty much able stand on it's own.The story (as I researched later) is based on a murder that took place in New Zealand in 1952 as Pauline Parker and Juliet Hulme bashed in the head of Pauline's mother after the threat of being separated became imminent.What leads these girls to such a brutal act is the focus of Peter Jackson's stunning film about two personalities that connect in a world that isn't comfortable with their closeness. Pauline (Melanie Lynskey) is frumpy, sour and hides behind her black unruly hair and permanent scowl. She meets Juliette (Kate Winslet) and is captivated by this pretty, outgoing girl who giggles hysterically, she smiles brightly and seems to understand her isolation. Both lead boring, emotionally confused lives going to Christchurch school but eventually find in each other a comfortable escape.The girls have everything in common not the least of which is a crush on Mario Lanza. They create for themselves a Camelot-like world, a world of kings and knights and romantic adventures. The special effects make this imaginary world a captivating place from which they escape the staleness of their lives. It allows Jackson to take us into this world to show us that this is a relationship built on mutual attraction of soulmates. To an outsider this could be misconstrued as lesbianism and thus begins the problem.Adults begin to suspect that the two are spending far too much time together, that their relationship has become 'unhealthy'. This is a time and place in which homosexuality is a hushed word spoken in a whisper. The suggestion is made that separating them would be the best thing.Pauline and Juliette are so intoxicated by one another that the thought of being separated would be devastating. Then, they begin to plan and carry out the murder. The irony, we guess, is that the girls were less of a threat before the adults began to intervene.What would be so addictive about their world that they would be willing to kill for it? Even Hulme doesn't really know. Around the time of the release of this film it was found that Hulme was living and writing novels under the name Anne Perry. In interviews she seems as baffled as we are.'Heavenly Creatures' is the kind of movie the people discuss in the same vein that they discuss the Columbine tragedy. What kind of maladjustments and emotional crippling leads people to commit murder? What was it, in the bond Pauline and Juliette that was worth protecting? The movie thinks it knows but leaves enough open for us to interpret.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Force of Nature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the age of 33, before the Hollywood calling, Peter Jackson has already presented the world a fundamentally riveting piece of work in his homeland New Zealand, HEAVENLY CREATURES, an intricate retelling of a horrendous matricide case based on a real story in 1950s, and the felons are two adolescent girls. It is a "too friendly" relationship between two schoolgirls albeit their very different background, Paulie (Lynskey) is from a lower class, always sulky and socially outcast, while Juliet (Winslet) is from a British middle class (her father is a college professor and mother is a marriage counselor) with a free-spirited soul, but they share the same pursuit and chimera, the idolatry of Mario Lanza and the aversion of Orson Welles, revel in their fantasies of the Fourth World with plasticine-made characters inhabit in the storybook Borovnia, they become inseparable and any force to tear them apart will stir up trouble which turns out to be lethal and kamikaze.Frenetically shot in the opening sequences, the bloodstained faces of Paulie and Juliet predestine the shocking value of the sordid ending, but runs in parallel is their blithe chasing and cavorting in their most joyful days, they develop a borderline sapphic relationship, but the story doesn't necessarily hinge on their " unwholesome" sexuality, in fact, it is way more complicated than sex appeal, the intimate connection between those two girls is a godsend, a telepathic ability which only can be communicated between them, thus anyone else is shut out from their world, and eventually Paulie's mother (Peirse) will fall prey to their delusive freedom. The film is both Lynskey and Winslet's big screen debut, the former recently got a BREAKTHROUGH AWARD nomination in Gotham Awards for HELLO I MUST BE GOING 2012, which is such a laughingstock since her debut work here is a tremendous force of nature and one of the most challenging role for her age, rebelling with a cause, Lynskey competently demonstrates both the evil and the compassionate sides of Paulie. Kinslet is also great, Juliet's superior tone aside, she is a spoiled flower trapped in a dysfunctional family, only when they are together, they can evade the rotten and tedious reality and enjoy the true happiness. The supporting cast is well-selected, most of them are caricatured (i.e. Merrison's pedantic father of Juliet), but Peirse casts a varnish of self-involvement to her otherwise pedestrian role of a nagging-mother- turned-innocent-victim. But it is Peter Jackson, whose expansive imagination works wonders here, one can feasibly detect his predilection to fictitious creations and gory violence, with the aid of DP Alun Bollinger, HEAVENLY CREATURES presents itself as a high-end paradigm of blending drama with surreal constituent, a bona-fide cinematic gem should not be overlooked.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Haunting Stories Are the True Ones</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Jackson's Heavenly Creatures is haunting, disturbing and uncomfortable. It's the best thing Jackson has ever done and it sits with you for quite a while. After completing the film, I feel immensely uncomfortable and just can't stop thinking about it. The film tells the story of Juliet Hulme (Kate Winslet) and Pauline Parker (Melanie Lynskey) who murdered Pauline's mother with a brick placed in a stocking. During the film, tension builds and the atmosphere slowly becomes an incredibly uncomfortable one.The performances from the two leads are incredible. We see Lynskey slowly become mad. She is already a bit of an outcast, but Pauline slowly turns insane. She's obsessed and vengeful, she can't wait to rid herself of her overprotective mother. Winslet's performance is the best she's ever done. On the exterior she is a very cheerful person, full of life. However when you get past her loud, cheerful and imaginative side, you see a person who is depressed, dark and seeking her parents approval and attention. Together, Juliet and Pauline may seem like polar opposites, but they are two of the same. Both Lynskey and Winslet craft such wonderful performances, it's actually kind of surprising that this was the first film for each of them.Jackson's direction is tremendous. It's by far his best work and it seems to be his most effortless. He crafts a film that many directors would overdo, he never does. The script is along the same lines, every piece of dialogue is perfectly placed. It helped having actual lines from Parker's diary, it definitely made the film more haunting. Hearing the actual diary entries made the film all that more uncomfortable to watch.The murder scene was one of the most haunting and disturbing scenes that I have ever seen. Honora Parker's scream was bone chilling and I at times wanted to look away. It was a tremendous, but at the same time disturbing sight to see.It's a perfect film, I highly recommend it.10/10</fullReview>

Their bond is so strong, that when separated, they become physically ill. It is the saddest movie i have ever watched and ironically, their biggest fear becomes a reality: They murder the mother because they want to get rid of whoever it is that separates them, and their punishment is exactly that: separation from each other. I have read some of your comments about banning Anne Perry and I think that that's really stupid. The best artists and writers create out of pain and one must not judge her talents due to a bad decision that she had made when she was in a fragile state of mind. The point of the movie was to convey this relationship, this bond that was misunderstood by the girls' family and what such a misunderstanding and in acceptance of such love could lead to. You are doing just that, judging without understanding, knowing and feeling their pain. Besides, the girls got the worst punishment imaginable to them - they were separated...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peter Jackson's Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those films which warrants multiple viewings, and not just because it as an excellent film, but because you will be so immersed into the story at first viewing, that you really need more viewings to see all that Peter Jackson has done here.First off, Peter Jackson, make no mistake, is genius. He won well-deserved praise for LOTR, partly because it was such a mammoth undertaking, but many people do not know he was nominated for an Oscar previously with Fran Walsh for the Heavenly Creatures screenplay. This film was quite a departure for him at the time, and that is important considering how completely effective the film is.There will always be people who don't understand Heavenly Creatures, and also those who take issue with some of its thematic elements, but one must remember how dedicated Peter Jackson was to capturing the truth about what really went on between these two girls. He lets Pauline's diary entries do the talking and constructs the film around them. Minimizing the movie to being about lesbianism or murder does not do it justice. This movie is about a bond formed between two wounded children that grew into something so intense that it moved beyond all borders of reality. If you are one of the lucky people who understand this movie, when it ends you will feel as though you have been immersed into another world and emerged feeling disturbed, saddened, and exhilarated.This film made me a lifelong devotee of both Melanie Lynskey and Kate Winslet, as well as Peter Jackson, and although Lord of the Rings was a masterwork, I still consider Heavenly Creatures to be Peter Jackson's masterpiece. It remains one of my all time favorite films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie really shows up Hollywood on how to make a truly riveting movie. Unlike their standard fare, there are no black and white characters here, even though the movie deals with a horrible murder. This movie manages to evoke sympathy for the victim as well as the perpetrators of the crime. It's based on a true story that shook New Zealand in the 50's about two teenage girls, Pauline Rieper and Juliet Hulme, who kill Pauline's mother.The acting is some of the best I've seen. A lot of well deserved praise has been heaped on Melanie Lynskey and Kate Winslet as Pauline and Juliet, but my standout was Sarah Peirse as Honora Parker, who portrays the role of Pauline's mother beautifully. She gives the character just the right amount of desperation and despair as she completely runs out of ideas about what to do with Pauline.The visuals are stunning too, this movie is incredibly beautiful to look at. Particularly when the girls escape to their fantasy world, a world where knights and kings rule and the clay figurines that they model throughout the movie come to live.Hard to believe that this is the same Peter Jackson who made trashy (but incredibly good fun) movies like Bad Taste and Braindead or the Michael J. Fox vehicle The Frighteners.Heavenly Creatures got an Oscar nomination for best original screenplay which is a real shame, because it means that enough people at the academy saw it but it still didn't receive enough votes to get either one of the nominations it would have deserved. Certainly the best actress for either Lynskey or Winslet, best supporting actress for Peirse as well as direction and film for Jackson would have been well deserved.It remains one of my all time favourite movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very few movies have stayed with me, night after night, haunting my mind and invading my nightmares. This is one of them.After viewing the movie, I felt very compelled to research it on the internet, to find everything I could about the real story and compare it. The accuracy is absolutely amazing! I have never seen a movie so true to the facts. From the accents, to the pink gemstone, to shooting everything exactly where it took place, even in the girls' old classroom right down to the seating arrangements. The only scene not shot that way was the murder scene, which was done 100 yards down the road because the director found it disturbing to shoot there. It is easy to get swept up with the girls in their fantasy world. They seem so innocent and enchanting, it's almost impossible to see the horror coming that they caused.I find it interesting that Juliet Hulme (now Anne Perry) joined the Mormon church after her jail sentence. The religion is filled with fantasy, gods and goddesses, and various kingdoms of heaven. This is still very fitting of her personality.You will be hard pressed to find such an intense bond between two girls in any movie, although it is frightening and unhinging to watch. I had to rate this a 10.</fullReview>

The two girls in this film live in their own little world together. And the more time they spend together, the further away they drift from society. It's as if they're mutually-schizophrenic. They create a fantasy world of their own in which they're the only ones aloud to enter. They would sometimes walk around seeing unicorns and medieval castles as if they're actually there. This movie reminds us of how people behave differently when they are together, and how they would do things that they could only do with the back-up of each others confidence. Each of the girls is nothing when she is by herself, but when they're together they're stronger. We realize that when two people are the perfect soulmates, they could live inside each others' mind. In this case, they fit together so well that they act like one unit when they're together. Kinda like Beavis and Butthead, who are like one person altogether. .....HEAVENLY CREATURES is the perfect love story!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strange, absorbing movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Heavenly Creatures drew me helplessly into the fantasy world of its two adolescent protagonists. Many of the fantasies are things that anyone with a memory of being young will recognize, at least generically. But when the fantasy world starts taking control of the girls lives and then turns murderous, the fun turns to horror and the slightly crazy coming-of-age story ends in violent insanity. What makes the movie so good is that it is meticulously made. It is absolutely believable. Look at the girls' dream-world one way and it's ingenious fun; look at it another way, and it's madness. There isn't even the proverbial "fine line": you realize that the two are one and the same.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A complex, textured film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Heavenly Creatures is a wonderfully textured work. It attempts to make the lives of these two troubled girls come alive, and it succeeds -- through practically everything cinema can offer: wonderful screenplay and dialogue, great use of sound and music, 3-d animation, precise and moving acting, and more.Some have said it's a violent film, but there is only one scene of true violence -- at the very end. The rest of the movie attempts to get us to inhabit the world that lead to that act. It manages to be moving and beautiful along the way ... until we are faced with the horrific consequences.I've never read The Hobbitt or other Tolkien books (and have an aversion to that fantasy stuff), but the fact that Peter Jackson, who made this movie, is making the Lord of the Rings series makes me think they may actually be worth watching. (Written in Jan 2001, long before the first of these LOTR films are completed.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That's my personal opinion, of course. It might seem exaggerated given the fact that it hasn't made it to many of those "top 100" films of the century that critics all over the world have been compiling. But from other comments in this section, it seems that other people out there share this view. So there's little I can add, I just wanted to say that this magical, tragical tale marvels me more every time I see it, and that I believe that it is for Works of Art of this magnitude that cinema was invented for. It takes you along with the girls in their descent to madness with such compelling passion and energy that you are willing to believe that they are not mad at all, but have really reached that utopian higher state of consciousness and pure unrestrained devotion for another person, regardless of sex, that eludes the rest of us mortals. Whatever Peter Jackson does the rest of his life, Lord of the Rings and all, for this film only he already deserves a place among the Greats.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THIS IS THE ONE...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are greater movies than "Heavenly Creatures", but this is my all-time favourite. Why? Perhaps because I discovered it for myself when it was first released, and saw it without any preconceived baggage. I love this film unconditionally, for it's invention, it's imagination and a million other reasons. Kate Winslet's best performance(she is magnificent, but Melanie Lynskey is astonishing; the whole film hangs on the credibility of her portrayal of Pauline), Jackson's depiction of the Fourth World, the knowledge that you're rooting for people who are going to do something unspeakably awful, and of course the joyous abandon of the "Donkey Serenade" sequence. Jackson's masterstroke is his depiction of the moments leading up to the murder, soundtracked by "The Humming Chorus" - the fact that you know what is about to happen makes the suspense all the more excruciating, as your stomach tightens and you still can't quite believe they'll do it. What follows is genuinely horrifying, even on repeated viewing. It remains to be seen if Jackson will ever be this great again, but I possess an ocean of gratitude and goodwill for everybody involved in this film. And by the way, what has become of Melanie Lynskey?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I knew this movie was good, just by when I saw the trailer. Gory, cult-film maker Peter Jackson turned the tables by making this highly dramatic film of the true case of two girls murdering ones mother after getting threatened separation. Melanie Lynskey plays the moody, shy Pauline Parker, who meets up with cheeky, rich Juliet Hulme played well and convincing by Kate Winslet, though I thought the real excellent performance was Lynskey. They instantly bind together creating a fantasy world where they escape from their problems. Things go from interesting to creepy, when they start a plot after both parents tell them they have to be separated. They try all sorts of things but eventually they realize they are beaten they decide to kill Pauline's mother who they feel is the main reason for their troubles (when really it's Juliet's dad). All sorts of interesting things are shown through out the film, such as a rape scene with Orson Welles, and clay figurines that come alive. The most beautiful part in the movie is the intense scene where they decide to treat the mother one last time and then go for a walk down into the woods while humming chorus playsThis has and always will be my favorite movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A unique movie about teenage murderesses that perfectly captures the rapture of being young and feeling alive. I believe "Heavenly creatures" succeeds because it fixes on the adolescent mind and sticks to it through the entire movie.This is the world seen through the eyes of youth. This is what it feels like. This is the fanaticism, the helplessness, the horror, the rush of hormones, the starry-eyed wonder that comes from discovering that you are the hub around which the universe spins. The adult world has no place in this movie. So the two girls tries to dissociate themselves from it. When their parents threatens to destroy their world, they calmly contemplate murder. It's as simple as that. And it's beautifully done by a master director. One of the classics of the 90'ies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fascinating, that is the first word that comes to my mind when I think of HC. I saw this movie four or five months ago, and somehow the images just keep coming back to me. There are three reasons why HC made such a deep impression on me. At first, there is of course that fascinating story of the friendship between Pauline and Juliet. From the first scene on, you know that something terrible is going to happen. This knowledge influences your feelings while you are watching the sometimes cheerfull, joyous fantasies of the girls. It certainly gives the story an extra, awkward dimension. Second, there are these two great actresses. The characters are so important to this story, that lesser characters easily could have ruined the movie. But Melanie Lynskey and Kate Winslet both are just right to personate Pauline and Juliet. You feel that there is so much going on inside Pauline's mind, and that Juliet is just a bit too cheerful. The supporting actors and actresses are very good, also. Third, there are those amazing special effects. Never before have I seen such a perfect mixture of the real world and a fantasy world. I especially liked the imaginary run from Orson Welles, and the scenes in which the clay figures came alive. I don't want a give a 10 to easily, but I decided that HC is one of the few movies that really deserves this figure!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's a lot that Peter Jackson can do with a true story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hot off "Dead-Alive" and a few years before the "LOTR" trilogy, Peter Jackson directed what is in my opinion his best movie ever: "Heavenly Creatures". It portrays two teenage girls in 1950s New Zealand: working class Pauline Rieper (Melanie Lynskey) and wealthy English immigrant Juliet Hulme (Kate Winslet). After Juliet befriends the somewhat outcast Pauline, they start developing a very unhealthy relationship. But when their parents try to separate them, that's when things really get ugly.This is not just any people-go-crazy story. It's almost scary - but certainly masterful - how Jackson shows their descent into madness. And another thing that the movie shows is that when the adults get suspicious of them, not only do some people think that they're lesbians, but only the working class Pauline gets interrogated. We almost want to identify with these girls, even though we understand the self-destructive nature of their relationship.Anyway, I really think that Peter Jackson accomplished his best work ever here. "Heavenly Creatures" is as haunting as it is masterful. Perfect.</fullReview>

Heavenly Creatures is disturbing and shocking, but it is also very beautiful, haunting and quite thoughtful as well, as well as having a masterly mix of nostalgia, menace and innocence. It looks beautiful, with the cinematography simply stunning, and the score is both haunting and beautiful. The story is interesting and the dialogue makes you think and even more than that. Peter Jackson directs wonderfully, and boasts superb performances not only from Kate Winslet and especially Melanie Lynksey- who is mesmerising in the more controlled and I suppose meatier role- but also from Diana Kent, Clive Morrison and Sarah Peirse. Overall, brilliant and one of Jackson's best. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

The acting is superlative however. The dream sequences are masterfully done. The relationship between Pauline and Juliet is the pivot of the film, a pivot well crafted. Melanie Lynsky paints the brooding, intense portrait of Pauline, an awkward girl with a fluttering heart. Kate Winslet effortlessly plays her debut role of a carefree and emotional teenager. The movie is somewhat stretched out in the middle, and that is why I am rating it a notch low. It is a good film however, and definitely worth a one-time watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well-shot and interesting tale, but not one I found particularly engrossing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Peter Jackson calms down a bit after the manic gore fests of BAD TASTE and BRAINDEAD to give us what it undoubtedly his maturest work to date. It's certainly one of his most well-made and beautiful films, with some really stunning scenes in it - such as the moment where a cornfield becomes a royal garden complete with hedges, colourful flowers, and fountains. Filmed in New Zealand, the scenery of the woodlands and countryside is never less than breathtaking, and Jackson retains human interest also by offering interesting camera angles and situations throughout.Based on a true story, this is a very realistic and slow-paced film, with dialogue that rings true. Unfortunately I did find a lot of the lovey-dovey dialogue in the film quite irritating, even if it was a mark of the '50s era in which the story is set. Lynskey and Winslet are excellent in the roles of the friends, but even the supporting cast are very good too, each filling out the roles of the slightly odd, mannered and very much human characters that they place.There are some truly inspired and shocking moments in this film, like when Orson Welles walks on to the screen or the first time we see the life-sized clay men...thanks to some very impressive computer effects work these are highly convincing. After all the slow-build up and human drama, the bloody murder at the very end of the film is unpleasant and graphic, all the more so for being totally unexpected. This counters the serene feel of the rest of the movie and is thus more horrific for it.So, a well-made film with fine acting and an interesting story. Why didn't I rate it higher? The simple fact is that I didn't find this film to be particularly moving or engrossing, although it is well made enough to be thoroughly watchable. After all the hype I had heard about it, the movie could only disappoint me, although most other viewers would probably think of it as wonderful.</fullReview>

What's interesting with Jackson's approach is that he supports those girls, not giving them all the responsibility but rather describing a hard environment : fragile health, need for someone's compassion and out-of- this world dream ! For sure, Kate is really burning the screen as like nowadays she really opens her feelings like nobody else ! At last, we can only support Jackson's  patriotism  to shoot in his native country as New Zealand is indeed a beautiful land much unknown.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peter Jackson known for low budget gory splat movies from New Zealand makes his first steps in serious film making in this murder drama based on a true incident.The film opens with the aftermath of the slaying as two teenage girls emerge hysterical from the woods in Christchurch.The film is about two schoolgirls, Mario Lanza, Orson Welles and living in early 1950s New Zealand which might had been decades behind the 1950s where rock n roll was to emerge in America.Awkward, morose, gawky schoolgirl Pauline (Melanie Lynsky) meets a new arrival from England, Juliet (Kate Winslet) who is confident, clever and brings Pauline out of her shell. Both bond closely with their love of opera and begin to live in a fantasy land which also allows Jackson to keep his horror fans satisfied with special effects scenes.The friendship between Juliet and Pauline soon becomes unhealthy as they feel superior and reality and fantasy collides. Pauline is resentful of her hokey, backwards family, especially her mother. Not helped by them not understanding her burgeoning sexuality, especially when a older boarder takes advantage of her and they blame the daughter.Juliet is ignored by her self centred parents who on the verge of splitting up and Juliet might end up going to South Africa. As the girls are forcibly kept apart they hatch a violent plan which ends up in disaster and tragedy.This is really a small scale drama from Peter Jackson, a world away from his recent overblown, enormous budget epics with even lengthier directors cuts.Here the acting from Winslet and Lynsky does the talking. Jackson brings the New Zealand of the 1950s to live, a world that is very insular. However the film is an efficient drama, nicely acted, a gory ending but not too far away from a well made television drama with some good special effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All the best people have bad chests and bone diseases. It's all frightfully romantic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kate Winslet is Juliet Hulme, a bright eyed schoolgirl with golden locks, a radiant smile, and a British accent that makes her stunningly exotic, or at least to the strictly Catholic New Zealand school. Melanie Lynskey is Pauline Parker, whose hair is almost as dark as her glare, and whom no doubt wishes she could exchange her thick New Zealand accent for something a bit striking and otherworldly. These are two girls who would not normally be drawn to each other, but because of medical conditions, find themselves a close friendship. Jackson indicates the blossoming of this by letting the debut actresses act, and be teenage girls; after the first conversation, Paul hurries home, dodging her mother's question to put on a new record - Mario Lanza, the world's greatest tenor, and her blissful reaction is all we need to know. They are both terrific performances and scream children instead of actresses reading lines in each little symptom of girls lost in their own worlds; the mocking tones in which Juliet mimics a 'friend' of her mother's, the way Paul drops her head into her hands whenever she is embarrassed by her father singing into a fish or her mother welcoming a boarder, how they skip together hand in hand and giggle and laugh endlessly in their own imagination. The visual effects, which are noticeably dated, seem to fit quite well with the context. When they first visualise the Fourth World, the mundane New Zealand is physically wiped away in swathes for the idyllic gardens and unicorns and giant butterflies, and a golden glow bathes their playtime. It does not look fluid or smooth, but transforms itself in the same way in which a child's mind unlocks little segments of their daydreams. The soundtrack tinkles along, Mario Lanza serenades, and the camera weaves and swoops its way through the air like the outstretched arms that they have exchanged for aeroplane wings, and swivels around in excitement. A show-tune could easily be dropped in here, and the whole scene could insert itself into Mary Poppins without a touch of difference. When they build a sandcastle, they lovingly craft intricate details and a storyline to match, and the camera makes itself tiny and matches each gallop of the sound design as it tours the majestic building, matching their vivid imagination. Only later, as the Fourth World leaks into the real, does the sound become more menacing; as irritations are beheaded and gutted for upsetting the creator. Aside from those bursts of imaginative violence (which all of us have had once in a while, even as adults - but this films takes it further), Jackson subtly imbues the real world with a haunting, suffocating quality, as if the girl's dreamland has begun to affect how they see reality, and how little they want to return to it. When a pastor offers up a pamphlet emblazoned with Jesus, there is a loud whoosh, dramatising how horrifying this confrontation must be, before a clay figure drags him away for execution. An extreme closeup likewise does the same to evil word the doctor theorises, a taboo back in the 50s. But I think it is much more than just physical love that they share; it is something much stronger. When Paul goes in search of the latter, the camera hovers over a backyard full of junk, and she is presented, climbed the railing, as some sort of prince to a Rapunzel, or a Romeo to a Juliet, in search of that romance in vain. That search leads her back to Juliet, who descends the staircase while the score crescendos in a gown and manner gracefully reminiscent of Cinderella, and Paul's face is awash with a sensual red glow. Harsh green light seems to constantly leak in through the windows, creating a sickly aura that seems to chase the girls and wind down the time they have together. When they are in separate beds, Selkirk hovers over the back of a nurse and smoothly connects the pair through their letters, and then the red and blue glows merge into each other so gorgeously, and they spend the night. All the while, Paul's diary voice-over narrates, and gives us insight into this relationship. It covers every thing from the childhood trivialities to the passionate moments, and is spoken with such a haughty distaste for the real and a wondrous longing for the imaginary. It almost seems normal and consequential when those shocking words are finally dropped: remove mother. This is the film's crowning achievement: to immerse us into Paul and Juliet's world, to make it so seductive, to make themselves so unconditionally necessary to each other, and then to slip in something so trivial, like murder. And it almost manages to convince us it is justified.</fullReview>

I mean, Pauline and Juliet were very intelligent ordinary girls but it really went downhill for them in the end. It is too bad that back in the 50's, they didn't mention what homosexuality truly is.

I do not know how Jackson wanted us to feel but I was not happy for the two main girls and did not actually like them very much. I was kind of on the family's side rather than the teenagers' side. Also, there seemed to be an unrealistic age gap between the two girls with Pauline looking about 15 and Winslet looking about 22. They should have also shown more of the school life; how they were seen by their peers and teachers. On the whole a 'wow' kind of film, worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pauline (Melanie Lynskey) lives in Christchurch, New Zealand. It is a tiny suburban town. Pauline doesn't have many friends and mostly keeps to herself.Juliet (Kate Winslet) moves to town from England and befriends Pauline. The two girls quickly become inseparable and spend most of their time together. They create an elaborate fantasy world together and the two girls live inside it.The Girl's parents become worried that the relationship is becoming a bit unhealthy (and could be more than friendship.) and they decide to separate the girls.The parents don't understand the depth of the girls friendship however, and when one of the parents decides to move to South Africa the girls decide that they will stop at nothing to be together.This movie is based on actual events that occurred in New Zealand in 1954. Peter Jackson was stickler for details when he made this movie and used actual passages from Pauline's diary and filmed in many of the locations where the events actually happened. The result is a truly gripping and engaging movie with a tragic conclusion.Jackson made this movie a few years after the cult classic Dead Alive which is hands down one of the goriest movies ever made. You can see a lot of similar camera angles and extreme close ups in this movie as well. It is an interesting study in the development of Jackson as a director.Heavenly Creatures is not perfect, there is quite a bit of over acting to be found here and you can see how far Winslet has come as an actor. That said, it is an engaging movie with some really interesting visuals, especially the clay people from the fantasy world when they come to life.Like what you see here?

		<shortDescription>Challenging, Heady</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Heavenly Creatures" may very well wind up being, first and foremost, "that one film Peter Jackson did in the 90s with Kate Winslet". Hell, it probably already is. At least, it's the attitude I went into the film with. That simplistic title betrays the fact that "Heavenly Creatures" is an extremely accomplished work, and a challenging one at that. Though I was not familiar with the true story behind the screenplay, it goes without saying that sympathizing with a couple of emotional, dramatic, downright selfish girls who go to extremes by the end of the story cannot be expected from a normal audience. That said, Jackson doesn't canonize them as tragic heroes as much as he fleshes them out as lost souls, whose pursuit of love and companionship is clouded with delusions of endless despair.The film is visually intoxicating and in-depth almost to a fault, really delving into the idyllic fantasy realm that Pauline and Juliet create. It's a nebulous world that falls just somewhat short of allowing the audience into its threshold, perhaps due in part to the incredible performances of Winslet and Lynskey, both of which regard their fantasy as their own little secret.Even if the off-putting and confusing nature of the emotional, eccentric leads makes the film a difficult experience to be fully immersed in, the ending packs a powerful punch. In the hands of a lesser filmmaker, what could be "movie of the week" material becomes a traumatic, devastating end and a tragic understanding of how the search for something so pure and innocent can go so wrong.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peter Jackson has had some career. After sharpening his teeth on such films as the strange comedy-musical "Meet the Feebles", and the low-budget independent horror films Bad Taste, and the now classic Braindead (AKA Dead Alive), the writer-director- producer-actor-special effects man further came into his own following the international release of Heavenly Creatures, an unique drama about two teenagers from an all-girls schools in New Zealand who create an elaborate fantasy world and form a special bond. When their relationship is threatened however, they consider taking drastic measures to prevent their impending separation.Performances are superb all around, and introduces it's two brilliant leads - Melanie Lynskey and Kate Winslet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pity about Titanic.. This must be Kate's best performance ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps you might be wondering why I am writing a review of a movie which was released way back in 1994. Today morning, with nothing else to do, I decided watch this movie on youtube and felt I should be writing about this (one of the most) under-rated movies ever."Heavenly Creatures" is made by the man who directed Lord of the Rings trilogy - Peter Jackson. The movie is about the famous 'Parker-Hulme Murder Case' where in Parker and Hulme, together murders Parker's mother, Peirse.Pauline Parker and Juliet Hulme are two 14 year old girls played by Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskey respectively. They meet in school and become fast friends immediately. They create a secret fantasy world and become obsessive about it and each other. As their friendship grow, even bordering on homosexuality, and their fantasy land Borovnia seems real to them just as the real world outside, their parents grow concerned and try to separate the pair. Resenting this, they plan revenge on one of the mothers. Their form of revenge...ultimate...Murder!What sets the film apart is the fantasy world the girls create - the world named Borovnia. Kate quotes "I'm going to the fourth world. it's a sort of a heaven, only better, coz there aren't any christians!"The fantasies get darker and darker as the girls get separated and the movie gets more and more difficult to watch...but you can't tear ur eyes away from the scenes coz Peter Jackson creates a 'what will happen next' with delicious frissions created by the girls restlessness underneath.The film deserves to be seen not just once but more than that, if not for all the above reasons, for Kate winslet's performance. As the smarter of the two girls, she dominates every frame and lights up each one of them. Pity about TITANIC, as she got the maximum adulation for the worst role that she did in her career. Her performance in Heavenly Creatures,being her debut too, deserved an Oscar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved his one from Peter Jackson? Based on a true story!...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is based on a true story; it chronicles the events leading up to a murder in 1954, New Zealand. It's the story of a very close friendship formed between two teenage girls and how it lead to murder. Ever since I saw the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy I have always been looking out for other works directed by Peter Jackson. This one has come up several times in discussions and so I was very pleased when the BBC gave it an airing earlier this week. Here's a brief plot summary before I give you my thoughts.We begin in Canterbury, New Zealand, 1953 where Juliet Hulme has arrived at her new school from England. She forms a friendship with Pauline Parker, an impressionable girl who shares her love of the opera singer, Mario Lanza. They quickly form a strong bond, one that is made stronger by the fact that they both have had bad illnesses in the past. They begin writing stories about a fantasy land with various colourful characters. They re-enact scenes from the stories and eventually this fantasy land becomes real to them. Their parents become worried that their friendship is becoming too intense. As events unfold, it transpires that Juliet's parents are planning to divorce and she is to be shipped out to an aunt in South Africa. This hit's Pauline hard and, because she has been having a particularly hard time with her mother, they hatch a plot to get her out of the way. I can't say any more or the spoiler police will be escorting me down a country path.It's all beautifully shot with some really great CGI in the fantasy scenes; I can now see just why Jackson was chosen for those other films he made later. Great performances from both of the starring actresses. I thought Melanie Lynskey was really excellent as Pauline Parker and, in her first movie role, Kate Winslet did a first-rate job as Juliet Hulme. Honourable mentions must also go to; Sarah Peirse as Honora Parker Rieper, Diana Kent as Hilda Hulme, Clive Merrison as Dr. Henry Hulme, Simon O'Connor as Herbert Rieper and Jed Brophy as John/Nicholas.Peter Jackson pays great attention to detail and it is the details that make this a particularly good film. It's a period piece and it really looks the part with every detail as it should be. As I've already mentioned, the CGI is expertly done and fits seamlessly into the story. It's quite an unusual plot with much of the action focused on just one of the girls, Pauline, but then it was based on her diaries. In fact, much of the narration is made up from direct quotes from her diaries. It may not be for everyone, but I found it quite engrossing and well worth a look? Recommended.My score: 8.5/10.IMDb Score: 7.6/10 (based on 30,765 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 95/100 (based on 42 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 82/100 (based on 35,964 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting look at two teenagers' unusual friendship</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is about two teenage girls who form an intense friendship in a fantasy world, that they would do anything to keep themselves together."Heavenly Creatures" looks at an unusual friendship of two very different teenagers. One is from a working class family, rebellious and sulky. The other is from an upper class family, elegant and smart. They form an intense friendship, that sometimes it borders on being homosexual in nature. The film portrays their intense relationship in an ambiguous manner. At times they appear to be really good friends, but at other times only a few occasions) they appear to be lovers. This ambiguous nature distracts viewers a little, but otherwise "Heavenly Creatures" is a strong story that captivates viewers. And in the opening credits, it says "Introducing Kate Winslet". Maybe the filmmakers would never have thought that the person they introduced would go on to become the youngest actress to get five Oscar nominations for Best Actress?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peter Jackson, now world-renowned for the Lord of the Rings trilogy, directed this tale of the intense friendship of two New Zealand teenagers, culminating in the merging of their bitter fantasy world of Mario Lanza, their movie 'saints', and their historical saga of Charles and Deborah, Nicholas and Gina, through which they communicate with each other, and let their fantasies lead them to kill. It is not only an early chance to see the potential of Kate Winslet (although I'm not convinced she has lived up to this early promise completely), but also to marvel on the work on sets and prosthetics which later influenced the work done for LOTR by Weta Workshop. The sequences within the 'fourth world', populated by the girls' clay figurines, are exceptional. On safer ground, the relationship between the girls is clearly signposted and beautifully acted. The violence when it comes is kept to a minimum and the film is sedately paced so we get to know the girls very well and come to understand where they are coming from. There is also fantastic use of music (much of it the songs of Lanza) which is extremely evocative and effective.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderfully offbeat comedy-crime thriller!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suppose that's because it's based on the diaries that describe a true life murder case in New Zealand in 1954, but I really love this movie anyway!!! I suppose only the mind of disturbed teenagers could conjure up something this offbeat!!! It is marketed as a crime drama/thriller, but I found a lot of comedy involved in this film.Melanie Lyskey gives an especially brilliant performance as Yvonne/Paul/Gina/Charles, and Kate Winslet is wonderful as Juliette/Deborah. I didn't know this was Winslet's first film!!! I thought this had been made "after" she became a star with TITANIC. She and Lynskey are both acceptionally gifted actresses, and daring to take roles like these!!! Their "fourth" world is indeed heavenly, but it is also an evil place in which evil schemes are hatched. These two girls' friendship is extreme and intense, and anyone who threatens to break them apart is in danger.I give this terrific film an A+++++!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**Possible Spoilers** I have just watched HEAVENLY CREATURES for the first time. The beginning started out very silly, two unlikely school friends. One a very self conscience introvert, the other more flamboyant. Both of them are searching for a reason, for living, laughing. They become each others escape from the dullness and drudgery of everyday life.The attention to each of the character developments was amazing. Everything was ...natural. I had heard of this movie before, but did not know that it was based on a true story, until the ending credits. I did not notice it until the scene in the woods, but there was no violence in the movie. It was their dolls that acted out their fears and anger, as well as their happiness. It was simple and surreal. It captured that both of these girls with their obsessiveness and, lack of a better word, insanity, was really just innocent. Pure souls, confused and lost. Not until the actually take the step into reality. The more they acted out in the "real world", the more their fantasies weren't as powerful and exacting. I thought this movie was excellently directed and scripted. Casting and portrayal of the characters could not have been improved, and for all that it is, it is a beautiful and remarkable film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In post war New Zealand, 2 schoolgirls from different backgrounds become bound to one another by an inability to relate anyone but each other and a shared pathological passion for fantasy. I don't know if a better treatment of a true crime story has ever been produced. Director Jackson so perfectly brings you into the bizarre never never world of these two misfits, that you ultimately find yourself likewise enchanted. The film, its horrific ending notwithstanding, is a marvelous erotic journey into the land of misplaced determinism. Like Lord of the Rings, Jackson presents a work which doesn't just stand up to repeated viewings, it demands them. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Obsession taken to a conclusion.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly I have to admit that I'm somewhat biased about this movie as I walk past Juliet Hulme's old house, the one where large parts of the movie were set and filmed, about 300 times a year. Minor Spoiler: I have also fallen off (while drunk) the bridge that Juliet is standing on when Pauline first visits her at her beautiful home. This is a fantastic movie that brings alive the fantasy world of Juliet Hulme and Pauline Parker/Reaver as their obsession with each other grows and eventually lead to the murder of Pauline's mother. Peter Jackson's inimitable vision and imaginations make the girls fantasy world appreciable for the viewer. The murder scene is appropriately horrible and is devoid of any stylisation which makes the murder seem believable mundane and painful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Deceptively good film, this. Could've ended up like any of dozens of forgettable made-for-tv-real-life-dramas, but hits all it's targets spot-on. Although based on real diary entries, and hence episodic in nature, the director (Peter Jackson) manages to make each scene flow effortlessly into the next and hold the attention of the viewer with a great, economical script, superb acting, lovely shot composition (see it in 2.35:1 "letterbox" aspect ratio), and, most of all, the fascination of the bizarre fantasy world that the girls inhabit. Pauline (Melanie Lynskey) and Juliet (Kate Winslet) are highly unusual characters (to say the least!), but their performances never lapse into caracature or the grotesque - they remain highly believable and sympathetic, making the grisly ending all the more shocking. My favourite sequence is the one accompanied by the singing of Mario Lanza which shows the beginning of the girls' friendship - superbly edited and visually captivating. What stays with you though, is the gradual erosion of a happy, healthy friendship, and the accompanying slide into tragedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Pauline(Melanie Lynskey)and Juliet(Kate Winslet)meet each other they immediately become fascinated with each other and become best friends. Their friendship turns into a beautiful fantasy world, where both girls feel safe and happy. But when Pauline and Juliet become a little bit more then friends and realize that they love each other, their parents, especially Pauline's mother becomes concerned and threatens to keep them apart. But Pauline would rather kill herself then never see her beloved Juliet again and she would do anything to keep their relationship last, even if it means killing her own mother. I thought this movie was so beautiful yet very disturbing. Pauline's and Juliet's friendship was just so fascinating and unbelievable. Melanie Lynskey and Kate Winslet did an AMAZING job, they were so realistic and wonderful, their acting has got to be one of the best I have ever seen. This movie was truly awesome and unforgettable. I would give Heavenly Creatures 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A painfully beautiful film that writhes with seething obsession, fury, and yet a perfect innocence. These qualities make Heavenly Creatures by far one of the most unique films ever created. The plot itself is suspenseful, with breaks of quirky humour. You will often find yourself laughing despite yourself.This true story of two obsessive teenage girls --Juliet and Pauline-- trapped by their deep love for one another sparkles with such wonder, it is almost indescribable. At a time when lesbianism is frowned upon--the 1950's--the girls become extremely close, both mentally and physically, and are accused by their parents of being lesbians. They know they will inevitably be separated when Juliet's parents leave the country and take her with them, but the girls will not have it. In order to stay together, they devise an unbelievable plan that will end up separating them forever.This film is shocking and beautiful every time you see it. Try and watch the uncut New Zealand version; it contains vital and interesting subplot information that was erroneously omitted from the abridged American version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plain review of complicated story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILER A story that is both disturbing as well as intriguing, `Heavenly Creatures' makes one wonder about the real innocence of youth. The movie begins with a short portrayal of Pauline (played by Melanie Lynskey) before meeting her partner in crime, Juliet (played by Kate Winslet.) As their friendship grows, so does their strange 'romantic' relationship. A climax is reached when the murder of Pauline's mother is devised and carried out by the two girls, bringing the movie to an end and leaving questions as to their fate after finishing their jail sentences. `Heavenly Creatures' starts with your attention and ends with it too, leaving you generally confused in the middle. It's hard to decipher exactly what type of relationship the two have because one moment they are acting as many friends would, and the next they are living out their sexual fantasies with each other. This story makes you feel insane! To see these children having such adult thoughts but still living in their own make-believe world makes one more and more perplexed and bothered. Both lead actresses did a convincing job of portraying juvenile, mentally unstable young women and although I'm still not sure what to make of this movie, I do think it was well made. Surely a film that will leave you in disbelief over just how desperate and frustrated people can get.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two girls have an intense fantasy life; their parents, concerned the fantasy is too intense, separate them, and the girls take revenge.Up to the point Peter Jackson may have been more of a niche director, known for such films as "Brain Dead" and "Bad Taste". He quickly moved up in the world, and this film no doubt helped him land the "Lord of the Rings" series (which also benefited from his New Zealand homeland). The film received an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay but lost to "Pulp Fiction".The story itself is fascinating, and makes you wonder if imagination can be dangerous or if childhood fantasy can be pushed too far. Despite being a fan of Jackson, this went over my head at the time of release. It seems to have grown in stature since, no doubt due to his success and the success of Kate Winslet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was hard to believe that horror specialist Jackson, who's Braindead is one of the goriest movies ever delivered, could make a movie that is so lovely, sweet en gorgeous as Heavenly Creatures. Now he is one of the greatest directors who's working now because of The Lord of the Rings trilogy and the remake of King Kong and The Hobbit. For me this was the beginning of a great director's life. Two girls, the uncertain Lynskey and the 'wild' Winslet, live in the 50s in the conservative New Zealand and have a close friendship. To close, or so their parents say. They fear that their daughters are lesbians. The two lose themselves completely in their together fantasized medieval fantasy world. When they threaten to be torn away from each other, Lynskey gets the plan to murder her mother, with disastrous consequences. The two young, debuting actresses deliver great performances, and are helped by a strong adult cast. In Venice awarded a Golden Lion and the screenplay by Jackson and Frances Walsh was nominated for an Oscar. Three years later, Winslet would become world famous by her role in the blockbuster Titanic. Great drama, great effects, great acting and great but sad story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peter Jackson Presents in Cinematic Form A 'Mental Music' of The Minds of The Two Murderesses Which Allows Us to Experience The Killers' Psyche First-Hand</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pauline Parker is a misguided adolescent. She is blinded by the belief that her best buddy Juliet Hulme's family is the ideal one where she belongs. Her foolish ignorance of the love, care and affection given by her own middle-class parents can be especially found when she does not consider the fact that it is her mother who always takes notice of her feeling and tries talking to her, like when Pauline is sad about Juliet contacting tuberculosis or when she is sitting in one corner away from the rest of her family. Pauline's vivid imagination also innocently made Dr. Henry Hulme (Juliet's dad) a hero, when in reality he was a major cause for the separation of the two girls. She may have a wider knowledge and a greater imagination than her mother, but she also was bafflingly stupid and ungrateful for believing her mother was the main enemy in the film.The unfortunate incident of the mother's murder would not have happened at all had Juliet not entered Pauline's life and poisoned it with deluded thoughts about the Fourth World. If Pauline is misguided, Juliet is the main cause for leading her buddy astray. I really don't know how to take the fact that this same Juliet is a best-selling author now, because the movie unflatteringly portrays her as a cankerous albeit intelligent mind who thinks 'scars are romantic'. Pauline meanwhile leads a reclusive life at a school, ashamed of her dark and twisted past and seeking redemption possibly by nurturing school children to be unlike what she had been.The sensational murder case of Honora Parker by her own daughter Pauline and her best friend (and lover probably) Juliet Hulme is brought to screen in a fascinating and unorthodox fashion by auteur director- scriptwriter Peter Jackson. Though not as talked about as cases like Black Dahlia or the Moors Murders, the 1954 murder case is still a very intriguing one for the plain reason that it was hard to fathom that two very intelligent girls could turn into cold-blooded murderers of one's own mother. Also to be considered is the relationship between the two girls who are seemingly lesbians yet it cannot be entirely confirmed as they do not show much attraction towards other girls. The diaries written by Pauline refer to the girls' communion with 'saints' in the Fourth world who are mostly made of actors like Orson Welles, and thus act as a major source material for the film and another reason for raising curiosity about the case. Peter Jackson is not one to keep it straight; much like David Lynch he has his directorial mark etched all over the film. Heavenly Angels does not start with court proceedings, and neither does it show the arrest of the two girls. It lets us enter and experience the 'mental music' of the girls themselves rather than presenting its events informally through banal court sessions. Jackson's transition from Braindead to Heavenly Children and following transition to Lord of the Rings is clearly visible in Heavenly Children, which seems to possess both the stylistic characteristics of the preceding and succeeding films. Not only do the characters give slightly mannered performances that recalls the over- the-top acting in Braindead (such as a scene in the first quarter where Pauline's father holds a fish in his hands and pretends to sing while the record of Mario Lanza plays on), but certain characters also give us impressions of characters from Braindead (especially the timid boarders at Pauline's home who are quite similar to Braindead's male protagonist). On the other hand, Juliet dressed as a princess chasing Pauline, with white horses in the background may recall magical sequences from LOTR series; I may be wrong in saying this since I have not seen the Lord of the Ring series. There are a number of brilliantly choreographed sequences, especially the montage showing Pauline's and Juliet's happy days together, lightened with Mario Lanza's arresting music. Some involve lighthearted humor that nevertheless act as a presage for the girls' worsening behavior, such as the hilarious scene at the hospital where Juliet is approached by a middle-aged man who rambles about Christ and placing faith in Christianity and is ultimately beheaded albeit in Juliet's mind by one of the saints. The most unnerving part is reserved for the end where the characters the camera movements slow down and silence becomes more pronounced, with only a background score playing solemnly as we brace ourselves to watch that dreadful part.Kate Winslet is consistently brilliant in each and every scene; apart from one scene involving the girls discussing about each others' scars where she sounds too crazy, she successfully makes Juliet a highly mentally fragile female whose attachment to her fantasy life and Fourth World acts as a catalyst for the disruption of the lives of the two families. She also excellently plays the brutal murder scene, rightly giving the 'should-we-really-do-this' look to Juliet. But Melanie is the true star here, doing a great job performing the difficult role of Pauline. Not only do her expressions, her lack of eye contact and her defensive sitting posture accurately portray the role she is playing of a socially awkward teenager, but Lyndskey also gives her character Pauline a unique manner of smiling where her nose crinkles up as she smiles. And both actresses play their characters with damn seriousness even during the hallucination sequences, which is a tough job for such a young pair of ladies. Also, Sarah Peirse is terrific in her slightly straightforward role as the mother who is the only one taking an effort to understand what's wrong with her daughter.I unfortunately do not have the unrated version of the movie which is slightly longer but would have nevertheless remained useful because I've read it contains scenes involving Juliet's mother's affair with one of the patients. 'Heavenly' Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the first of Peter Jacksons early films that I have seen, I have heard a lot of praise for his early splatter movies but I didn't know what to expect from Heavenly Creatures, I was blown away. The first scene with the girls running screaming soaked in blood set a strange tone for the movie. I thought of it throughout and didn't know whether it was an embellishment on one of their fantasies or that something horrible was going to happen to them. Obviously I didn't know that the film was based on a true story despite the mention of the excerpts from Paulines diary at the beginning.The portrayal of the two girls and their relationship both with each other and with their parents and others in the lives was sympathetic of what many teenage girls go through, however not quite to the extent of these two. It made me feel a strong connection with the girls and their loving friendship with one another. I liked the way the homosexual theme was played down during the film, not using it so much as an excuse for the actions, instead playing more on their self obsession and hysterical nearsightedness. They are immature and seemingly unaware of much of the reality around them, it is unfortunate for them to have lived in a time of archaic mental health care when issues such as theirs were frowned upon and misunderstood.The cinematography throughout was beautiful, i found the expressions of Paulines face to have the heaviest effect on me. Also the use of the fantastical claymation scenes was done to great effect, however, I found that the girls were each called by three different names at times to be confusing. The names and definition of the clay figures was also confusing at times due to their looking so similar. However, it was a great connection to show what was going on in the minds of the girls. Particularly the scenes with the pink gem they used in the end to distract Honora before the fatal attack.All in all this film was a clear insight into the misunderstood mind of a teenager.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Heavenly Creatures was for a long time in my list of movies I need to see, but from a reason or an another it always managed to seem an impossible movie to see, so after a local TV-channel finally showed it, I was naturally pretty pleased. So there I was, expecting to see a sort of an exploitation flick about lesbian murderers. Boy, was I wrong with that expectation.The core element of the Heavenly Creatures is the relationship of the teen girls Pauline (Melanie Lynskey) and Juliet (Kate Winslet). Juliet is a daughter of a family, that has spent most of her childhood traveling all around the world, thus giving her vigorous imagination. Pauline in the other hand is a daughter of pretty ordinary family, who feels trapped in her oh so casual life.When Juliet arrives as a new student in Paulines school they quickly find each other as soul mates, who plunge deeply inside fantastical day drams of magical kingdoms and royalties made of clay.There is a murder in the movie, the death of Paulines mother and there is a tender, lesbian romance, but they both are portrayed in very non exploiting manner. The main focus is always to the relationship of the girls and their fantasy world and how it makes their teenage angst ridden lives seem much brighter. Of course there's the tension of knowing the outcome present, but the actual plan to murder Paulines mother enters the story in relatively late, despite the outcome of it is shown right from the bat.All in all Heavenly Creatures is pretty special little movie and it has many unique characteristics. It is an interesting plunge into the minds of two girls, who are not quite as others.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Heavenly Creatures (1994)Peter Jackson fans (and Lord of the Rings fans) both might find this film breathtaking and astonishing for its raw telling of events and its inventive twists. It does move quickly through a series of different stages of the relationship between two girls, beginning and ending with a horrible event that caps it all off. And it has some surreal and technically quasi-animation (claymation) sections that are interesting, at least.But it's a clunky film, forcing sensational issues on us, and rather too many of them, really, because it feels as though button-pushing is the goal. Think of the core of the film--two high school age girls living in New Zealand have such an obsessive bond they are driven to madness and murder. Their contrasting families (stuffy and cultured vs. middle class and real), the girls private school rigidity, and the beautiful landscape make for rich stuff to work with. Add a reasonable decision to try to depict their inner thoughts through imaginative dream scenes, and even throw in a hint of teenage lesbianism, which is probably as common as coffeecake in Christchurch. You should have a searing, disturbing, beautiful, memorable movie.And some of you think I've nailed it. I get that. I also get that it garnered some awards here and there in 1994. But for me the effects, including the over-dramatic first scene with all its blood and interlayering from black and white to color, is just pushy movie-making. From there one there is a similar stretching of ideas, and even a stretching of the film, which after all is a linear plot the way it is told here, of two girls and their decline. There is some realistic acting that gives it strength (the two mothers in particular) but much of the acting is also pushy and exaggerated, including the clearly inspired job by a young (18 year old) Kate Winslet in her first full film role. Call it stylized.As much as some scenes are really gripping and commanding, the whole movie, taken scene after scene, is sloppy and indulgent. It might push you out of the movie, the way it did me, so that you feel outside the experience looking in. Maybe even a bit impatiently. A footnote: both girls got five years in juvenile prison. The English one (the Winslet one) is now a mystery writer living in Scotland. The other (whose mother died) is also now living in Scotland (in a more remote area). Life goes on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tension...tension...masterful tension.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the very most disturbing films I've ever seen. I do not use these words lightly, nor can I stress them enough.The exercise of restraint by Walsh (screenwriter) and Jackson (director/screenwriter) is a new level of impressive. They use EVERYthing in their arsenal to push the tension past familiar territory. The film provokes the mind in its slow path, utilizing the occasional unique, fantasy world visuals to illustrate the imaginations of its young protagonists. Heavenly Creatures builds and builds to a breaking point that you will never forget, but may not want to recall. I'm somewhat glad I never saw this on the big screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Evil Urges</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>HEAVENLY CREATURES is Peter Jackson's award winning film which investigates The Parker-Hulme Murder Case that occurred in Christchurch, New Zealand in 1954. The director downplays the court case to concentrate on the lurid relationship between the two young girls. Whether or not Pauline Parker or Juliet Hulme were lesbians is not resolved, however in New Zealand at the time, homosexual behavior was considered a symptom of madness and all but illegal. The film begins with stock footage depicting the idyllic nature of life in Christchurch in the mid 1950's, and then jump-cuts to a brief scene immediately following the grisly and horrific murder. By conjuring an elaborate fantasy life unrestricted by reality, the two girls are able to engage in acts which would have been ordinarily unthinkable. The intense nature of this process is strikingly similar to the modern cult obsession with the game, Dungeons &amp; Dragons. By employing Weta Digital, a graphic effects company, Jackson demonstrates how this fantastic alternate universe could have pushed Pauline and Juliet to kill Pauline's mother at a popular hillside recreation area. This digital technique richly and sharply enhances the fantasy sequences of the girl's, "Kingdom of Borovnia" and "The Fourth World". Both young women received light jail sentences, and as a condition of their release, they were not allowed to contact each other. At the close of the film, one is left with the feeling that you have been shown graphic psychological reasons which led to the commission of a violent act, yet many questions remain unanswered. Overall, this is a very thought provoking film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe I'm just getting mellow, but I was really overwhelmed by how beautiful this movie looked. Especially when we find our protagonists in the hallucinated dream world or whatever you call it, it had that kind of surreal touch I'm really into. Peter Jackson generally is just good at filming stuff. That climax is really good too, it's just all sorts of emotions, and you ask yourself how you personally would want the story to end. Especially the mother was kind of a complicated character to me, just don't know what to think of her. This movie is also noteworthy because it's the screen debut of Kate Winslet, who as some might guess is doing really well. She could be the best actress of her generation. I don't know that much about the other lead, but I do love her narration. Overall, I'm just kind of ashamed I didn't feel like watching this sooner. This beautiful thing has left quite an impression on me, not in the least because of the grim ending frames. In conclusion, it's pretty great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is quite possibly the most disturbing film you'll ever see. It left a deep impact on me, so much so that I refused to see it again until much recently. Directed imaginatively by Peter Jackson, the film features two impressive performances by Melanie Lynskey and Kate Winslett, two teenagers in 50s Newzealand who develop an 'intense attachment'. The closing scenes (MINOR SPOILERS) are VERY shocking and left me with a sick feeling in my stomach. The girls develop a bizarre fantasy world filled with sinister Orson Welles figures (!), something shown with great style by the directer. Highly recommended.Overall 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful piece of cinema-full marks to Peter Jackson!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actually first watched this movie about eight years ago. I was and still am a big fan of Kate Winslet and as this was her very first film and she was only nineteen when it was made, I was interested in seeing how she started her film career. So I watched the film-and ended up watching one of the best, most moving, and most hauntingly fantastic films I've seen. To be honest I was very shocked to find that it was based on true events. It made me sad (but not completely surprised, given the events of today) to think that something like this actually happened, committing by teenage girls besides anything.Kate Winslet was amazing in her debut, as was Melanie Lynskey. Their interaction and chemistry on-screen was brilliant, portraying the schoolgirls Pauline (Yvonne, Charles, Gina) and Juliet (Deborrah) as being young girls who find they are 'soulmates' though from totally different classes. Juliet is British-the daughter of a successful, rich doctor and an attractive marriage counsellor, but there's a downside to her situation. She has the money and the house and the material things but she does not have the thing she craves-her parents' love. She is the typical spoilt little rich girl, abandoned by her parents regularly, left to fend for herself and in turn becoming rather rebellious. She clearly sees Pauline as her freedom, as someone she can relate to and have fun with. Pauline, bored with her dull, monotonous life and possessive mother, also sees Juliet as a freedom and the two friends soon become inseparable.I have never enjoyed watching the events of a film unfold so much-it was unpredictable, it was scary in places (the clay figures of Borovnia and the violent son of Charles and Deborrah, Diello, slaying everybody stick in the mind) and it was also poignant. I didn't feel sympathy for the girls, it was difficult to, but the film left me wondering how on earth they could have gotten so desperate as to commit such a vile act against another person. There was something very different about the two girls-they had a strange psychic connection-they truly believed that this 'Fourth World' existed and that they would join their favourite film stars in a place beyond Heaven. As the film progresses and you realise just how deep into their own little fantasy world they are, you begin to also wonder about their clearly disintegrating mental state-something in which their parents mistakenly believe is simply homosexuality. While the girls do experience sex together, what they have together is something far more sinister and far more powerful-something both sets of parents realise too late.'Heavenly Creatures' isn't like other films, in my opinion. It isn't an epic, and it probably hasn't even been seen by wide audiences. It's an independent, possibly low-budget offering by the fantastic Peter Jackson. Lord of the Rings it definitely isn't. But it offers the viewer something else. Anyone who hasn't seen this movie needs to sit down and watch it. It's not one to be ignored.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peter Jackson is just wonderful!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film years ago when it had its major theatrical release. Years later now, it remains as powerful. The wonderful, odd vision of Peter Jackson (Director of LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy) is put to use in this story of two young girls whose fantasy world runs amok.I think it would be fair to say this is the breakout film that brought Kate Winslet to the well-deserved attention of a world market, but her co-star Melanie Lynskey gives the more complex performance of the two in this, if only because her role is given more layers. The DVD is an uncut version, and it lends a different light to her sexuality than the version in theatres, but it is all still awkwardly (perfect for this story telling) ambivalent.Jackson makes weird and wonderful use of the clay figures and fantasy land of the girls, and although I don't really think he has a full handle on what a girl's fantasy land would be made of (this one was awfully muddy ? ick), it is still a compelling, complete and disturbing vision ? all fitting. There are truly great moments which feels completely, messily, real. Sarah Peirse's entire performance is wonderful, as the more downtrodden and distressed mother. This is really fine acting.Not long after the film was released, the actual case this was based on was re-opened, and it was found that, as part of their "treatment," the girls were given a drug to sedate them, but it has since been proved to cause extreme violent outbursts. It is too bad this information could not have been available as the film was made. I believe Jackson could have incorporated this and made the film even richer. But that would be icing. This is a true story, and a truly wonderful film of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Early Kate Winslet and Peter Jackson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Heavenly Creatures is a fascinating character study of two adolescent girls growing up in New Zealand in the 1950s. Possessed of a rich fantasy life and lesbian tendencies, they see one of their mothers as standing in the way of their happiness together. Their fantasies take the form of a medieval world of castles, knights and unicorns which director Peter Jackson depicts in odd clay like costumes. In the beginning the girls' reality is stronger than the fantasies but as their relationship grows the fantasies begin to take over. Are the girls insane or just possessed of vivid imaginations? This is Peter Jackson before the big budget, epic Lord of the Rings but Heavenly Creatures is an excellent, minor movie. The scenes of fantasy are very strange. Young Kate Winslet is excellent.

		<fullReview>Every single aspect of this movie works -- it's completely and utterly flawless and worth it all the way. No words of mine will do justice, I'm sure of that.It disappoints me that Jackson went on to make the muddled LOTR movies after his brief creative and hugely successful period -- began with "Bad Taste," ended with "The Frightners." This was undoubtedly the peak of that period, by far.I'm not a big fan of the LOTR movies, but am hoping Jackson will someday soon return to territory such as this sometime soon. It's like this -- watching "Heavenly Creatures" or "Dead Alive" truly create a cinematic feel unlike no other -- completely original works they are, devoid of any cliches or commercialism. The LOTR movies might have some style, of course, but they are more exercises in money making products pumped out of the studio than pure artistic statements.Here's to Peter Jackson. Because of his wonderful film career before the LOTR movies, he's one of the best directors out there. And this, "Heavenly Creatures," is one of the best films ever made thanks to him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Call it a murder mystery, a lesbian flick, a coming-of-age-teenage-girl-in-the-fifties-movie, call it what you like. Just be sure to call it brilliant. Peter Jackson is in the company of my favorite directors (along with John Waters, Tim Burton and Matthew Bright), and he has done some amazing films. But even with a million dollar epic like Lord of the Rings, he can never top this movie. This movie places him directly on top of his career. He cannot go higher, because to do so would cause my brain to explode. He has inspired me to see the world in a completely different way. Not different like killing my mom will make all my problems go away, but different like seeing the magic in everyday things. He proves that you're never too old to have an active imagination. Love these girls. Despite their problems, they are magical, wonderful, heavenly creatures to love and cherish. Be happy, rent this movie, be happier. Actually the end is a little depressing, but once you see it 30 or 40 times, you'll start to feel happier about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still Confused (This might a spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Heavenly Creatures is one of those movies that will take you weeks to figure out if you really liked it or not. The absurdity through most of the movie is that which will leave you wondering why the movie is still on and you haven't turned it off yet. This is also the movies appeal. Based on a true story, it is hard to believe that this actually happened. To me this is a movie of what happens when two people who probably should never have met, meet under very odd circumstances. The relationship created between the two girls at the all girls school blossoms into something that is both unhealthy yet appeal in many ways. There are some definte time era problems that could have been avoided had the two been in our day and age. The lesbian theme that runs through the movie is hard to pinpoint if it truly is a lesbian relationship. I did enjoy this movie because it was not your average good guy bad guy plot and it took a lot of twists and turns and left me with a strange feeling at the end. Movies like Heavenly Creatures stay with you and make you think a lot more than your average film. I would recommend that everyone see this film at least once just to know what everyone else is talking about and to form an opinion for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's the fuss about? See it for yourself.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In reading over the comments on this movie, I'm amazed at how varied the interpretations are of this film. I might have some spoilers here.The lesbian aspect of this film is a characteristic which I don't see a controversy over. There's no indication that homo-phobia is what led these girls to kill. It's their intense friendship, which is played out in a way that suggests more of a symbiotic relationship than a romance between them. They both get sucked into this fantasy which is far more appealing to them than dealing with their problems. Pauline has a family that she finds demeaning, and she clearly doesn't get along with anyone at school. Juliet is very unhappy with her family life, and we can see this also in how she tries to make herself a center of attention at school, and with guests, and to a lesser extent, to her family. I wouldn't doubt that there was a certain amount of romantic entanglement between these girls in real life. This sort of a friendship would lead to it, and they probably wouldn't say that they were in love with one another, it would be something more to the effect that "she understands me, and no one else does."Jackson knows how to make a movie that feels like it goes slowly, but it's far more effective if you try to remember how it was like to build a fort in the woods with your friends as a child.I do feel that the issues discussed in each of these reviews only testifi es for the many levels one can view these events as taking place on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why do so many love stories in film end in bloodshed? Well, for one thing it gives dramatic impact, and if the death takes place at the end it leaves us with a shock, even if we already knew it was coming. Sometimes in films, a person's death at the finish seems so tacked on and contrived that it feels like a last ditch effort by the filmmakers to give their film some importance. This is one of those times where it seems like the only fitting end without feeling like everything was worked-out in advance. Sure, the film is based on a true story, but even still, any part of the film could have been altered for a more exciting story -- I would never look to a film for a recounting of real-life events (it's too important for that). This isn't a film that exists solely for the purpose of letting the world know that specific events occurred, it works on a basic level of the obsession two people can have for each other.The story takes place in the early-to-mid 1950s in New Zealand. Juliet (Kate Winslet) is new in town and to the Christchurch Girls High School. She's an intelligent, imaginative daughter of a well-to-do family and she's a little snotty. When she corrects the teacher in French class, Pauline (Melanie Lynskey) just knows that this chick is going to be her new best friend.They quickly become close, trading off each others' flesh wounds. Pauline has a long scar on her leg that forced her to stay in bed as a youth while doctors drained fluid out for two years, and Juliet has scars on her lungs from a respiratory illness she had as a child. Her parents went so far as to send her to the Bahamas so she could be in a warmer climate -- and left her there for fives years (twice later in the film, when her parents tell her of travel plans they have, and when they send her to stay in a hospital due to tuberculosis without canceling their travel plans, she's understandably upset). Pauline enjoys spending time with Juliet and her parents (she's embarrassed by her folks -- they rent rooms in the house to boarders).The two girls spend more and more time together and become inseparable. They share a love for Mario Lanza and old movie stars like James Mason. They both write and Pauline records her thoughts in her diary. The two create a fantasy land, the Fourth World, that they'll go to when they die. Two days a year they can use a key -- an extra part of their brain that only about ten people have -- to visit the Fourth World through a passage in the clouds. (The morphing effects transplanting the girls to their Eden -- not to mention the life-size clay sculptures that thwack bible thumpers -- are seamless, especially for 1994, just a year after "Jurassic Park.")Eventually, the parents of Juliet fear that the two may be forming an unhealthy relationship and try to separate them. To make a bad thing worse, Juliet's parents (who have their own marital troubles, as well) decide to send her away to South Africa for the good of her health. So the two girls, even more infatuated with each other, vow to do whatever they can to stay together. The finale, even though we know and are indeed told it's coming, is no less brutal or gruesome. It had me cringing, to be sure.What's interesting about the film -- what elevates it beyond the level of an interesting crime-drama -- is Jackson's direction, which isn't to overlook the accomplished acting in the film, particularly from Winslet, one of the most compellingly different actresses we have. Those trips to the girls' Eden, the place that makes them so elated that they're willing to do anything to secure it, give the film something extra. The feel of the film, almost like a "Degrassi High" episode half the time, is awfully unique. The soft-focus photography that looks like "JFK" gives the film the impression of being as dreamy as the journeys to the Fourth World.***1/2</fullReview>

You can't help but be sucked into the girls world of fantasy as im sure many can testify that sometimes life just does not cut it. Why be in a world where all that surrounds you is convention and boredom? Kate Winslets character charms the viewer from the first instance she is introduced to the scene. She is young, vibrant and charismatic. A spur of the moment type gal - larger than life - the best friend everyone wishes they had or wishes they could be. However beneath this front is a darker side to her character (I blame the parents), this side can be seen in the character Paul quite evidently. As the two become closer there characters merge into one, it becomes hard to see where one begins and one ends. I feel it shouts out to an innocent time before the imagination was blocked out by the tediousness and preditability of adult life - childhood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A beautifully disturbing film, "Heavenly Creature" combines style, imagination, flawless acting, and a seamlessly written story. I understand that a film such as this can be too intense for some viewers, but this does not effect its quality or significance. Peter Jackson uses his horror film background to erect a dramatically twisted tragedy that barely misses being perfect. For the audience the experience is like putting on a pathological suit, where you walk in the footsteps of near crazy and then jump over to the other side. Remarkably though, Jackson, manages to maintain a balance where the viewer does not lose sympathy for any characters, therefore making the tragic turn much more devastating. If you want to be a filmmaker, if you are a Peter Jackson fan, or if you just want see a powerfully unique film, "Heavenly Creatures" must be seen.</fullReview>

God thank the casting director for casting Kate Winslet as one of the two girls or who knows whether we'd be lucky enough to see her in all the things she has done since. Although the story is disturbing, and particularly because it's based on an actual real life event, I felt it was wonderfully done, especially the fantasy scenes where the characters that the girls work on come to life in their minds and imaginations. Both actresses were great and completely right for the parts, but in this movie, I give the most credit to the director. His vision is so very clear and he passes it along to the audience with that very same clarity.A really special film. I can truly say that I have not met a single person in my age group that doesn't think this film is one of the most special movies out there.

		<shortDescription>Simply Heavenly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before Peter Jackson had become such a household name he made different pictures. I loved Bad Tastes as a super-indie film, which relied on jokes and gross humor to keep the pace up. It's not for the weak stomached but it is an impressive film none-the-less. Dead Alive I didn't care for on the whole, it was beautifully shot but the story didn't do much for me and neither did the over-all production. But Heavenly Creatures... now here was something that no filmgoer or maker was really expecting.The plot is a little different in and of itself, centering on the infatuation of two young girls for one another. The girls are both brilliantly played and well cast. Kate Winslet (Juliet) in her first big roll is a little off kilter and unstable. Melanie Lynsky (Pauline) is also very subdued and quiet, not the looker that Juliet is but rather something deep and hidden away. Something dangerous.The film plays itself out very slowly which is good because after you've spent much time with the girls it's hard to let them go. It's also hard to not understand a little of what they were going through and at least feel some sympathy for their plight. We travel with the two into their fantasy world (creepily realized by WETA in the form of clay models come to life) and back, having a full understanding that the fantasy world is more real and more of a true home to the girls. As time goes by the film doesn't fail as either a suspense thriller or character study. It is strong on both ends because of a taught script, unfaltering directing, and magnificent acting. The events near the end of the film are so suspenseful that I still find them hard to watch at times. Jackson builds and builds and builds and keeps building long after I thought there would be anything left to build.The film is an astonishing look at young love and teenage reasoning. It is a sharp, almost painful, reminder of the level at which adolescents (especially the intelligent ones) think and view the world. After Columbine and Santana this film carries more weight than I think Jackson intended. But never the less, it is there. I think it was put together as a cautionary tale in some respects, and it is a caution... even more so now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Christchurch, New Zealand, every teenage girl is equal, and every girl has friends. But, at the all girls school, Pauline Parker (Melanie Lynskie) is a loner. She has been a loner all her life. But, when a new girl from England named Juliet Hulme (Kate Winslet)shows up one day, Paulines world is brightened up completley. The two girls meet during art class and become best friends immediatley.Soon, they start only spending time with each other and no one else. Paulines mother becomes suspicious of the two and immediatley discovers that they are having a homosexual relationship. She also finds out that they have a secret world with their own kind of characters and people.As the story moves along, power begins to grow with it. But, when Juliet becomes sick with tuberculosis on one of her lungs and is put in the hospital for 5 months, both of the girls' parents try what they can to keep the girls apart. That ends up not working because Juliet gets out later on and the girls pick up where they left off. Their relationship is very soon threatened by Paulines mother. This puts the girls up to something that normal people would not do in a situation like theirs.The rest can not be spoiled.Written and directed by Peter Jackson (The Lord of the Rings Trilogy), Heavenly Creatures is one of the most powerful thrillers of all time. It is also a based on a true story.Rated R for: Strong Sexual Content, a scene of grusome murder, thematic elements involving teens, disturbing images</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the movie that enabled Peter Jackson to go on and eventually make the Lord of the Rings Trilogy (first film currently at number 1 in the top 250 of IMdB...). I have only seen it once, in a television screening, and I think it is a very haunting film, a beautiful and powerful piece of work. The performances by the then unknown Kate Winslet and her girlfriend are so realistic, so gripping... It just makes you very sad to think this more or less really happened. I must admit that I do not like the other films Peter Jackson has made (Brain Dead, Bad Taste, Meet the Feebles) as I am absolutely not into gore. The end of Heavenly Creatures is also quite gory, but since it is done in a very realistic style and no more brutal than what we see in TV series nowadays, it fits. Kudos to Peter Jackson for rising above himself and making a very intelligent film about a brutal murder. Go and see or rent this one, it is well worth the time you invest. One of the great overlooked films. Top stuff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A strong, powerfully imaginative story.... its not every day you get involved so deeply with a character who's presence so entangling that you can't help but be inthrilled with every moment, feeling, fantasy and reality in which the main characters are surrounded in. Peter Jackson delivers yet another masterpiece, engulfing to the very climactic end... in an interview about this film he expressed the awkwardness in shooting in the house prior to the murder scene... and when you see this movie you know why... its so intense that you can't help but choke back while you grip tight to a stunning climax. Enduring, fun and superb.... don't miss out.... there's quite none like it</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've never actually heard of the true story, and just came upon this movie because I'm a Kate Winslet fan. I have to say, it's one of my favorite movies and definitely one of the top films of all time.Winslet and Lynksey are perfect. Their performances are moving and get you emotionally involved throughout the entire time you watch the movie. The scenes of despair are especially heartbreaking, and the funny and creative sides of the girls are admirable and fun to watch. If only they didn't get carried away with their imaginations.But you'll just have to watch the movie to see what I mean. :) 10/10I might also add that the adults who played the girls' parents- Peirse, Kent, Merrison, and O'Connor- did it flawlessly. A very good movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most underrated and overlooked film I know of</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For whatever reason this one fell through the cracks and it is a loss for its makers but even more so for all of those who have not seen it. I do not throw around praise but I would say this is one of the greatest, and certainly most underrated, films of all time. It is based on the true story of two girls who in 1950s New Zealand murder one of their mothers in an attempt to prevent their separation. This fact gives the epilogue an almost unbearable amount of tragic irony. At any rate the most compelling aspect of the story is the way in which it portrays a relationship from it's innocent beginnings, to an intimate friend ship to a sexual and in a way psychotic bond (the girls share a fantasy world populated by characters from the stories they write) between the two girls. This is a film that should be watched by anyone who hasn't seen it yet. Writing direction and acting are all nearly impeccable and I dare say it is the most convincing portrayal of love ever in a film.</fullReview>

I was never sure when either of the girls was going to go off her nut and for what reason, because they seem to have been that way when they were alone - together they were two times as lethal. Their imaginery world of knights and kings and undying love was consistent with their slightly off-balance existence. Movie contains some gorgeous cinematography and I enjoyed hearing Mario Lanza too!A credit to all involved. I can see why this movie is so admired. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Heavenly" Indeed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The true story of two teenaged girls living in New Zealand in the early ?50s, `Heavenly Creatures,' directed by Peter Jackson, is a riveting, sometimes intense drama that examines the fast friendship between Pauline Parker (Melanie Lynskey) and Juliet Hulme (Kate Winslet), and the effects of that friendship, on not only themselves, but on their families and friends as well. From a working class family, at fourteen, Pauline was shy and prone to introspection, recording her most intimate thoughts daily in a diary. Originally from England, Juliet was the new girl in town; from a well-to-do family, she was well traveled, her father a professor of some stature. Gregarious and outgoing, she was also given to flights of fancy, all of which appealed to Pauline immediately. Brash and vivacious, Juliet was everything Pauline would never be; and Pauline was writing a novel, an endeavor in which Juliet quickly joined her. Together, they would write and act out their romantic notions of brave knights and fair ladies, and Juliet shared with Pauline her knowledge of `The Fourth World,' a place to which she would one day go instead of heaven. By the time they were fifteen, they were virtually inseparable. They were `best' friends in every sense of the word. Director Jackson does a magnificent job of taking you into the world of Pauline and Juliet. By contrasting the reality with the fantasy, he gives you an excellent sense of what they were all about, how they related to one another (as well as to others), and most importantly, their collective mind set which enabled them to actually embark upon their chosen path. the girls' dream world is presented with a lyrical style that makes the happy times uplifting, and enhances the impact when things turn dark. Throughout the film, passages are read verbatim from Pauline's diaries, which adds such stark realism to the events as they unfold, that in the end it produces a veritable sense of awe. To see the things depicted here in a movie is one thing, but when you stop and think about the fact that two such `normal' young girls were capable of doing what they did, it is indeed sobering. And when you learn what finally became of Pauline and Juliet, it merely adds to the incredulity of it all. This film marked the screen debuts of Winslet and Lynskey, and in Winslet's case, this film could have been subtitled `A Star Is Born.' From the opening frames, in which her talent, beauty and charismatic screen presence are readily apparent, there was no doubt as to the direction her career would soon be taking. In retrospect, this was a great role with which to jump start her career, and she grabbed the opportunity with both hands and created a truly memorable character, using her natural poise and charm to the ultimate effect. Winslet not only played the character, she discovered the spirit that moved Juliet and used it to the fullest extent to bring her to life here. It's a genuinely auspicious and incredible performance. That Lynskey hasn't fared as well in her career as Winslet has since this film was made is in no way a reflection upon her performance in it. Pauline is perfectly realized by Lynskey, but due to the more solemn nature of the character, it was almost as if she was predestined to be overshadowed here by Winslet. But the credit for making the on screen relationship between the girls work so well, and the fact that it is so believable, has to be distributed equally between the two actresses. And it was Lynskey's ability to evoke and surround herself with an ambience of darkness that allowed Winslet's light to shine so brightly.  The supporting cast includes Sarah Peirse (Honora), Diana Kent (Hilda), Clive Merrison (Henry), Simon O'Connor (Herbert), Jed Brophy (John), Peter Elliott (Bill), Gilbert Goldie (Dr. Bennett) and Kirsti Ferry (Wendy). Watching such extraordinary circumstances being played out so matter-of-factly by such seemingly ordinary people can be a thought provoking experience, but in the case of `Heavenly Creatures,' it's profoundly disturbing. There's nothing quite so jarring as realizing the facility with which certain boundaries can in fact be traversed, and when it happens, it's like a slap in the face from reality. And that's what this film does. It's an engrossing tale that will prick up the hairs on your neck of awareness, and stay with you long after the screen has gone dark. I rate this one 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The horror lies in the fact that this is a true story. We know that all the time because we're told at the beginning that the diary quotes are original. I don't know exactly if this is the reason but there's always something evil moving over the film, even in happy moments. You have no idea what it will be but you know that something terrible must happen; and you can't await it. Bathed in breath-taking pictures, wonderful colours and the dream-like opera music of Mario Lanza, the whole movie is one big dream and at any point it could turn into a nightmare.Peter Jackson's directing and the cinematographer should have won an Academy Award. Kate Winslet showed even in her debut that she is one of few REAL actresses whose main intention is qaulity and variety.Besides, this movie features the strangest love scenes I've ever seen. I don't think you'll find any weirder love scenes in a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Crushed Dream of Exclusive Togetherness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pauline and Juliet are two friends, who accidentally meet in Christchurch in the fifties and are then unable to part again. It is a fateful encounter, which tragically ends in a conspiracy to murder. Pauline's mother is intentionally killed by the two girls with a brick hid in a carrier bag, during an outing.Why did it have to happen? The movie answers this question in a long flashback which lasts until the starting point (the murder scene) is reached again.The two girls' friendship is unusual and exclusive. Pauline and Juliet only playfully include other persons in their world, famous contemporaries like Mario Lanza and Orson Welles, one as hero, the other as demon. Parents, teachers and other persons of their immediate vicinity are of lesser importance and become significant merely as objects of their mockery, like the clumsy tenant who lives in the house of Pauline's family and has the bad luck to fall in love with the girl. They are all denied access to their privacy. Therefore they do not even have the remotest idea of the existence of Borovnia, the dreamworld that the girls have created to escape from the troubles of daily routine. Diello, heir to the throne of Borovnia, becomes an ally in the fight against the lack of understanding of the others. When Pauline is interrogated on account of her alleged lesbian tendency, powers of imagination become so strong that the psychologist is killed by the sword stroke of the fiercely intervening Diello. And in the same way Diello comes to Juliet's rescue when, while being treated for tuberculosis in hospital, she is being plagued by a clergyman. He simply strangles him from behind so that his devotional words become inaudible.But when both girls' parents finally agree on separating the friends and sending Juliet to South Africa this fanciful method of confronting and eliminating the mischievous attacks of their fellow creatures does not work any longer and the continued existence of their salvaging fantasy world is seriously threatened. The conspiracy to murder is nothing but a desperate rescue operation in a state of emergency. Exclusive friendship has become something like a life supporting obsession of which the loss would leave the girls without any support in a strange and sinister world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is absolutely amazing. At first I just saw it, in order to see Kate Winslet (one of my favorite actresses). But afterwards I watched this movie so many times that I have fallen in love with it. Its so captivating and intense. The murder scene is so violent and not because of the blood content but because of how realistic it was. Honora Parker's scream sent shivers down my spine. The bond between Juliet and Pauline was so intense that it left me in awe. If you listen to the narrative Pauline says that they were enacting how the Saints would have made love. They were just two passionate people with an intense friendship. What's most interesting is that the voice-over is from the real life Pauline's diary. The most shocking aspect of this movie is that its mostly TRUE!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After my first viewing of Heavenly Creatures, I must admit, I was quite put off. I didn't quite like it, but it could be because I didn't appreciate. Now, two years and over a hundred viewings later, I can say that this movie is one of the best ever created. It's portrayal of the true crime story is dead on, and it was Kate Winslet's best performance, in my opinion, definitely a perfect vehicle to create a star. Melanie Lynskey is the underrated star in this, what with Kate's Titanic fame, but it takes true talent to play the role she did, and this movie would not have been the excellence it is without Melanie or Kate. Definitely a splendid movie when given a chance. As they say, "'Tis indeed a miracle one must feel, that two such heavenly creatures are real."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps the best true-crime film ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most chilling true-crime movies ever made, Heavenly Creatures depicts the extraordinary obsession with each other of two Christchurch, New Zealand, girls--an obsession that eventually drives them to murder one of their mothers. The crime took place in 1954, when Christchurch was a bucolic outpost of Anglo-Australasian culture, and the movie captures the shock that the crime's enormity caused.One of Heavenly Creatures' many achievements is its portrayal of intentional murder as a base, obscene act. The actual murder scene is almost unwatchable. In mainstream Hollywood movies, murders tend to be stylized, and the viewer sees them at a remove from the horror. By contrast, Heavenly Creatures contains no similar mediation, and the moviegoer is psychologically placed directly in the ghastly view of events, without a gloss of any sort.</fullReview>

And when I watch this film, it makes me think of the grown-ups, "Who are they to attempt to break a solid friendship?"What's great is the bond that Pauline and Juliet form and share between one another.

		<fullReview>Peter Jackson`s 1994 film "Heavenly Creatures" has got to be one of the most disturbing movies I have ever seen. Not that I`m saying it`s bad or anything, it was a good film. "Heavenly Creatures" is a very unconventional movie, mainly because its story is so bizarre. I have never witnessed such a deep look inside the twisted,psychotic minds of two teenage girls during the 1950`s. And the fact that this film is based on real life facts just makes it even more chilling. The film`s story is very dark, but the film itself is quite colourful. Jackson takes the viewer into the delusional fantasy world imagined by the two protagonists, filled with magnificent and sometimes eerie images. Kate Winslet is terrific, she probaly delivers her best performance in this film as a deeply disturbed adolescent whose unhealthy friendship with another girl (Melanie Lynskey) ultimately leads to a grisly murder. "Heavenly Creatures" is quite graphic as it focuses on the two girl`s unhappy lives and the lesbian love they finally share. Their imaginations were so distorted, it was actually quite frightening to think that teenagers could be so delusional and merciless. The film`s scenery is quite nice, but even the most pleasant backdrop couldn`t weaken the extremely disturbing plot. "Heavenly Creatures" is a film that will definitely make people think twice about adolescents.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Heavenly creatures" is one of the most disconcerting films I've ever seen. Peter Jackson made an extreme powerful film out of that true story. Just because of its fusion of wonderful poetry and incomprehensible violence, the film leaves a conflicting impression, you will think of it for a long long time after. The director refrains from a moral judgment. He only shows. He shows us the world of two very sensitive and very imaginative young girls. Both unite a deep friendship and they fight against their separation. I felt a lot of sympathy for both heavenly creatures but also for their parents. And so the end shocked me deeply! Peter Dasent wrote a superb orchestral score. The use of Mario Lanza's songs are very fanciful. The cast, especially Kate Winslet with her beautiful theatrical English accent, is outstanding. I don't like splatter movies, but Peter Jackson has convinced me of his talent to make other kinds of films, too!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Based on real events in 1950s New Zealand.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Years before Peter Jackson wrote and directed the Ring Trilogy movies, he wrote and directed this nice drama based on real people and real events, authenticated by the diaries of the two school girls.Years before she famously appeared in "Titanic", Kate Winslet as a teenager was Juliet Hulme. Her friend was Pauline Parker, played by Melanie Lynskey. The girls developed a close bond in New Zealand, where they shared their love for Mario Lanza and for a fantasy dimension they could enter in their imaginations.Several things conspired to bring the climax to the story. Juliet developed tuberculosis, a recurrence of an earlier bout, her parents decided to get a divorce, and her father left the university. The separation anxiety was compounded by Pauline's mother thinking the girls' relationship was too close and unhealthy, forbade her from traveling with Juliet and her dad to South Africa.Perhaps delusional, the girls conspired to kill Pauline's mother as a way to eliminate her influence, and did so with a brick while the three were on a walk. The girls naively claimed the mother fell, but it was easy to see what had happened, since it took 45 blows to the head to kill her.The girls were convicted in 1954, barely 2 months after the crime, were imprisoned for a few years, and both ended up back in Great Britain with changed names, and apparently changed lives.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unknown films of actors/actresses who turned famous later are sometimes horrible and sometimes great. This one is definitely wonderful. Its charming way of transferring the girls fantasies has more credibility than any other film I have seen. Juliet and Pauline are that persuasive and the cuts and transitions are excellent. The difficult sequences when dream and reality are melted together and torn apart again are so hard to manage and so brilliantly done. It is not a movie with much of a direction or moral in itself, it simply shows the relationship between the girls and the families so one might nearly feel like Pauline or Juliet. Anybody who likes movies with feelings but without a melodramatic TITANIC style will have endless pleasure watching one of the greatest movies of the decade with a Kate Winslet (and a Kate Lynskey) who is persuasive like she never was in Titanic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heavenly Creatures vs. Fun- PLEASE READ AND LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU THINK</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>the "folie a deux" that you are talking about really reminds me of the movie "Fun". have you seen that? Fun is a similar story about two young girls, also with a sexual obsession who commit a murder. Their murder is not for any personal gain though but more of an experiment, the same as their sexuality I suppose. I watched both of these movies when I was very young, probably 11 or 12 and I must say they had quite prestigious effects on my development. Insanity is a topic that we are all afraid to think too hard about for the worry that our own minds will slip. It is scary because it could happen, it happens easily to these normal people. How do we know it won't happen to us, or that it hasn't happened already? Know what I mean? Perhaps that is why these movies have such intrigue. Murder is another reserved topic. There is murder committed by police or do gooders against the criminal but then there is blood splattered, over the edge, past the brink of sanity murder. Who says where the line is drawn? Taking someone's life is the same whether you are Vin Disel in "Walking Tall"(total acceptable non insane revenge killings that are accepted by the public for some reason) or if you are Mickey Knox in "Natural Born Killers" (disgusting, sick actions of a mind that is sickened and poisoned) They both use guns as a weapon of choice sometimes right, where is the difference? back on topic, good movies-both of them-but for some reason I wouldn't want to recommend them to anyone, or watch them with anyone else, for "fear" that perhaps they would think I too was sick. Does that make any sense? How we can be ashamed to find these movies interesting?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant drama about friendship, obsession and fantasy. Absolutely unforgettable!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed Peter Jackson's early splatter comedies, but I was still extremely surprised at how much depth and subtlety 'Heavenly Creatures' had. I am not a fans of his Tolkien movies, but I think this one is his true masterpiece. It's a brilliant film, and absolutely unforgettable. Inspired by a true life murder story, of which I wasn't aware of before I watched the movie, 'Heavenly Creatures' is blessed with a strong script (co-written by Jackson and his wife Frances Walsh), inventive and inspired direction, and most notably, superb performances from Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskey. Winslet is now a major star, but as good as she is in the movie, I think Lynskey is even better. Why she is still relatively obscure is a real shame. Before I watched this movie I almost balked expecting it to be an insipid "chick flick". I urge anyone else out there with similar doubts to give it a go, because it's a damn fine movie that will please just about any viewer, no matter what their taste. One of the finest movies to ever come out of New Zealand, this riveting and powerful drama comes with my highest recommendation!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A surprisingly thoughtful Jackson and predictably brilliant Winslet make a memorable experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though I adore the "Lord of the Rings" films, it's due to the incredible work of Tolkien on the source material rather than Peter Jackson's direction, which I in fact dislike. And what little other work of his I have seen has been nowhere near that level of quality in terms of direction or any other aspects, so finding this thoughtful, chillingly brilliant piece of direction and writing from him was a surprise.*SPOILERS COMING*The tale is of two teenaged girls who escape their realities by indulging in an intense fantasy world and over time the line between that fantasy and reality becomes blurred to the point that there is no separation--and Jackson wisely gives us no hint of when we are entering or leaving the realm of fantasy, even though there had to be a temptation to do so. He and Frances Walsh also managed to deliver truly wonderfully-written, thoughtful dialogue, though some of its best moments are the excerpts from Paulina's diary, showing her conversion to the speech patterns of Juliet and then her rediscovery of her own voice as she takes on the dominant role in the relationship beginning with their sex scene and continuing through the remainder of the film. This part was where Kate Winslet really shone--performing brilliantly the nervousness, sadness, and confusion that her character feels at being suddenly in the submissive role she has been forced into through her entire life and hated. Now I'll get back to general film comments.*SPOILERS OVER*The direction and writing in general were very intelligent and thoughtful, though to explain how is really difficult without spoilers, so those comments are really above.The performances were generally good enough for roles that didn't require much except for the two leads. In those two leads, Kate Winslet was wonderful and Melanie Lynskey was good enough but had most of the work done for her. While neither had a much better character than the other, I think Winslet was given the opportunity to express a greater variety of emotions and feelings while Lynskey was usually given her emotions by Jackson's camera angle's, which were brilliantly and perfectly worked out. It's also noticeable that both girls (especially Winslet--though Hulme did actually look rather more sickly) do look like their true historical counterparts.Overall, this was an intense and very thoughtful film experience given to us by Peter Jackson's exercise of a cinematic brain that I never knew he had, a powerful, interesting, frightening story, and a notably excellent performance by Kate Winslet (as usual). Only two years later, she would take on one of the greatest female characters in literary history in Ophelia from William Shakespeare's "Hamlet" and nail it perfectly, and here she nails perfectly a role almost as difficult in a masterful film. But Jackson is the real star here. He may be an Oscar-winning director now, but I really think if he deserved one for direction (not picture, for which he deserved three in the "Lord of the Rings" films--I want to be clear on that), this was where he did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I felt like the parents did--completely shut out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two misfit schoolgirls in 1952 New Zealand form a close bond, tuning their parents out while creating an intimate world of deceitful fantasy. Peter Jackson, who directed and co-wrote the fact-based screenplay, helms the proceedings with an intense, chilly romanticism which is initially arresting. Unfortunately, his film is nearly done-in by the broader strokes, which gives the film an artificial, off-putting resonance. As youngsters Yvonne Rieper and Juliet Hulme, debuting actresses Melanie Lynskey and Kate Winslet are unsubtle and, as rendered by the filmmakers here, unreachable. This piece, which rests so firmly on whether we can respond to the girls, gives us two belligerent young ladies who are practically beyond repair. The adults fare no better, which isn't surprising: Jackson only leaves them scraps of scenes. The talented director's primary vision is bristly and gripping, yet the tremulous story threads are practically buried underneath the stylistic bombast. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just looked at the ratings for this movie, and all demographic groups gave it between 7.1 and 7.7, and there are few if any unsatisified reviews. But I thought it was truly average, and honestly over-rated. Yes, the production values were high etc., but quality form needs salient content. Though it's apparently a true story, and was interesting (though never gripping) in places, the plot seemed derivative and the metaphorical scenes were clichd (unicorns and adolescent girls? seriously?). Kate Winslet played herself well, as usual, though with a different accent. I feigned interest for my partner's sake, who did rate it highly, though she seemed puzzled and possibly annoyed when the movie ended and I said 'let's watch Night of the Living Dead again, and continue the dead actors theme'. Yawn. Peter Jackson had to start somewhere, I guess</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They're Not Natural Born Killers?But They Kill In Cold Blood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is One of those Movies that is Difficult to Categorize, and the Temptation is to Define it as in a Category all its own. It is a Fantastical Film Based on a Real Life Murder that was Committed by Two Teenage Girls. Adding to the Horror is the Fact that for One of the Girls, it was Matricide. Often said to be the most Heinous of Killings, the Aftermath of the Crime, the Punishment and Their Post Prison Lives is Surprisingly Subtle.The Film is Offbeat and Off Putting with a Disturbing Factor that is Very High with an Artistic Vision by Director Peter Jackson that is Oddly Beautiful as He Captures the Girl's Fertile Imaginations and On the Edge Psychopathy with Surreal, Hallucinatory "Dream" Sequences that are Humorous and Horrendous, Sometimes in the Same Scene.This was a Breakout Film for Jackson and Kate Winslet, but Everyone Involved in this Well Crafted, Imaginative, Insightful Indictment of Rigid 1950's Values like Religion, Teachers, Mores, and Homosexuality can be Proud. It Turns Movies about Real Life Murderers On Its Head like In Cold Blood (1967) and Illustrates the Power of a Deep and Unconditional Love Gone Bad, like Natural Born Killers (1992). Two Ground Breaking Films that have a lot in Common with this Odd Movie.Highly Recommended for Fans of Films that are Off the Beaten Track, Dealing with Abnormal Psychology, and those Looking for Art Films done by Talented and Creative Filmmakers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is film-making at its best! Even those, who don't like the storyline itself, have to admit that the execution is excellent.It's very atmospheric. The acting is impeccable. This was Kate Winslet's very first movie, after which she went on to become one of the most prominent Hollywood stars -- and rightfully so. She's massively talented.Winslet's co-star (Melanie Lynski) was also very, very good, but, for some reason, her acting career never took off.They couldn't have picked a better cast -- just perfect. All the actors were very convincing in their respective roles.A very accurate portrayal of mental illness and sexuality in a society where such issues were totally taboo.Anyone can enjoy this movie, but it will be of particular interest to those, who like exploring mental health/psychology. Both girls have personality disorders (Juliette - histrionic; Pauline - avoidant), but psychiatry was not as well-developed as it is today, so their behavior is blamed on "unusually intense imagination" and "homosexuality".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Before Jackson and Winslet became famous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It took me 18 years to catch up with this New Zealand film of 1994 by which time the director Peter Jackson and co-writers Jackson and his wife Fran Walsh had achieved spectacular success through "The Lord Of The Rings" trilogy and one of the two young actresses at the heart of the action, the British Kate Winslet in her dbut movie role, had starred in "Titantic" and much more.The heavenly creatures of this true story are the teenage working class New Zealander Pauline, played by Melanie Lynskey, and her precocious British schoolfriend Juliet (Winslet). In the quiet world of Christchurch in 1953 &amp; 1954, they form a bond of extraordinary intensity which leads ultimately to murderous intent. Jackson cleverly portrays the descent into a form of madness and uses text from the diary kept by Pauline in real life, while the two young actresses give astonishing performances that both impress and disturb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Heavenly Creatures is a film that really highlights a part of New Zealand that is not often seen or talked about. It is the murders and violent crime that lies beneath the average 'Joe' community. So often in New Zealand we get films the illustrate the relationship with our land and tense Maori culture. This film along with 'Out Of The Blue' has shown a side of New Zealand that even the people the live there don't talk about. This true story is extremely deep and interesting. There is not one part in the film and history of the two girls that rings a fake and typical aspects. The reason why I gave it a six out of ten is because the people around me have ruined the ending and other parts which caused me to be bored and switch it off. So even though I knew nothing about the film it still didn't capture me, the only aspect of this film I liked is the fact that it was a New Zealand story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic New Zealand Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was traveling in New Zealand recently and during my stay in Christchurch I sat down with a bunch of strangers in our hostel common room and watched Heavenly Creatures for the first time. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't uncomfortable, but the best films are ones that push the boundaries of your comfort zone. Jackson created a very edgy film here, one that shows the cruelty of the world in the eyes of young women when they feel like they're in a no win situation. The audience moves in and out of the fantasy world they create with startling ease, evidence of Jackson's deft handling. Their desperation is a result of the alienation that all young people feel at one time. When they meet each other, they find an escape. The relationship becomes too intense for their parents to handle and they make an attempt to separate them, believing that lesbianism is a form of psychosis. The murder of Pauline's mother is never justified, but we can't really hate the two girls either, well at least not Kate Winslet's character. There's so much that can be said here, but the most compelling thing is that these events really happened. Heavenly Creatures is based on one of New Zealand's most sensationalized murders. The lead actresses give fine performances and Jackson proves that he can do strange and wonderful things with any material he is given.</fullReview>

Based on a true story, Melanie Lynksey and Kate Winslet are Pauline and Juliet, two imaginative misfits at a New Zealand high school who form an obsessive bond. Suspicions about their relationship emerge--are they lovers, or just two crazy school girls? The two girls go so far as to murder Pauline's mother to prevent separation. Peter Jackson directed this and his work is impressive, conveying Pauline and Juliet's dream world of prince and princesses and Mario Lanza without seeming pretentious. Lynskey and Winslet are both very good in challenging roles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had wanted to see this film for years and had attempted to watch a late night TV showing before but fell asleep. Well finally I have seen the movie and boy what a good film it is. This the true story of two girls in 1950's New Zealand who become inseparable friends who become transfixed with one another leading to a series of shocking events that they feel they are pre-destined to commit. The two teenagers are played fantastically by the then unknown Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynsky. With the now expected excellent direction from the future superstar Peter Jackson. Here you can actually feel Jackson playing and experimenting with some of the styles he later used to such great effect in the LOTR trilogy. The supporting cast are very good and we are drawn into a real mixture of emotions that is the wrong directors hands could have been an absolute disaster. But we go through the full range of emotions from shock to sympathy to repulsion leady up to the truly shocking ending. Stunning stuff that I will certainly view many times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I felt sorry for poor Juliet Hulme. Her father, Dr. Hulme, was a cold fish and her mother, Hilda, was self-centered beyond belief. They left their daughter at a very young age in a sanitarium for five years and never visited her? How cruel!Honora Parker had nerve calling her daughter Pauline a "tart" when she was living with a man to whom she was never married for years - Wendy and Pauline were not their only children. A boy, Herbert, born before Wendy lived only days and a daughter, Rosemary, born after Pauline, was so severely retarded she had to be institutionalized at the age of 3. Having given birth to no less than four children by a man who was still married to another woman, Honora had no room to cast aspersions on her daughter's morals.Herbert Reiper was thick as a plank - "unhealthy" meant "not getting any fresh air."Why did that boarder, John, keep pushing himself on Pauline, when he had to know that she was only 14 years old? And why were Herbert and Honora so ready to believe the worst of their own daughter when John was old enough to have known better? He should have been the one blamed, being the adult.The psychiatrist was so laughable - someone would "outgrow" being gay?Both sets of parents made a huge mistake trying to keep the girls apart - opposition only makes things worse.Not that Honora Parker deserved to be murdered for that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film for the first time last night and I knew before the credits even rolled up that it was going to be my type of movie. Not only that but it has also found its way into my favourites. Before Peter Jackson went for the whole big-budget, multi-Oscar winning Lord of the Rings trilogy, he crafted this subtle, gorgeous masterpiece, based on true facts.It must have been an exciting time for anyone in the film business, because two new promising talents were born. Although Kate Winslet was fantastic as her passionate, spirited Juliet, the real star in my eyes was Melany Lynskey, portraying the two contrasting innocence and menace with verve and pure talent. It's a shame she hasn't gone on to the levels of admiration as Winslet has, but no matter. Their on-screen relationship was electrifying and tragic at the same time, all beautifully set off with the captivating setting and wonderful direction.This film is good for anyone (such as myself) who likes to lose themselves in a fantasy world of art, literature and passion, even if it means your friendships become a little too close and drives you to murder to keep it going. I'll admit the end made me cry, but more importantly inspired me to...well, keep hold of my fantasy world as tightly as possible. Sod it, I'm fifteen...life's too short.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unusually serious Peter Jackson movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS!!!Peter Jackson was known for his splatter movies before he made "Heavenly Creatures".With films "Bad Taste" and "Braindead" he created a whole new niche in horror being an over the top extremely funny and bloody sub genre.I still believe that "Braindead" is his best effort yet (yes even better than the Lord of the Rings trilogy which is a little bit overrated if you ask me).But "Heavenly Creatures" is probably his second best movie ever.The story is based on true events that occurred in New Zealand in the 1950's.It is nice to see that such a story can be recreated with style on celluloid.Kate Winslet,in her first movie role,puts down a very realistic and convincing performance as Juliet and the second leading lady,Melanie Lynskey who plays Pauline, is also in great form.These two girls make the movie better than it already is,because they appear in almost every scene.Besides the leading performances there are some great supporting roles by Sarah Peirse and Simon O'Connor as Pauline's parents. Although it is a very serious movie with "real" persons Peter Jackson still creates his usual over the top characters like the rev. Norris,a copy of Orson Welles ("the most hideous person alive") and of course his own cameo (Jackson plays a bum outside a theater).The violence at the end is long awaited and not surprising since it is announced pretty soon.Still,the actual killing of Pauline's mother is the best scene of the movie in which Jackson creates a tension that is truly riveting.Even when it is not really surprising.All that is obviously accomplished by the splendid acting of the three actresses involved in the scene.It is a shame that Peter Jackson never made more of these movies,because he surely has got the talent.But I have to say that his strength lies in creating fantastic stories with fantastic bloody effects. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Love knows no bounds nor does teenage frustration. From the beginning you think this is going to be about some troubled local girl meets an out of towner, who is everything she is not, and becomes a 'complete person'. Vomit. The girls find happiness, gain confidence and then the troubles come--and are resolved--but this film takes the other road and is worth the ride through intense psychological hysteria, pain and fear. In teenager world the general crap feeling teters between melancholy and violence. The future is not bright and why should it be for anyone else, feelings to regret and eradicate.The dream sequences are fluid between the real and the imagined, plenty violent and thus traumatic/memorable. The dreams the girls share are pleasant compared to their lives, one has her mother and her mistress living with her father, living in a threesome, this would drive any child mad. Polygamy is not all its crack'd up to be.The mother and child disunion at the end reveals the sociopathic behavior of the girls to kill. The walk down to the shore in the final act is difficult wrought with anxiety, butterflies knotting the stomach and struggling to watch the girl's evil manifest. Peter Jackson, unlike most, has distinction in his movies. Monsters, ghosts, dreams, trauma beneath the stunning landscapes of New Zealand, though Washington State is just as brilliant in areas like the dunes of Moses Lake, the Grand Coulee and Ritzville before Helena blew her top.This was written in haste.

		<shortDescription>An intimate and gripping exploration of true-crime events.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: This review contains no definite spoilers, but there are strong references to the nature of the film's conclusion.With Heavenly Creatures (1994), director Peter Jackson grips his audience and holds them in the feverish minds of Pauline and Juliet, young teenaged girls who enter into a mutual fantasy so intense that it damages their grip on reality, leading both girls to behave with shocking brutality when they are threatened with separation. The film is based on the story of a true crime committed in New Zealand in 1954, and Jackson's meticulous attention to detail is almost misleading; his exposure of the girls' friendship is so intimately internal that it seems sympathetic toward the desperation of their private attachment and their violent resolve. But only by miring the audience in the mentality of the girls' obsession with one another and the details of their exclusive fantasy world is Jackson able to achieve the chilling lurch into reality that results from the girls' ultimate behavior. Melanie Lynskey (Pauline) and Kate Winslet (Juliet) give fine, disturbing performances as two apparently normal, lonely adolescents who come together as if magnetized to create an escapist world all their own and then cannot - will not - exhume themselves from it. Both actresses successfully portray the turbulence of internal darkness and flights of childish fancy that comprise adolescence, coupled with a mutual desire for escapism that is so fierce and binding as to unbalance them both; their love is all-consuming and their terror of separation so well played that it inspires compassion - until the moment they set in motion their horrific choice. Then, compassion and sympathy are out the window, and Jackson leaves only the cold shock of reality in its place - on the actresses' faces and in the sickening brutality of the film's final moments, which are almost too real - visually and aurally - to stomach. Heavenly Creatures is in no way a pleasant film; instead, Jackson lures the audience into the twisted fairytale universe of two girls' minds, in order to expose the psychological escalation that triggered an unthinkable crime.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I tried to watch this movie without any thought of the 'Lord of The Rings' Trilogy, as I knew this would alter my perception of this film. I think I was not quite successful in doing this, since LoTR is my favorite movie trilogy ever. But, all in all, it did not change the fact that this is certainly one of the best films I've ever seen.If you consider the 'horror' genre as a subtype of the 'Fantasy' genre, it is possible to say that Peter Jackson is one of the greatest directors ever to deal with Fantasy. He has a very peculiar way of defining fantasy, which is seen in all his movies, from Braindead to The Return of the King. He abolishes what one would expect from the term, and creates a world where 'fantasy' is REALITY, in every way.This approach is particularly adamant in this picture, which deals with a fact that really took place in New Zealand. Two girls develop a relationship of affection that becomes a little too serious, as they start living in their own world, which becomes pathologically real and will be defended by both of the girls at whatever costs from those who trespass against it.The art direction and cinematography are nothing less than stupendous (as one would expect from the first class team that conducted the making of the Lord of The Rings movies) and the screenplay is yet another masterpiece from Fran Walsh. The result is fantastic. 10/10</fullReview>

This is a truly unbelievable movie, as it shows two very unique friends, and how far they would go, to keep from being separated.Heavenly Creatures paints a vivid and disturbing portrait of two teenage schoolgirls whose obsessive friendship leads to an unspeakable crime. This hypnotic thriller chronicles the story of Juliet Hulme and Pauline Parker from the moment they meet during the 1950's in New Zealand. Unhappy with their lives, the girls withdraw deep into a bizarre fantasy world of their joint creation. But when faced with a devastating separation, the notorious pair plots a horrifying and violent solution to stay together.I want to give great praise to director, co-producer and writer of Heavenly Creatures, Peter Jackson. He made a very intelligent movie, putting great emphasis on every minor detail. His direction for this film does many things that I like, such as showing off many great scenic views of New Zealand. With every movie I see of Jackson's, I get the feeling that I would not mind going to New Zealand for a look. Then to keep in sink with the story, Jackson beautifully recreates a time that was undoubtedly very very conservative. Then to finish it all of, we get some remarkable special effects from Jackson, that show what a weird world these best friend's allow themselves to imagine and escape to.But without a well written story, this movie would not have been as great as it was. Helping Jackson with the screenplay was Francis Welsh. I very much like how the movie opens for us, as we get the impression that something strange has happened, but we are not sure what. While the ending of the film is also very confronting, as it shows what these girls plan to do and how they do it. Then to have the story retold to us via the diary entries of Pauline was great, as you could the true feeling of what life was like for these girls and how much they cherished each other.Other interesting themes in this story include how the film deals with the issues of homosexuality, an issue I am sure people in the 1950's would have not liked to confront. It was also good to see the mental issues surrounding both Pauline and Juliet. It was clear to me that Pauline was suffering from some sort of depressive illness, showing herself to be a very mixed up and crazy person. The scenes with Pauline at the psychiatrist are great as we get a true insight into what sort of person she really is.This leads me to the great performances by the two leading ladies of Heavenly Creatures. Pauline Parker (Melanie Lynsky) was a very interesting character watch unravel before me. Firstly she seemed a very quiet shy person, but after she meets Juliet (Kate Winslet), she certainly starts to change, as they share common interests, like tenor Mario Lanza and movie star Orson Welles.What I like about Lynsky's performance is her look, especially the camera shots from above her head, where she has this scathing look on her face, of pure hatred, just brooding inside of her. Winslet, in her first major role is quite superb as this girl who seems very easy-going and hyperactive. Her change in character was also great, as she could be so 'bright' and bubbly, and then look so sad and unhappy. It was as if she was a chameleon, able to change her way at the drop of a hatThe supporting cast here is also good. The roles I like the most, include Honara Parker (Sarah Peirse), Pauline's mother, a woman who is very good to her daughter, but is treated appallingly back. The other performance is Juliet's father, Henry Hulme (Clive Merrison), who alerts the Parker's that something bad could be developing between the two girls, as they grow closer as friends.As I was watching this movie, I started to remember a movie I watched last year which also showed another unspeakable crime. That movie was the controversial 'Bully', which showed another view of teenage sexuality, and how evil young people can be. In fact the 'plan' to trick a person into a vulnerable situation in Heavenly Creatures, was almost a carbon copy of Bully. I recommend both movies if you are yet to see them. The fact that this movie is based on true life events, makes it all the more poignant for me, because a crime such as this committed back in the 1950's would have been a huge scandal, but in today's society could construed as common place.Peter Jackson has made a great movie and presented a story that obviously he thought needed telling. I am glad he did. I also want to commend the casting people for their choices, as the wrong actors playing Pauline and Juliet would have made this a bad movie to watch, but they got it right. Finally it was interesting to read, that the character of Juliet Hulme, is in real based on person by the name of Anne Perry, now a British crime novelist. From my research, this woman seems like a good person, and is still puzzled by the fact that she could help commit such an atrocity all those years ago, that this movie shows. All of us we be of that mind set after we have watched this movie, because I know I am!CMRS gives 'Heavenly Creatures': 4.5 (Very Good - Brilliant Movie)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Heavenly Creatures is a look into a real life murder case but more than that explores the world in two disturbed teenage girls minds. I caught this movie late at night on TV and I must say was riveted and stayed up till 3am to see how it ends. Great performance and a completely unique film in every way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS***I saw this film recently, a couple of days ago, Friday or Thursday night methinks (sorry, i've been really busy and I my memory is kind of messed up). Anyways, I was really interested in Lord of the Rings and I found out that the director for Lord of the Rings (Peter Jackson) also directed Heavenly Creatures...which you probably already know. So when I discovered that Heavenly Creatures was on I thought I'd give it a watch.The story is basically about two rather different girls who form an extremely strong rapport, which is both touching and very unsettling. They become so immersed in their extraordinary friendship that they start to live in a fantasy land, a paradise, and soon they realise that the paradise wouldn't exist without eachother. Between their experimental lesbian encounters and driftings into fantastical realms, one of the girl's mothers stands in there way, threatening to separate them which eventually leads to her horrific demise, at the hands of her daughter and her daughter's best friend...The acting in this film was excellent, one of the film's strong points. Melanie Lynskey did well pulling off her subdued character (Pauline Rieper) and Kate Winslet was excellent in her flashy, energetic role (Juliet Hulme).The directing was really good as well, the seamless transitions between reality and fantasy were amazing and the opening to the film (similar to that of The Hole) was excellent and captivated me straight away. The music in the film was kind of bland and didn't really stand out but I guess it wasn't really supposed to anyway?I found the film deeply disturbing, I don't like the idea that two people can be so consumed in each other that they'll murder one of their own mothers to stay close to eachother. I liked the dialogue and to be honest I think the two girls make a cute couple, it is evident in the film how right they are for eachother, how they slot together like two pieces of a jig-saw puzzle.The biting irony at the ending was bitter and also one of the most disturbing parts of the film is that ... it makes you think that, from the two girl's point of view, murdering Pauline's mother Honoria Rieper (Sarah Peirse) was sickeningly just. The film exploits both girls and gets inside Pauline's dark mind through the use of her diary.I thoroughly enjoyed the film however I felt that in some parts it was slow paced and I couldn't help myself feeling disgusted in some parts. The fact that this film is based on real events made this even worse... I know it was 1994 but some of the special effects looked shoddy and I think the whole lesbian aspect of the film needn't have been included.At the end ... I'm not quite sure. During the film I felt a whirlwind of emotions; awe, disgust, at times laughter, joy and fear.I'm not sure now if I deeply regret watching this disturbing and depressing film ... or if I am really thankful I saw a brilliant, intriguing film. I must admit though, it is overrated (probably due to the controversy surrounding the film) and I expected a little more but overall it was a good film.B+- Milla.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant but very disturbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Jackson's name has been made with Lord of the Rings and watching this made me think that fantasy worlds must have an appeal for him. These two girls create a fantasy world and the way he presents this world through special effects is brilliant. He was doing some ground work for Lord of the Rings. However, J R R Tolkien did not let Middle Earth consume his life in the way that Misses Parker and Hulme let Bonrovia consume theirs. This is shown in the way in which they completely disregard teachers' instructions in their lessons at school and paint pictures of and write essays about their fantasy kingdom. One other correspondent says this film demonstrates how homophobia can kill. Well, the murder of poor Mrs Rieper was an extremely wicked act which cannot be justified in any way. The parents had worked out a compromise solution to the problem whereby the girls could stay in contact. Also, how could Pauline kill her own mother? I don't know if this is what happened in reality but when they first brain her with the half brick in the stocking she lets out a scream of agony. You can almost feel the blow. Normal humanity should have made them stop. But they continue hitting her until she's unconscious and then dead. And they'd set her up for it, doing things like dropping the jewel on the ground and making her look at it. Wicked! The girls were also living in a fantasy world thinking they'd get away with it. Yes, homosexuality was not tolerated in those days and was illegal in most countries. But even nowadays, in today's permissive and tolerant climate, no parent ever truly welcomes the news that their son or daughter is gay. Dr Hulme can't face it and when Mrs Rieper takes Pauline to the doctor the doctor has his face turned to the window and says "homosexuality" to Mrs Rieper like he's afraid of the word. Most of the other characters are portrayed favourably. Dr Hulme is portrayed as a rather stuffy man and his wife is exposed as a hypocrite when it turns out she's sleeping with one of the clients from her marriage guidance clinic. Mr Rieper is an easy-going fun-loving man who makes fun of the way his daughter takes Mario Lanza's music so seriously by saying to her "so that's that great Irish singer, Murray O'Lanza" and lip synching to her Mario Lanza record with a fish to his mouth. He is evidently a pleasant man who had a very bad thing happen to him. When the pervert lodger climbs into bed with Pauline (paedophilia is nothing new) he is justifiably angry and Mrs Rieper tells Pauline that the fact that she did nothing to discourage him from climbing into bed with her reduced her father to tears. But he is still in the mood for jokes when Dr Hulme comes round and expresses his concern at the intensity of the girls' friendship. Mrs Rieper is portrayed as a kindly housewife. But Pauline and Juliet are at best, two rather silly girls. Their life revolves round the fantasy world they have created and they are shown as very foolish in the scene where they both strip to their underwear in the middle of the woods while singing The Donkey Serenade in off-key voices, walk to the edge of the woods not expecting to see anyone and encounter a farmer hammering in a signpost who touches his hat and says "g'day" to them. Their murderous tendencies are shown in scenes faintly reminiscent of Billy Liar's fantasies about machine gunning people (and he created his own fantasy world as well, namely Ambrosia). When Juliet is in the sanatorium a hellfire preacher tells her that modern medicine will not necessarily save her from dying from TB and pushes an evangelical tract in her hand. He rants away at her and she fantasises about one of the clay figures from Bonrovia dragging the preacher away and beheading him. Well, maybe that was justified. I mean, the preacher had wished her dead first. However, in a similar fashion, Pauline fantasises about the same clay figure impaling the doctor on a sword. A very good film, showing how wicked and inexcusable murder is. Once you have committed murder you have not only ended another human being's life your own life will never be the same again even if you are released from prison. Pauiline and Juliet were forbidden to have any further contact with each other as a condition of their release and both had to assume new identities. Pauline even tried entering a convent and Juliet never married. This film is a cautionary tale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mario Lanza featured in this fine film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would like to discuss a movie we enjoyed last night that has a strong tie-in with Mario Lanza, namely the 1994 film set in New Zealand,"Heavenly Creatures". This is based on the true story of two adolescent girls who become best friends and eventually develop an obsession with each other while living in the fantasy world they create. They worship Mario Lanza, the man and his music, and throughout the film the viewer is treated to many fine songs and Lanza visuals. First you hear "Be My Love" as Pauliine plays it on her parent's Hi-Fi (this was 1952..no stereo yet!). (Inaccuracy: she pulls the black labelled LP out of the famous red Student Prince cover!) Later, they find "Cavalcade of Show Tunes" at Juliet's house and another black label record falls onto the turntable playing the first cut of "Donkey Serenade". (Inaccuracy..wrong song!) Still later, there is a delightful sequence involving dancing and romping the countryside to "Funiculi, Funicula". (Innacuracy: he hadn't recorded this cut from the Mario! album yet) Then a young man dressed like Lanza in Great Caruso lip syncs to "Loveliest Night of the Year". We see photos of Mario hanging in the girls' bedrooms, see large poster of "Great Caruso", and even see a life sized animated singing clay Mario. Also, there are many references to Lanza throughout..."the greatest tenor in the world", etc.! Great funny line from a father, who says: "Mari O'Lanza...an Irishman, not an Italian". Mario sings "You'll Never Walk Alone" during the end credits.The British film is wonderfully photographed and has brilliant directorial touches from Peter Jackson. It's an enjoyable movie, but deals with serious issues as murder, lesbianism, etc., and consequently feels rather odd.The quality of the sound is excellent on the DVD with 5.1 Dolby Digital sound. Hope you get to enjoy it as well!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've just finished watching Heavenly Creatures, and have to say its one of the best films ive ever seen, it was beautifully written and the acting was out of this world. I did see this film when it came out in the early 90s but maby i didn't appreciate it as much, and because it was a true story made it even more fasinating, these two girls really did live in a fantasy world to kill such an unfortunate woman, who happened to be one of there mothers and the scenes in how and where it was done gave me a chill to the bone.But the most disturbing part of the film is at the end credits, when you realised just how much they paid for there crime, one got 4 years then released, and the other only a discusting 2 weeks, they were both let off on the understanding they were never to see each other again, and being this the reason they carried out the horrific murder was maby to some eyes the perfect punishment they well deserved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant, provocative, on the edge of inexcusable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most important point about Heavenly Creatures can be summed up as follows: This movie takes a profoundly dicey chance on being a gut-level apologia for matricide. Imagine an alternate universe _The Sound of Music_ where Julia Andrews/Maria decides that it's in the best interests of the children she governs that their cold, emotionally distant father be killed while on a stroll in the countryside. Imagine the director setting up the storyline to lend a kind of credence to this fateful decision. This is what Heavenly Creatures does, and does with finely deployed devices of cinematic storytelling. It's these "traditional" storytelling devices (straight narrative, voiceovers, "dateline" sequencing, music, humor, good character development) so effectively used to reveal murderous intent that makes this a daring, glaring look at the ultimate taboo; the idea that someone might "deserve" to die, and the murderers can be forgiven, if not thanked. If it seems I'm being a bit harsh with the director, allow me to qualify by pointing out this is the natural concomitant to Jackson's key decision; to commit himself to expressing the point of view of the girls, as he sees it. And he does just that, and Heavenly Creatures is a document of that commitment.That said (and, as if all that weren't dark enough), there is a dark side to all this. It relates to the fact that, when all is said and done, it's sobering to realize the portrayal of the girls is necessarily the product of subjective artistic processes. So in the end, it's very much Jackson's projection onto the girls of an inner need to vindicate them on some level. I'm telling you; this is a scary, taboo movie.And I would say this tells you everything you really need to know to decide whether you want to watch this movie or not.Have a look.P.S.: I have been wondering how Jackson was able to convince investors to give *him* the money to make the Ring Trilogy. He didn't have a particularly lengthly or impressive filmography. Did he convince them with a "bang-for-the-buck" dog-and-pony show?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie that made Peter Jackson the new Terry Gilliam</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Heavenly creatures" was the simply marvelous movie that finally gave Peter Jackson some earned credit as a talented serious director and this film also made him the new Terry Gilliam. Both of these ingenious directors started out with comedy. Not very light comedy, though. Terry Gilliam was a member of the beloved anarchistic Monty Python group and Jackson directed three incredibly violent, sick and disgustingly hilarious splatter comedies ("Bad taste", "Meet the Feebles" and "Braindead") that obviously became instant cult classics. Afterwards Gilliam started to direct extremely eccentric masterpieces like "The Fisher king", "Twelve monkeys" and "Fear and loathing in Las Vegas". Peter Jackson's "Heavenly creatures" reminds me of Gilliam's works. It's an imaginative and absurd mixture of facts and fiction, it introduces strange, hypnotic worlds where anything can happen, it's visually wild, beautiful and striking and it has absolutely superb camerawork full of stylish zooming, sliding and close-up's. This was the first proof that Peter Jackson was the right man to direct J.R.R. Tolkien's larger-than-life trilogy "The Lord of the Rings".</fullReview>

It's especially interesting for me, being a fourteen year old girl myself, because I can relate to the characters of Juliet and Pauline. Well, without the obsessive relationship of course. And I have lived in Christchurch all my life, so it's a buzz to see what my school was like in the 50s!! The acting is realistic and believable, and I like how they worked in the two girls' fantasies of Charles and Deborah! Although it's almost bizarre at times, it's a sobering movie and definitely one of my favourites.</fullReview>

While, by comparison, Heavenly Creatures is leaps and bounds better, HC just lacks the charm of Bad Taste.But on the other hand, I think HC gave Jackson a bit more credibility too. I mean, after seeing Bad Taste and Dead Alive, would you really expect Lord of the Rings to not be a let down?</fullReview>

The way the girls interact is beautiful. Kate and Melanie manage to bring forth amazing emotions by the simplest of actions.One detail I liked very much was the artistry the girls show in clay models, which appear quite frequently throughout their dreams and fantasies.I reccomend this movie for adults, and teenagers over thirteen only.

		<fullReview>"Heavenly Creatures" has succeeded in portraying the extremes of young adulthood as I myself saw them at that age. Everything was either perfectly lovely or perfectly horrendous, and there was not a grown-up in the world who could understand this. I didn't go to the lengths that Pauline and Juliet did, but I remember the emotions well, and this film brought them back with amazing vividness and empathy. The brilliance of the script, direction, performances, and special effects combine to create an aura of realism, even in the fantasy scenes, that often is lacking in stories based on truth.The tragedies in "Heavenly Creatures" are abundant, but the most dismaying, to me, was the fact that two young women felt themselves to be so misunderstood, so different, and so unfairly maligned, that they took drastic measures to prevent their separation. Their master plan was thwarted by real complications that neither of them had considered. Pauline and Juliet were otherwise incredibly intelligent, perhaps geniuses, and they let emotion cloud their beings to the point where they committed an unforgivable act rather than even try to find a logical solution or compromise. Juliet Hulme is now known as mystery author Anne Perry, whose books are well-written and imaginative, but not as extraordinary and magical as her adolescent masterpieces. Very little is known about where Pauline Parker is today, and what she is doing. If Pauline's and Juliet's families had not attempted to forcibly part them, chances are they would eventually have produced legendary literature together. What a waste of talent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two such Heavenly Creatures....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From New Zealand horror auteur Peter Jackson comes an unlikely film. Set in the 1950's this factual based account follows the lives of two teenagers named Pauline Parker ( Melanie Lynskey) and Juliet Hume ( Kate Winslet) whose bizarre relationship leads to unexpected behavior and tragic results. Pauline is a typical adolescent girl, a non-conformist who feels ostracized from everyone around her until she meets Juliet. Juliet is of a wealthy British upper class who moves to New Zealand. She meets Pauline and they have an instant connection. Both are partial to Mario Lanza ( the worlds greatest tenor), have a passion for writing and creating stories as well as art. The girls vivid and powerful imaginations allow them to create virtual fantasy worlds that they immerse themselves in to repress reality itself.As the story unfolds and their relationship grows increasingly intense the girls parents try to separate them. Peter Jackson has an incredible visual sense. He perfectly balances the world of fantasy with reality. The aesthetic look of the film is astonishing and convincing throughout. Both of the two leads give extrordinary performances and have a dynamic chemistry. Their relationship is very credible, you never doubt their behavior or actions for a minute. Overall a very unconventional and original movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful Madness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No one captures "frenzy" quite like Peter Jackson. With his intertwining use of shaky, still, loud, and suspiciously quiet moments, his filmmaking style can absolutely *define* the emotion of momentarily losing your mind.With "Dead Alive", he gained much lauding by making a winking schlock movie, a film so revved up on its own excessive fantasmagoria that it eventually burped up an impressively maddened comedy. Jackson had used this kind of soak-'em-with-everything-you-got philosophy before with "Bad Taste" and "Meet The Feebles". Although, unlike "Alive", those two films do not carry the same sort of coherent slapstick that makes Jackson's horror hilarious. Like all good directors, Jackson realized that, at some point, he had to shake off the fleeting applause and take things to the next plateau. And so he did. In "Heavenly Creatures", his fourth outing, Peter Jackson took the rambunctious glee of his past three films and combined it with a quiet tale of true crime. The amalglam of his jumpy sensibility and the subtle, dark personality of Pauline Parker and Juliet Hulme (played perfectly by Melanie Lynsky and Kate Winslet) makes for an extrordinarily colorful film. To see his imagination and the lengths he'll go to to re-create the situation of two obsessive teenagers in 1950s New Zealand mesh with the stale, flat reality of how sad these girls lives really were is a marriage made in heaven (or is it Borovnia?). The gray existence they (are forced to) lead is the true villain of them, and the director captures it (see: bathtub scenes) as cinematically as he does their fantasy world escape (the aforementioned Borovnia: expansive, three dimensional home of lifesize clay warriors, unicorns, and jumbo butterflies). This movie does not act as an explanation nor an excuse, simply as an adaptation of an emotion. When it gets down to it, the true frenzy of "Heavenly Creatures" is the unmoving *love* that two people can have for each other, and the unnecessary graves they will dig to not let it go.*****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit, this film did not start the way I thought it would. The segment prior to the credits was, indeed, one of the best I have ever seen; it was certainly the most disturbing thing I've ever watched (this from an avid David Cronenberg fan). But fifteen minutes later I was thinking, "This is a disaster!" See Peter Jackson operate his camera on crack, see Peter Jackson force the story along at Mach 2, see Peter Jackson conjure melodrama from nothing to feed Kate Winslet's ego. Grrrr, Peter Jackson! His directing, plus the obscene overacting of the two actresses (especially Winslet) turned the movie into a farce. By the time the lovers were gallavanting through "the Fourth World," I'd become completely desensitized to the zaniness and resigned myself to cynically enduring the remainder of the story.  And therein lies the genius. Jackson numbed my mind to his own ridiculous imagery, and eventually won me over to the side of the lovers. I accepted further fantasy sequences without a second thought, and by the end they had taken on a kind of sinister beauty. I left the theatre ten times richer for having seen 'Heavenly Creatures,' and while I can't in good consciense recommend it to my friends (who would stop it long before they saw it's merit), I felt it was an obligation to recommend it to you. A great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best opening scene of any movie - ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The shocking, intriguing and attention grabbing opening scene of this movie flashes back and forth between the two blood soaked girls, screaming and tearing through the forest, and the two golden sun drenched happy girls running and laughing on a boat, in their fantasy world. If you see the beginning of this movie, you will NOT stop watching. It's terrifying and horrific yet glorious and ecstatic at the same time. It just gets better from there. You are taken on the ride of your life into the dark, demented fantasy world of the girls, told with original special effects, dizzying camera work, heart pounding music and perfect performances. This film is HIGHLY underrated - a definate must see!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Heavenly Creatures was not only the best film of 1994,in my opinion it is probably one the best films of the decade. A flawless masterpiece that is even better in it's un-cut 108min New Zealand version.I had eagerly awaited this film after hearing so much wonderful feedback from NZ and wasn't disappointed. I left the cinema emotionally drained and couldn't quite comprehend the remarkable achievement that I had just witnessed until several hours later. My only quibble was when I found out that the film I had seen was the 95 min international version. Although I have heard since that director Peter Jackson was satisfied with this, I can't understand the reasoning behind this: is not the original vision the truest to form?I believe that Sarah Pierse who played Honora Parker was worthy of a supporting actress Oscar, however all the performances were spot on; the direction and screenplay flawless and the forth world was surreal and stunning.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was perhaps one of the best films of the nineties, however, few have taken the opportunity to view it. Jackson tells the true story of matricide with a touch which few directors could accomplish. He gets a stellar performance out of Kate Winslet, far better then the one she won an award for. Heavenly Creatures is a powerful story of love and insanity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kate Winslet at 18</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Christchurch, New Zealand, 1952: two school girls become friends and swoon over Mario Lanza, "world's greatest tenor," as they create a fantasy world of royalty and intense emotional attachment to one another. This is teen escapism carried to the nth degree. Innocence and wholesome fun do NOT prevail. As the parents grow increasingly concerned about their daughters' obsessive relationship, the girls begin to hate the parents... Based on a rather shocking (for its time) true story. Kate Winslet made her film debut in this modest comdie noire from way down under. It is amazing to realize that three years later she starred in the Academy Award winning Titanic (1998), on her way to establishing herself as one of the most charismatic and talented stars of the past decade. In retrospect, her budding talent is apparent here as the spinning, laughing, crazy teen who went off the deep end emotionally. There is no mistaking the sharp, confident and commanding Winslet style. Despite the part, Kate looks as wholesome and delicious as apple pie with cherry vanilla ice cream, yet manages to convey the demented edge necessary to the role.Full-figured and brooding Melanie Lynskey is intriguing and not easily forgotten as Kate's manic/depressive friend. Director Peter Jackson is to be commended for getting the most out of the girls, and for making their fantasy world believable. We can imagine how they fell into it.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"

		<shortDescription>The greatest film about love that I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw Heavenly Creatures when it first came out and, like a lot of people, I was completely riveted by it. Much has been made of the use of special effects, but for me that's the least interesting part of the film. What shook me up about it, then and now, is the intensity and raw honesty of the portrayal of the relationship between the two girls- both of the performances are a revelation. The director has to be credited with the brilliant use of pacing in the film, which mirrors the inner life of the characters in an amazing way. How one interprets the overall theme of film will probably vary from person to person- but for me this is the most painfully real love story I've EVER seen in any film. It cuts to the heart of what it feels like to be in the throes of passion. How those internal feelings and desires are enacted in the real world can indeed be tragic, and the film spares the viewer nothing. This is easily one of my all-time favorite films. It's interesting how godawful dull Peter Jackson's other films are- at least the ones I've seen. But he did make this one masterpiece, a film that once seen can never be forgotten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The low budget Heavenly Creatures very subtly introduces us into the lives of two young girls. Their fantasies seem innocent but slowly they drift into madness and murder.The pace of Heavenly Creatures follows the moods of the girls well, picking up quickly with camera movement and sharp editing at the end. The special effects depicting their imaginary world are very interesting, in a sense bringing a doll house or sand castle to life. But the best part of the movie for me was the performances by the two leads, especially Kate Winslet who is fabulous in her first film. Heavenly Creatures grows on you. It seems straight forward but before you realize it, you are in a crazy world. One of the few murder mysteries with which Hitchcock would have been proud.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was at the world premier of this film in 1994 in Wellington and as it ended there was a spontaneous standing ovation from the audience which lasted several minutes. It is obvious why - not only is it the best film ever made in New Zealand but one of the best made anywhere. There is virtually nothing about the screenplay (which is highly authentic) and the direction that can be faulted. Those ultra picky might see the occasional cliche - but nothing drags or bores, the acting is convincing and the presentation of the girls' fantasies is sublime. 10 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>what a beautiful vision</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After independently directing 2 gross, if not hilarious films, Bad Taste and Dead Alive, Peter Jackson goes in a different direction, in giving us a lush, cinematic art film. Practically everything in the film is great. The photography, cinematography, camera work. The special effects were so fluid, and realistic. The effects are better looking than star wars episode one, because the effects are so subtle, and you wouldn't even know, that the butterfly was really a computer image. Excellent visuals! The two leads are amazing, and very impressive. Though, you might already know the ending to the film, but once you really see it, it gives you goose bumps, and it leaves you paralyzed, and you say to yourself: oh my God. The opening and closing scenes forever haunt me. And the final screams we hear before the concluding messages, are forever stuck inside my head, and i will never get it out. An odd, masterful film by Peter Jackson.I was so impressed with the special effects, that i have total faith in Peter. Jackson is directing the upcoming trilogy THE LORD OF THE RINGS, which would contain an abbundance of visual effects. Sometiimes, effects turn me off, especially if they are so outlandish. But Heavenly Creatures proves to me, that Jackson has potential, to use the effects to his benefit. I believe in you Peter, don't dissapoint us!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskey, both in their film debuts, star as Juliet and Pauline, two girls who meet through a boarding school and form a dangerously close friendship, one that disturbs their parents and especially Pauline's mother. Their fantasy creations and playacting causes their parents to question their buddy system, so their friendship is in turn threatened. They resort to plotting murder in order to keep their friendship alive. I particularly liked the way "Heavenly Creatures" did not turn out like so many of these types of thrillers, where one friend ends up as the conspirator or the evil element of the two. Both Juliet and Pauline are part of the crime they commit, an act that could not have been done by one alone. Kudos to the intensely chilling and suspenseful murder at the end of the picture; it will not be soon forgotten. Rating: Three stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was 17 in the annus mirabilis of 1994, when you could stumble blindly into a theater and be treated to the likes of Naked, Man Bites Dog, Ed Wood, Short Cuts, or this movie, Heavenly Creatures. Heavenly isn't the best of the lot -- Naked takes that honor -- but it is the most purely cinematic head rush. As I told one of my friends at the time, "It's like Brian DePalma with a brain."Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynsky make splashy screen debuts as the two hyperimaginative girls who try, and fail, to rise above the mundanity of life in 1950's New Zealand. Lynsky is thoroughly convincing as the awkwardest of awkward teens, whereas the casting of the lushly apportioned Winslet confirms Peter Jackson's penchant for pulpous blondes with British accents. In this respect, Kate is the inheritor of a noble tradition stemming all the way back to Heidi the Hippo from Jackson's earlier film Meet the Feebles.I can't keep it up. Look -- I have long held a candle for Miss Winslet that neither Titanic, her fluctuating weight, or even her recent title switch to Mrs. Winslet can do anything to extinguish; unfortunately, it's one of MY noble traditions to mock, as mercilessly as possible, what I can never attain. Sigh. Anyway, watch this movie and behold the gloriously creamy-skinned source of my forlornness. Far from being corpulent in Heavenly Creatures, Kate is downright wasp-waisted. And as for her British accent, let's just say that overenunciation hasn't been this foxy since the heyday of James Mason. Swoon.Oh yeah -- the movie itself. I watched it on laserdisc today and must admit that I was a bit less intoxicated than previously. It's far from badly constructed, but the problem is that, as beautiful as the finished edifice unquestionably is, all its joints are allowed to show. Most of the scenes are too pat and build to punchlines you can see a mile down the road. The whole screenplay just has an unsavory whiff of Screenwriting 101 -- not surprisingly, it got an Academy Award nomination.On the bright side, the cinematography is beautiful and the performances are inspired. And Kate Winslet looks much better when she's not in billowing period garb. Or starring opposite 120-pound wonders like Leonardo DiCaprio.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>New Zealand shock-meister Peter Jackson (Bad Taste, Meet the Feebles, Dead-Alive) claws out of the gutter and into a great movie. His vigorous direction and sly script give this film a level of vitality that is rare. Looking for something that could be improved, I am stumped. The final scene of extraordinary violence is controlled (This is noteworthy; Jackson's own Dead-Alive was such a blood fest that any sense of control is washed away in its, literal, floods) and, more surprisingly, shocking. So much violence is available in cinema now that it seems the only method left to shock an audience is to increase the already mind-numbing quantities of it and the, equally mind-numbing, qualities of disgustingness (All of Jackson's previous films presented as evidence). But here a relatively brief, and not so gory, scene of violence occurs that can only be described by the acute observer as the most disturbing in recent history.</fullReview>

I am thankful that the Academy Oscar nominated the wonderful screenplay, but still cannot believe that it was overlooked for Best Picture, Director, Actress (Lynskey and Winslet), Supporting Actress (Sarah Peirse) and Visual Effects.

		<fullReview>I can't really say I've seen anything quite like this. It contained images of fantasy both wonderful and terrible. Everything you see through the two girl's eyes seems in many ways to be a different world; their fantasy is messed with reality to such an extent that it seems their world truly is the way they picture it. The bond between them seems incomprehensible in many ways, based on friendship, sexuality, and shared knowledge of a world that only they can appreciate. I wonder what forces of the time they lived in caused events in their lives to take the paths they did. Compared to many films I have seen recently this one contains far more life and emotion. In many area's the way the movie was filmed seemed to perfectly complement its contents. Many scenes seemed to be likened to a hazy memory of long ago. I feel this effect greatly contributed to the impact at the end. Despite its disturbing nature I really liked the film and recommend it to anyone who would like to try something different from today's mainstream movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extraordinary Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We begin with newsreel footage of idyllic 1950s Christchurch, New Zealand, with lake rowers, colorful gardens, and well-to-do men and women cheerfully tottering about town.Then come the screams, amplifying until we cut to a steadicam shot running through trees, then to a house where a woman emerges to see investigate the noises. She sees teenage girls Juliet Hulme and Pauline (Reiper) Parker emerge frantically from the woods, covered head-to-toe in blood. "It's Mummy! She's been terribly hurt!" shouts Pauline. Meanwhile Juliet nearly collapses in desperation, crying "PLEASE! HELP US!" This is the opening of Peter Jackson's shocking, extraordinary film which effectively blends modern drama with fantasy and visceral horror. It's the gateway project that evolved Jackson from an inventive low-brow horror director (Bad Taste, Dead-Alive) to the premiere auteur of "Lord of the Rings" and "King Kong." Speculate all you want about others, but he is this generation's Spielberg, a visionary filmmaker with ambition, depth, and a musician's ear for pacing. (One only wishes Sam Raimi of "Evil Dead" fame could have blossomed the same way).The film tells the tale of two 15-year-old girls, the socially awkward Pauline Reiper (a shy, chubby Melanie Lynskey) and the new girl in town-- frenetic, bipolar, and incorrigibly imaginative Juliet Hulme (an intoxicatingly charismatic Kate Winslet, in her debut). They're polar opposites, Pauline dreadfully timid and Juliet vivacious and without boundaries. It's precisely why they become inseparable and form an unhealthy codependency on one another, particularly since they lack other friends. Spending late nights dreaming up fantasy worlds and role-playing lascivious engagements with famous singers and movie stars, the girls become utterly ensconced in a world of pure illusion that no one-- especially their parents-- can tap into.Jackson takes this material and goes after it with full steam, complete with dazzling visuals like enormous butterflies, full-motion clay figurines, and CGI facial morphing-- all the more impressive in 1995, when CGI was just beginning to surface in cinema. But it's just as impressive to see Jackson carefully weave these innovative effects into a tale of adolescent jealousy without falling to the temptation of reverting back to horror/fantasy. Not once does he show an effects scene where we lose tone of the story and feel like something is funny or gross for the sake of being so.It's precisely why this film works, and why the startling conclusion is so deeply disturbing. We know every element of terror is just fantasy until we encounter the real thing. And when it happens, we see it exactly the way Pauline and Juliet did. Horrifyingly. Here, murder is truly horrific in ways most of us would never want to experience in real life.This is one of those films I viewed without expectations, but discovered I couldn't turn my eyes away from it. I found myself fully alert, holding my breath, keeping my jaw from dropping throughout its 100 minute running time. The rigorous pacing by editor Jamie Selkirk, sparkling photography by Alun Bollinger, a spellbinding score by Peter Dasent, coupled with Fran Walsh/Jackson's gutsy script and Jackson's energetic camera-work, instantly made me a fan of rogue art-house cinema. It couldn't have pleased me more to see Winslet move on to become a star and Jackson earn an Oscar for "The Return of the King" a decade later.I recently saw the unrated extended cut on DVD, and I recommend the original version. The addition of several scenes, particularly ones where Pauline imagines gory ways to off her parents, do precisely what I felt the first cut restrained from doing. The original version is best because it takes itself seriously.And it ought to, because the crime, while fascinating, is no laughing matter. It's shocking, tragic, yet in many ways completely understandable. We spend a few hours getting drawn into the world of young Pauline and Juliet, and we can totally see how they've gotten seduced by their own spell. Jackson shows us how an untamed imagination can be vast, menacing and even deadly. Roger Ebert describes the climax as "a mob of only two people where each is waiting for the other to yell stop." He's absolutely right. Here, the terror lies in the blood on our hands, and our inability to stop the inevitable from happening.It's a thinking man's horror movie, a thriller of spectacle, and a dramatic tour de force.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love Peter Jackson's earlier horror films, though Meet the Feebles is probably the one film in the back of the collection of mine, and I'm a huge fan of The Lord of the Rings -- my favorite film(s) of all-time.This is a dark and simply beautiful movie on a friendship evolving into obsession. Kate Winslet and Melanie Lenskey are great in their performances, as well as the adults. In fact, the two girls are so impressive, it's a wonder how they didn't get any Oscar consideration.Even for a low-budget, this film has a lot of style. From the fantasy visions the girls have of their writings, to the love they share for each other and the tragic ending, this is just one gorgeous film. The early stages of the Weta special effects company can be seen here, and (once again) for such a low-budget, what they did is very impressive.There's nudity in this film -- at least from the cut I saw -- mainly from the chest of Winslet and Lenskey.The music is intriguing, making me wish there was a copy of it somewhere out there in the world for me to listen to.Overall, this film is rated-R appropriately (as much as I despise the MPAA) this film has blood and nudity. Yet, Jackson does not parade those two elements, making him a man of taste. The story is brutal and heartbreaking, and I definitely recommend it to anyone with a sharp mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kate Winslet's debut performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Long before The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Peter Jackson directed the true story of two schoolgirls living in New Zealand in the early fifties who commit a horrendous crime. This movie is called 'Heavenly Creatures' and stars Pauline Parker (Melanie Lynskey) and Juliet Hulme (Kate Winslet). They form the kind of intense friendship that only two fourteen-year-old oddballs can form. Both have a history of health issues and solitary hospitalizations and are exempt from what passes as P.E. in those days.Together the girls encourage each other's rebellions against the conventions of their convent school and on the way Juliet gets involved in Pauline's writing. Through the writing they create an alternative world, very well depicted in the movie. This is a world of knights and ladies in distress where they both inhabit fictional personalities. This is a story about best friends with an element of sensual and sexual awakening but never does the viewer get the impression this is about lesbians. Threaded throughout, to add further appeal is the singing and fictionalization of Mario Lanza singing his 'hits' and also the movie 'The Third Man' ? an Orson Welles classic ? which continually underlines the almost surreal atmosphere the girls have created.The final scene shot with Madama Butterfly's Humming Chorus running through it is completely haunting and stayed in my mind long after.One enters this difficult world of Pauline and Juliet only through the skill of a gifted director and Peter Jackson does an amazing job of creating all the worlds embodied in this movie and also capturing the almost imperceptible descent into the madness of thinking that a horrendous crime could be executed without trace. Pauline's diary is threaded throughout and this is the means by which their guilt becomes known to the authorities.Some of the film is beautiful and at times lyrical but the layers of disturbance are never far away.I gave it 7.5 out of 10. It would have been more but I found the ending too abrupt, though the notes on what happened subsequent to the movie were informative. The writer Anne Perry turns out to be the Juliet of the film and Pauline teaches riding to children somewhere in England and is a devout Catholic in atonement for her crime. The girls never saw each other again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fantasy, adolescence, leadership and lesbian love. Pauline is fascinated about Juliet Hulme. She is pretty, intelligent, wealthy and she has a lovely family. The relationship between the two teenagers is so intense that everyone is completely dependent from the other.Pauline is ashamed about her own family, specially if she compare them with the Hulme family. They are highly educated. She is specially charmed about Dr. Hulme.Pauline feels that she is part of a elite, she has a fantasy: she can write novels and opera and understand the hidden imaginary world that only Juliet and Pauline have discovered.In fact, she start to hate her mother very early, her hate is inside her during almost the complete film.When she decides kill her, she justify it because her mother was the obstacle to go with Juliet to South Africa. It's absolutely false. The only possible reason was the needed signature to obtain a passport, but is rather an excuse. She wants to kill her, not because the problem that she uses to convince Juliet, but only because she hate her mother. Pauline is mentally disturbed. The day of the crime, in the house, Juliet is talking about the crime and the victim but Pauline only talk about the characters of her novel.It's true that both,Juliet and Pauline, cannot clearly separate reality from imagination. In fact, they are mostly living in an imaginary world. But Pauline is really the criminal mind and the real killer. Juliet is convinced by her lover to do that. His blame must be considered reduced.The film is excellent. Brilliant. Peter has captured the feels and minds of the teenagers and avoid to blame in excess the lesbian factor to explain the crime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>**** out of 5</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's play a little game. Talk Radio, Bully and The Elephant Man, what do these three have in common? The answer is that they are all horrifying true stores that are told with so much passion and power that there is very little room for sympathy. What does this have to do with Heavenly Creatures? Nothing really yet everything. This film is not your average true story. Although it has all of the above mentioned qualities it was the last mentioned that sets it apart. This film was made so that it can be whatever you want it to be. True there is still very little room for sympathy but only if that is the way you want it. There are many ways to interpret this film and it is all based on the viewer's own mind, but we will get into that later. And why should it be a conventional true story, when has director Peter Jackson ever followed the rules? Jackson is not just placing events in chronological order, he is doing just exactly what the two girls in this film are doing, bringing life and meaning to a story that is sometimes misunderstood. This isn't to say that the other films mentioned were dull or boring, in fact they are three of my favourite films, but it is the way Jackson allows his story to blossom and grow that is just was interesting as the events themselves. Pauline is not your average student. She goes to an all girl prep school. She sits in the back of her class with her head down only allowing her eyes to gaze up over her eyebrows every so often. She is a dark and concealed teen, she kind of reminds me of Wednesday from the Addams Family when in full uniform. Then one day into class, into her life, into her universe walked her friend, her sister, her fortune named Juliet. Juliet was an idol of perfection to Pauline, her golden hair swung down by her shoulder, her beauty shawn though out the room and she was not afraid to question the teacher's authority. In art class she is paired with Pauline after neither girls can find a partner, coincidence or fate? All up to you. Fate plays a strong role in this film but it is not thrown in your face. It is like when you want gravy on your french fries but order it separate so that you can drunk a fry in ever once in a while but don't need it on every fry. Jackson places fate at the side of your plate and if you think a taste of it would fit the film then feel free to dip or even double dip if you please, it is all up to you. The girls instantly become friends; maybe even too good of friends, possibly lovers, that is part of the story that was kept in the dark again to allow the viewer to decide. The girls wander inside their heads to a private universe that only they can see. It is a beautiful dream place with fountains of sparkling spring water and meadows of green grass. In their universe we focus on two central characters made out of clay. One is Charles (Pauline) and the other is Deborah (Juliet). This is where we see whose got what it takes to make sense of the coming events. There are many possibilities surrounding how this Shangri-La-like world connects to reality and Jackson leaves all possibilities open to interpretation. One is that because this world where unicorns roam and giant butterflies rule the sky, where knights rain, where priests are seen as goblins and Orson Wells is evil, is so beautiful to the girls that it is ugly to all outside parties. Maybe because the two central characters in this world are opposite sex Pauline and Juliet don't realise what they are doing in reality. Maybe this is an escape from their sexually frustrated ways. Could it be possible that this world resembles everything that is happiness to the girls, Pauline goes there when she looses her virginity, but when taken to a shrink she has one of the knights kill the man. Even though nothing close to reality, this alternate universe is the only thing keeping them in tune with reality. Even though it is still up in the air as to whether these two girls were real life lovers has been left in the dark; Jackson has no problem touching upon that issue. He is very out in the open about it but never lets it become perverse or voyeuristic. He always keeps a sense of style and mystery behind the love of the two girls that it only builds up the possibility given to the viewer. Being the director Jackson is and noting his past three films prior to this one (Bad Taste, Meet the Feebles and Dead Alive) he could have went two ways with this. He chose the right one. Instead of making the end event of the film wild and over-the-top he made id downright horrifying and extremely brutal. If you are wondering what I am talking about I will tell you. After their friendship is put into question and they are separated, the girls devise a plot to kill Pauline's mother. I would not be giving anything away by saying they succeed in their mission due to the fact that this is a true story but I will be sketchy on the details. All I will say was that it was possibly the hardest five minutes of film I have ever had to watch. This is Jackson's fourth low budget picture to come out of New Zealand (Jackson's home and where these events took place). His first three were all Sam Raimi style slapstick gore flicks that were both disgusting and hilarious. Here Jackson is using his talent for bigger and better things. His camera works much in tune with the girls. It spins around like the girl's life and it creates magical pictures much like the girl's minds. The New Zealand scenery is also beautiful as Jackson's camera graves over the grounds and spins up to the skies. Jackson also grabbed his first Oscar nomination for the writing of this film; his others would come from his work on Lord of the Rings. Although Jackson's unique style has allowed him to create great films it is also his major fault. The whole time I was watching this I felt like I was looking at Dead Alive, making it sometimes hard to take seriously, but that doesn't take away from the fact that Jackson is trying to make something serious with strong and powerful morals. Besides the low budget feel this film is a work of art that couldn't have been made by anyone other than Peter Jackson. The idea of another universe being used as a means for escape and to show the girls reality is woven into the great script almost magically. Also the acting from first-timers Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskey are also surprisingly good for their first major roles. You can also catch a cameo from Jackson himself as a bum walking through the town. Although it was made nothing like Talk Radio, Bully or the Elephant Man it still has as much impact and meaning, if not more, and although Jackson's campy, low-budget style has always been somewhat of an acquired taste it is one that proves not to be one acquired in vein.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An absolute masterpiece of art and deep intelligence.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The day I've seen this magic and haunting movie, I knew it would be the movie of my life, my absolute favorite. I'm very happy to get this occasion to explain why (a little, because it need more than just few phrases for it !), with the hope that other people will see it... and will love it ! HC is an absolute masterpiece of art and deep intelligence, acted by two amazing actresses with such an incredible intensity. The script of Walsh and Jackson is a pure marvel: if you know the real "Parker-Hulme murder case", it's obvious that nobody could make better, because they choice to make a psychological portrait instead of a sensational criminal story. Jackson said that HC is a "murder story about love, a murder story without villains": I totally agree. Even you can't excuse the murder, you can understand the two friends and their own special logic - in their own irrational world. For Pauline and Juliet, nothing is important but their incredible, deeply and strongly devoted friendship and try to separate them is just unthinkable... and dangerous ! This marvelous movie is so intensive that it makes you feel every feelings: beauty and horror, humor and violence, love and hate, happiness and despair... thankful to Kate and Mel who ARE really their characters. This very special relationship is fascinating: two adolescent girls so physically and socially opposite, but in fact each one has her own affective problems, a great imagination and a real love for arts, are reunited at first for the best and finally for the worst... Their mutual attachment is far beyond a simple friendship or even love: it's like an emotional and spiritual bond and these two are just one person. There were a lot of questions and points of view about the famous "Night with the Saints"'s scene: for me, even it's seems to be a love scene - in an effective physical way - it's such a delicate one, and only the literal expression of their fantasies and their special mutual devotion, without any sexual stuff. GO rent or buy this masterpiece and you'll never forget it ! It's an infinite subject of thoughts and intense feelings. For all HC-fans, there is only one formula for conclusion: "Wonderful ! Heavenly ! Beautiful ! And ours !" When you'll see it, you'll understand... Enjoy it for ever !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It would be easy enough to become a fan of movies about weird Australian schoolgirls if they were all as interesting and well done as "Picnic at Hanging Rock" and "Heavenly Creatures." This more or less true story of Paula and Juliet is nicely directed in a style almost opposite of that in Weir's "Picnic at Hanging Rock." Instead of ominous lingering tableaus, this film uses rather rapid cuts and has far more dash in its dialogue and action. The stories are equally compelling. Here, Paula and Juliet share an elaborate fantasy involving a fourth world built upon Dungeon and Dragon sorts of setting and characters, while somehow working in Mario Lanza and Orson Welles. (The claymation is pretty good.) There is a not always covert sexual underpinning to their intense friendship. It isn't offensive because both girls look kind of full blown for fourteen, and it consists of so much in the way of implication that it wouldn't be terribly perverse if they looked younger. Speaking of covert messages, the linguist Deborah Tannen has posited two different interactional styles: the masculine, in which bonding is based on shared action; and the feminine, centered on shared secrets. I have no problem with that general argument. Yet, despite her oft-repeated denials and perfunctory qualifications, Tannen clearly believes the feminine style to be better than the masculine. This movie, it is interesting to note, is a valuable corrective to her simplistic value judgments. These two girls demonstrate the feminine interactional style in esse. Boy, do they share a secret fantasy. They seem to live in a room of their own or inside each others' heads. But when things begin to go wrong -- and they do -- they have little problem bashing in the head of Paula's mother. Men may bond by going to war but women are capable of killing too -- each gender striving to maintain its own fantasy about itself. In retrospect the way the girls' relationship was handled looks bad. How dumb can parents and authority figures get? Why not leave the girls alone? Why is their infatuation with one another labeled "unhealthy" when it's only unusual? But the film wisely doesn't make those sorts of facile judgments. The parents aren't made into living horrors. They're simply worried and angry, creatures bound by the mores of the times they lived in, just as we are, although, like the parents in this movie, we are unable to step outside the box sufficiently to realize it. This is a watchable flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An underrated classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Heavenly Creatures" is a dark, beautiful, and ultimately chilling film which has not gotten the recognition it deserves.Peter Jackson accomplishes the nearly impossible task of telling a real-life murder story without demonizing either the killers or the victim, or trivializing the tragedy. He wisely steers clear of the sensationalism, homophobia, and salacious reporting which marked the trial of Pauline Parker and Juliet Hulme, and tells the story from the girls' point of view--through their writings and diary entries. We get a fascinating glimpse into the lives of two girls who created a fantasy world which eventually proved to be more compelling than their own unhappy lives, and who were starved enough for affection to commit a heinous crime in order to avoid being separated.Jackson is a master of the subtle touches that add color and life to a film. Every gesture and expression tells a story. The lighting creates the perfect mood for each scene. Hints of a breakdown in the wall between fantasy and reality are sprinkled toward the end of the film. Not a single camera shot is wasted as the story rushes inexorably to its conclusion. A few of the fantasy sequences with clay figurines are a bit over the top, but otherwise the direction was nearly perfect.In lesser hands, this story could have easily devolved into gay-baiting tabloid trash. "Teenage Lesbians Bludgeon Mum!" But here it is made clear that the relationship between Pauline and Juliet, though it involved some sexual experimentation, was that of close friends--not lovers. The violence is also kept to minimum. There are a few scenes of fantasy murder which provide a contrast to the real violence at the end. The ultimate murder scene is neither sanitized nor overly dramatized--it is truly chilling."Heavenly Creatures" leans heavily on the talents of its actresses, and they perform superbly. Sarah Peirse lends a quiet dignity to Pauline's ill-fated mother. Kate Winslet, in her first film role, is excellent as the spoiled but emotionally-neglected Juliet. The real show-stealer is Melanie Lynskey, who was dragged out of a High School drama class in New Zealand four weeks before shooting began, and gives a captivating performance as the deeply disturbed Pauline.It is a shame that this excellent film is not listed among the Top 250. I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on real events, 2 girls meet in 1950s New Zealand, fall in love, murder someone. Despite what it sounds like, this movie is NOT homophobic--that don't kill somebody because they're lesbians. Just certain circumstances bring it about, and society won't allow them to be open about their love. Peter Jackson does another great directing job (this man can do anything!), superb performances by everybody (although Winslet doesn't need to YELL all the time), very tense and suspenseful plot (you know how it's going to end, but you're still nervous as hell watching it), beautiful special effects which are seamlessly worked into reality. Fascinating, disturbing, unbelievable. DON'T MISS THIS ONE!!! However, try to see it letterboxed...the film very effectively uses wide screen which doesn't work at all in a box screen--most of the times people are talking to other people who you can't see, so you have NO idea what's going on!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hmmm...was this supposed to be a musical?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had high expectations of this film. I remember it being released in America sometime in 1994 or 1995, and from the plot and the reviews it looked brilliant. After a few movies that have been released quite recently, I found that some of my favorite critics could no longer be trusted. This movie is a candidate of the list of films which "everyone seemed to love, but why"?It was like a cult musical. In the begining, the two girls are running around and singing to the soundtrack in the background. The movie (and this scene) supposedly stressed obsession and what it could lead to, but it never really introduced how these two got together or "what" the obsession was caused from. They were deeply in love with eachother. Why? How? And so what? It may have been based on a true story, but how about a little more insight on the character's personality and what really caused one another to commit such a heinous act? Melanie Lynskey was the most believable character in the movie. She had emotions that were believable and she acted her age. Kate Winslet was wooden, cold, and looked like she was in her early 20s. Instead of best friends just into each other's own world, Winslet was the domineering one and a contributing factor as to why this incident happened.Peter Jackson's trademark in all his films is to sickeningly move the camera around like a roller-coaster, and to use special effects to gel with the plot. Perhaps that was done here to hide the weaknesses, and everyone who raved about this movie was really just raving about that? </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful storytelling.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Juliet Hulme (Kate Winslet) and Pauline Parker (Melanie Lynsky) are best of friends, teenagers in 1950's New Zealand. Their friendship quickly becomes intense, obsessive, and as each pushes their own families farther and farther away, they wander jointly into a world that is more fantasy than reality.Peter Jackson's dramatic recount of the true story of matricide in Christchurch is aggressive as well as imaginative. Jackson's creative method of storytelling includes a combination of traditional story, with first person narrative by Pauline, and fantastic lifesize 'claymation' like portrayals of the girls' fantasies. Pauline Parker's own diaries were contributive in reconstructing many of these events.As their parents begin to question the 'healthiness' of the relationship, a decision is made to separate the girls from contact. Jackson implies that a sexual relation existed between the girls as well, and it's this implication and the resulting separation that ultimately results in the girl's joint decision to kill.When I first saw this film, it was also my first exposure to Kate Winslet. Her on-screen presence is so commanding, it's virtually impossible to take your eyes off her whenever she is on screen.I understand that, in real life, Juliet made a career as a writer of mystery stories subsequent to her release, but Pauline is nowhere to be found.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Under-engaging, over-rated botch-up.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>More than any of Peter Jackson's movies, 'Heavenly Creatures' is reliant on an audience's connection with the characters. The movie was based on 'Daughters Of Heaven', an acclaimed 1991 stage play which in turn was a representation of the infamous Parker-Hulme murder, committed in Christchurch, 1954. Enacted with just bare sets, startling lighting effects and a talented cast, the play was an eerie, unsettling experience, heartbreaking and horrifying as the two girls' friendship and private musings spiraled into paranoia and murder. Rather than offering us a pared-down, chilling depiction of a shared and gathering madness, Jackson instead elects to smother the screen in a hideously garish CGI 'fantasy world', destroying completely the play's genuinely creepy 'just two people on a stage' effect. What's more, it was this movie which first showed that while he could do broad splatter-comedy, Jackson had real problems with engaging our emotions in a serious, dramatic production. None of the characters ring true; the adults are oddly cartoonish and the girls are merely talkative and almost distant. Peter Jackson just can't make us care about the characters, and that's possibly because he doesn't. 'Heavenly Creatures' is flat, dull and pedestrian; a botched adaption of good material and a tragic waste.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Story Of A Deadly Friendship</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very impressed by this New Zealand-made movie, based on the murder of a woman in Christchurch in 1954. I wondered at first what I was getting into when the movie started with nothing more than a sort of tourist description of Christchurch, but that only takes a couple of minutes (although I never was sure what the point of starting the movie that way was) and after it's over we begin with a scene that grabs the viewer. The movie then never really lets you go.This is the story of two lonely girls - Pauline and Juliet - who develop an unexpected, unusual and finally obsessively intimate relationship lived out within a fantasy world of their own making. While it's perhaps most noteworthy for being a very early piece of work by Kate Winslet (later of "Titanic" fame), who played Juliet, I thought that Melanie Lynskey (in her first acting role) was every bit as good as Winslet (probably better, in fact, given that I thought Pauline was a more difficult role) - interesting, given that Winslet has gone on to greater stardom. There were also very good performances from Sarah Peirse as Pauline's mother, Honora, and Diana Kent as Juliet's mother Hilda. I was less taken with Clive Merrison and Simon O'Connor as the two fathers, who - to me - came across more as comic characters.As the story goes, eventually both sets of parents become concerned that the friendship between the two girls has become unhealthy, bordering on a lesbian relationship, and they decide that the girls must be separated for their own good. Juliet is told she'll be moving to South Africa, but the parents (surprisingly, given their concerns and suspicions) agree that they can spend two weeks together before Juliet leaves. During that time they concoct a deadly plan to allow them to stay together. Finally, Pauline's mother takes the girls on an outing for tea and a visit to a park, where the plan is unleashed. The whole thing ends up in a pretty graphic and somewhat disturbing murder scene, in which Sarah Peirse comes across as very believable as the mother under attack from the two girls.The closing captions describe the legal proceedings against the two girls, who were found guilty and sent to separate prisons, eventually to be released on the condition that they never see each other again. Interesting, apparently, that Juliet is apparently now living in Scotland and is known as Anne Perry, an author of murder mysteries, although I've never read any of her books.This is a really well done movie, lacking in Hollywood glitziness (which is a compliment, by the way) and highly recommended to anyone who comes across it. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The problem that I had with this movie was that there was no really good reason why they killed her. This movie is about Pauline and Juliet who are really good friends and maybe more than that. Then the parents of both girls (and especially the mother of Pauline) decided that they shouldn't see other. There is a lot to do with tearing the girls apart but I didn't see that as a good reason to kill. The girls were not abused or the needs were not neglected. Maybe they were just psychopathic together and the fact that they were being separated made them even more crazy. I think that it is sad that they went this low. I felt a lot of sadness near the end of this movie and it wasn't for Juliet and Pauline. Boo Hoo Hoo. They couldn't be together. Get over it ladies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this completely absorbing look at the intense friendship of two young girls, you feel a slowing growing sense of doom. Numerous times, the adults in the movie take the wrong turn in "helping" the girls. In the early 1950s, the girls' behavior is labeled as homosexual and "unhealthy," spurring the parents to separate the two girls with disastrous results. The foreknowledge of what is coming doesn't prevent you from feeling painfully gripped by the story. Instead, you find yourself hoping that somehow at the last minute the girls will escape from their shared madness.The use of images and sound in the film is masterful. The images of beauty and darkness in the girls' minds become part of the movie, and afterwards you feel as if you have lived it.The homophobia of the parents backs all of them, parents and children, into a corner, and murder becomes the only way out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, pretty much everything I want to say is expressed on this page already, most eloquently by Jerry Roberts from Birmingham Alabama.So to avoid repitition, I'll say my only qualm with the movie was Jackson's(or the DP Bollinger's) excessive decision to use the dolly in, which consisted of a shot starting from the waist up and ending on a close up of the face. It begs the question, was the director or cinematographer intrigued with this shot enough to innocently use as much as they did, or were they intentionally over using it to try and emphasize some facet of the two girls perception of what was happening around them. I don't know, but it's not hindering enough to detract from the story or the rest of the filmmaking.(Spoiler) I also especially like the bookends. As juliet and Pauline take all the necessary steps to carry out this murder, you watch in disbelief. The opening credits foreshadow the moment so perfectly that my heart was beating in my throat as they walked down the trail. A wonderfully crafted cinematic moment. That bricking was unbelievable. Kudos on the realism, Jackson!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An Oscar nomination for Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh's script, and winner of numerous awards for Jackson's direction and Kate Winset's acting in her first feature film.But, that was not all. Along with Winslet's outstanding performance was Melanie Lynskey's as the girl she was in love with, also in her first film. The two - one outgoing, and one quiet - made a perfect team in this mix of fantasy and reality that was just captivating. Credit has to go to the brilliant cinematography, the lavish sets, the captivating score and a soundtrack that was superb, with Mario Lanza's incomparable tenor voice.An enchanting love story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For a movie with Lesbians and violent death, kind of a let down.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now that I've seen this movie, I only have to see Bad Taste to have seen the entire directorial catalog of Peter L. Jackson. While not as horrible as some of his other feeble attempts at low budget cinema, this movie did promise a lot more than it delivered. Just because a movie is set in the 50's doesn't it mean it has to move like someone who is old enough to recall the events of the movie. Yes, I'm well aware that Jackson did a very good job of recreating actual events. If I wanted that, I'd have rented a documentary or at least watched the History Channel. Teenage Lesbians that are boring is generally a bad sign. Teenage Lesbians that have Kate Winslett amongst them and are still boring is a crime against nature. The main reason I tracked this movie down was because I'm becoming more and more of a Kate Winslett fan the more of her work I see. She is a fine actress and really spreads out her range. Now I know she was 19 when she made this and I know a lot of the problems I have were with the writing, but Kate can, at least today, bring out a nuanced performance out of any tripe she's given. Apparently this is a skill she developed in adulthood. The other actress, Melanie Lynsky was actually quite good as the plain common girl who finds love in the rich girl. Her change in attitude given the situation was quite astounding and well done. I actually came the closest to caring about her than anyone else in the film. It's not a bad movie, per se, but it really doesn't have anything to really set it apart from other movies. This movie is only worth a rent to see the early careers of people trying to find their footing early on in their career. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Heavenly Creatures is directed, filmed, and scripted well. Those involved in the production of this film know how to make a good film, using all of the right elements in suspense and pacing to make it work and to keep the film engaging. The characters are understanding and emotional, and the story building up to the end is done with care - introducing the characters and looking into their little world. The end is also done perfectly well, using a blend of pacing and excellent acting from the actresses to bring it together. This film has probably one of the best murder scenes as well as one of the best observations of human (criminal) psychology.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Decent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was something of a surprise for me - I was expecting a boring period piece from the director of the vastly over-rated Lord Of The Rings, and instead I got a well scripted, well acted, very moving drama (from the director of the vastly over-rated Lord Of The Rings). Admittedly, it pays a lot of attention to the architecture, clothing, and language of 1950's New Zealand, but unlike some lavish period dramas it doesn't do this at the expense of other areas of the film.English girl Juliet Hulme (Kate Winslet) has just arrived in New Zealand, where she bonds with Pauline Parker (Melanie Lynskey) due to their shared overactive imaginations. They create a fantasy world together that excludes all others and become inseparably close. When events seem to be conspiring to separate them, the thin line they've been walking between fantasy and reality seems to collapse, as signified by a ballroom dance scene featuring life-size representations of clay figurines.To be fair, Peter Jackson does very well here. The film descends from the bright colours and sunny days of the opening scenes to freezing blues and plain weird Orson Welles dream sequences as the girls themselves become more and more desperate. The script is good, and based on a true story (which makes it that little bit more disturbing), though it sometimes veers close to becoming standard teen angst fare, and there's way too much screaming near the end. Another slight problem is that Kate Winslet is quite obviously not 15 years old, but the fantasy sequences suspend belief anyway, so it doesn't really matter too much.At first it may seem that the girls are indeed too isolated and wrapped up in their own world, but the film asks us: Why shouldn't they be? They were perfectly happy until people tried to separate them, and the measures they go to in order to avoid this fate would never have happened if people had just left them alone. However, the film does fall down on one account - it may have benefited from the girls being less obviously lesbian. On the plus side it means that we have Kate Winslet in her underwear, but people involved in the incident in real life have said that this was not the case and it seems to simplify their relationship a bit too much. It takes the complex emotions and reduces them a little by introducing basic lust as well.Heavenly Creatures explores friendship, teenage rebellion, and the lengths people will go because of them, and it's definitely worth a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wish I could say I liked 'Heavenly Creatures' more than I did. It's well-made and well-acted, with strong debut performances from the two young stars Melanie Lynsky and of course Kate Winslet. But the story and characters just didn't appeal to me. The frighteningly intense, passionate friendship between the girls could probably only arise in ones so young. Maybe I'm just too old to appreciate it. The fantasy sequences weren't my cup of tea either. It's easy to see, though, how this movie could be a favorite of some. But it's definitely not for everybody.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sweet Jesus did this film bore me. Actually, that is probably not the right term. It aggravated me. So much. I don't know how I mustered up the strength to finish watching it. The film gets better towards the ending though, so if you're brave enough to suffer through the first half, you'll be rewarded by a good murder scene at the end. The acting? I liked the two fathers (and their wives, a little less). The two girls made me mad a lot of the time. I found myself yelling at the screen and slapping my hands to my forehead too often. This happened especially when they would scream (which is endless in this movie) and cry, or make hurt faces. The only reason I gave this a four is because I enjoyed some of Jackson's shots. I should have filmed myself watching the movie, as my comments and facial expressions probably would have been much, much more entertaining. I recommend this movie wholeheartedly if you're in the mood to bitch to a screen for an hour and a half.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A trip down the rabbit hole, but neither of the girls are Alice.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is Heavenly Creatures a movie about two people finding love despite all circumstances, or is it an attempt to show how suppression and intolerance could have severely drastic results? In either case, two young girls find each other, becoming the best of friends ? until their families start to suspect more is going on, and so try to break the two apart.The opening scene is of the two girls running through what appears to be a wooded area, covered in blood, showing the climax of the film immediately. The two girls, Juliet and Pauline, meet and quickly find that many of their interests are shared. Soon after, they start to create a 'fantasy world' where they escape into a realm of make-believe.They escape further and further into this world, even taking upon the personas of many of the characters they have created, almost intertwining the two, making their relationship ? for this has developed into more than a friendship ? seem more than a little inappropriate to the parents.For a movie based on reality ? the diary of Pauline Rieper as the main source - Jackson does amazingly well with the material. The acting is superb until near the climax, where Kate Winslet continues to shine, but Melanie Lynskey's work gets a tad over the top. In fact, Sarah Pierse's acting as the mother of Pauline also seems to be a bit disconnected at the end. For her credit, it could be interpreted as being unable to see the two girls' motivations, but it seemed rather much.The scenes in the 'fantasy realm' are all over the top as well ? but they were meant to be, and so adds to the girls' surrealistic departure from reality. Here Jackson's fascination with special effects is obvious, clay men and women wandering around the fictional 'castle' area.All in all, the movie is a surreal vision of two girls who would not let their parents get between them. Worth a viewing, if you can handle the situational aspects of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two girls in crisis--and not a country in crisis of ethical patterns.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Albeit the actual satisfaction one sees and feels in the cinematographic parts of the film, its special effects and the excellent cast, there are several problems that stop me from grading this movie as high a standing as the plot possibly deserves.The movie is an attempt to demonstrate a country in crisis, with `ancient' ethical patterns pulverized, innovating concepts preceding their time and credited with gloomy attitude as well as misunderstanding from the society.A non-conventional friendship of two teenage girls, observation from different aspects on the same theme, different aspects of view against extant axioms of ethics. In fact--a whole world against two teenage girls. And they love it. The girls flee to their own world ("The Fourth World"), which is supported by several excellent effects.However, the acting itself reminds somewhat a parody on a dramatic film, especially the beginning of it. All the dialogue scenes between the two girls seem to be unrealistic, and the (too) sullen world of one (Pauline--Melanie Lynskey) versus the (too) cheerful reality of the other (Juliet--Kate Winslet). Too many emotions involved in the dialogues, which transform them to a somewhat unreliable form of acting.We are presented two polarized worlds, but they are too polar. Everything is too flamboyant, and therefore: surreal. Perhaps the idea of such acting deserves attention, but in my opinion, in this film, it failed.The film is very unusual for the spectator, and uses patterns that are scarce in modern movies. Some people I have discussed the movie with argued that the dialogues in the movie are literally swan of an insane person which have been written down, or an attempt to show a parody on a relationship drama. I disagree with such a decisive overreaction, but it's partially correct. Although the film is based on a true story, it is very difficult to believe in view of the sometimes wretched acting. From the aspect of realism, it's a failure, and therefore the titles in the beginning and the end which give the film a grip of reality are not felicitous.There is no side that can be interpreted in the film, neither the girls (wicked, warped, going against the entire world, against ethical patterns that are not out-of-date even today...), nor the surrounding world (scorn of homosexuality, strict discipline, parent--child relationship...). It is somewhat difficult to understand the characters' actions, because the acting does not appoint them `evaluations'--not that it is bad, but the characters are not properly `explained' to the spectator. That definitely ill-treats the film. Aside from that, the philosophical ideas behind "The Fourth World" in the movie sometimes don't correlate with the actions and dialogues of the characters--and that is a problem of the plot, without a doubt.Bottom line: we have created ourselves a world, and no obstacle will stop us! (However, eventually there is one b i g obstacle--the law.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nope. No "Heavenly Creatures" In This Movie-From-Hell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Possible Spoilers Ahead!* If you're looking for a real "ding-dong" demented, teen, lesbian love-story movie (with a truly laughable murder, thrown in for good measure), then Heavenly Creatures (HC) is your one-way ticket to the 5th dimension of sheer, grate-on-your-nerves wackiness.I really don't know where to begin expressing my total disappointment over this utterly preposterous, unbelievably irksome and decidedly over-rated Chick Flick from 1994.But, I'll tell you one thing for certain, I found that I could not relate, in any way, shape, or form, with what went on between these 2 flaky teens, even if I tried.And, what's even worse, the life-sized, clay figures that inevitably dominated Pauline &amp; Juliet's freaked-out fantasy-world looked so absolutely dumb that I found I couldn't take this sort of nuttiness in the least bit serious. And I couldn't imagine anyone who could.Had I been able to take something of a genuine liking towards the Parker/Hulme characters, then, yes, that would have made a whole world of difference when it came to my appreciation (or lack of) for HC.But, between poor-girl Parker's dead-serious impersonation of "Droopy" and rich-girl Hulme's flighty take on "Olive Oyl", I found these 2 (who were forever hand-in-hand and (unconvincingly) gushing over each other) to be about as irritating a pair of lovers (be they gay or straight) that I've had to endure in any movie in a mighty long time.As well - Neither actress Melanie Lynskey nor Kate Winslet even came close in their character portrayals to convincing me that they were both supposed to be the age of 14 years.Anyways - When it finally came down to Pauline &amp; Juliet actually getting around to committing their nasty, little murder (which, of course, was a helluva lot more bloody than it was believable), I had grown so frickin' sick &amp; tired of HC's non-stop nonsense that I couldn't have cared less about it, one way, or the other.(Ho-Hum!) P.S.The one scene in HC that really killed me was when Juliet came barging into her parents' bedroom only to encounter her mom being shagged (rather listlessly) by a close, family friend.With this moment, obviously, being very tense and uncomfortable, all that Juliet could think of was to verbally threaten her mother with blackmail and demand that she pay her 100 pounds to keep silent and not tell dear, old dad about it.Yeah. I know that this scene doesn't sound like much, but, hey, just like the rest of this film, it was handled very insensitively and, in return, it came across as being totally laughable instead of as it was intended - Dead serious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I didn't watch the whole thing but I don't think I missed much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came into the movie at the halfway mark and watched the rest from there, something entirely out of character for me but I knew Peter Jackson had directed this and I wanted to see what it was about. (I didn't know anything about the back story or that it was real.) I haven't seen everything he's done but it looked like he was diving into a completely different kind of subject matter than some of his movies, so I gave it a shot. In all honesty, I hate movies like this. Head trippy, psychological thrillers do nothing for me. In fact, I was going in a completely different direction for a while. I kept laughing, inappropriately as it turns out. The main girl's expression was so ridiculous and funny, and that hair...lumbering around like Bigfoot...she looked like a female version of Peter lol. But I was soon to find out all these tidbits of levity were not important to the story. Predictably, it turns into a love story because that's what a lot of teenagers do, they experiment and fall in love at the drop of a hat. So now that we're supposed to believe that they're in love, of which I never do (it doesn't come across as anything other than horny teenagers having sex), their desperation combined with their insanity turns deadly. Now I've gone from laughing at some silly scenes to somehow believing these girls are capable of bludgeoning someone to death and not just someone, her own mother. I'm sorry, but nothing in this movie convinced me of the events that could lead up to this. It almost seems like the filmmakers were glorifying this event rather than chronicling it. I just don't see real hate. I don't see real love. I don't see real anguish, except by Kate Winslet who seems to be upset by the littlest of things. Perhaps watching the entire movie would shed more light but having seen what I've seen I don't think it would change my opinion of it. Frankly, I'm glad I didn't pay any money for this. I'm not saying it's wholly bad, if you like psychological thrillers, go for it. Psych. thrillers in general don't make any sense but you're supposed to allow yourself to go along with the ride, no matter how silly or unbelievable it gets, so if that's what you like, you should be good here. I applaud Peter for attempting such a subject matter, especially since it's a true story. But I really don't think we need any more first-person accounts of real-life murders anymore. There wasn't anything beautiful about this story. That would be like saying the Lizzie Borden murders were beautiful. No, this is just sad and should have been portrayed in an appropriate way, if nothing else, for the families. Plus, it would have been great for those of us who weren't rooting for them to see those witches for what they really are and not try to get us to feel sorry for them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peter Jackson with training wheels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most startling thing about this movie is how much of the senior production staff of Lord of the Rings Peter Jackson had already brought together for this earlier film. Jackson's superb skills as a cinematic visualizer are also already evident in this polished production. The man 'thinks movie.' But alas Jackson is still thinking out loud here. The ventriloquist's lips are moving, and the dummies are too obviously made of wood (I mean the characters, not the animated clay figurines). In this film, Jackson's abilities at directing actors were, let us say, still latent.In "Heavenly Creatures," Jackson set out to make a 'true crime' version of George Roy Hill's "The World of Henry Orient." That film missed perfection because of the affected cornball performance of Peter Sellers in the title role. If this was the performance Hill wanted, shame on him. But if this wasn't bad direction but rather mis-casting, then double-shame on the director for failing to replace Sellers when he found he could not control him. When Peter Jackson found he could not control his original 'Aragorn' in making "Lord of the Rings," he fired him and hired Viggo Mortenson.By contrast to the one bad casting choice in "Henry Orient," in "Heavenly Creatures" nearly everyone seems mis-cast, with the single exception of Sarah Peirse. The rest of the performers never let you forget that they are playacting -- which is fine on the stage, but not on the silver screen. If this was intentional on Jackson's part, well 'nice try,' but it doesn't work. I suspect it was not intentional, because this same weak direction is evident in the first scenes Jackson filmed for LOTR -- the four hobbits pursued by the black riders. Luckily for Jackson, and for all of us viewers, he found the confidence to begin directing realistic performances around that time (I suspect that his veteran producers on LOTR might have taught him a thing or two about this). Besides "Henry Orient," "Heavenly Creatures" invites comparison to two other films I have seen recently -- "A Real Young Girl" by Catherine Breillat, and "Lost and Delirious" by Lea Pool. Breillat has certainly mastered the art of getting realistic performances from her actors. But she goes much too far in that direction, forgetting that the seemingly unedited intimate reality of relentlessly ordinary people is boring to watch for an hour and a half (then again, if you like "Reality TV," which I loathe, then you might also like Breillat's films).Pool's film is a lot like "Heavenly Creatures," and just misses success for pretty much the same reasons: it is not possible to believe in or sympathize with the characters -- the problems not being so much in the script or the production, but in the nuances of direction, the failure to "make it real," to transcend stereotypes and create authentic individual characters.(For girls school movies done right, check out "The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie" and "Mona Lisa Smile.")5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two Girls form a Lesbian relationship and kill to protect it.Yawn. Well that's the stereotype over and done with now for the movie...This film has little enough charm: it's overlong, character development is replaced by screaming and girning and then there's the special effects.Now perhaps I was spoiled as I recently watched Operazione Paura and La Maschera Del Demonio but I can not understand why Peter Jackson opted for Digital Effects rather than camera trickery for this film. The effects look dated now while the sophisticated lo-fi tricks of Bava are still spellbinding and beautiful. Indeed La Maschera Del Demonio highlights another problem with this film: the woeful acting. Bava's characters all act in very formal, staged ways and Jackson tries to do something similar but his conceit falls flat on it's face through the inability of Kate Winslet to act her way out of a paper bag. Kate Winslet's acting reminds me of the old joke that an actor only has two expressions 'hat on and hat off' but in her case this is 'kooky and extra kooky.' Winslet girns, screams and shouts her way through the whole film leaving to poor viewer with a feeling similar to discovering a stone in one's shoe while on a forced march through the desert.In short a failure in almost every respect. It got two marks for Serah Pierse's wonderful, nuanced performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes, well. Yet another unremarkable Australasian film manages to attract rave reviews.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I often suspect it's because of a kind of subconscious cultural relativism: "I must find SOME film from Australia or New Zealand to praise to the skies; otherwise I'm left with the conclusion that Australasian cinema is inferior to that of America, Asia and Europe; and we can't have that." Well - why not?I'm the last person who wants to say that "Heavenly Creatures" is bad. An intense - ferocious - friendship between two young teenaged girls ends in their jointly committing a murder; it's not a bad story, and Jackson succeeds in making sympathise with the two girls even while we see how potentially destructive their friendship is. So it's a good movie. But great? Don't be absurd.For one thing, the computer-generated effects - the means by which we're allowed a glimpse into the girls' fantasy world - are cheesy and unattractive. I've heard a number of excuses offered for this, all more or less sophisticated versions of, "Yes, but they're meant to be." I'm never very impressed with that defence. I don't see why WE have to endure bland, unmagical fantasy visions just because Jackson has taken it into his head to make some point about how the girls have a shallow conception of reality, or some such. (If THIS is Jackson's point, one might respond with a tu quoque. He's a little too willing to portray the adults - the school staff in particular - as unconvincing buffoons, if you ask me.) Besides, the fact that the fantasy visions fall flat prevents us from seeing things EITHER as they are OR as they appear to the girls.And while I found the film refreshingly free from sensationalism for the most part, I'm afraid I had to revise that assessment when I saw the murder itself. Not so much because of the way it was filmed; rather, because it's the last thing we see. It's as if Jackson is saying, "You wanted a murder, didn't you? Well, here it is; and now that we've got to the juicy bit, my work is done." But it wasn't. Jackson failed to satisfy our desire to see what happens next for no better reason than that it pleased him to do so. We're told, by a title-card announcement, that the girls were in the end allowed to go free on condition they never meet again; now THAT, surely, is the most important part of the whole story, and we read about it on a title card. It's less of a clich than a title card reading, "And they all lived happily ever after", but no less bad art.Apart from these two flaws the film is, as I said earlier, good, involving, and unremarkable.</fullReview>

What, I ask you, is "beautiful" about a movie about two teenage girls who brutally murder the mother of one of them because they were not getting their way."Heavenly Creatures" appears to try and win sympathy for Juliet and Pauline. Had these girls been in the least likable it might have worked. But they came across as spoiled, self-centered, selfish and egotistical.This is just one more example of how society today tries to make the criminals into martyrs and victims and the victims into criminals. These two girls beat a woman to death and it is THEM we are supposed to feel sorry for. What about the woman who got her head bashed in? Where's the sympathy for her.I don't really care if they were lesbian lovers or not, whether they were frantic at the thought of being separated or not, or whether or not they had been emotionally scarred in childhood or not. What they most definitely are is murderers. Maybe they have turned their lives around and are model citizens now, and good for them for doing so. But the fact remains that on that day at that time they cold-bloodedly killed another human being and no matter what statement "Heavenly Creatures" is trying to make, that fact can't be changed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I fail to understand why this movie was so highly rated. It's a chick flick and a poor one to boot. The character development was interesting, at first. After the first 1/2 hour my husband fell asleep. I kept on watching hoping the story to pick up and make a point. Neither once happened. Judge for yourself or better yet, skip this one all together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Peter Jackson was known for making gory films like Bad Taste and Braindead before having his fortunes changed by this drama, and going on to direct the hugely successful Lord of the Rings Trilogy. Based on a true story, with all facts taken from diaries, in 1950's New Zealand, Juliet Hulme (Kate Winslet, in her first film role) and Pauline Yvonne Parker (introducing Melanie Lynskey) met each other in school and formed a close, intense and obsessive friendship. They spent every minute possible together, often writing about and imagining themselves in their own fantasy world, which obviously caused concerns for their parents. There comes a point where Juliet and Pauline could be separated, and they see the biggest problem for both of them is Pauline's mother Honora (Sarah Peirse). So they set "the happy day" where they plan to run away to America together, after savagely killing Pauline's mother using a brick in a stocking, bludgeoning her to death, smashing her head to a pulp. This plan they saw as being a way to bring them closer together and get away, but of course they were both caught and put in separate prisons, never to see each other again. Also starring Diana Kent as Hilda Hulme, Clive Merrison as Dr. Henry Hulme, Simon O'Connor as Herbert Rieper, Jed Brophy as John / Nicholas, Peter Elliott as Bill Perry, Gilbert Goldie as Dr. Bennett and Geoffrey Heath as Rev. Norris. The talented and beautiful Winslet and a mesmerising Lynskey dominate this film with their very disturbing friendship, and the film with its special effects for the teenage duo's fantasy world creates fantastic nostalgia, innocence and menace. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen. Kate Winslet was number 55 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, she was number 2 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses, and she was number 29 on The World's Greatest Actor, and the film was number 22 on Film 4's 50 Films To See Before You Die. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Directed by Peter Jackson" was enough to get me to watch this movie, but it certainly wasn't enough to make me enjoy it. Why anyone would want to make, or more importantly, watch a movie about 2 teenage psychos whose fantasy world turns to murder is beyond me. There's really not an entertaining moment in this film. Everything is laid out in the first 5 minutes -- then it all boringly plays out.You can see Jackson's early effective use of digital effects, as well as Kate Winslet's film debut (she makes like Reese Witherspoon in "Election"). Beyond that, unless you're a masochist, I'd skip this film.2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will we ever tire of the Lesbian Cliche?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched most of this movie but I was so disgusted that I kept changing the channel. First off, I am upset that someone would capitalize on a tragedy like this. There are plenty of real stories out there that are much more interesting and perpetuate no bigotry. Secondly, to single out two violent lesbians and continue moviemakers' obsession with mentally ill homosexuals is just sick. And I say this as a woman married to a man.The acting here is okay, with one exception; Kate Winslet couldn't act her way out of a paper bag. She has a grand total of two facial expressions; sullen and doe-eyed. She has used nothing but these two emotions in every movie she's ever made, with the exception of Holy Smoke, where she adds closing her doe-eyes and dancing for a change of pace. No one else really stands out as bad or good. Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh can do good work. I don't know why they failed so miserably here. Perhaps they should stick to fantasy movies that involve hobbits and avoid the mentally ill.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This story is true. It is sick to watch. Two lesbian girls who express themselves completely to each other and then commit murder so that they can continue their innapropriate relationship, is hardly a work of art. Don't see this movie. If you really want to know about it get the book or read about it somewhere. I saw it on TV one evening as I was flipping through the channels. I wish that I had never watched it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can hardly believe this was from the same person who brought us such genius films as bad taste, meet the feebles, and braindead. Possibly the biggest let down in history. One should only see this movie if they like a lot of talking and standing around. Incredibly droll.</fullReview>
