		<shortDescription>A Sweet Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike many others who have left comments about this film, I really enjoy it. This is definitely not high on the intellect scale, but it is a sweet romantic comedy. I agree this is not Marilyn's best film, but her performance in the role is better than anyone else could have done it; very cute and believable. Some of the writing really seems to target Marilyn's own personal life (I don't know if they did that on purpose), especially when she talks about going to night school. Also during the song "Incurably Romantic," Marilyn's dress is flying up (a parallel to "The Seven-Year Itch?"). Her performance of the song "My Heart Belongs to Daddy" is just great. It's really a lot of fun. The cameos are awesome, they really make the film into a "time capsule" of the most popular comedian, dancer, and singer of the time. Tony Randall has a nice supporting role throughout the film; he is great in the scene where he sees Jean-Marc Clement's "softer side." Yves Montand and Marilyn Monroe have the strangest relationship in the movie, and you have to feel bad for Jean-Marc! He is not used to NOT getting the girl! Yves plays this very well, I think. They may lack some chemistry, but the two characters are cute and likable and you really want them to get together. So what I'm saying is, this is well worth seeing, especially if you are a fan of Marilyn or Yves, just don't expect it to be intellectually challenging... it is a great rainy day flick. :-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All About Charm...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite Marilyn films. No, let me amend that--this is one of my favorite Marilyn performances. She is sweet, natural, sympathetic, adorable. She has no character to play and no script and no director (Cukor was sliding fast at this point) But she and Montand are lovely together; two great charmers surrounded by an overblown 60's confection of "guest stars" and constant costume changes (although some of Marilyn's outfits are so flimsy one wonders why they bothered to dress her at all?!) "My Heart Belongs To Daddy" is classic MM, but I have a perverse fondness for "Specialization" with Monroe hopping around (she really couldn't dance) in this INCREDIBLE gown, belly and backside bulging, a Reubens come to life. It's a very minor film, especially sandwiched between "Some Like It Hot" and "The Misfits" but there is pleasure to be found if you're into Miss M.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>...but is it really that bad?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released in 1960 after Marilyn's super turn in the fantastic 'Some Like It Hot', LML has often been cited as Monroe's worst movie.There is plenty to work against the film: Cukor's almost non-existent direction, the rather dreadful musical numbers, Yves Montand's irritating performance and the wasted opportunities of the star cameos.However, Let's Make Love is a reasonably inoffensive way to waste an afternoon. The plot is slight and therefore doesn't require too much brain power to follow and Monroe is, as usual, cinema gold. Despite the fact that she is slightly overweight here and nothing much has been done with her in terms of make-up, hair or wardrobe she is eminently watchable. She gives a convincing, assured performance in her role turning the simple character of Amanda into a sweet, likable woman. As I have mentioned before in Monroe reviews, I always find it interesting to see Monroe in films in the 1960s, being very much an icon of the 1950s.So, is LML really that bad? Well, to be honest no, it isn't. It's lightweight fluff that doesn't really mean anything but is watchable non the less. It is unfortunately placed between the sublime 'Some Like It Hot' and Monroe's bravura performance in the following year's 'The Misfits' but don't hold that against it. Make up your own minds!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Bad, Not Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is by no means a great film, but I was pleasantly surprised in the end. Montand and Monroe both do good jobs. Tony Randall is always enjoyable, and Milton Berle has a great time teaching Montand how to be funny, the best comic moment of the film. Having just seen Montand in The Wages of Fear, one of the most intense movies ever made, it was interesting to see him goofing off and having a good time. This role takes him back to some of the songs he sang early in his career, not long after Edith Piaf discovered him. I only wish he had been able to sing more in the movie. I'm not a big fan of Monroe - her dumb-blonde routine generally irritates me - but she seems more vulnerable in this film, more pleasant to watch. She particularly impressed me in the musical numbers. Unfortunately, the costume designer did a lousy job - everything seems too big on her, or just tacky. Compare these costumes to those of Bardot in Une Parisenne, made around the same time period. There are ways and then there are ways to show off a body like that of Bardot or Monroe. All in all, this is a light piece of fluff, with some humorous moments, some sappy moments, some good musical numbers, some bad writing, some good cameos by Berle, Bing, and Gene Kelly, a silly storyline, Yves Montand, Monroe, and a good dose of fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marilyn Monroe and Yves Montand in a romantic comedy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since I am watching all Marilyn's movies, ''Let's Make Love'' was the second one from the collection to be watched. Marilyn is beautiful as usual, and we have Cameos from Gene Kelly,Bing Crosby and Milton Berle as themselves.The movie starts telling the story of Jean Marc's ancestors, and how his family started to become richer with the time, until his present days as a billionaire. Jean Marc has power,money and also is a 'Casanova', with a new woman to go out everyday. One day, he discovers that he is going to be satirized in an off-Broadway theater, and he goes to see how the play is going to be, until he sees Amanda singing and dancing in a provocative way and the director,who thinks that Jean Marc is an actor trying to take the role of himself,cast him as a member of the show. Decided to go out with Amanda and make her fall for him, he pretends to be someone else,using the identity of Alexander Dumas and acting as a poor actor who wants new lessons from Amanda to improve his acting career. With the time, Jean Marc starts to fall for Amanda, since she is the only woman who was kind to him without expecting money or gifts in return. The problem now is his fake identity.PS: I only have to complain about the ending of this movie, which, in my opinion, was far from good: I don't think that Amanda should stay with Jean-Marc, since she always refused and hated rich guys like him, calling him arrogant and liar,among other things. I think she changed her idea too quickly about him,after knowing Alexander Dumas' original identity was Jean Marc, but anyway, no movie is perfect.aka "Adorável Pecadora" - Brazil</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yves Montand and Marily: an affair that HAD to happen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without what we know about her now, this movie wouldn't be worth the time it took to watch it. However, now we know about what was going on while the movie was being shot, you can see the attraction between her and Msieu Montand, whose wife took him back afterwards. It's funny, since I've seen him in a French movie, where HIS wife was unfaithful and how he copes with that. What goes around comes around, I suppose.Montand has to act silly, which must have been as painful for him as it was for his character, a multi-billionaire trying to win Miss Musical Star, Marilyn. Watching the male singer in this movie was funny, as it reminds you of the 40s and the Dean Martin style crooners. Watching Bing Crosby and Milton Berl teach Yves how to sing and be funny was a hoot!!! "Don't 'bubba-boo-boo', or you'll get arrested," Bing suggests. Watching Milton berl walk on his ankles wasn't all that funny, but this was the 60s after all.I liked the musical numbers, and watching Yves' face do all its rubbery wrinkling numbers. He may have been a great actor because he could put on so many different expressions, but his best movie was the one where he's trying to run for office in a crooked Banana Republic (sorta like our present government), a Cost-Grava film.  See this one just to remind you of how beautiful, how vulnerable, Marilyn was: 2 years from her suicide????!!!! She really had some nice moves, and a great figure when a tummy wasn't considered obscene (in our day of anorexic sexy?? stars).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I have changed my opinion about this film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not regarded as one of MM's best films by her legion of fans. "Lets make Love" isn't as bad as one might think. Gregory Peck and Carey Grant were originally asked to be her co-star, but after reading the script I guess they soon declined. Neither were game to play 2nd fiddle to a screen sensation.Plot line reads as follows: Rich man (Yves Montand) wants poor girl.(M.M.) Rich man pretends to be poor. Rich man gets poor girl then looses her after he tries to tell her the truth. Rich man eventually woos and gets the girl. With Marilyns clout at 20th Century Fox studios one wonders why she chose to take the role as Amanda Dell. She's not altogether bad as the character. The script simply had little to offer her. But I have to say after repeated viewings, the film has grown on me. I am a huge fan of MM and to be fair Monroes first appearance singing "My heart belongs to Daddy" is a clever and exciting opening performance. What an entrance, she is on fire in this 3 minute masterpiece. I love the kiss and wink and staging of this classic piece. That scene is the best musical number in the picture. This sequence might have been filmed and added at the last minute after 20th Century Fox exec's saw a rough cut of the film. Marilyn does look very comfortable and relaxed on the screen. But, at times she appears distracted.(Probably George Cukors uneven direction) There is something a little charming about the whole production. The musical score will grow on you and "Incurably Romantic" is very well done. This film was nominated for an Oscar for best musical score. I also loved the fantasy sequence with Yves and MM in the board room on the table where she is knitting with gold yarn. She even makes that chore look sexy!Marilyn and Yves are finally given a chance to show some real spark in the final scene of the movie when the whole charade comes to a close. Trapped in an elevator (and looking her best in the film) with a starry eyed Yves, Marilyn finally succumbs to his musical rendition of the title of this movie. They kiss passionately and we finally see AND hear what all the gossip was about. Her very heavy breathing during the kiss is caught on film, just turn up the volume... there is nothing "Method acting" about that! Aside from her sensitivity, intellect, and training with the Strasbergs this is what Monroe the movie star sex goddess was about.A fine line between acting and reality was beautifully blurred in "Lets make love"s final 2 minute scene. Released in 1960 The audience when asked "Lets make love" apparently said no thanks. The film was a box office failure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just Not That Great.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was pretty unimpressed with this movie, to be frank. There was something about every aspect of it that didn't quite add up and you're left with an essentially dull film, which you're not really too concerned about by the end. I am a huge fan of Marilyn but I don't feel she was at all her best in this picture, and I don't think that's entirely her fault - the film around her is incredibly flimsy. The dialogue is often wooden and unconvincing, and Montand's character and his storyline are just totally unbelievable - nothing of what he says or what he does was convincing to me and this really brought the film down very hard and very quickly. The musical numbers are pretty standard fair and were nothing Marilyn hadn't done before. The film didn't make me laugh and I didn't care what happened to the characters. If anything I was only sad the talented Marilyn Monroe was a part of the film - as her portfolio shows she was deserving of far higher quality films than this. I can't recommend the film as it's not really worth your time and you probably won't enjoy it - if you just want to see all of Monroe's film's than see it, but otherwise don't bother.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marilyn Monroe began to change her role</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie in Aug 4,2005. And I saw it again yesterday. Yes. this is one of the most hilarious movies I've ever seen. Marilyn's acting role, as Amanda Dell, was great. Here in this movie, Marilyn Monroe was not the Marilyn Monroe we know.In Niagara(1953) and The seven year itch(1955), both of these movies, she portrays as sexy-starlet. But in this movie, she is a very pure and fragile theater-actress Amanda Dell. Well, we know her platinum blonde hair attracts a lot of men, but her character,in this movie, is very friendly to girls. May be many girls lost their feeling of inferiority after watching this movie.And I saw Marilyn Monroe, Yves Montand, Tony Randall, Frankie Vaughan and Wilfrid Hyde-White plus Milton Berle(40 million Americans call him as a Uncle Milky?) Bing Crosby(i love his song 'White Christmas')and Gene Kelly. These luxurious casting combination is very fantastic.I never expected Crosby and Kelly to appear. I saw a preview version of Let's Make Love, in there, no cameo appearances of in the preview. But Kelly and Crosby's cameo appearing made my eyes happy.I think Marilyn's acting career is more valuable in her 30's than 20's.Because in her 20's, she portrayed us her physical attraction. Sometimes she enticed a man(Niagara), Sometimes vivacious(How to marry a millionaire), and sometimes valiant(River of No Return).But in her 30's her character showed fragile, pure and vulnerable. I found out these phenomenon in this movie,Let's Make Love. So I can figure it out her acting was changed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's Make Love, the next to last film of Marilyn Monroe is a harmless piece of fluff, rather lazily directed by George Cukor. Marilyn was her usual temperamental self during the filming and I think Cukor decided to just let it slide.Think mega-rich, a 1960s Donald Trump who speaks French and you have the character Yves Montand plays. Publicity agent Tony Randall calls it to Montand's attention that an off Broadway theater review is going to be satirizing him among other celebrities in the review. Montand decides to check things out for himself. And the star of the review is none other than Marilyn Monroe who Montand starts raising his blood pressure over. Who wouldn't.20th Century Fox used this same plot device in 1937 in On the Avenue. That time it was rich débutante Madeleine Carroll and her choleric father George Barbier are being satirized in a show being directed by Dick Powell who stars in it as well. It was much better done there. Of course they also had an original Irving Berlin score to help. And Barbier was always playing those kind of roles. It fit him naturally.Montand is cool and unflappable. I can believe he wants Marilyn, but I can't believe that this is how he would meet her. Unless one is an egomaniac like Donald Trump, I don't think most people would care about what some off Broadway show that few will ever see, says in some satirical sketch.A lot of talented people were involved in the making of this and it seems a colossal waste of time. Marilyn and Montand and British pop star Frankie Vaughan had some nice numbers to sing.And we can't forget the three unbilled cameos of Milton Berle, Bing Crosby, and Gene Kelly who Montand enlists in his quest to win Marilyn. Their scenes with Montand are the best thing about the film.One other thing though. I can believe Berle and Kelly would come if summoned by Montand. But Crosby, you're talking about a guy who was as rich the character Montand played.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All About Yves</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is based on a breathtaking conceit: That Yves Montand, the greatest singer-actor of the twentieth century and rivalled only in both departments by Frank Sinatra - had to be 'taught' to sing. As if that weren't enough they manage to top this by having Montand, a lifelong politically active supporter or the Left - his father's Communits activities forced him to flee his native Italy, where Yves was actually born, for France and his elder brother was a high-ranking official in the Communist party, and with his wife, Simone Signoret, Montand signed dozens of left-wing petitions - play a billionaire. In a film studded with bad jokes the biggest joke of all is Frankie Vaughan, a pathetic non-singer,non-actor, non-dancer who was, unnacountably, very popular in England, where they love the second-rate and to add insult to injury Vaughan gets to mangle the best new song in the score by a mile, the standout ballad Incurably Romantic, in which Sammy Cahn turned in a lyric reminiscent of Jimmy Van Heusen's previous collaborator Johnny Burke. It's clear from all the comments I've read here - though, to be fair, I haven't read all of them - that most of the posters are completely unaware of Montand and his track record in his adoptive France where he could sell out any venue in which he chose to appear with his unbeatable parlay of singing, dancing and charm. It was in fact his left-wing sympathies which left him visa-less and prevented him from appearing in the US until impresario Norman Granz finally obtained a visa for him in 1959 when, despite performing his one-man show totally in French, he blew the critics away and did SRO business for months instead of the two weeks he was contracted for and it was on the strength of this, and not, as one poster has assumed, his performance in the film version of The Crucible - which he had also played on the Paris stage with Signoret - in 1957. With the benefit of singing in English Sinatra left many more memorable records than Montand but against this Montand far outclassed Sinatra in dramatic performances on film, mostly post-Let's Make Love. For some reason none of the several films Montand made in England were wholly satisfactory including this one but, in its favor, we DO get to hear Montand perform, albeit incompletely, the gorgeous ballad Incurably Romantic and we DO get a glimpse of how gracefully he could dance, again, in an all-too-brief sequence when he imagines himself replacing the inept Vaughan in a number with Monroe, a clear case of a Bentley replacing a Skoda. Inevitably the film is still being marketed as a Monroe vehicle with everybody else just along for the ride but for Montand devotees it is a must in spite of its shortcomings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly, inconsequential Monroe film with a dull Montand for the leading man...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has got to be one of the dullest films MARILYN MONROE ever did--and equally dull is her leading man, the French accented YVES MONTAND who must have left his heart and his talents in France for the duration of filming.He's simply bland with a capital B and very unfunny. And when MILTON BERLE, GENE KELLY and BING CROSBY attempt to give him pointers on how to be an entertainer, they're impatience with him is understandable. Whatever magic Montand had in his homeland is obscured here by a witless script and poor direction from George Cukor, who even manages to make Marilyn look less than believable as a wistful showgirl.The faults extend to the songs to. The only reasonably good one is "My Heart Belongs to Daddy" done in a rather coy and simpering style by Monroe but nevertheless, it's the only high point in the whole show. Everything else is better left unmentioned.Summing up: A waste of two stars who, incidentally, have no chemistry together, at least on screen. Off is another matter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, many people think is is not a good film with Monroe - they don't like him. But I think it's a funny film. Mountand is they only men Monroe played with, who has so much fear like her, because this is his first Hollywoodfilm. They play nice together because he is a friendly French person. In the film she is teaching him to be a good actor. Her father is a priest.It is an important film, because here she is an enemy of millionäres - it is a part of her new image, to be the opposition of Lorelei Lee in "Gentlemen prefer blond". To have other ideals as money!!!The first scene with Monroe in this film is very famous and very nice to - where she sings: "My heart belong to my Daddy" (This had nothing to do with her privat point of view... I think but thats another theme.)An interesting Movie - an e-motionpicture - with a nice Monroe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stony, Dismal Love Affair - No Romantic Chemistry between Montand and Monroe and Weak Script Leaves Audience Yearning for Actual Love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a singular Marilyn moment which defines her timeless relevance and popularity in American history. Before experiencing Marilyn on screen, I often encountered her photos/ references about her in magazines, encyclopedia, compilation and archives. I also read a Life in Pictures biography about her. How I visualized her gait, her voice and her gestures were quite contrary to her actual performance in cinemas. I expected this woman to possess extraordinary acting capabilities along with natural stage charm and sex-appeal and a deeper, mellower voice that showed class and refinement. Never did I think Marilyn to be so bubbly, fluffy, and erratic with a chirpy, girlish timbre- the typical coquette whom men would swoon over to in an instant. She wasn't like Greta Garbo; the magic couldn't be discovered immediately in Monroe (Garbo could make everyone around her, the actors, the cameras and the audience, fall in love with her in an instant). The disappointment in me after enduring Prince and the Showgirl and Bus Stop cast a negative perception about Monroe. I found her syrupy and panicky, as though she is constantly thinking of ways to keep her audiences (her male fans) happy while not giving up the unpredictable method acting. I preferred 7 year itch ? Marilyn didn't experiment but only let her naive face, clueless eyes, admirable figure and the witty dialogs do the work. Sometimes, I felt the method acting ruined her performances, though she has a few shiny moments on her last released film 'The Misfits'. After four films, the true reason for her massive success still eluded me, but in Let's Make Love (a lackluster film overall) I realized why she was adored.It was the scene where her character Amanda Dell, a small-time actress and a stage performer, began jogging on the footpath and encouraged Jean-Marc Clement (played somewhat sullenly by Yves Montand) to join her. An embarrassed Clement looks around as men seem to ogle Amanda; she isn't dressed inappropriately, but she smiles and her face is beaming. Marilyn seemed to draw everyone's attention not by acting stupendously or exposing her body here- she was carefree and spirited, probably aware that men were eying her but not minding. She knew she was a siren, but she also made it clear that she wasn't a bimbo. She has this coy charm about her, a sense of self-awareness that makes her so amicable with men and women. It is similar to what Meryl Streep said in a speech '? to be appealing to boys and being accepted by girls? a tricky situation (which she mastered). Marilyn doesn't explicitly try to draw attention; she does it cleverly, discreetly.Unfortunately, she was stuck with a patchy script that was deficient in several aspects. A Paul Thomas Anderson start (Magnolia style) which montages the fate of six/seven Jean Marc Clement is middlingly amusing but unnecessary because there isn't any reference to it later. I did get what it was supposed to mean but there need not be narrations of so many Clements. Then the camera lingers on a group of elite gentlemen smoking cigars as a debonair Jean Marc of Modern Times tells them a joke. These men may have heard it several times, but they flatteringly laugh at his inane joke ? he is a billionaire, keep in mind. Some scenes later, when he pretends to be a nascent actor and impersonator, Jean Marc reiterates the same joke to a bunch of actors and is given a damp response. The billionaire, with a keen esthetic interest and a notorious womanizing reputation, is informed that he is going to be satirized in an off-Broadway Revue. He does not react at first but then shows displeasure in such an idea- therefore he checks out a rehearsal of the performance. This seems far-fetched as the theater itself seems so unremarkable and lowly with bawdy, unfunny and tired acts that no one but a local goon would take objection of being satirized. We instead get this wealthy man treading such common places.There Jean is struck by the glamorous Amanda Dell, who is tailed by hungry boys in an unimpressive number that lacks naughtiness. Marilyn's voice sounds affected, and she fails to bring the oomph. There are a couple of well acted scenes after this between Montand and Monroe where the former seems shy and out-of-place in the theater while the latter can adapt to any surrounding. The third person in the love triangle is Frankie Vaughan, who shares a better chemistry with Marilyn. Montand takes his initial defeats too seriously and seems so dull at times that it is impossible to feel sorry for him or consider Marilyn the right lady for him. She seems like a good friend and adviser, not a lover in any way, till the end of the story. Here is where more than Montand, the script fails in providing more crucial scenes between Montand and Monroe. 'Let's Make Love' isn't something the movie sets out to make- it is rather 'let me buy your love', which is crude. Also, in a desperate bid to raise laughs, Milton Berle, Bing Crosby and Gene Kelly were roped in and I was thinking, "If Gene were younger he would've made a charming Jean Clement". Berle is funny but has to feign laughter at Jean Clements's drab performance on stage, for which he should've demanded for additional fees.The musicals are ghastly, the production is weak and the plot is sketchy; only the performances try to save 'Let's Make Love's' face. I would say the best actor in the movie would be Wilfred Hyde White, who mouths the line "You made a terrible/risky decision by mortgaging your house for this (to save his theater)" to the theater owner. I would add that George Cukor made a terrible decision of getting big actors such as Monroe and choosing such a script for them".My Rating: 3.4 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uneven but sweet Marilyn comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of Jean-Marc Clement and his pretty chorus girl is so widely hated and depreciated among the critics I always get surprised when I find myself enjoying it. Sure it's overlong, from a good half an hour, sometimes dull and never truly believable: why they kept the introduction sequence is a mystery. Also, as often with musicals of this era, the camera practically never moves.Still, there are noticeable good points: the score makes for a pleasant listening, from the classic Cole Porter 's"My Heart Belongs to Daddy" (the only number really well staged) to the romantic, jazzy themes "Let's Make Love", and "Incurably Romantic". Marilyn sings and dances with her own soulful abandon, and as an actress, she will only disappoint those who do not like her at all. I, a fan, thought she was right on my money. There is true charm in her portrayal of Amanda, an everyday beauty queen who knits between sexy numbers, good comic timing too -although she overacts a bit the final scenes. And with her pale blonde hair and tired gaze, she looks almost younger than in the 50's. Some biographical allusions -like the night school- and the fact she's supposed to be an happy-go-lucky, "at home wherever she goes" make sit ultimately poignant. As for Montand, in charge of a difficult task after Gregory Peck and James Stewart had said "no", he looks surprisingly at ease. Apart from the heavy french accent, his approach of the Clement character is cleverly unexpected : while everyone thinks of him as an icy, pompous businessman crossed with a self-assured playboy, Clement appears as always charming and suave, exceedingly polite, widely smiling and very stiffly dressed. As a result, it makes impossible for the viewer not to go for him -specially as once he poses as a struggling extra, he gets humiliating indifference and mockery from everyone. The trouble is the story becomes much less believable and a bit confusing : and while you care for the billionaire, you never get to understand him or the life he leads. The chemistry between the two stars is fine yet it never sparkles, much because of the script which until the very end imposes misunderstanding and a one-way relationship. The supporting cast is less reliable, from dazzling to forgettable. Theatre people have not much soul, although they're supposed to be the good guys : directors spend their time screaming, there's a mean blonde dancer and Frankie Vaughan, as the whining crooner, is no match for Monroe. On the other hand, Wilfrid Hyde-White is pleasant in a prototype for his Col. Pickering of "My Fair Lady". And young Tony Randall frankly excellent as the public relations man who gets disgusted by his boss's frivolity. Long before I got to love Randall as Felix Ungar, I thought he gave the subtlest performance of the movie. It's too bad that after a definite part in the first hour, his likable character stands aback in the shade with Hyde- White, to watch the seduction going on. One gets the feeling he had scenes cut or else added in the course of the film. Of course, one has to mention the three guest-stars that make most of the life in the middle dragging part, during which Clement learns how to be an artist. It turns out the shorter the appearance, the better it is and Gene Kelly is truly priceless in the one little scene he waltzes with Yves Montand. Bing Crosby and Milton Berle are nice too but the latter remains too long on the show.The script, which suffered many rewrites before and during the shooting is an odd mixture, including moving monologues by Arthur Miller (who, complained Peck, wanted badly to extent Marilyn's part), classic comedy stuff, good one-liners and awkward gags: the Elvis Presley satire comes from a long way. The charm and tenderness of some sequences does not work so well with the mechanical farce going around, leaving the general feeling of an of- balance movie. George Cukor was not the ideal musical director and he fails to reconcile human comedy and singing lavishness - although he would score a triumph a few years later with "My Fair Lady", but then the script was of better quality. One may wonder what "Let's Make Love" would have been, with sharper writing and wiser editing. But there's enough good to contradict the severe critics, as long as Monroe, Randall and sometimes Montand are around. So forget the faults. Enjoy the stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hard to believe but still worth watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I hope you can kiss better than you can sing." When I heard this line from the film regarding Yves Montand, I had to laugh, as in real life Montand sold a bazillion records over his long career.In LET'S MAKE LOVE he plays a mega-millionaire who tries to pretend to be a stage actor--paying the likes of Milton Berle, Gene Kelly and Bing Crosby to give him lessons on comedy, dance and singing. So why would a rich guy like this go to all this trouble? Well, when the industrialist (Montand) hears that an off Broadway play will be lampooning him (as well as others), he's curious and sneaks in to watch rehearsals. There he sees sexy Marilyn Monroe and is so struck by her he doesn't tell anyone who he really is. And, in a strange twist, the producer decides to hire him to play himself--not realizing Montand really is the millionaire! He decides to go with it and says nothing to the company, as he plans on staying with the production and wooing Marilyn. The trouble is that he's NOT a professional and so he hires the best people to train him--and that's where Berle, Kelly and Crosby come into the film.This story idea is actually reminiscent of a great old film, THE DEVIL AND MISS JONES--where a rich department store owner decides to pose an a regular employee in order to spy on "rabble-rousers" in the company. Though the stories differ quite a bit, both certainly have similarities. Bkoganbing's review indicates that LET'S MAKE LOVE is very, very similar to 1937's ON THE AVENUE, though I can't really say since I haven't yet seen this film.The problems with the film are abundant even though I still think it earns a 7. That's because the plot is so very likable you can ignore the ridiculousness of the plot (it really is tough to believe) as well as that many of the song and dance numbers don't seem all that great. While Miss Monroe has a HUGE cult-like following, I don't think her singing and dancing were all that great--but she was nice to look at and did a better job at acting. Overall, it's a nice little romance and worth a look.FYI--Casting Montand is an interesting choice to play a nice industrialist, as he was a member of the Communist party in France up until 1968!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Poor romantic comedy that was subsequently talked down by director George Cukor and its two main stars, Yves-Montand and Marilyn Monroe. The latter only doing the film due to contractual commitments to 20th Century Fox. There were also problems with the affair that Montand &amp; Monroe were having since both parties will still married to Simone Signoret and Arthur Miller respectively. Perhaps because they were trying not to show their feelings on screen explains why the coupling comes off as bland and listless? Monroe at least captivates and looks very well here, but Montand is dull as dish water and it's hard to believe that Monroe in character or in real life could go for such dullness.The plot is unadventurous and it's tough enough to swallow without Cukor forcing in lame humour, lead weight dialogue and sub-par music numbers. A spark of hope that we might get a good movie arrives early with Marilyn's entrance, resplendent in figure hugging costume and warbling "My Heart Belongs to Daddy", but it's a false dawn and only serves to remind us why we loved her in the first place, and, that she deserved better than this. Montand's role had been touted to a number of high profile American actors, notably Cary Grant, James Stewart, Rock Hudson and Gregory Peck, the latter of which did get the gig but quickly got out of it upon viewing the script. Peck is also credited with a humorous and most fitting quote about the finished movie. He wryly observed that the end result "About as funny as pushing Grandma down the stairs in a wheelchair." Now where's Tomy Udo when you need him most eh? He could have pushed this movie down the stairs with Grandma too.The film is also guilty of other things. It's at least 30 minutes too long and Tony Randall is badly underused as Coffman, PR aid to Clement (Montand). While cameos by Gene Kelly, Bing Crosby &amp; Milton Berle, as pleasant as they are, just smacks of film makers trying to dress up a dogs dinner. There's some enjoyment to be had in Wilfred Hyde-White's sarcastic support turn, while some value can be got from the De Luxe Color/CinemaScope production. But really they are thin excuses from which to use in recommending this to anyone but the hardiest of Monroe completists. 3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yves Montand was right for the part, but the writing and development so dire that he has no chance to shine.There is no chemistry between Montand and Monroe. Perhaps they were trying to conceal their affair. One wonders why Frankie Vaughan, is never even mentioned by American reviewers. Is it because, like Montand, he is a foreigner ? He gives a first rate performance of the title-song, and "Specialisation", and partners Marilyn beautifully. Some of the closeups of Marilyn,especially in "Daddy", are badly lit and cruelly emphasise her age. Was Cukor, who disliked Marilyn, taking revenge for past misdemeanours? In the CD version of "Specialisation" there are verses not in the film. Were these added for the CD or edited out of the film? If so,why? All in all, a galaxy of star performers could not make a silk purse from this sows ear. A remark made by Marilyn about a beautiful but personally unpleasant film actress sums it up well - poison is still poison, no matter how beautiful the bottle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Marilyn's better films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Maybe spoilers herein)In spite of an ominous start (a bit too much about the family history of the Montand character) and the annoying Montand (awkward-looking and charmless), the film grew on me as I sat through it. It turned out to be none of what the trailer tried so hard to sell: a story about people who are love- and sex-obsessed. Instead I was pleasantly surprised.It is refreshing and marvellous to watch Marilyn as the ambitious and good-hearted stage performer, so unlike one of those "dumb blonde" roles considered typical of her screen persona. I *love* the catchy musical numbers,which are just the right amount, not too much to distract one from the plot. My favorites are My Heart Belongs to Daddy, Specialization and the title song. Marilyn is not at her most stunning here, probably a result of excessive dependence on drug and alcohol..but she still looks adorable, cheerful and full of life throughout the film. Overall the film is a delight to watch, marked for the decent script, sometimes funny dialogue, smooth direction and a great cast (after all I would say Montand is acceptable) I am sure I will visit this overlooked gem multiple times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie had its spots of humor due to the absurdity of the total differences between the real billionaire and the fake average guy. Some of the gags were just chuckle category but some elicited a real laugh. I enjoyed watching the people play the roles of those caught plying their deceit in the passing off of the rich man who was pretending to be poor so the object of his affection would hopefully like him for himself rather than his money. It was good to see the likes of Bing Crosby, Gene Kelly, and Milton Berle in surprise roles trying to teach the stiff as stark rich guy how to sing or dance or be funny.I'm not certain why it did poorly at the box office, maybe it had some serious competition at the time. This was not Oscar material but it was good enough to keep me interested.

		<fullReview>Marilyn Monroe was at the top of the Hollywood star ladder as the Star of Stars when assigned this movie by her home studio 20th. Marilyn Monroe had just had the smash hit of her career with Some Like It Hot (A United Artists film) and 20th wanted to cash in on the MM popularity. Marilyn Monroe had been announced for another UA film John Huston's masterpiece The Misfits co starring Clark Gable and 20th insisted on a Monroe film before MM was allowed to do another film outside 20th. (between 1956 to 1960 while having the greatest star in Hollywood under contract 20th Century Fox did not cast MM in a movie however the very shrewd MM had a play or pay contract and when the studio announced her for Wild River and The Blue Angel but those deals did not materialize MM demanded and got her salary for those films!) Much has been written about this film and when it was released I was disappointed, having seen it recently on the Fox Movie Channel, I now find Lets Make Love charming and Ms Monroe enchanting. George Cukor among the "Approved Directors" on MM's short list ( others were Wilder, Huston, Hitchcock, Wyler, et al) was said to be a director aware of the nuances of a female star's personas ( Hepburn, Garbo, Crawford, Leigh, Holiday, Loren all raved over Cukor.Marilyn Monroe looks stupendous in this movie,and is given fine support by a cast of professional's such as Wilfrid Hyde White, Tony Randall and cameos by Milton Berle and Bing Crosby. Yves Montand, who had a legendary fling during the filming of the movie with MM, is fine as The Billionaire.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can see why this is a bit of an underrated film, but it does have some good routines and songs, and a good performance from Marilyn Monroe, in her penultimate film before her tragic death. Basically French billionaire Jean-Marc Clement (BAFTA nominated Yves Montand, who at the time was really with Monroe) has learnt he is being satirised in a Broadway show. At the theatre where it is happening, he sees Amanda Dell (Monroe) rehearsing the song "My Heart Belongs To Daddy" (the first song), and not knowing his real identity, the director casts Clement to play the role (of himself). Clement, posing as Alexander Dumas, he takes part to see more of Amanda, and goes through some auditions, along with singing, dancing and joke lessons, with the help of It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World's Milton Berle, singer Bing Crosby and Singin' in the Rain's Gene Kelly. Obviously Amanda in the end does discover Jean'Marc's real identity, but she can't resist him and his charm, so thank goodness there is a happy ending. Also starring Pillow Talk's Tony Randall as Howard Alexander Coffman, Frankie Vaughan as Tony Danton, My Fair Lady's Wilfrid Hyde-White as George Welch/John Wales, David Burns as Oliver Burton, Michael David as Dave Kerry, Mara Lynn as Lily Nyles, Dennis King Jr. as Abe Miller and Joe Besser as Charlie Lamont. The highlights for me are obviously the first song, the title song, and ultimately, both Montand and Monroe's performances, definitely worth watching. It was nominated the Oscar Best Music for Lionel Newman and Earle Hagen, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical. Marilyn Monroe was number 39 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, she was number 6 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Women, she was number 3 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols (she could have been number 1), and she was number 11 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and the film was number 1000 on The 100 Greatest Musicals.

		<fullReview>I said it before and I'll say it again, I'm trying to see the important films of Marilyn Monroe, I just love her, she's a really beautiful and unique actress. So, I moved onto Let's Make Love, an OK romantic comedy that puts a little difference into Marilyn's usually gold digging character.This time, she's an actress on Broadway, and when billionaire comes in and sees Marilyn he is immediately struck by her beauty. The director sees him and is interested in him as an actor, but it is Marilyn who is his true passion. He takes the part, but he lies to her saying he's just a regular Joe, causing her to fall for him as just himself. But when he learns that it's not money she's after and just his love, the story takes an interesting twist of events.Over all, I'd say that this was a nice little flick with Marilyn, it wasn't my favorite though out of what I have seen. I just love the charming gold digging Marilyn we've all grown to love. :) OK, that sounded weird, but I think you'll know what I mean if you've seen the movies I've seen her in. Still, don't shy away from this classic, it's still worth a watch.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On paper it must have looked very fetching: a tailor-made Marilyn Monroe script, matching the comely star with French matinee idol Yves Montand.Add a few hot musical numbers, dependable comic character actor Tony Randall, and several superstar cameos by Milton Berle, Gene Kelly, and Bing Crosby and--voila!--a formula sure-fire hit.To top it off, hire great director George Cukor, noted for bringing out the best in female actresses, to helm the project. Cukor, who made Judy Garland such a sensation in her comeback film, "A Star is Born," would work the same magic here.Somewhere along the way, though, the concoction simply failed to bubble, with the entire entree falling a wee bit flat. Maybe there was too much Montand and Frankie Vaughan here and not enough Marilyn.Anyway, as things turned out, Ms. M emerged as more piddeling around the sidelines with minor quips and breathy riffs than focused at the center of attention. Still, I find M's campy performance quite amusing, in which she playfully parodies her own persona. In this, her second last film, she looked just fine, and tried her best with the assigned material. A must for Monroe fans and general film buffs, who will appreciate this document of a legendary Hollywood icon. </fullReview>

Mistaken for an actor, Mr. Montand decides to go along with the ruse and try out for the play. He wants to get close to Ms. Monroe, who isn't impressed with money and correctly realizes "Alexander Dumas" is a noted author. Monroe's co-star and lover Frankie Vaughn (as Tony Danton) falls off the wagon with worry. Public relations man Tony Randall (as Coffman) plays his usual supporting role...Whatever Monroe and Montand were doing after hours doesn't translate on camera. He has some good moments, though, especially when he hires Milton Berle, Bing Crosby and Gene Kelly to teach him the art of comedy, song and dance. There is a nicely written scene for both, involving an expensive necklace. Also fun: the prominent placement of a Greta Garbo poster and some Elvis Presley impersonators, including surf guitar legend Dick Dale. Despite guidance available from director George Cukor, the story feels very labored. Monroe is distant, appearing as if inserted into scenes with careful editing. But, she's still an attraction.**** Let's Make Love (9/8/60) George Cukor ~ Marilyn Monroe, Yves Montand, Frankie Vaughan, Tony Randall</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With the burden of all her own insecurity and distractions, and with all the commercial desperation haunting Fox's post-"Cleopatra" project, Marilyn actually delivers a very good all-round performance in "Let's Make Love." At times, such as her singing and dancing, and especially playing against Montand, I think she really is brilliant. She certainly acts and performs the wooden French star off the screen. (The thoroughly polished and rather cool British star Frankie Vaughan is a far better match for her as a performer.)Everyone has heard tell what a nightmare she could be to work with. I tend to think her Hollywood associates should have forgiven her eccentricities - apart from that late, great - and very nice - person Jane Russell, did she really have any friends in that brittle world? And yet they were all happy for her to sell the tickets that made her vehicles the big draw they were and earned the big bucks for the studios.Shame someone hadn't taken her 'little girl lost' aura more seriously than just thinking it meant she was an annoying airhead. Shame on them all for lusting after that magnificent physique, while impatiently and cruelly discarding the complex and tender person herself!If more people in her life had ever really shown her simple kindness and understanding, she might have lived longer, achieved more - and, most importantly of all, in the end, been happier.

		<fullReview>Let's Make Love, 1960 * * Verdict: mostly boring. On the positive side: opens with an interesting, imaginative introduction of the main character. The first half of the film is quite tedious and boring. Things improve a little in the second half with pace and dialogue improving and appearances by Milton Berle, Bing Crosby and Gene Kelly, playing themselves in the film, as they give advice to help our French main character learn comedy, dance and singing.The story concerns a French billionaire, who learns a stage play will be made, one which makes fun of him. He visits a rehearsal of the play and is mistaken as an actor. He decides to take advantage of this and accepts an offer to be in the play, to try to save his reputation from being tarnished. Along the way, he falls for a young female actress (Marilyn Monroe), also rehearsing for the play.For those familiar with Marilyn Monroes's films of the 50's, she was a bit overweight here. In her case, that does not detract much from her overall beauty, sensuousness and charm. As a lead character, Marilyn Monroe does not have much of a role to play here, the same old boring sex siren, this time in a stage theater setting.The Frenchmen Yves Montand, is the acting highlight, to help brighten up an otherwise mostly dull film. He has some moments of genuine charm and humor. A paycheck for Marilyn Monroe, but a waste of her comedic and dramatic talents as a film actress. She would next go on to "The Misfits", a dark and sad film and after that, was filming another comedy, "Something's Got To Give", when she was fired from the studio, hired back and shortly later, died alone, tragically at home.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wealthy Jean-Marc Clement (Yves Montand) discovers that he is going to be satirized in a play so he pays a visit to rehearsals. However, he is mistaken for an actor and asked to join the troupe. He does so under the alias of Alexander Dumas so that he can get close to the leading lady, Amanda (Marilyn Monroe). But she already has a boyfriend in the leading man, Tony Danton (Frankie Vaughan). Can Jean-Marc get his girl....? Yves Montand is good, apart from his terrible "cock-a-doodle-doo" impressions - truly awful - and there is a very obvious scene which he is given towards the end - you can just imagine the director saying "Give the French guy a mime to do". Milton Berle appears as himself and is both funny and annoying. Bing Crosby appears as himself and is totally pointless and "past it" and Marilyn Monroe shows that she could actually be quite good in certain roles. She seems to have thankfully dropped the baby-talk.Back to the story - it's complete unbelievable garbage. It's not very funny and poor old Frankie Vaughan is treated appallingly as Marilyn's love interest. In the real world, no way would the story pan out how it does. I must also mention the music numbers - they are awful. Despite a few hopeful moments in the opening number "My Heart Belongs to Daddy" (a desperately transparent attempt to emulate the success of "Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend"), it's ultimately disappointing. As is the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WAW ! Let's Watch Marilyn Monroe!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, it is not a great movie for any one worked in. Yes, it is a dull musical with poorly comic scenes. Yes, it is not the best for my beloved Marilyn Monroe. BUT...There is Marilyn Monroe here !! And here she is dancing, singing, acting, talking, smiling and moving and that is more than enough for me.Cinema is the greatest watchable art, because with it you can see all of that incredible beauty. And really it's forever. I have read about this movie for a long time before I finally got to watch it in 2006 (my friend download it from the net with "Singin' in the Rain - 1952"..God bless him). So you've got to imagine how craving I was and for years to watch this movie. And to tell you the truth anything by MM is worthy, yet in this one SHE, more than the movie itself, was ultra-worthy ! Simply Marilyn was at her best shape at it, being the best of it as well. Nothing in this movie was as high as Miss Monroe's fantastic voluptuous body and fiery sexuality. As for me I'm totally crazy nuts about the "MY HEART BELONGS TO DADDY" number.. OOHHHHH.. The music and lyrics of Cole Porter, the moves of my Marilyn, her voice, her hair, her lips, her blue sweater and her black pantyhose..All of that and more is pure sexy sexy sexy. Listen to her French "Moi? mon coeur est ? papa" or "You know, le propriétaire" ..This makes me feel the heat indeed ! and as for Marilyn's dancing it can strike and blow your mind utterly. Although her Booty is not a main point as it was in "Some Like It Hot - 1959" but it is so active in here ! So as her legs which are an outstanding entertainment apart, she was perfectly curvy (the perfect curvy woman is the word). And when it comes, at the number's end, to her kiss to one of the dancers so it is something over the top (any top), extremely sexy and ahead of its time (I discovered in the movie's original trailer that there is another unused kiss for the same situation; watch it, IT IS a treasure). In fact the movie, even if partly, oozes sexual boldness; just remember the outrageous dancing of the showgirls, some of Marilyn's obvious sexual moves at MHBTD and the movie's title; I bet it annoyed a lot of conservative people back then. The jazz mode of the number moved me highly, yet nothing was like its big finish where MM gave the sudden kiss, winked to us, went back, held the pole and opened her legs with the light off...At that point I've got all the magic of Marilyn Monroe's hot sex. I know that she never made a sex scene in her movies (simply it was the 1950s and 1960s or The Age of Innocence) but even if she did...It would've never ever been as sultry as this. Though all of this fuss is nothing when you watch her at the "Heat Wave" number of (There's No Business Like Show Business) six years earlier, which is the hottest sexy dance in the history of cinema.. But that's another story!!All in all, when the MY HEART BELONGS TO DADDY is over the movie itself for me is over also. You may watch the movie for one time, but you'd watch and re-watch that number for countless times, I can tell you that ; being exclusively Marilyn's ultimate show in color. To end my review I just search for any words to put right my true feeling for that shot in the beginning of the dance when Marilyn opened her legs then downed to the camera whispering in shivery low voice "BOYS!" ..OHHHH!!..I find no words at all!! P.S: I hope that one day the ex-spice girl (Geri Halliwell) makes a remake for this song, she is the best to do a job like this. (Juliette Lewis) did a bad remake in (Room to Rent - 2000) which I think it was an intentional parody of Marilyn Monroe.</fullReview>

In this film, millionaire Jean-Marc Clement (YVES MONTAND) goes to the off Broadway theater that has been doing a parody of him in its featured play, sees Amanda Dell (MONROE) and lets the producers think that he is an actor who's trying out for the part of Clement. He spends the remainder of this dreadful flick trying to woo Amanda under the guise that he is an actor and not the real Clement because the real McCoy has the reputation for being an obnoxious womanizer...... MARILYN MONROE never looked worse in a movie. Maybe her personal life was in its usual shambles. The song &amp; dance numbers are embarrassing to watch. MONROE looks desperate trying to appear sexy in her numbers. She is pale, overweight, and ordinary. YVES MONTAND, maybe because he's in an American film here, has no charm whatsoever. In fact, he has counter-charm ! Probably the homeliest man that MONROE ever played opposite. Did RONDO HATTAN have previous commitments ? The storyline itself is insipid &amp; stupid ! Even the supporting cast, and there is some big names in this one, have nothing to work with. The only appeal here is for big MONROE fans, and believe me, those fans will only get small glimpses of her usual magic !!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Low on plot, low on good script, low on greatness. Yes, it is not the best Marilyn film, or the best film of any at that rate. But, it is a sweet charming movie. The movie was not made to get Oscars, it was made to put out a film and have a little fun. I think it is perfect for what it is. I think Marilyn gives a good performance, not her best of course, but she rolls on well. She works well in the hands of a woman's director, Cukor... Anyways, if looking for a feel good, funny movie, go rent this one...*** out of *****3 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointment!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What makes this a disappointment is this film is so routine. Anyone could have played the lead and it's heartbreaking that Marilyn Monroe, who gave us only a handful of films to remember her by, is so wasted in this. Making it even worse was that this followed her very best film; "Some Like It Hot." But let's face it, any film with Marilyn is watchable. The lady had magic, no matter how poor the vehicle she was in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE WORST MARILYN MONROE FILM EVER! She was stuck with a terrible terrible movie, and try as she may the movie was a flop at the box office. Montand plays a millionaire who finds out that a play will be making fun of him. He goes to the theatre to complain, and is mistaken as a look-a-like. He goes with the flow after seeing Marilyn and deciding he wants to get close to her! The only good thing about this film is Monroe's "My Heart Belongs to Daddy" performance. And even that was not her best! One star rating and that's only because Monroe was in the film! Anyone else and the movie would get half a star!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, I'm one of the biggest and most loyal Marilyn fans, but this movie sucks. Her character is at times cute but not nearly as cute/lovable as her other "dumb blonde" roles such as The Girl in "The Seven Year Itch." I do not like Yves Montand or his character - sorry to go with stereotypes, but he is the "Dirty Frenchman," spying on her, finding out her address and personal information, twisting things to get her affection, being cloyingly (and not convincingly) sweet to "win" her...And as far as theplay that was going on...okay, though I loved the number, what does "My Heart Belongs to Daddy" have to do with the play's supposed point? And if you'll notice, Yves is not very good at anything, even after all those people try to help him sing, but funny, etc. Yet they keep him on the play when Amanda's boyfriend is doing all the rehearsing for the Jean-Marc character. So does he have teh part or not? And if not, why is her still there?! Nothing in this movie fits with what it's supposed to be doing! I've read that Marilyn did not like this role, and neither did I. She may "have a heart of gold," and all those other cliches, but the character is just dumb (despite her going to night school - she should get her money back). Like I said, I love Marilyn but...even she saw how absurd this film was! If you're interested in Marilyn's best "dumb blonde" characters, I suggest you go see "The Seven Year Itch," "Some Like It Hot," or "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" with its superb "Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend" song (though her character in this movie is not really dumb...go see it, you'll know what I mean.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have a hard time understanding why a slim minority heaped praises on this film. The film goes absolutely no where, and as far as French males go Yves Montand is one of the least attractive Europeans I've ever seen (and that's putting it too mildly). Surely Monroe's character has better taste than this?No one's funny in this movie. Comic legend Milton Berle can't hope to save this film with his small part, ditto with dancing legend Gene Kelly's cameo, nor any of the other cast. Monroe herself, as appealing as she is, can't salvage a blase script like this turkey.There're so many things wrong with this film. Drab costumes, uninspired numbers, miscued performances, wandering story and just overall poor direction that it's a wonder it was ever released at all. Though I suppose the studio had to recoup its losses somehow.I'd heard a lot about this film since I was a boy, but had never had a chance to see it, probably because it was deemed to racy at the time for younger audiences. Well, now I've seen it, and not only do I wish I hadn't, I wish it had never been preserved. Then again we need poor films in this world to remind us good films are good in the first place. Too bad Marilyn had to be in this one.Do yourself a favor and pass on this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It does not mean to have sex</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During my schooldays I once wrote an essay on Chaucer in which I stated that the Wife of Bath "liked to make love to lots of different men". This was returned to me by my teacher with the comment in red ink "Making love does not mean this! If you mean having sexual intercourse, why not say so!" I was baffled until my father explained that to the older generation (and my teacher must have been born around 1910) the phrase "to make love" meant simply to kiss, cuddle and whisper sweet nothings. It did not mean to have sex. Which explains why it was, as late as 1960, possible to make a film called "Let's Make Love" without it being banned by the censor as pornographic. (It also explains why Doris Day could include the line "Make love to me!" in the song "Move Over, Darling" without losing her "good girl" reputation). The film stars Marilyn Monroe and essentially inverts the plot of one of her earlier films, "How to Marry a Millionaire". In that film Marilyn plays a gold-digger whose ambition is to marry a wealthy man but who ends up marrying for love. In "Let's Make Love" her character, Amanda Dell, is a free-thinking idealist who despises the idea of marrying for money but who ends up with a billionaire. There are also similarities to the plot of "The French Line", which starred Marilyn's close friend Jane Russell, although in that film the sex roles are reversed; it is the woman who wants a man who will love her for herself, not her money, and therefore keeps her wealth a secret. In both films the man is French and the woman American. In the original script the billionaire was to have been an American and several actors, from Gary Cooper to Charlton Heston, were canvassed for the part. Gregory Peck was cast at one time, but later dropped out. Eventually the film-makers decided to make him a Frenchman, Jean-Marc Clement, and Yves Montand was chosen to play the role. (Cyd Charisse was originally slated to play Amanda before Monroe was cast). The plot involves Clement learning that he is to be satirised in an off- Broadway revue and going along to the theatre to find out more. By a misunderstanding, the director assumes that he is an actor who has come to audition for a part, and Clement ends up playing himself in the revue. He does not, however, enlighten anyone as to his true identity, as he has fallen in love with Amanda, a beautiful young actress appearing in the same show. Because he wants to be loved for himself and not for his money, and because he quickly realises that Amanda is not interested in wealth, he decides to woo her under an assumed name. This was to be Marilyn's penultimate film before her death. (Her last was to be "The Misfits"). She did not have a high opinion of it, having only accepted the role in order to fulfil a contractual obligation to 20th Century Fox, and described it as "the worst in her career". Her husband Arthur Miller was similarly critical, even though he had contributed towards the script. Certainly, it has its weaknesses. Montand was capable of projecting great charm and personality, but he was not a fluent English speaker and his heavy accent sometimes makes his lines difficult to understand. Yet the film also has its strengths, and some of these lie in the areas where Marilyn and her husband made their contributions. The script is elegant and witty, although I cannot say how much of this is due to Miller and how much to the original scriptwriter Norman Krasna. Moreover, a lot of the success of "Let's Make Love" is down to Marilyn's performance. She was one of those fortunate few who seemed to get more attractive as she got older (the late Princess Diana was another), and by 1960 the ordinarily pretty girl of the early part of her career had blossomed into a genuinely beautiful woman. Yet she had done so without losing the ability to convey an innocent girl-next-door charm, which in this film is an important part of Amanda's personality. The more sensuous Charisse, a great beauty and a brilliant dancer but a mediocre actress, could never have done that so well. There are also good contributions from Tony Randall and Wilfrid Hyde-White as two of Clement's employees, and Bing Crosby, Gene Kelly and the comedian Milton Berle as themselves. (They are hired by Clement to teach him some of the tricks of showbiz). In its day "Let's Make Love" possibly seemed rather conservative, a romantic comedy from the sixties which was not too different from the sort of thing Hollywood was doing in the forties or even (apart from the use of colour) in the thirties. This may explain why contemporary reviews were mixed and it was not a great box office success, certainly not when compared to most other films starring Monroe. (Her previous film, "Some Like It Hot", for example, had been a smash hit). Over the next decade styles of film-making were to change enormously; by 1965 a film like this would have been deeply unfashionable and by 1970 virtually inconceivable. Yet today I think we can appreciate the film for what it is, a sophisticated and amusing rom-com from a particular era in cinema history. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked this movie. I thought it was "cute" I guess I could say. I love Marilyn. Someone said, "She wasn't the best actress around." Hmm. She didn't really ever get a chance to show how much she could act. She could act very well. She was very talented. They kept putting her in these roles that didn't show just how talented she was. I bet you anything she was one of the best actresses ever. She didn't know how to act at first, but she learned how to and was VERY good at it. People even said that her acting was MUCH better than LAURENCE OLIVIER'S in The Prince and the Showgirl. Hell, if I got really really good at acting, but only got to do roles like that (even though Marilyn did want to be an actress, not a star, she wanted to do serious roles and be taken seriously) I bet I wouldn't look like I could act all that much. She didn't get a chance to show just what she was made of. Now that I think of it, like two of her films were serious. Watch those, and you'll see just what I mean when I say she was a very very good actress. She is in fact my favorite. She rocked. This movie was okay. But Some Like It Hot was my favorite comedy with her in it. I would have to say there's no way I could hate a Marilyn Monroe film. But my favorites so far have been Don't Bother To Knock, Niagara, and Some Like It Hot. I just thought of something else. She got to a point where she didn't want to do these comedies where she pretended to be a sexpot and or a dumb blonde. That might have something to do with her not showing just what she was made of also.</fullReview>

Cukor's direction is invisible, the narrative unexciting, Porter's songs are pretty unmemorable and the on-screen duo of surprisingly lukewarm Monroe and absurdly miscast Montand disappointing. Occasional pleasurable moments are provided by some, if not enough, sophistication in dialogue and characterization.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A poor film only occasionally brought to life by Marilyn's performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I quite enjoyed the 'set pieces' with Marilyn doing her stuff singing 'My heart belongs to Daddy' etc. but watching the film turned increasingly more irritable through having to watch, ('endure' might be a more appropriate verb), the scenes between Marilyn's appearances. Montand is simply miscast and one begins to feel simply sorry for him after the first few scenes, (whilst remembering him in such movies as 'The wages of fear'), and, apart from the ever-reliable Wilfrid Hyde-White, I thought the inputs/cameos by the other 'stars' were either so short as to be inconsequential, (Bing Crosby and Gene Kelly), or just simply atrocious, (i.e. Merton Berl and Tony Randall! Churchill said Britain and the USA were 'divided by a common language' but how on earth Randall and Berl could ever be classified by use of the word 'comedians' remains, on the basis on their inputs to this movie, a total and complete mystery to this particular Brit! I began to cringe when they appeared for yet another squirm-inducingly UNfunny escapade, (Berl's walking on his heels or Randall looking lost and dejected yet again, for example)). Verdict: hardly worth the effort of viewing apart from Marliyn's set-pieces. Set the remote to 'FFW' in between these.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The stars save it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Let's make love' is symptomatic of the crisis of the musical in the 1960s - the drowning of amiable stars in bloated 'super'-productions devoid of visual quality. The songs are generally lacklustre, the choreography suffers from the claustrophobic setting; the direction is so self-effacing as to be Cheshire Cat-like; the plotting and characterisation are cynically lax. The wasting of Yves Montand's song-and-dance talents seems like wilful foot-shooting. That it is at all enjoyable is due to the unexpected chemistry of stars in stock roles - Montand as a skirt-chasing French billionaire, Monroe as a knowing yet naive kook-blonde. The opening animated sequence is fun too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this is one great movie. Ms. Monroe is at the top of her game in this type of film. She oozes sex, womanliness, with a bit of naivety and intelligence thrown into the mixture. Mr. Montand, as usual, understates his role and does so beautifully. He always reminds me of a person who has constipation, but that is part of his acting charm. The plot is simple, the songs fantastic and the cast very nice. The highlight of the movie for myself is Ms. Monroe and Mr. Vaughn singing "Let's Make Love." Boy after that scene I always feel like seducing the man I love. In this scene Ms. Monroe comes across as a powerful woman who knows that she holds all of the cards necessary to vamp and bed the nervous Mr. Vaughn who sings his part beautifully. Isn't it a riot how Mr. Montand daydreams he is singing the song with her and lies across the chair in an embrace? This is one of a very few movies that I could see many times without wanting to fast forward through this or that scene. I would have like to hear Mr. Montand sing the title song in its entirety. A very sexy, comical bit of entertainment!Well, after five years, I still enjoy the movie. In fact I now own the DVD so I can hear the beautiful rendention of the title song any time I wish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yves Montand plays wealthy tycoon who finds he's being spoofed in a new musical revue; he strikes back by getting into show business himself. Tired backstage shenanigans looks like a remake of 1937's "On the Avenue" with a sex-reversal, none of it helped by George Cukor's uninspired direction. The glossy coating over this fluff is so thick, the actors look smudgy and perform lethargically, particularly Marilyn Monroe (who was reportedly having an affair with Montand during the movie's shoot). This all must have looked promising on paper (what with star-cameos delivered and the usual run of intermittent ditties), but the results fail to generate any sparks. This nearly put the kibosh on French star Montand's bid for Hollywood stardom; he seems itchy and uncomfortable. * from ****</fullReview>

Marilyn, looking pasty and bloated performs this number in an old, loose fitting sweater. So much for her hourglass figure. Yves Montand showing that he has no funny bone in his body whatsoever, coupled with the non-existent chemistry of the two on the screen, one can only imagine the lack of sizzle off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst Monroe movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marilyn Monroe' considerable on screen charisma is lost in Let's Make Love, a supposed romantic comedy that looks exactly like what it is: a contractual obligation. Monroe plays an actress named Amanda who is playing a role in a horrific off-Broadway show satirizing French billionaire Jean-Marc Clement played by an oddly subdued Yves Montand. Montand's character is alerted to the upcoming spoof and decides to pay a visit to the theater's. One look and he is smitten with Monroe, this despite the fact that everything conceivably possible has been done to ameliorate Monroe's beauty and luminosity. She's overweight, she's pasty, her hair's bleached to straw and she's filmed using the worst lighting imaginable.After reading the mostly kind reviews here on IMDb, and being a considerable Monroe fan I decided to give this film another go despite being unable to watch it at least five times prior (hey! I said I was a fan!). Even her relatively strong singing (truly, she was well-trained - see Ladies of the Chorus) falls flat here. The film is a boring, tedious mess that can't be saved by either Monroe or the cameos of Milton Berle, Bing Crosby or Gene Kelly. All I could feel while watching this movie was a deep sense of sympathy for Monroe, who is abused by both Cukor and Miller (who apparently wrote some of her lines).</fullReview>

She seems to be sleepwalking through the whole movie. The production values are missing, ex. the writing is the worst, also poor lighting, framing, the musical numbers are lifeless, the directing and acting is poor, I guess George Cukor was getting too old and tired, and couldn't get the actors to give their best. I think the main problem is that the material was just too poor to make anything worthwhile out of it.
