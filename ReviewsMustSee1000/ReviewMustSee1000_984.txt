		<shortDescription>Enjoyable, but leaves you puzzled.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed this film, but I was left a little puzzled at the end by what I'd just watched in terms of what type of movie this is.It starts off as a very Tarantino-esquire film, it's clear that he wrote it as his famous dialogue is present. It's an enjoyable crime thriller much along the lines of Tarantino's other works (such as Pulp Fiction &amp; Reservoir Dogs) but with a bit of Robert Rodriguez flare shown during the action sequences.Then with about 50-ish minutes left, the style film changes entirely. It becomes another film, it goes from stylish crime thriller to random vampire action movie. It's almost as if Tarantino left the room while writing the script and somebody wrote the rest of the film for him, it loses it's Tarantino charm and becomes a predictable, gore fest, vampire flick.I'm a fan of Vampire films, so I still enjoyed the movie, but I can see why others don't like it. The acting is of high quality, especially from Geroge Clooney who outdoes himself, and in parts saves the film.8/10 - Watch with an open mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crime/Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this film for many reasons. For one, the switch from a crime thriller to a horror thriller was seamless. I for one had not heard much about this film before I watched it, and I assumed the TV Times were mistaken in called this a gory horror thriller. To me, it was a simple crime thriller, the norm which is expected from Tarantino's pen. However, the switch was such a shock and so fast, that I didn't now what happened I was amazed at this revelation, since there was no word of any horror topics beforehand in the script. It was completely out of the blue, and resulted in a pleasant surprise.And the thing that's interesting is that BOTH halves to this film, both the crime section and horror section are enjoyable. The first half has less action, but tension does mount between Keitel and Clooney, while Tarantino is in the back, paying special attention to Keitel's daughter. A great premise with an equally great script in the first half. The second section is also great because of the horrific violence and as I heard mentioned before, the unique ways on how to kill vampires.The script is witty and full of dark humour, "I have 6 little friends and they all run faster than you.", and the intro is certainly one of the best I have seen in months. The characters are well established, with Clooney as the 'gentleman' (well, not really) crook, Tarantino as his psychotic brother (who, strangely, I found difficult not to warm to) and Keitel is the preacher who has lost his faith, the hostage who will help out later when the satanic hordes unleash themselves.A special mention must go to Salma Hayek for that special dance. ;) While this film was never made out of blockbuster material, it is still very understated, taking a unique and perhaps surreal viewing on the horror genre, all the while using horror stereotypes. As far as graphic violence is concerned, it is on par with the likes of Evil Dead (well, perhaps not THAT bad).For once, this is a film which doesn't give the viewer all the answers beforehand. You are in the same boat as the characters and you don't know what's in store for them. If you hadn't seen this before, without any knowledge of the movie, you'd be in for a huge surprise as I was.An 8/10 for it's script (thanks to Tarantino) and the actors who, while not trying too hard, make this an enjoyable horror flick with a difference.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'From Dusk Till Dawn' is kind of brilliant, brutal, bloody, Tarantino, horror, silly and funny. It is brilliant, brutal, bloody, horror, silly and funny the way Sam Raimi's 'The Evil Dead'-series is all those things, the twist here is a screenplay written by Quentin Tarantino. This means the first hour is just brutal and bloody, sometimes a little funny, in the 'Pulp Fiction' kind of way.We see two brothers named Seth (George Clooney) and Richie Gecko (Quentin Tarantino). They are bank robbers, although they do the occasional killing as well. We learn they want to reach the Mexican border. That the entire state of Texas and the FBI are looking for them is a problem so they force the Fuller family to bring them across the border with their motor home. Father Jacob (Harvey Keitel) used to be a minister but gave up faith after his wife died in a car crash. He travels with his adopted son Scott (Ernest Liu) and his daughter Kate (Juliette Lewis).So we have the first hour, filled with Tarantino-stuff in its dialogue and references, and then the party arrives at a bar called the Titty Twister. Not long after they are inside it is revealed that every crew member from the bar is actually a vampire, feeding themselves on bikers and truckers that visit the place. The Fullers and Geckos survive together with a guy who calls himself Sex Machine (Tom Savini) and a guy named Frost (Fred Williamson). Now they are a team and face vampires as their opponents.You see how this movie is actually two movies. Especially the second part will find a smaller audience and in a way I was a little curious how the first part would have ended if they kept it as serious as it was. Still, because the movie shifts the way it does it becomes quite original. We have a crime movie to start and a horror comedy, really in the Sam Raimi way, to end. If you are able to take it the way it comes, not too serious, there is a good chance you might like it. Even the gore is presented in a silly way, making it less gory.Clooney's cool performance, the fitting soundtrack, some hilarious moments, Tarantino's fine touches all make this a highly original, quite bloody, vampire adventure. If you are a genre fan don't miss it, if you are not you might give it a try and be pleasantly surprised.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film defies classification...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Critics of "From Dusk 'Till Dawn" often dismiss it as grade Z-slasher tripe, however the film is really two separate but equal genres (hard boiled crime drama and B-horror comedy) scotch taped together. Definitely not everyone's cup o' cinematic joe, this movie has more energy, wit and style than most high-budget Hollywood actioners. Clooney and Tarantino make a classic duo in two powerhouse and differing performances. T-man's script is crammed full of his usual over-the-top dialogue (if only criminals were really this interesting) and a lot of love for the conventions of B flicks from his youth. I give it a 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robbers and Preachers and Vampires, oh my!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone trying to do a 'serious review' of this movie needs to lighten up. George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino are the Gecko brothers, two bad, bad men on their way to Mexico. Along the way they pick up a preacher played by Harvey Keitel and his two kids. They're supposed to meet a partner at a bar called The Titty Twister, and once they get there madness ensues. From there it takes a turn that many seem to find infuriating but I personally find highly entertaining. It's humming along like a typical Tarantino picture, and then- BOOM. Out of nowhere, it becomes all too clear that these two bad, bad men are not by a longshot the baddest in *this* bar. All of this can- and *will*, given the right attitude on the part of the viewers- read as a loving high-five to 70s zombie flicks, a homage to the campy fun of those movies. The tough guy dialog continues throughout, the gore level is astounding, and we see via Kate- the preacher's daughter, played by Juliette Lewis- that sometimes a p***ed-off virgin with a crossbow can more than hold her own. On top of that, it has a hella-cool biker-bar soundtrack and Salma Hayek in a bikini. What's not to like?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Half an interesting film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first half of this film is like anything you'd expect from Quentin Tarintino and Robert Rodriguez: cool 70's soundtrack, snappy dialogue, really good editing, lots of violence, and a slightly unconvincing role by QT himself. I thought it was disturbing, stylish and pretty good for the first half, and was enjoying it.And then they get to the Titty Twister, where there are lots and lots of vampires and lots of blood and nudity, and lots of fighting, and, for me, it just went completely downhill. It felt silly and just inappropriate from what we'd seen at the beginning, and I actually got a little bored.That being said, I really liked Harvey Kietel's performance and George Clooney was much better than I'd thought he'd be. Plus, Salma Hayek is one sexy kitten.So yeah, half a good film. If you love over the top vampire films though complete with dated effects, then go for it, because you might just like it</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gore + vampires + Tarantino &amp; Rodriquez= great entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Rodriguez's From Dusk till Dawn combines vicious violence, Cheech Marin vampires, and some funny humor from the cast into one big collective film. More than a basic horror movie, it has Rodriquez as a fine director and Quentin Tarantino as a good screenwriter who bring to the screen basic shoot em up fun. Not all of it is for the people out there, but for thrill seeking teens, it's worth a glance.The story involves 2 criminal brothers (George Clooney and Tarantino) who are part focused and part insane. They kidnap a family (Harvey Keitel, Ernest Liu and Juliette Lewis) and bring them to a bar called the T**y twister while waiting for morning and their money prize. But what ensues in that bar is terrific fun in which all the members are vampires and are relentless "from dusk till dawn". Great fun, terrific violence (if not disgusting) and cool quotes bring this film to a fine T. Look for Tom Savini as Sex Machine, Salma Hayek as a stripper and Cheech Marin who plays 3 characters.

		<shortDescription>Great action-packed thrill ride!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directors Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino are probably the two most recognizable faces of the generation of filmmakers who had their start in the independent scene of the early 90s. Rodriguez had a tremendous success with his western-inspired action movie "El Mariachi" while Tarantino reached fame and glory after updating heist movies in "Reservoir Dogs". Their friendship lead them to make movies together starting with "Four Rooms", but together with make-up masters Kurtzman, Nicotero and Berger the two young directors crafted one of the most original movies of the 90s: "From Dusk Till Dawn".The plot starts with the escape of two criminal brothers, Seth (George Clooney) and Richard Gecko (Tarantino himself) and their effort to reach Mexico kidnapping the family of a faith-less preacher named Jacob Fuller (Harvey Keitel) who was traveling with his daughter Kate (Juliette Lewis) and his son Scott (Ernest Liu). In their escape the group will arrive to a Mexican strip club where nothing is what it seems.The story (by Kurtzman) is a very good mix of action, western and horror cleverly put together in Tarantino's witty script. Rodriguez direction gives the film the a 70s feeling that gives the movie a Drive-In spirit pretty much in tone with the plot. In fact, at times the film feels like an updated version of exploitation action films of that era. This lack of pretensions makes it even more enjoyable as it never tries to be something else than pure entertainment.The movie is interestingly divided in two, the first half dedicated to establishing the relationships between the characters, particularly the complicated clash of the Geckos and the Fullers, in a typical Tarantino style crime/drama fashion; on the other hand, the second half is an action packed thrill ride on the style of 70s action movies that clearly shows John Carpenter's influence over Rodriguez. While it is definitely a tribute to their influences, the Rodriguez/Tarantino team create a solid movie that stands on its own as a very original take on horror movies.The acting is very effective, with George Clooney carrying the film as the cool-headed older brother who has to take care of his psychotic younger brother. Tarantino is average, but he was certainly having fun with the role. Keitel is terrific as always and is perfect as the faithless pastor who doesn't trust in God anymore. Apearances by Salma Hayek and make-up virtuoso Tom Savini have small but unforgettable roles. Savini steals the film in his role as a biker that brings back memories of his part in Romero's classic "Dawn of the Dead". All in all is a very complete and solid cast that certainly gives the movie a very special flavor.The special effects by KNB are top-notch, but the CGI used in some scenes is poor when compared to the traditional prosthetic make-up employed in the rest of the film. While the violence is never intended to be realistic, the poor CGI at times make it look more cartoon-like than what it was supposed to be, but it is not a real damaging flaw and the film is still highly enjoyable.Rodriguez has always done films to have fun, and this is what has set him apart from other filmmakers (Tarantino included). His lack of pretensions and his dedication to his craft seem to transmit the fun he has making movies to the audience who watches them. While his films may not have an introspective depth or a high philosophical meaning, they work perfectly as entertainment of the highest quality. This underrated film is probably among his best and most enjoyable films of his young career. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An action-packed extravaganza!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Dusk Till Dawn is simply a fun movie. Not meant to be taken seriously at all. If you're looking for a movie to sit back and enjoy for brainless entertainment, get this. There is nothing wrong with the acting, the music really good and the special effects are gross (but great).The first half of the story revolves around the Gecko brothers, Seth (George Clooney) and Richie (Quentin Tarantino). They need to get past the Mexican border to a bar named the "Titty Twister." Along the way they take hostage the Fuller family, Jacob (Harvey Keital), Kate (Juliette Lewis) and Scott (Ernest Liu). In the second part of the movie they make it to the bar, unfortunately it is a bar run by vampires and soon enough the feasting begins.This movie is great in a lot of ways. First, the script is written brilliant, it is darkly humorous. A lot of the lines had be laughing very hard. The acting is good from all the cast and the special effects are pretty disgusting. We have decapitations, limbs getting torn off, throats getting ripped out and plenty of impalements. For gore hounds, this movie is gold. This movie never really gets boring. This movie is not meant to be anything groundbreaking, just entertaining, which it is.3?/5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pointless and repulsive waste of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just what is the point of this film? It starts off as one film, then changes track, cheating us of a resolution to that film and ends as another movie which is nothing but a pale, pale imitation of so many other schlock-horror flicks you've ever seen. The overall impression is confusion in every respect and a great deal of hubris. Screenplay by Tarantino, direction by Rodriguez, two guys who have previously shown talent, but who now seem to believe their own hype and assume that whatever they do must be good merely because THEY did it. But it doesn't quite work that way. You're only good while you continue doing good things. There are so many questions to ask: Just what are George Clooney and Harvey Keitel doing getting involved in such pointless dreck? Clooney initially makes an intriguing bad guy ? utterly ruthless and efficient ? and it would have been interesting to see where that was going. But, of course, we never do. And the Clooney of the vampire film changes into a completely different character. That's not clever or witty, that's just bad, bad work. Keitel looks thoroughly ill at ease throughout, and no wonder. Did no one in the studio take a look at the script before this project was given the go-ahead? Tarantino is utterly unpleasant as a murderous sexual deviant (and why did he, as writer, assume we would find the rape, gruesome murder and butchering of an inoffensive hostage funny). On every level ? except the technical ? this film stinks. Avoid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was not a good movie!! Why do you people keep saying that? There is a nice little story going on and then some sexy girls and then BAM vampires!!! Why? Why are there vampires? Where did they come from? Also, what the hell?! There are all of these "super human" vampires but George Clooney and three other random guys dominate ALL of them. Quickly too. It's not like there was a long fight scene with lots of struggle. There was just three dudes from the bar killing these vampires like a fat man kills twinkies! The next thing you know, Clooney and the stupid girl are rescued by Cheech and leaves the family-less homeless in the middle of Mexico. End of story. Literally. Oh and the strip club was an Aztec temple which is funny because that would have to be southern Mexico not the border. Why are you people lying and telling people this is a good movie? Do not rent, buy or even watch this movie at a friend's house. You will wish you had that time of your life back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Your Average Mexican Hay-ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I am not AS lovestruck with this film as many other reviewers are, I did find it an entertaining albeit conscience-churning experience. From Dusk Till Dawn really is two films in one. The first part tells the story of the Gecko boys(Not Geico) played by George Clooney and Quentin Tarentino. They are escapees from the law and have killed over a dozen people brutally already by the time the film opens. For me, this tale of how they kill a gas station guy and finally abduct a preacher and his two children for their RV is the most chilling part of the film. Clooney plays a guy with little moral conscience well. Tarentino does a good job too and you can see his wit throughout the script. I found both men very despicable, so I guess the acting was good. The film falls into parody/farce, however, once the the whole gang(the two Geckos and the preacher and his daughter and son)reach a strip club/bar out in the middle of nowhere in Mexico. What happens here, to the uninformed viewer, will be totally unexpected. Does it work? To a degree, however, the film really loses momentum and credibility it might have had. The acting in general is all acceptable. Harvey Keitel once again shows us why he is such a good actor. Juliette Lewis is also very good in her role as his daughter. Nice to see guys like Tom Savini and Fred Williamson too. Oh, and Salma Hayek IS the highlight of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love dissing this movie. My peers always try their best to defend it, probably out of love for Quentin Tarantino or Harvey Keitel, but they'll never convince me that this one should be treasured. Here's some huge reasons why: A: The plot goes from kidnapping road trip movie to vampire-inhabited strip bar slasher flick with no set-up whatsoever. Suddenly something very real turns into something very fake, which is like sitting the audience down to a Thanksgiving feast then exploding it with dynamite. B: That untalented Juliette Lewis is in it. C: Preposterous ideas abound such as actual torso-and-leg guitars, brothers with the last name "Gecko," bad vampire make-up jobs, Cheech Marin playing three characters (?), and a crotch-based gun that only fires when "erect" and belongs to a guy who goes by "Sex Machine." If Robert Rodriguez didn't pathetically try to be so innovative with his violence, I might've had fun with this obvious popcorn flick. The whole project's like he got the ideas by playing with action figures. The only thing even close to being considered my favorite scene is George Clooney's laugh-out-loud cheesy monologue after he kills his blood-sucking, horny-for-children, terrible-acting brother. I swear I think they thought it up right then and there. This movie's out to offend, and ends up offending those who want the offensive. Horrible movie.</fullReview>

Robert Rodriguez, known for his other gory flicks including el mariachi, desperado, once upon a time in Mexico, and the very recent sin city ... really holds your attention with the well executed first half ... which leads you to believe that you are in for an entertaining time ... but then apparently for no reason, and without any provocation, the madness starts ... there's even feeble attempts at parody and comedy ... truly exasperating!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say that this is actually a good movie although it does lose it's way towards the end. The final 15 minutes I thought were a little crappy. I prefer more realism in my vampires but having said that, I cannot fault Tarantino, his is perfect in the role as the twisted Richard Gecko, and although I don't usually like George Clooney he was surprisingly cool as Seth. There are some funny moments that you have to have a slightly twisted humour to appreciate (which I do!) and as long as you don't take it too seriously, it is an entertaining movie. If you like overacting, lots and lots of blood and Tarantino movies then go see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From Dusk Till Dawn (1996) Review: How bout this? George Clooney in a different role? Yep. For once he tries something different.From Dusk Till Dawn is something else. This is about two criminal brothers(Clooney and Tarantino)wind up taking a family hostage to make it across the Mexican border to a meeting point, a bar called the "Titty Twister". That's where the Gecko brothers are to meet another group of crooks.....at dawn. This bar is open from dusk till dawn....and is filled with vampires.This movie starts off as something else at first. More like a gritty crime movie, then becomes a total spatter-fest. This isn't at all bad, just takes a total turn. The vampires here are a bunch of ugly as hell monsters. Think of the Evil Dead movies only the undead zombies and skeletons are vampires instead and that's the score with the very small supply of vampire slayers to take them on.Like I say, if you are a fan of the Evil Dead movies, then this is the treat for you. It does not have the amount of silly humor like them, but has the gore nailed just right. The makeup effects are dead-on as well. This just happens to be more gritty than the Evil Dead.The Last Word: I like it. Good for your October needs. Did I forget Salma Hayek and Cheech Marin? They are here as well. Good bloody fun.</fullReview>

The rest of the movie from that point was totally awful.I gave it 4 stars for the brilliant beginning alone. I think that's a little generous, but I was entertained for a while.

		<shortDescription>Concept: 9, execution: 6</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I sat down to this movie with no preconceptions whatsoever, as had been recommended to me. This turned out to be very good advice, because it makes the twist in the middle a complete surprise, and therefore all the more enjoyable. (It is for this reason that I'm giving a spoiler warning, as even knowing there is a twist might rob people of that experience.) Essentially you're thrown from one movie into a completely different one, with the main characters as the only thread holding the two together. Almost the entire plot from the first 30 minutes is rendered irrelevant, which I thought was a great idea. Usually, you sort of know where a story is going. If the point is for the protagonist to travel to a volcano and throw a ring into it, you know they are going to be successful. You have some suspense of disbelief that allows you to still experience some fear when a perilous situation presents itself, but at a more "meta" level you know what Frodo isn't going to die in the first book/film.This movie takes that expectation and punches it in the face. Unfortunately, though, the concept is not carried to a satisfying end. After the monsters are let loose, there are about 10 minutes where the movie is able to ride the absurdity of this gear shift, but then finds itself stuck with a bunch of vampires to get rid of, and a plot to tie a knot in. And through the insistence to pay homage to cheap gore movies, the tension arcs that were built up in the first half of the movie are deflated without pay-off, and the relationships between the characters are essentially reset. This robs the movie of a connection between the two stories, as well as a proper resolution. Still, it's an entertaining 90 minutes and a must-see cult classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outrageous, intentionally trashy comedy-horror-thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1960, Alfred Hitchcock did something unthinkable in the film "Psycho". Halfway into the movie he killed off the main character (and the film's biggest star), thereby shocking the audience through sheer unpredictability while simultaneously changing the expected course of the narrative. A similar trick is employed in "From Dusk Till Dawn" (although the two films are nothing alike). For the first half the film is a kinetic crime thriller, characterised by writer Quentin Tarantino's trademark witty, hard-boiled dialogue and a clutch of well delineated characters. At the halfway point, the film suddenly switches to become an ultra-gory, ultra-violent vampire movie, almost a hyperactive homage to "Night Of The Living Dead"! It is a jarring switch; the effect is like watching half of two separate movies. There is an element of frustration that the serious crime thriller half never gets properly resolved, and similar frustration that the horror half is not introduced and built-up logically. But both halves are undeniably well-made and the actors seem to be having a great deal of fun with their outrageous roles.Psychotic criminal brothers Seth (George Clooney) and Richard (Quentin Tarantino) Gecko go on a murderous robbery spree across Texas. Their aim is to cross the Mexican border and rendezvous with one of Seth's buddies, and to ensure their safe passage they take a female hostage. When Richard kills the hostage the brothers are forced to find new ones, so they seize a family travelling in a RV - ex-preacher Jacob Fuller (Harvey Keitel) and his kids Scott (Ernest Liu) and Kate (Juliette Lewis). After a palm-sweating trip across the border the crooks and their hostages arrive at the rendezvous point, a raunchy biker-/trucker nightclub called the Titty Twister that stands in the middle of nowhere. Seth is hell-bent on getting drunk while waiting for his contact to arrive, but soon has to change his plans when it becomes apparent the Titty Twister is actually the lair of a bunch of super-strong blood-sucking vampires that have been feeding off their customers for years! An all-out gore-fest ensues as the mortals take on the vampires in a battle that literally lasts from dusk till dawn!Tarantino's intentionally vulgar, tongue-in-cheek script is complemented by the frenetic direction of his real-life pal Robert Rodriguez. They are making their own rules here, delivering a movie that cannily taps into the juvenile wish-fulfilment fantasies of tough kids, adding heaps of bad language, gore, nudity and stylized violence. The special effects are quite good, with limbs being ripped out and vampire bodies melting and burning and exploding left, right and centre. Clooney turns in a spirited star-making performance, while Tarantino is OK as his unbalanced brother. Keitel is clearly much too good for his role as the disillusioned preacher but in spite of this he slums it with considerable spirit. Similarly, Lewis doesn't have to register much real acting emotion as the hostage daughter but she enters into the simple-minded violent action with panache. "From Dusk Till Dawn" is a raucous, self-indulgent action/comedy/road movie/horror flick - crazy nonsense that was great fun for the cast and crew to make, and is a guilty pleasure for the audience to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i had never heard about this movie before, but i was a big Tarantino fan. So one day on comcast, there was a section called All Tarantino in the on demand section, and i saw From Dusk Till Dawn, and I had never heard of it so i started watching it. It was good, it had the same dark and twisted feel of any Tarantino movie, and then one hour into the movie, with only 30 minutes left into it, everyone turns into a vampire and everyone gets killed. If your looking for a terrible movie that will leave you saying what the F#@$, go ahead and watch this. If you take out its horrible choreography, bad acting(good actors but terrible acting... except for the Chinese kid, he just sucked straight up monkey a$$) the ridiculous weapons they use or how about VAMPIRES in general, this would be a good movie. Maybe this would have been a good movie if it was only being watched by 4 year old children the day it came out in theaters so they would actually get a scare out of this (and so they could explore ma$+urbating</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I watched FDTD, I didn't have any major expectations, and so I wasn't disappointed with the result. It took me a bit to get a hold of the sudden plot shift. For the most part there wasn't really anything that stuck with me, except for George Clooney's tattoo and the final shot of the movie. OTOH, this is a movie that I would certainly watch again. Partly because I like Juliette Lewis (maybe that will give you a reference point on which to compare my opinion), but also because it's a good ride while it lasts. Don't go looking for deep meaning where there isn't one, you'll only come out feeling cheated. Oh, and BTW, this movie really isn't for the weak of stomach. I give it 65%.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The return of the B-movies!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"From Dusk Till Dawn" is a great crossover between A- and B-movies, that only a genius like Quentin Tarantino could have made possible: there are great character actors (Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis) next to Hollywood superstars like George Clooney, Salma Hayek or Tarantino himself. Not to forget the excavation of almost forgotten cult-,trash- and C-movie actors like Cheech Marin, Fred Williamson, Tom Savini, John Saxon or Michael Parks. Of course, "From Dusk Till Dawn" is also the only serious horror film of the 90s, which gave this sickening genre some new impulses. While all those teenager flicks like "The Faculty" (also directed by Robert Rodriguez) were only rip-offs from their elder examples, FDTD has enough originality to be a real classic! This movie is full of slime and gore, absurd ideas (holy water filled in condoms), although the showdown reminded me a little bit on Peter Jackson´s "Braindead". Instead you get a great performance from Salma Hayek, who is one of the most erotic women alive! Her dance is one of the most unforgettable moments ever featured in a horror film! Many people also find it idiotic to combine a gangster story with a splatter flick: well, you shouldn´t take this movie too serious, because "From Dusk Till Dawn" is nothing else but a B-movie with A-list actors. It exists from his crazy ideas and the pure fun entertainment! (9/10)</fullReview>

Then everyone turned into vampires and it became an entirely different movie. It was like they took a really good drama/action movie, and combined it with a horrible B horror movie. It literally was like watching two different movies, one that was great, and one that was just plain awful, and they just happened to have the same characters, and both be about an hour long. I wish they had just stuck with the first movie, instead of seeming to say ,after writing about half, you know what would be cool, a movie about vampires that live in a Mayan temple, hey I know let's just turn this movie into that one, yeah...

		<shortDescription>DON´T SHOOT ME, I´M ONLY THE Umm..VAMPIRE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING** POSSIBLE SPOILERS** I had never read any reviews of this movie prior to watching it, which was today, and so I ended up watching a vampire movie when I thought I was enjoying a good old-fashioned chase/thriller movie - until we crossed the Mexican border of course. I had a feeling that something was going to change when one of the characters in the strip bar threatened another character with a knife, only to be confronted with a gun that swivelled into place from a device attached around this man´s groin area. It was an incongrous moment and just didn´t fit in with the previous tempo of the movie as a whole. And, of course, we then had an infamous vampire orgy of blood and violence that equated the bloodletting in Peckinpah´s THE WILD BUNCH. I say equated but not bettered, for Peckinpah´s epic was stylish and exhuberant. Here it was way over the top and virtually portrayed as fun. But then again, looking at the movie as a whole, perhaps being way over the top was the point, paying homage not only to Hollywood but world cinema in general along the way. The Tarantino script tips it´s hat to the spaghetti westerns of Sergio Leone, Akira Kurosawa´sSamurai flicks, Romero´s Evil Dead and countless excursions into the living dead genre produced by the house of Hammer. We have here what Francois Truffaut sought out to achieve when he made "TIREZ SUR LE PIANISTE" ("Shoot the piano player"), namely "..an explosion of genres...by mixing genres". That classic flick was a mixture of gangster movie/love story/thriller/chase/musical etc.., that took the traditionally accepted notions of different film genres and fused them together into a coherent whole. FROM DUSK TILL DAWN most immediately fuses the thriller genre with the horror genre but many other genres are also in evidence, provided you are looking for them. Comedy is very much to the fore and I contend that this movie was made very tongue-in-cheek, very influenced by the tradition from whence it sprung. "Kill me Kate" says the Harvey Keitel character after he has metamorphosised into a vampire. A million miles from "Kiss me Kate" but then again, FROM DUSK TILL DAWN is a million miles from the pages of Bram Stoker. An enjoyable film that seems to enjoy itself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like many have said, it is basically two movies. A half hour into it I was disappointed it had taken me so long to watch it. The opening 10 minutes are outstanding. It was like a time warp back to Dogs/Pulp, but with Clooney in the mix. Tarantino's acting was once again painful however - it's bearable in Dogs/Pulp because it's kept to a minimum. But I can't stand his voice, delivery and chin. Clooney was great, although after a while his "lines" became a bit much. It was starting to feel like a profane trailer instead of a movie. I don't know if the subtlety needed to come from Clooney toning it down a little, or Tarantino writing something less corny. This would have been a keeper for me if Tarantino replaced himself with someone from his regular group like Buscemi, then chose to direct, and sh#tcanned the whole vampire bit. I'm not into vampire movies so I had no use for the last 50 minutes. Vampire fans will like this more than Dogs/Pulp fans. Overall, a bummer. I should have known there was a reason I never saw this before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film of 2 halves - neither very good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clooney and Tarantino are brothers on the run from the law. When they spend the evening in a truckers strip club they find more thrills than they had expected. This film was trading on several things - the success of Tarantino, Clooney's star power and the hot property of Rodriguez after Desperado. Unfortunately these are the main things the film has going for it.The first half of the film is quite good and plays like a Tarantino-esque crime thriller, until they reach the club where it turns into a gory vampire b-movie. The special effects are good but messy but it replaces tension and thrills with gore and makes the second half of the film a messy fight rather than a tension standoff. The crime section is good because Keitel, Clooney and Lewis are good in their roles - Clooney deserves special mention as he plays a tough cruel killer, well against type and is the epitome of tattooed cool. Tarantino however can't act, he's a good director and should do more of that rather than turning in performances like this.The film is a messy action movie, it lacks structure, tension or any emotional core - whenever the actors get turned to vampires you don't really care. It replaces all these with gore and special effects. It's worth watching to see Clooney playing against type but outside of that there isn't much else here to justify watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ultimately just disappointing, in my honest opinion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING: I advise anyone who has not seen the film yet to not read this comment.When I first started to watch this movie, my expectations were that it was a vampire movie and that it was going to be awesome considering how Rodriguez and Tarantino both helped make the film. Those were my honest expectations and maybe it was just that I was expecting the wrong thing, or maybe it was that I had built up an anticipation too much and was thrown off by what this film actually ended up being that I didn't like it as much as I thought I would, at all.About fifteen or twenty minutes into it on my first viewing, my hopes for this movie already had went down the drain, which shocked me entirely. At first, the story it was going with was just not at all appealing in anyway possible, and just flat out boring and uncompelling to the point where I just wanted to turn it off. The characters; why should we care for them? Bland, insipid creatures who had no purpose except to fill in the time. I was getting more frustrated with the movie as it dragged on, but I guess since I had kept those hopes I believed that it would get better. Then, when it finally showed vampires, it blew my mind, in a very bad way.I thought, "Okay, this movie started with some backwash horrible story about these two criminals that they made us tolerate, then very slowly turned into some mediocre vampire movie, which I thought it was going to be from the beginning, in like, the last thirty minutes?" To add on to that, they try to make the main characters all cool, awesome and mean around the end when they are just not; a bunny would have been more intimidating than these characters. They also make the vampires seem like skin flick thrills or lame amusement park attractions of some sort to the point where none of them are as fun or likable as other creations by the cast and crew. I was so frustrated that I felt like puking, and when I decided to watch it again for a second viewing, I tried to find some more redeeming qualities about it, and even though, since I knew what to expect, I didn't hate it as much as I did the first time, it still is just plain disappointing. The worst project by anyone who partook in it to date, and I can't believe so many perceive it as highly as they do, even though I of course can understand that every film will have it's haters and fans.To me, this movie is really a horrible piece of junk. From Dusk Till Dawn disgraced me and left a terrible taste in my mouth, disheartening thoughts in my head, and left my body unable to move from the horrible shock that I just wasted 108 minutes of my life away on a horrendous film. I do not understand how George Clooney, Quentin Tarintino, Cheech Marin and Danny Trejo, all being the good and honorable actors that they are, could take part in this useless filth. The rendition of it all was just amazingly ridiculous and I was so yearning to enjoy something about it, but here I am, years after I saw it, still being put off every time someone mentions it. In my opinion, From Dusk Till Dawn is one of the worst movies I have ever suffered my eyes upon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... but on this occassion, I just couldn't resist.Within just a few minutes, I felt uncomfortable with this film. Like most films in which Tarantino is involved, everything was predictable. Some people have referred to this film as fun. Yawn. The gratuitous violence is just so dull and I often wonder if Tarantino and Rodriguez are actually pitching this trash at the sub 15 year old market, despite its inevitable censorship classification. If adults are truly enjoying this type of trash, then we are in big trouble.This movie came across as a poor short story that couldn't/wouldn't go anywhere and so a vampire thing was tacked on to make up time. But still no story.I suspect that Harvey Keitel may regret being involved in this film. As most know, he has proved his skill and talent as an actor on many occassion, but why did he get involved in this? I must confess that I would have been surprised if Juliette Lewis wasn't involved in this. This is just her thing. Maybe there is some talent there, but who would know? George Clooney may well be challenging Kevin Costner as the planet's most boring actor. He is as convincing as your average politician and I'm sure that I won't even notice that he has stopped working, or has he already? Some have also suggested that if one enjoyed this film, Natural Born Killers should be high on one's list. Sorry. Impossible. Natural Born Killers was warning us of our bad habits in allowing manipulative media into our homes. From Dusk Till Dawn offers, well, nothing but wooden actors (except for Mr Keitel) and rubbery parts splattered in Hollywood ketchup. Truly a stinker. 0.1 out of ten, and it was only Harvey who got it that high.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One wonders if Tarantino wrote this script when he was 14 and just dusted it off. Everything about this movie -which is actually two bad stories stuck together to make one turkey- has an adolescent feel to it with its stylised and sadistic violence, gratuitous nudity, cliché ridden vampires, f-laden dialogue, gunplay, biker bars, girls on the toilet etc.Clooney and Tarantino play a couple of murderous brothers. Clooney is apparently the 'good' brother. He merely burns an innocent man alive, puts a gun to the heads of helpless women and children and shoots some bikers in cold blood. In what moral universe can such a character be considered a hero? The film makers seem to think so, since he is allowed to drive off into the sunset at the end, not just scot free by with a sexy young preacher's daughter hanging on his every word.Tarantino is the 'bad' brother. He improves on Clooney by shooting a ranger in the head point blank and raping and murdering an innocent abducted woman.These two then abduct Harvey Keitel and his son and daughter. Keitel is a cliché pastor who has lost his faith. Since Tarantino's gifts as a dialogue writer do not extend much beyond foul mouthed tirades (admittedly he does excel at that), this man of god and his young daughter are given the same f-bomb speech patterns as the 'heroes'.The first half of the movie is a deeply unpleasant series of indiscriminate murders, rapes and abductions. There is a brief satirical news report which is strangely out of place here, since the general atmosphere is menacing and aggressive.When they arrive in Mexico the film suddenly morphs into a poor vampire film. Two more formulaic characters appear out of nowhere, a cigar-chomping black man and a Mexican with a cannon codpiece. Together they fight an assortment of vampires as the film becomes campy and incoherent. The dialogue here, usually Tarantino's forte, is embarrassing. One could expect and even enjoy this sort of thing from a low budget movie, but one with Clooney and Tarantino in it? For supposedly top Hollywood talent, it is extraordinarily bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From Dusk Till Dawn was a very entertaining film. It never once bored me, so props for that. I did like it, but did not love it.The film has moments of real brilliance in it's screenplay. I perhaps think that maybe Tarantino should have directed it. I am not saying Rodriguez did a bad job, just that maybe the film would have come together as something more with Tarantino behind the camera. Of course, the turn of events in the 2nd half would have been surprising had Dish Network not spoiled it in the summary info. But it didn't matter, I was hooked throughout. From the Tarantino scripts, this IS his weakest, but it doesn't matter. It's a blast to old gory cheesy horrors! In fact, the comedy really made me dig it even more! I would say that the other pairing between Tarantino and Rodriguez in Grindhouse (Planet Terror and Death Proof) is better but this is still a very entertaining and gory film!</fullReview>

The talentless Lewis reprises her role as a weak little girl surrounded by psychotic men. Hayek is allowed on screen long enough to dance and die, and that's a little too long for her talent. Keitel didn't have a clue about how to be a mild-mannered preacher.Still, there is a lot of blood and gore. Lots and lots of people die. So if it's a blood fest that you want, try this one.But watch out for that wooden post that keeps reappearing throughout the movie. That's Ms. Lewis acting her heart out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie left me completely baffled. As said by others, it starts out as a sort of road movie and then turns into a horror(well sort of). Each of these genre's have something typical, but in this movie there is only one guiding principle: violence. There are other movies which are violent, like Cross of Iron, the Wild Bunch, Saving Private Ryan, Psycho or Letters from Iwo Jima. I liked these movies because each of these movies have something else to offer besides violence. Sure there is a weak effort to make some fun like in the living dead series. Sure a tongue in cheek effort is made to hint at the vampire genre. Sure there is the sexy dancing. But it lacks the fun, it lacks the twist and about the sex:after Selma Hayek has done her stimulating dance she is gone in a minute because what is left is violence: pure, undiluted, utter, gory, bloody, sexy violence. Therefore if you want to see a movie that is based on violence and violence alone: pick this one!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since I am a gangster movie buff who can't get enough of the Tarantino classics Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, I was all set for some more of the great dialogue and keenly directed diction of these two films when I tuned in for FDTD. After the somewhat exaggerated burning scene at the start, one is inclined to think, 'well the Tarantino atmosphere is there, he just got carried away.' Indeed, Harvey Keitel, naturally, but also George Clooney, and Tarantino himself continue to pronounce their well-chosen lines with exactly the right emphasis and all seems set for more interesting plot turns. However, being completely unprepared for Mexicans rising from the dead and turning into monsters, I found myself gazing stupefied at what followed.(The presence of Juliette Lewis might have warned me that something weird was coming, but since the Tarantino character seemed the central psycho of the story, I didn't expect inhumans in any literal way). How could he and Rodriguez have thrown their fine ingredients into this maladorous boiling pot of illogical nonsense? Now that I learn that this was his first script, I hope for a return to the older, or rather later developed style. All in all, as a horror comedy the movie has its moments and it is worth seeing, but I think it could have been so much better if the story line of the first part would have been followed to the end.</fullReview>

It merely employs poor costumes and CGI to make disfigured vampires whom are a bigger nuisance than threat to kill. The acting was also some of the worst I had seen. This film felt endless (in terms of duration). I was completely disappointed. Aside from the good introduction that is Pulp Fiction-esque, the entire movie is monotonous. From the lacklustre plot to the boredom of terrible comedy (not even laughable as anti-jokes), this movie lacks in nearly every department. As a cult film, I hope some out there enjoy it, since it managed to bore me for nearly two hours (in real time) and I was excited to watch it. I would highly advise against watching this movie.

		<fullReview>It was probably the most fun I had at the cinema back in 1996. I absolutely love From Dusk Till Dawn, very much one of those films that you either buy into or you don't. There's no surprise element with the film, you get everything that director Robert Rodriguez and writer Quentin Tarantino said you would get; a hard buttocked road movie that turns into a raging B horror movie gore fest.The plot, for what's it's worth, sees two criminal brothers, Seth {George Clooney} &amp; Richie Gecko {Tarantino} on the lam after Richie breaks Seth out of prison. They are heading for the haven of Mexico with wads of cash garnered from a robbery. After overcoming a couple of fatal {for others} hiccups, the brothers, in need of a vehicle, kidnap faithless minister Jacob (Harvey Keitel), his daughter Kate (Juliette Lewis) and adopted son Scott {Ernest Liu }. From here they must make it to a rendezvous point in Mexico; a bar called the Titty Twister, where they will exchange cash with a friend of Seth's and start their new lives as Mexican civilians. Trouble is is that the Titty Twister isn't no ordinary bar, it's a vampire stronghold and the Geko's-and there newly acquired captives, are on the menu. Can they make it till dawn and let the daylight be their saviour? Swearing, blood, limbs severed, nudity, violence, sexual references, guns, more violence, more blood, other weapons, lots of teeth, bats, a snake, more violence. On it goes really, yet as Rodriguez and Tarantino start thrusting a blunt blade into your stomach, you really should be feeling them also caressing the funny bones in both your arms. For it's a key point that From Dusk Till Dawn is a dam funny film as well, something that bizarrely many critics have failed to understand. Honestly you can go to various sites and read people saying the characters are shallow, or the plot is preposterous!! Dear me, it staggers the mind. Hey don't like the film by all means, but failure to understand is genre leanings and homage persuasion is as funny as Cheech Marin is in the movie. Thrice. It's bonkers and silly as hell, but once a fan of From Dusk Till Dawn, you are a fan for life.

		<fullReview>There is no reason not to make a film which leaps abruptly from one genre to another. From Dusk Till Dawn leaps from the hard-boiled crime thriller to the gory vampire monster movie at the halfway mark, and does it so blatantly (seamlessly? I think not!!) that you can see the stitch marks.The reason why this genre-switching manoeuvre is not done more often is because, to anybody with any sense, it would appear that the result is not going to satisfy the enthusiasts of either genre and, given that the object of the exercise is bums on seats, maybe this is not the way to maximise the box office take.Of course, closer examination of those cases where genre-jumping has taken place - Moulin Rouge, Back to the Future 3 come to mind - the results have often been critically and commercially pleasing.In this case, I love the outrageous abandon with which the new genre is embraced. I don't care for the Tarantino character, and I don't care for the way the slightly less odious Clooney character shapes up as a kind of hero only by virtue of not being a vampire.But the ride is fun.And, even if it wasn't, the whole thing would be worth sitting through solely for the Santanico Pandemonium sequence - I would sell my children into slavery for the pleasure of sipping a good brandy from her navel (don't condemn me too readily: you haven't met my children!)</fullReview>

Keitel's character and his loss of faith, his love for his kids, etc. could've played against Clooney and Tarantino's bond and it would've been compelling despite Tarantino's inability to act.Unless it's entertaining for you to watch a movie get sabotaged half-way through you should avoid this one. If only the first half had been so terrible--there was actually a touch of substance for once in one of Quentin's movies, I should've known it wouldn't last--I would've turned it off then and not wasted my time.The "4" rating is mostly due to Cheech Marin's 30 second onslaught of hilarity and the acting chops of all but Quentin in the beginning. They're so good at their craft that I actually thought for a minute it was an attempt to really say something.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Quite the Film to get worked up about</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film that is talked about...especially by Robert Rodriguez fans. Unfortunately they would be the only ones who I think would love this film.The biggest problem I had with this film is the fact that it was poorly distributed and spanned out. The film's runtime is 1:43mins and the main plot concerning the vampires does not come in until and hour into it. I would suggest a longer time with the vampires and a little less with the two brothers (Clooney and Tarantino). The vampire 'segment' of the film went by way too quick. One minute they walk into the vampire-infested strip bar and the next they are fleeing from the bar with blood-stained, ripped clothes.But, the gore was necessary and somewhat...entertaining. I thoroughly enjoyed the action sequences, and also Clooney's performance was surprisingly exceptional.This is not the kind of film to see if you are not into the cliché of supernatural villains, but nonetheless, enjoyable.......2.5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tarintino Bomb</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems almost unfathomable to think that a movie of this genre could actually go 'over the top' in terms of violence; than again, one can never disregard the mind of Quentin Tarintino. Although he did not direct the film, he wrote the script for it, and there are splashes of his style all over the place. It really seems uncertain if this movie can really fit in the horror genre, despite the presence of vampires; a decent story just wasn't there. Tarintino's performance as Richard Gecko was also sub-par.The movies saving grace was surprisingly the acting of George Clooney; he played the part of the criminal with somewhat of a good heart to a tee, and seemed full of witty lines. Harvey Keitel also turned out a good performance as the faithless preacher.All in all the movie was a disappointment; I was expecting something golden and walked away with wasted time. The movie seems to try to compensate for its lack of a plot through extreme gore, which gets to be so redundant that it loses the desired effect.The acting was good enough, and some of the fight sequences were decent, but the movie fell short of being a horror, and nothing could save the story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie shows a tough, edgy side of George Clooney that I had not seen before. I had usually found him boring. Oh, and to digress briefly: Is anyone else bothered by the hypocrisy of women (I guess it is women) voting guys like George Clooney or Richard Gere or Sean Connery the Sexiest Man Alive, when, in real life, these women would sooner drop dead than date a man with gray hair? I bet most of the ones who call these guys the Sexiest Men Alive wouldn't even date these very guys. Oh, yes, we are a land of substance and honesty and character. Anyway, Clooney seemed boring and a push-over to me before, but in this movie, he kicks butt. The whole movie kicks butt. It is alot of fun, and one of the good efforts by Tarantino (there have been too many bad ones since Reservoir Dogs, True Romance, Pulp Fiction, etc.)</fullReview>

It has been made 3 movies in this series and this is the best one,with the third one on a close second.Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino is really two masterminds who have made some of the coolest movies in a long time.And they do not disapoint with this ground breaking movie.If you like this one then be sure to check out the third one,which is very similar.And maybe the second one although it is not that great.8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From Dusk Til Dawn is definitely a movie of two halfsIt starts off well enough, with the hellish Gecko brothers (Cooney and Tarantino) shooting and hijacking their way across Texas, picking up the hapless Harvey Keitel and family en route. The dialogue is sharp and the Geckos are a humourous, if unsympathetic, pair. Tarantino, as a rapist and psychotic given to hearing voices which tell him, basically, whatever he wants to hear, is both scary and funny.So far so good. Until the mobile home carrying the desperados and their hostages goes over into Mexico and stops at a garish biker/trucker bar which must be one of the sleaziest joints ever portrayed in the history of Hollywood. Unfortunately, for the viewer as well as the characters, it proves to be a lair of vampires!Selma Hayek performs one of the most sexily outrageous dance routines of all time but proves to be a vampire rather than a vamp. (Too bad - Juliette Lewis is one of the films liabilities, seeming to have a movie career based on being a piece of baggage for psychotic and violent men to tote around, without any deeper discernable skills on offer than the ability to pout when the bullets are flying)Once Tarantino is dead (or undead, however you care to look at it) the movie is committed to being an out and out actioner with bursts of spoof putdowns of vampire movie cliches. Cooney, Keitel (who gives a first rate, understated performance as the disillusioned preacher / hi jack victim) and the two junior vampire hunters backing them up don't look as if they could bruise a bag of apples, let alone hold out all night against the legions of the undead. Fortunately, more convincing help is on hand in the shape of grim faced veteran Fred Williamson and ace horror make up artist Tom Savini, who steals scene after scene as whip cracking biker, 'Sex Machine'Having said this, the movie rips along at a good pace whilst never quite being able to live up to the movies from which it borrows (Carpenter's 'Assault On Precinct 13' and G.A. Romero's 'Living Dead' films).I'm in two minds about whether to rate it higher or lower than average, but I'll ignore the worst parts and rate 'From Dusk Til Dawn' a blood sucking 7 out of 10 (The vampires might get me if I don't, though if one is Selma Hayek, this might not be as bad as bus ride with Juliette Lewis)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cool! Bad Ass! Awesome! I use these words to describe FROM DUSK TILL DAWN. This movie was cool, bad ass, and awesome. I thought it was a good change in pace for vampire movies, and action movies in general. I think only a few directors can make an action movie work while being confined in some what small surroundings, and they are Robert Rodriguiz, Quinten Tarantino, and John Carpenter.There were great actors in this, including George Clooney (he was a bad ass in this, and most of his movies in general), Harvey Keitel (who is also a bad ass, but in this he's more of the bad ass farther type), and the always bad ass Juilette Lewis (need I say more). I certainly cannot recommend this to every one. But for those who don't mind strippers dancing one minute and decimating a guy's face and throat the next, a lot of profanity, crude weapons (including a jack-hammer with a stake on the end), bikers, bat/vampires, and bad asses with guns, than this could be your cup of tea. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Average horror flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There may be some who liked the movie, but personally speaking, this film was a complete turnoff for me. I only watched it for George Clooney and wondered how he could sink so low as to want to use this as his big screen opportunity.It's a strange combination of slasher/vampire film that has no focus and splits up into too many directions to form a coherent story. The characters have as much depth as cartoon creations and all of them are as freakish and pathetic as anyone can get. George Clooney mumbles his way through his role in a way that suggests he'd rather be back in "ER" with its own kind of gore than splashing the blood of vampires. Frankly, he ought to be better at choosing material than this mess.The story starts out as a gutsy crime drama but soon veers into downright nightmarish activity at a Mexican border bar staffed by vampires. Nudity, foul language, vulgar expletives--everything is poured on thick to appeal to today's younger movie-goers who have an appetite for sex, sadism and buckets of blood. About as gross as any movie can get without leaving you with a queasy stomach.Of course, you'll get the opposite opinion from those who think Quentin Tarantino is the master of pulp horror. This graphic depiction of vampirism is sure to have them raving that this is a masterpiece only a genius like Tarantino could have invented.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Is One Crazy Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Extremely violent, very bloody, often crude and at times humorous. That about sums this movie up - except that you'd have to add to the list that it's really quite bizarre as well. The first half or so - while violent and bloody - comes across as pretty straight. George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino play bank robber brothers who are trying to escape from the United States into Mexico after pulling off a job. Much violence ensues, until the brothers finally take an entire family hostage (played by Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis and Ernest Liu) and manage to get across the border into Mexico in the family's RV and then proceed with their hostages to an out of the way bar to meet up with their Mexican contact. This, of course, is where things turn truly weird.It turns out the everyone who works at the bar (the bartenders, the band, the strippers, etc.) are actually vampires - and quite bloodthirsty ones at that. What started as just a place to hang out until they meet up with their contact Carlos becomes an all night bloodbath as they do battle against these creatures and struggle to stay alive. The first half was actually pretty good, but for me the second half ruined it. This might have worked well as just the story of a couple of violent and perhaps insane bank robbers who try to escape from the law. The vampire thing (even though that's how the movie is sold) was completely overdone and to me at least became very tiresome after a while. How many times do we have to watch a vampire getting a stake through the heart or burned with holy water? Well, according to this movie, we have to watch it a lot! Although I usually like vampire themed movies this one was just too weird to really be of much appeal to me, although it might appeal to action-oriented teens.I will add a word about George Clooney. I generally don't care much for his movies. It's seemed to me that the bigger he's become in Hollywood the less passion he's putting into his work, most of which I would say is characterized by a total lack of energy or enthusiasm. This was different. I liked him in this role - perhaps because this was still while he was a TV star trying to become a movie star, he put more into it. Whatever it was, this may have been the best performance I've seen him give in a movie. Unfortunately, it had to happen in a movie I didn't care much for. (3/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Clooney should have stuck will this kind of role. He did fine in Out of Sight and Ocean's Eleven, but he really dominated this movie with a fury that we may never see again. Almost every line he delivers is memorable and that is not all Tarantino's doing. The rest of the cast is dominated by cool cameos and veteran cult and mainstream names. The exception being Ernest Liu who does a good job of holding his own. No Tarantino film would be complete without a good soundtrack. This one, as with Desperado, features songs by Tito and Tarantula. Although I have only heard four songs by them, I consider them one of my favorites. I will never forget what my parents told me after they watched this without me. "You sure can pick 'em," my mother blurted with distain.

They are made up to be sort of anti-heroes but they're really just murderous thugs. I wanted to scrape them off my mind like dog poop from the bottom of my shoe. Halfway through the movie, the tone changes from a drama to a horror film, which reallllly strains credibility! But then I finally had someone to cheer for - the vampires...and of course, Harvey Keitel and his screen family. What a waste of time this movie is. It doesn't know where it wants to go, doesn't know who is the good/bad guy, and meanders on for about 90 minutes longer than it should.</fullReview>

Someone has abducted this script at the half way point and given it to group of 12 year olds in juvenile hall for the ending - that seems the only explanation.Because prior to this unexplainable event, this film was quite good. There was a credible cast, Harvey Keitel, Clooney, Tarantino, Juliette Lewis,Selma Hayek. A family is abducted by two criminal brothers and Tarantino's character was chilling, I was genuinely interested to see where this film would go. Then the unthinkable happened.

Only Juliette Lewis, who is the most talented of the bunch, disappeared into oblivion. For anyone who thinks this is anything more than a poor Sci-Fi channel after-school special, you seriously need to get more out of life than collecting your navel lint or trawling Facebook.

		<fullReview>From Dusk Till Dawn (1996)It's meant to be a B-movie, cheap, sleazy entertainment with virtually no storyline aimed to provide 'cheap thrills'. Well I don't care; I thought this was a waste of time and I was neither entertained nor excited. Although I do like Tarantino's style and sometimes Robert Rodriguez, I cannot credit From Dusk Till Dawn with anything. If I was entertained I would have awarded the film a higher rating, but since it was both flat and stupid it gets a very low score.The first act of the film until the characters enter the bar in Mexico is just watchable: How come I liked the first part better? I thought it might lead to something mildly interesting and the quick hitting humour from the Tarantino script was relatively enjoyable.On another note, I have to say that Quentin Tarantino's performance in this film is beyond awful (or is it because this is suppose to be a bad film, so the actors were advised to act badly?!!!) and he fully deserved his Razzie Nomination for 'Worst Supporting Actor'.Uninteresting, tedious cinema.2/10</fullReview>

That said, This is the single worst movie I have ever seen. That is not to say that this doesn't start out well. The first 1/3 of this movie is pure gold. Everything Tarintino is famous for! Witty dialog, multi layered Characters and twists galore. Tarintino and Cloney are a great combo and the family they abduct are likable (with the exception of that damn son). They get to Mexico, go to a strip club (with added nudity) and get in some good one-liners. Then the movie goes to hell. Vampires appear, crappy secondary bar goers appear, one from Nam, and promptly die. Good actors appear in a now horrible movie and I find it comical and hate Tarintino for writing this. In the movie's defense, This movie is a favor to a friend for Reservoir dogs so I guess the Ends justify the means, But for the love of god, DON'T WATCH THIS!Two thumbs down and then promptly stuck in whoever thought this up's eye</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From dusk till yawn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"From Dusk Till Dawn" works as a thrill ride; if it were a rollercoaster, it'd be named the "Vomit Comet." It also serves as a showcase for what was, at the time, the state of the art in makeup/splatter/morphing effects. It falls short in most other respects.For one thing, its structure makes it almost two separate movies: before the Gecko brothers arrive at the Mexican bar, it's another Tarantino crime-spree road picture a la "Natural Born Killers"; afterwards, it's "Vamp" meets "Dawn of the Dead." Quentin Tarantino, who stars, opposite George Clooney, as the more unstable of the two criminal brothers, also scripted; evidently, he knows how to write action movies, but less about how to write vampire movies. (Let alone horror movies, which are much more subtle than terror/action flicks.)As with all of Tarantino's works, this one is highly derivative. In addition to "Vamp" (vampire strippers) and "Dawn of the Dead" (bikers vs. the undead, even going so far as to cast Tom Savini as one of the bikers!), FDTD features squirt guns full of holy water a la "The Lost Boys"; has a character carve a cross into the tip of a bullet, which echoes both "Curse of the Undead" (a vampire Western of the late '50s!) and "Taxi Driver"; mentions Peter Cushing by name; and product-places a character wearing a "Precinct 13" T-shirt.At one point the question arises as to whether anyone has actually read anything about vampires, or whether they're relying solely on movie knowledge: a fair question, and one that could be asked of Tarantino himself. The refreshing possibility that maybe the story will adhere somewhat to actual folklore is sadly thrown away. While certain folkloric traditions have it that vampirism is contagious, it's never described as incubating within minutes, as happens here. And of course, the film's vampire peril ends when sunlight obliterates them--an enduringly popular movie device, although folkloric vampires aren't harmed by sunlight at all. (Neither are certain classic literary vampires, including both Carmilla and Count Dracula.)Then there's the cast. OH, dear. Much as I like Harvey Keitel, he's incredibly miscast as a Baptist preacher! True, the character's pastoral days are behind him, since he's embittered over the death of his wife; still, putting Mr. Keitel in a white shirt, a pair of horn-rimmed specs, and a dorky straw hat doesn't make a credible preacher out of him. Nor does it help that his character is so shallowly written: it's unconvincing that a man his age, who'd evidently been pastoring for some years, would completely blow off God on the basis of a garden-variety family tragedy. I would have accepted that he'd take a long sabbatical, a road trip with his kids, to clear his head and to come to terms with his loss--probably with a well-thumbed copy of C. S. Lewis' "A Grief Observed" close at hand. The character's sketchiness isn't surprising, though, given the evident lack of research on Tarantino's part: with millions of Baptists in the U.S., you'd think he could've easily found out that Baptists don't make the sign of the cross OR use holy water! This is just another example of how out of touch Hollywood is with ordinary American life.As Harvey's daughter, Juliette Lewis plays EXACTLY the same character she played in "Cape Fear" and "Kalifornia": the teenager of budding sexuality. I'm not a big fan of hers to begin with, but I REALLY don't get how she landed all these "sexy" roles. She's an OK actress, but if I had a dog that looked like that, I'd shave his butt and make him walk backwards. I'd have loved to see Natalie Portman in this role instead.Didn't catch the name of the black actor who plays the Nam vet; he's good, but again, his material is cheesy. When, during a lull in the action, he lights a cigar and begins a tale with the words, "I was in Nam," the audience I saw the movie with LAUGHED! As Harvey's adopted son, Ernest Liu looks appropriately bewildered--almost as overwhelmed as he must have been in real life, making his film debut in the company of Tarantino, Keitel, and Lewis. Salma Hayek plays Satanica Pandemonia--white snake and all!--the sort of role that might once have been played by Caroline Munro. And Cheech Marin plays three roles--adequately, but Peter Sellers he ain't.All told, FDTD is a flashy but foul bit of fun, a trove of cliches culled from other (and better) vampire and action flicks. Regrettably, it contributes--along with stuff like "Bordello of Blood," "John Carpenter's Vampires," etc.--to the the ongoing trivialization of vampire films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*some spoilers follow*Looking back over my reviews, I see that I have a somewhat inconsistent reaction to violence. Maybe not inconsistent, but complicated. In general, I'm bothered by "funny" or glorified violence, and "From Dusk 'Till Dawn" wallows in both. From the moment that the "heroes" set fire to a convenience store clerk, they lose all of my sympathy. They're every bit as repulsive as the vampires - so who cares if they win or lose? An essential element of horror is that the victims should be likable, so we can be alarmed at the prospect of their deaths; here, they're a bunch of jerks.The film could still be good, if viewed on an entirely superficial level, but it's not. Rodriguez's over-the-top action just looks tacky. The CGI effects are already ludicrous, the vampire makeups are silly (rubberized demons - what is this, a BBC production?), and the violence is neither exciting nor scary - it's merely gross.Check the trivia section and note that Quentin Tarantino - that fiercely original screenwriter and director - ripped off all of the film's best lines from older movies. I guess it was too much effort to come up with an original script, right? Of course, the siege aspect of the story comes right out of "Night of the Living Dead" and about 10,000 other horror films. At least Sex Machine acknowledges one debt - the improvised cross is lifted from Peter Cushing's "Horror of Dracula," a film that's superior to this pile of crap in virtually every respect.This is horror for the stupid set, a movie where the coolest thing in evidence is a "crotch cannon." It's SO mindless that I can't even appreciate it on the same level as bad Godzilla; it's TRYING to be campy and stupid, but at the same time masquerading as a piece of decent film art created by famous people, and it's that clash of styles that bothers me so. This film is dishonest. It's a turd wrapped in silk. It thumbs its nose at horror while trying to horrify. In short, it's maybe the worst film I've ever seen...and I've had to sit through it twice! Do I get some kind of endurance award for that?</fullReview>

Hybrid talents of crime thriller Tarantino and kitchen sink violence of Rodriguez combine in this high octane cocktail about crime spree siblings Clooney and Tarantino (who also did the screenplay) high-tailing it to Mexico with an unwitting family (Keitel, Lewis and Liu) as their hostages/getaway for a rendezvous in hell: a truck-stop strip joint full of vampires! Blood drenched gore and non-stop action galore with a high body count and low i.q. approach but nonetheless campy good fun with a nice strong lead by Clooney.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a truly repugnant film on many levels, but perhaps mostly in the character played by Tarantino. A brain-dead thug, he has *no* redeeming qualities, but presumably the movie wants us to root for him and the Clooney character. Forget about it.If you must see this, make sure you VCR's fast-forward function is working well. You'll need it during the bloody and boring final act.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...to be associated with this deplorable mess. Halfway through, just when I thought it couldn't become any more boring and pointlessly violent, this bank robbery/hostage caper of a movie abruptly decides to become a vampire movie--and a gory, lumbering one at that. You can almost hear Tarantino musing, 'Hmm, what would it look like if they cut someone's hand off? Ooh! What about if a flying ax splits open someone's skull?' Etc., etc.If you read through the reviews here, you may come to the conclusion that I simply didn't understand Tarantino's point or his artistic vision. Please. He HAD no point or vision. He had some money to make a movie and apparently felt smug enough about his own reputation that he could simply throw in whatever scenes interested him. If this had been made by a no-name director and been populated with no-name actors, no distribution company would have sat through the entire movie, much less backing it.An absolute train wreck, spilling over with stinking piles of manure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually ugly, sadism-is-cooler-than-thou trash with dialogue to match - hey, it's Tarantino's fantasies again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie what Christians mean when they complain about depravity in modern Hollywood: Tarantino oozes sleazy sadism and there is not any entertainment value whatsoever. Now, I love vampire movies. Hammer films or Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992) are classy Gothic fantasias where everything - colour photography, plot, dialogue, sets, costumes - are enchantingly beautiful and atmospheric. Then there are more trashier but still fun movies like Fright night flicks or even Lifeforce, made watchable by fascinating succubus Mathilda May (and I'm a woman!). Everything here is just sleazy, trashy, ugly and nasty. I don't say anything about acting: this is hee-haw garbage, Ophelias are not needed. Yes, there is Salma Hayek in pretty red velvet bikinis but movie around her STINKS!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Calling this film awful would offend the producers and directors of movies that were merely awful. This was one of four movies I was forced to turn off before finishing. A note to the director: Trash is something you throw away. You don't MAKE it on purpose.There was no premise, no justification, no plot and little of anything resembling acting. If you enjoy watching a great deal of blood spurting, listening to screaming and watching mahem, this is the show for you. As for me, I feel like I was raped by my video store. It's a crying shame that QT had to shove this film our way after the successes of Pulp Fiction. I will have to lick this wound for a while before I take another chance on one of his films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After a bank heist in Abilene with several casualties, the bank robber Seth Gecko (George Clooney) and his psychopath and rapist brother Richard Gecko (Quentin Tarantino) continue their crime spree in a convenience store in the middle of the desert while heading to Mexico with a hostage. They decide to stop for a while in a low-budget motel.Meanwhile the former minister Jacob Fuller (Harvey Keitel) is traveling on vacation with his son Scott (Ernest Liu) and his daughter Kate (Juliette Lewis) in a RV. Jacob lost his faith after the death of his beloved wife in a car accident and quit his position of pastor of his community and stops for the night in the same motel Seth and Richard are lodged.When Seth sees the recreational vehicle, he abducts Jacob and his family to help his brother and him to cross the Mexico border, promising to release them on the next morning. They head to the truck drivers and bikers bar Titty Twister where Seth will meet with his partner Carlos in the dawn. When they are watching the dancer Santanico Pandemonium (Salma Hayek), Seth and Richard fight with three bodyguards. But soon they discover that the bar is a coven of vampires and they need to fight until dawn to leave the place alive. "From Dusk Till Dawn" is definitely one of my favorite cult movies. I have just seen it again, now on Blu-ray, and the film is still entertaining. The plot is divided in two parts, the first one (and the better) with the violence of "Reservoir Dogs" and the second part is funny, entwining horror with comedy. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): "Um Drink no Inferno" ("One Drink in Hell")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a long time ago I saw this movie and still it's one of the worst I've ever seen. I like lots of kind of movies; sci-fi, action, drama, thrillers and sometimes even horror. Not a combination of two. This could have been a wonderful movie, but they all blew it up. I didn't want to see this movie, but friends of mine insisted to watch it. I didn't know it was such a crap. I loved the first part, in which Clooney and Tarantino drove through Texas, killing everybody on their way (especially the scene with the liquor shooting was excellent), but at its turning point, in the titty twister bar everything changed. Stupid Vampires took over the place and what could have been a perfect gangster movie became a stupid horror movie like 'Nightmare on Elmsteet'. If you like horror, watch a real horror movie. And when you love bloodstolling thrillers don't watch it at all, you will be very disappointed at the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow for a while, but then it's non-stop action and thrills to the end.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>** 1/2 out of ****Robert Rodriguez's From Dusk Till Dawn might surprise those who are watching it without any prior knowledge to the plot. It begins much like a crime/road drama, with two criminal brothers, Seth and Richard Gecko (George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino), getting into a shootout in a convenience store. They end up losing a few hostages. Their plan is to get to Mexico and meet with an associate. Thus, they are forced to take a former preacher, Jacob (Harvey Keitel), and his two kids (Juliette Lewis and Ernest Liu) by gunpoint. Using their RV with Jacob at the wheel, they get past the border, stop at a seedy strip bar out in the middle of nowhere, and are in for a big and unpleasant surprise.After a hectic shootout and some funny, quirky dialogue in the opening, the movie does develop quite slowly and is buoyed only by the occasional interesting bit of dialogue (which is trademark Tarantino). A few of the characters we've been introducted to do up to this point are fairly interesting, but are a little underused or are simply excessive in whatever they do. I was finding myself rather bored by the proceedings. But once they reach the bar, all hell breaks loose, as our "heroes" unpleasantly discover that the bar is owned by vampires, and for the last 45 minutes From Dusk Till Dawn is a non-stop ride of action, thrills, and campy dark humor.The action is the film's main showcase and it's fast-paced, violent, and exciting. It makes John Carpenter's attempt at high-energy in Vampires look lethargic in comparison. The film offers some creative ways to kill vampires, and it's all so hectic there's not a chance you'll be bored. I haven't seen Robert Rodriguez's El Mariachi, but if he shows the same kinetic style here it'll be another wild ride. All the action here is set in the bar (it's a rather large one, too), making it an obvious poke at Night of the Living Dead because of that film's own confined setting. Of course, instead of zombies we've got the undead of the blooksucking variety.There's gore all over the place here, which must have made the R-rating a close call. There are decaptitations, throat-rippings, stakes through the heart, limbs ripped off, and exploding bodies. The make-up effects are good (and sometimes noticable campy) but the CGI-rendered effects are weak, even for a movie that isn't meant to be taken very seriously. Thankfully, there aren't as many of those here as the traditional make-up effects (vice-versa was the case for Blade, which was terrible).To satisfy the male crowd, a fair share of nudity is inserted, though none of it is particularly titillating. Most people I know, though, have found Salma Hayek's dance sequence to be a highlight. I'll admit, it's a little sexy in a seedy manner, and she plays the scene perfectly. Hayek isn't in the film all that much, but her attractive presence is a plus, it certainly adds to the experience. When it comes to vampire seductresses, she's not as memorable as Mathilda May was in Lifeforce, but she's still eerie and sexy here.As much as it is an action/horror film, From Dusk Till Dawn is also a comedy, and a very dark one at that. For the first hour, it's mostly the same style of humor seen in Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. Once the vampires appear, the laughs come from some sharp jabs at horror cliches (the sharp dialogue is till there). Despite the humor, there's still some genuine tension, particularly a scene where one of the massacre's survivors turns into a vampire and attacks the others, as well as Keitel's slow walk to the back room as he tries to hold off dozens of vampires with a shotgun.The film is also boosted from some fun performances. Nobody's aiming for an Oscar here, but George Clooney is quite effective as the anti-hero who wields his guns in near desperado-style, and Quentin Tarantino is a riot as his insane brother. Harvey Keitel is his typically solid self, and plays the part of a preacher who has lost his faith well, bringing some dignity into the movie. Juliette Lewis and Ernest Liu are adequate for a movie like this. Cheech Marin's got three roles and chews the scenery big time.The film's most interesting character belongs to make-up man Tom Savini. Fred Williamson tries to be as odd and quirky, but Savini's biker character Sex Machine is hilarious and memorable. Horror fans may know him mostly for his great make-up effects, but this performance is a scene-stealer. This isn't exactly a great performance (nor is he aiming for that), but it's a remarkably enthusiastic one.By the end, you'll realize that From Dusk Till Dawn is hardly a great film. But it accomplishes its intent, delivering thrills and action in spades, as well as some good laughs. Two sequels have been made, and I keep hearing the second one is terrible while the third is pretty good. Vampire films have never been my cup of tea, but damned if this one didn't have me entertained.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meatloaf</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie... I have very complicated feelings on this movie. It's like eating a piece of a delicious cake with all your favorite ingredients in it, but half way in you suddenly taste something odd and realise you've got a bite of meatloaf in your mouth. The rest of the cake is meatloaf. It takes some getting used to, but you finish the cake anyway, because meatloaf is also delicious. Your impression of it as a whole, however, is obviously conflicted since those two things usually aren't combined in that manner which leaves you conflicted. You can't help to think that the person behind this creation meant for it to be this way, so you respect it's existence, even though you might not want to eat the cake ever again. There's a sting of regret, though. The first half was truly something which had so much potential, so it's shame the creator spoiled it all with meatloaf. Not a controversial opinion, but I felt like the first half could have led up to something truly great. Shame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film of two halves</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the film opens a Texas Ranger pops into a liquor store and starts talking about a bank robbery in Abilene. The robbers, Seth and Richard Gecko, are believed to be heading through Texas to the Mexican border? he has no idea that they are hiding in the store and he doesn't live to find out. The brother's continue south to a motel near the border. Here they meet the Fuller family; Jacob and his children Kate and Scott, for are taking a holiday in their recreational vehicle. Jacob is a preacher suffering a crisis of faith after the loss of his wife. The Geckos take them hostage and force Jacob to take them to a sleazy bar in northern Mexico.Here they settle down and have a few drinks while waiting for Seth's contact to arrive. While waiting they learn the terrible truth about the bar? it is a nest of vampires who prey on their unfortunate clientele! If they are to survive until dawn they will have to recall everything they've heard about vampires and Jacob will have to find his faith again.This is very much a film of two halves; the first a tense hostage situation and the second a full on vampire movie? there is nothing in the first half to suggest what is to come. George Clooney does a fine job playing against type as Seth and is ably supported by Quentin Tarantino who plays is disturbingly creepy brother. Harvey Keitel is more understated as Jacob Fuller, Juliette Lewis impresses as his daughter and Ernest Liu is pretty good as his son. Selma Hayek may not be on screen for long but she oozes sexiness in the film's most memorable scene. The style of action changes too; in the first half it is grittily realistic in a fairly mean way then in the second half it is more full on? blood and gore done in a more tongue in cheek way; an example being the four stripper-vampires who end up staked on the legs of an upturned table. Overall I'd say that this is very much a cult movie that people will either really enjoy or really dislike? thankfully I enjoyed it and would certainly recommend this to fans of the films of Robert Rodriguez or Tarantino.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rip-roaring blend of crime and horror worked for me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quentin Tarantino's films have always been controversial, something which has given them cult appeal. Tarantino ups the violence level and goes one step further to give us this odd film, which blends the crime and horror genres seamlessly, smoothly flowing from one scene to another. All of the Tarantino trademarks are there - hip dialogue, cool stars, brutal action - which makes it a Tarantino film, even though the director is Robert Rodriguez. Rodriguez brings his own unique style to this film, giving it a glossy, shiny sheen and adding in features which associate it with the classic western film - even the classic bar room brawl is in there.Opinion is mainly divided about this film, but I love it. The action is fast, the gore is plentiful, and there is plenty of non-stop violence for horror and action fans alike, which make this film feel like a cross between THE EVIL DEAD, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, and PULP FICTION. While the first half of the film is a typical crime story, focusing on the characters instead of the action, the second half is a surprise non-stop flow of action as the survivors take on the huge vampire hordes.The acting is all excellent in this film. Quentin Tarantino is well-cast as the creepy sex pervert who is mentally unhinged, his nervous stammering portrayal making him seem a harmless weed. George Clooney is the real star of the film, though, delivering smooth dialogue throughout while also being a commendably tough action guy in the second half, never breaking a sweat as he gets splattered with dust and slime. Harvey Keitel never fails to impress and he enjoys himself in an against-type role as a by-the-book preacher who has lost his faith, and his character acting is well suited to the film. Juliette Lewis plays her usual 'kooky' self, and she also acquits herself well in the action stakes, being the most believable character of the lot.The supporting cast is also impressive, thanks to the inclusion of two major cult stars. Firstly there's Tom Savini as Sex Machine, looking exactly like the guy he played in DAWN OF THE DEAD, a biker, who's smart and fast with his whip. It's great to see Savini back on screen, I can only lament about whatever happened to that VAMPIRATES film he was making. Another cult star is Fred Williamson as a typical tough no-nonsense wiseguy who just happened to be in 'Nam, and he has some of the best lines as he fights the vampires.Among the varied explosions and killings, bad language, and perversity, the special effects are also highly impressive, mixing together rubber and CGI in a pleasing, effective way. The vampires makeup may look more alien than bloodsucker, but it's strangely old-fashioned and scary looking. The many different vampire deaths are also brilliantly done with computers, from meltings to burnings to disintegrations and many more. There's even a magnificently animated giant rat creature in there among the blood and grue. Expect lots of extreme violence as people have their throats and arms ripped open and the vampires are brutally staked.FROM DUSK TILL DAWN has so much energy that it can't fail to entertain the viewer constantly, from beginning to end, and the influence on films like BLADE and VAMPIRES is clear. Obviously fans of subtler material may not find the excess to their liking, but there are many show-stopping moments (the sexy snake dance turned blood-fest is surely a moment of cinema history) and knowing references to other horror films (Peter Cushing is even mentioned) that fans will have a field day. Amazingly exciting!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Looking for something that doesn't abide by regular horror genera rules? "From Dusk Till Dawn" may be the one to choose. With a sizzling screenplay by Quentin Tarantino and perfectly directed by Robert Rodriguez, this is a horror/thriller to remember. The Gecko brothers are two extremely violent criminals who end up taking a family hostage. The family is forced to drive the notorious brothers to the end of the border. They end up making a pit stop at a Mexican bar, where the brothers are supposed to meet their contact. However, things get out of hand when it turns out that the place is contaminated with vampire strippers and truckers. You add all of those elements together and you get one hell of a ride that you'll never forget. I'm not the biggest fan of vampires, but I thought this was an excellent movie.Probably the best element in the film is George Clooney, as he not only has many of the best lines, but also delivers them in a convincing manner. Harvey Keitel is certain worth watching, yet he seemed to take his part just a bit too seriously at times, in my opinion, but this was offset by Clooney and his underlying jovialness. Lewis, whom I don't care for in general, did alright, and actually looked kinda cute, albeit a trifle skinny for my tastes. Tarantino was probably the weakest element in the film, but at least he and director Rodriguez had the good sense to populate the film with enough talent to offset this factor. If you're not a fan of the graphic violence, then you should avoid this one, as its loaded with visceral goriness.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It had been many years since I saw this and I had not remembered how much this is like a Tarantino film. It's not just that the script has his hallmarks, Rodriguez shoots many of the scenes exactly the way Tarantino would have (shot looking up from inside a trunk anyone?). It's really like a pretty mediocre Tarantino film. It's got all the elements of one of his films, but they never really gel. That's all about the first half. The second half of this film is a pretty generic action-horror-gorefest. It's not bad, but it's never anything more than okay. This does stand out as one of the less obnoxious Tarantino on screen appearances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thoroughly entertaining crime/horror mash-up from Rodriguez &amp; Tarantino</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"From Dusk Till Dawn" is one of the few Quentin Tarantino screenplays that he didn't direct himself. In a bit of a change, he took an acting role and handed the directorial reins to Robert Rodriguez. A modest success at the time of its release, the movie has since gone on to gain a cult following.The story revolves around a pair of criminals (George Clooney &amp; Quentin Tarantino) who seek refuge in Mexico following a big score. Taking a family hostage, they head to an isolated strip club in order to rendezvous with their contact. However, they get more than they bargained for when they realize that the club is a haven for blood-thirsty vampires.Although basically a B movie, the cast is well assembled. George Clooney, in one of his first starring roles, seems at home delivering Tarantino's snappy dialogue. Tarantino himself is pretty good, too, but easily overshadowed by the likes of Harvey Keitel &amp; Juliette Lewis. Of the supporting actors, Fred Williamson &amp; Tom Savini stand out in particular while Salma Hayek, Danny Trejo, Cheech Marin, Michael Parks &amp; John Hawkes all made the most of their limited screen time.Tarantino's script is rife with his trademark dialogue and Rodriguez directed the movie with panache. Unlike "True Romance" or "Natural Born Killers", I think that Rodriguez's take on the material is pretty close to what Tarantino's would have been. The special effects are handled pretty well also, though rudimentary effects don't necessarily detract from the appeal of a B movie.It seems that the main problem people have with this movie is how it starts out as a straight crime movie before morphing into a horror movie. Personally, I find both parts of the movie entertaining in their own way. With a lively script and a great cast, "From Dusk Till Dawn" makes for a top notch B movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has been more highly rated by others because it has big names and some novelties in it. If lesser known actors had played in it, it would be given the rating it deserves. It would only be fair to give credit where it is due, so I will agree that at times the movie employs some interesting dialogue. At times, the actors deliver that dialogue quite well.Ultimately, though, a movie is about story. Writing a great character or an interesting dialogue exchange and plopping them in the middle of a terrible story does not salvage the terrible story. Adding novelties (like Sex Machine's special wardrobe feature) doesn't either. This is a great example of how twists in a story can sometimes harm rather than enhance it. The twist in this movie is forced and silly. This pushes a mediocre story into the realm of awful. In this case, the whole of this movie is less than the sum of its parts. It is absolutely wretched.</fullReview>

They escape jail and go on a killing spree in Wichita and then flee to rob a liquor store in a small Texas border town. They have just robbed a bank and killed a number of cops, they have also taken a middle-aged bank teller as a hostage. In the liquor store they kill a Texas Ranger and the store clerk, and burn down the store. Stopping off in a flop-house motel, Richie rapes and slaughters the hostage. These scenes are all done with an eye for comedy and parody, if that's possible. The story really becomes bizarre when they get across the border and get ready to meet Carlos in a bar/whorehouse for truckers and bikers called the Titty Twister. The place is open from dawn to dusk, thus the film's title. Here's where Rodriguez has a chance to throw convention out the window and have some absurd fun, as the place turns out to be a vampire hangout. It sells sex to its patrons, and has exotic stripper Santanico Pandemonium (Hayek) do her alluring strip before turning into a vampire. The brothers and their hostages have to fight their way out of the place, as the vampires keep coming and the killings become the film's staple.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First thing you need to know before watching From Dusk Till Dawn is that it is a B movie. It is made that way. It's one of those movies that need to be crappy in a certain way. All the vampires look really shitty. It just makes them gross, which is all part of the fun.While the TV show tells the audience a lot more about the whole thing and several people stay alive, the film also shares some of the strengths of the show. One of them how thrilling few scenes are, and you are not sure who to root for. To be honest, in the TV show there were more parties to root for than in the film, but still, same feeling.The cast of this film is really weird in a way. Clooney and Tarantino playing brothers? How would that ever be believable? Well, it seems alright, because the two work really well together. From Dusk Till Dawn is really messed up, but it is also so much fun, as Rodriguez' movies usually are. Excellent film, definitely has earned its cult status.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Action-packed vampire flick...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember back in 1996 when this movie initially came out, I wasn't particularly thrilled. Why? Well, because of George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino on the cast list. But it is a vampire movie, so I still gave it a go.And now in 2015 I watched the movie for the fifth or sixth time since it was released. The movie was a slap in the face surprise first time around when I watched it, but it has gradually grown better and better.While the movie does start out slow, it quickly picks up pace as the story of the homicidal Gecko brothers unfold. On the run from the law, the outlaw brothers take a preacher and his family hostage as they make their way towards Mexico. At the Mexican rendezvous, a bar named The Titty Twister, things go from bad to worse as night falls, and blood-sucking vampires from Hell infest the seedy bar."From Dusk Till Dawn" is a wonderful mix of action, comedy and horror. A mix that director Robert Rodriguez managed to pull off quite nicely.The vampires in the movie were quite a treat. Why? Well, they were not the charming, romantic Gothic creatures as seen in many other vampire movies, nor were they sparkly teenage heartthrobs seen in later movies. No, they were bestial and animalistic savage creatures. And the special effects were good and right on the money.The cast in "From Dusk Till Dawn" was off the charts. While I didn't particularly Clooney and Tarantino in my younger years, I have learned to get past that. George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino are actually phenomenal in the movie. But the movie has a heap of other great talents on the cast list, including Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis, Salma Hayek, Danny Trejo, Tom Savini, Cheech Marin and Fred Williamson.This 1996 movie is a definite must watch movie, whether you like vampires or not, and it spawned two less impressive sequels and an awful TV series. But the 1996 movie that started it all is well-worth watching. And it can be watched over and over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino collaboration shows the vampire-horror genre at its best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Robert Rodriguez and producer Quentin Tarantino make their third collaboration after the action film 'Desperado' and the anthology comedy 'Four Rooms' with this exhilarating action-horror extravaganza complete with a brilliant Tarantino script. In this film, George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino play brothers Seth and Richie Gecko, two wanted felons by the FBI who have committed a string of bank robberies and homicide. In attempt to flee to Mexico, the brothers kidnap a family of three: Jacob Fuller (played by Harvey Keital), a devoted Catholic father who has recently lost his wife, and his two children Kate (played by Juliette Lewis) and Scott (played by Ernest Liu); who are traveling on vacation in an RV. The brothers order them to drive them to Mexico where they end up at an strip club known as "The Titty Twister" owned by Carlos (played by Cheech Marin), a Mexican border guard. Things quickly grow awry when the club is revealed to be inhabited by blood-thirsty vampires who ensue a vicious, gore-filled onslaught. The Gecko brothers and the Fuller family team up to defend themselves against the vampire mayhem until the crack of dawn.This action-horror flick present audience with both the amazing action-packed thrills of Robert Rodriguez's style of filmaking and the ingenious style of writing by Quentin Tarantino who also makes an appearance as a main character unlike the brief cameos he's notable for in his films, though his performance may not be on par with his directorial skills. This film basically brings just about everything fans could ask for in both a Rodriguez film and a Tarantino film: top-notch characters, darkly funny dialogue, and an exhilarating plot. Also featuring Salma Hayek who makes an appearance as a sexy bouncer, the film delivers some tense, over-the-top vampire action that while extremely heavy on blood and gore, is very exciting and fun to watch. The beautifully (and scarily) animated vampires will have audience gripping their seats and the intense atmosphere almost perfectly balances the heavy action and scares that will please both action and horror fans. The same can said about the visuals (though slightly cheesy) and production design of the strip club which serves as the main action set for the majority of the film. The performance by George Clooney who is a stranger to roles on the wrong side of the moral compass, sits well as does Harvey Keital who's been collaborator for works by Quentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs).From Dusk Til Dawn sets a textbook example of how an action-horror film should be, and is also one of the best (if not the best) collaborations of Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino who later go on to co-directer the B-movie double feature 'Grindhouse' ten years later. If you come across this movie, this would be a good choice for action and horror fans. Although the film isn't anything close to a masterpiece, what is important that is it is fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a Scary Vampire Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To steal from a well-known line: Dying is easy; vampires are hard.Most folks will be seeking out this movie in search of a good monster movie ? unfortunately, the scariest stuff happens before the vampires even enter the picture. There's a lot to like here: Harvey Keitel and, surprisingly, Quentin Tarantino put in good performances, and there are a lot of great scenes and good writing. But once the movie clicks into vampire mode ? which, let's face it, is why we're watching this in the first place ? Rodriguez seems to become a directorial zombie.It's as if he worked so hard on the first half that he was plum too tuckered out to maintain the film's edgy excellence. More than anything, it's a problem of quality control. Everything in the second half suffers due to a steady stream of irregularities and lazy execution. For example, everyone knows (and the movie acknowledges this) that vampire stories come with certain "rules" ? holy water, stakes in the heart, that sort of thing. But here, one person will almost instantly turn into a vampire after a bite in one scene, while another character will have "about an hour" before he changes in a later scene. The vampires even look different in terms of their makeup from one to another, both as "living" vampires and when they're killed.All of the inconsistencies pile up on one another until the action devolves into something bordering on camp. Whereas in a truly scary picture you'll be on the edge of your seat wondering when the next attack is coming, here there were scenes where you could literally see vampires in the background sort of dancing in place, waiting for the stars to say their lines before they finally attacked.Lazy, lazy, lazy.It's a shame: The goodwill earned by this movie's truly eerie and suspenseful first half is effectively frittered away by the inattention to detail that follows, and not even the clever ending can redeem it.Unlike some other viewers, I have no problem with the sort of portmanteau thriller/monster-movie construction the filmmakers attempted here. But vampires that aren't frightening? Oh, the horror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic horror shoot em up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Dusk Till Dawn is a gritty, bloody, psycho southern vampire western birthed of both the different artistic styles of Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino. It's a hybrid, charging out of the gate with the laconic dialogue and pulpy, cooked to perfection aura of Tarantino's crime outings, then plunges into the slimy, schlock bucket hell of a Rodriguez horror flick. It's that jarring upset in tone that makes it so memorable and hard to pin down in the genre books. George Clooney is an energetic viper as dangerous bandit Seth Gecko, and Quentin Tarantino, who can actually act when he puts his mind to it, is terrifying as his delusional, violent brother Richie, a monster prone to harsh acts of brutality. They are on the run from the Texas law after a violent bank robbery, and following a dusty prologue involving everyone's favourite Texas Ranger Earl McGraw (Michael Parks, his first trip out as the iconic lawman), they kidnap an ex preacher (Harvey Keitel) and his two kids (Juliette Lewis and Ernest Liu) and hightail it to a remote area for some waiting time as Seth plans to meet with a shady associate. It's their rotten luck that the place they pick to lie low, a rowdy hellhole of a roadhouse called the 'Titty Twister', is the last place they should have looked. No sooner have they settled into its chaotic interior, the staff bar the doors and all change into leering Mexican vampires, out to feast on the truckers, bikers and our unfortunate heroes until the sun comes up. From there the film ramps up for one of the biggest, baddest, bloodiest orgy of body parts, gooey effects, stakes through the heart, gunshot wounds galore, and fleshy, latex infested nastiness I've ever seen a horror movie keep up for an hour on end. I'd love to see the budget for practical effects on this one, and work put in. It's an endless parade of freak show proportions, and you'll feel the slime dripping off you when the closing credits come up. You haven't lived until you've seen the human spinal cord played as a saxophone with a screaming head on the end of it. The vamps come in all shapes and sizes too, from Cheech Marin's Chet Pussy (one of the three characters he plays), to Danny Trejo's tough guy bartender Razor Charlie, to sultry Salma Hayek's sexy Santanico Pandemonium. She has a dance sequence with a snake that will have anyone salivating, before she goes full beast mode and terrorizes everyone, that is. Tom Savini is great as Sex Machine, who has a gun for a willy, and Fred Williamson kills it as a nam vet who's seen some stuff, man. Juliette Lewis and Harvey Keitel provide the movie with what little heart that can be taken seriously among the silliness, and are both excellent. Rodriguez, Nicotero and team seriously outdo themselves in the effects department, turning the climax of their film into a claustrophobic, hairy shoot em up taking place in hell. Clooney has never been more of a bad boy, a tribal tattooed (lol), volatile prick with a good side only drawn forth by the baddest circumstances. Check out the sequels too, especially the third. They're toned down, but still a lot fun. Just avoid the new TV show like the plague, it's crap and doesn't deserve the title. Vampire westerns come in all forms, from poetic (Near Dark), to clunky (John Carpenter's Vampires) to slick (Priest). A few words that come to mind with this baby: Crazy, loud, insane, gross, bloody...fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ridiculous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are so many names that I like in this ridiculously awful movie. I'm just going to completely forgive Selma Hayek for making this movie and assume somehow in 1996 she thought it was a good idea to be acting next to Clooney and Tarantino. I'm going to forgive and never try to think of her and this movie together ever again. It fits the Tarantino cult genre and as Tarantino was one of the screen writers I just have a few question: Really Quentin, vampires? Did you completely run out of ideas or just need the money? And its like two different movies! It takes them forever to get to the bar; and then it takes them forever to get out! I guess there are some props to the special effects team but that's it. And why is George Clooney in this? Hey George! Did you lose a bet? Tax lien on your Italian villa? Pets were being held hostage? I liked exactly 10 seconds of that movie. I'm not a drinker but I would do a tequila body shot off Selma Hayek's foot any day of the week. Also happy for the many names in the cast that I didn't recognize, happy to see talent get a chance, just wish it had been a decent screenplay. Barf.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wouldn't call this a soft story because literally there is so many scenes where its bloody, scary,dark and rough. I didn't expect that the whole vampire scene was gonna happen at all and I mean I'm only figuring this out 17 years later like! George Clooney was absolutely outstanding and such a bad ass for playing a ruthless hero villain. He was bloody brilliant but honestly scary like I thought he was gonna kill the whole Fuller family. It was so sad that the father and the son died in the end but of course, they had to be shot because they were turning into bloodsucking and blood eating vampires.Quentin Tarantino was really good too, he played a clueless villain very well. He really should be in more films like this for a lead role because he can literally do anything even if he is a screenwriter! This movie was very disgusting but yet, the action was awesome and gripping!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No I haven't seen the TV series, I heard about it after I watched this movie. I just happened to stumble upon this and had no idea what would be in it so I watched it. And I gotta say, that escalated quickly. I honestly thought this was an action movie, and for a good half-hour to an hour it was. The action was good, the acting and suspense portrayed an action setting, until the last half of the movie. Which caught me completely by surprise. Rodriguez is famous for his artistic and crafty style of making movies and I gotta say, he did an outstanding job with this one. The hand-off from action thriller to a horror action film was so well-done I was impressed. I really enjoyed this movie, you can tell the director and cast members had fun making this film, and everything about this film is non-cliché and an insane thrill ride from start to finish. To those who have never seen the movie or the series I'm telling you to watch this first. If you are a fan of the series, go and rent this classic that started it all. You will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From Dusk till Dawn is like The Devil's Rejects meets The Lost Boys, with the harshness of one and the goofiness of the other. Its a fun ride throughout and generally seems to have the right idea about making a film like this, don't take it seriously! With Rodgriguez at the helm it would've been hard to achieve a serious film anyway. Tarantino gives a surprisingly decent performance and isn't doomed to give the kind of acting that directors, singers and models usually give. Clooney steals the show completely and is fantastic as a relentlessly professional criminal/thief. This one really is NSFW, with profanity in almost every single sentence and themes of sexual violence, murder and general demonic possession throughout. The ending is one of the most fascinating play ons for a sequel I've seen in a film and slightly alters the tone from fun to actually quite creepy. Have yet to see the sequels.

		<shortDescription>From Dusk Till Dawn (9/10)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Loaded with kick-ass actors and actress with the likes of George Clooney, Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis, Salma Hayek and Quentin Tarantino there is little doubt that this movie was going to be a bust. The film starts out as a gruesome dramatic action but tailspins into an all-out bloody vampire flick. Given the horror element of vampires, Robert Rodriquez casted a few well-known supporting actors (Danny Trejo, Tom Savini and John Saxon) to solidify his horror film and attract audiences. There are an abundance of quotable, laughable lines throughout that is only in Rodriquez and Tarantino type fashion. The film is a wild ride, with a load of bullets and exploding corpses. The one let down from this being perfect is the awful CGI but that can be looked past. From Dusk Till Dawn isn't the traditional vampire flick but it does offer a whole helluva a lot, a fantastic flick to put up your feet and kick back to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like most Tarantino-inspired films, From Dusk Till Dawn is exactly what it purports to be, which is good because there is nothing worse than a pretentious, enigmatic film that leaves you with more questions than answers. This comical, action-packed thriller satisfies not only with action, thrills and gore, but also satire, which is to be expected of both Tarantino and Rodriguez.The acting isn't phenomenal but it isn't suppose to be. The characters, especially Clooney's, are both likable, and detestable, and together, notwithstanding their differences, form a dysfunctional, yet effective whole that band together to combat a legion of ghastly ghouls yearning for human blood.If you're after a film that'll induce awe, or leave you feeling a better ? or worse ? person, then From Dusk Till Dawn isn't for you. However, if you desire something palatable, funny, and entertaining, then watch From Dusk Till Dawn right now.</fullReview>

The director doesn't have the skill of the screenwriter, and the screenwriter seemed more interested in getting his big face on film.Amusing gore, but the comedy beats are off and the pace drags.

		<fullReview>From Dusk Till Dawn is a bad-ass horror comedy. A blood drenched good time, with an amazing script written by, who else but Tarantino? It felt like two separate films, which is the coolest and strangest thing about it. It's a violent crime drama for the first hour, and then a wild horror comedy for the last half hour. Some call it indecisive, but when you tell Tarantino to make a horror film, this is the exact thing he'd come up with. The only thing is, if it were directed by him, it would've been such a masterpiece. Without him in control of every aspect of production, it just seems like something is missing. Robert Rodriguez isn't exactly a great director, and sometimes, you can see that here. Bad CGI anyone? Ah, who cares? I enjoyed the hell out to this thing.</fullReview>

Tarantino writes and stars, with Rodriguez directing. Their combined influence is noticeable -- the dialogue is very much Tarantino, whereas the more Texan / Mexican influence is certainly Rodriguez (not to mention the casting of Danny Trejo).Aside from some cheesy special effects with the transformations, this is a pretty good horror-crime-action flick, and has rightly become something of a modern classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hello my beloved children of the night, it is I, your beloved monstermaster and I have returned - it's time for me to take you back to a time where vampires were actually awesome. That time being 1996, and the movie in question...From Dusk Till Dawn.I know I already talked about this movie during Halloween last year, but....I thought it would be an awesome idea to talk about this movie in full, of course everybody I know has seen this movie so I am not going to go over the whole plot, but I am going to go over why I think this movie is awesome. For starters, this is how I think a vampire movie should be, it is scary and intense but also exotic and intriguing! It's become one of my personal favorites, so much so I am becoming obsessed with it - i'm even starting to dream about it, you could say that in my dreams I am a regular at the Titty Twister, no i'm not a vampire yet, but I feel I might become one very soon. I even have a fan-made Grimm Wesen based on the vampires in this movie! I love how this movie is different than your typical run-of-the-mill horror flick, it starts off as a typical Tarantino-esque crime caper only for it to become a kickass horror movie in the second half! It took me by surprise! Kudos to Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino for their teamwork here.This movie is one no horror fan should be without, as it is an absolute must for horror movie fans, vampire movies, and badass movies in general. It's movies like this and Bram Stoker's Dracula that make me wish i was a vampire myself, I just have a thing for bloodthirsty monster types and monster-girls. It's also movies like this and Sleepy Hollow that make me wish I was the one being bitten or kissed like that. The same goes for Bram Stoker's Dracula, and you can't fault me for the latter because the Hessian in Sleepy Hollow is Christopher Walken and when Walken is on screen you don't question anything and just let Walken do the rest! Also you cannot fault me for wanting to get bitten by Santanico Pandemonium because Salma Hayek is a goddess, and i'd gladly surrender to her and be her willing slave anytime. Hey! It was that sexy dance that did it for me.That sexy dance scene.... by the way is...still impressive even to this day, even more impressive considering Salma Hayek is afraid of snakes and had to be hypnotized in order to overcome her fear. I'd let her bite me anyday! I'd let her bite me anyday! And you can quote me on that! There's so many characters in this movie to love, including the Gecko brothers, the Fullers, Sheriff Earl, Frost, Razor Charlie but I think my personal favorite is this guy here. Sex Machine. This man is one badass mamajamma. Just look at him. How many people do you know that have a crotch-gun? No one.This guy is AWESOME! I wanna hang out with him! One of the best scenes and also one of the funniest moments comes in the scene where we see Sex Machine transforming bit by bit into a vampire, it just cracks me up - especially when he covers his mouth after his fangs start forming, and his right hand changes to become all monster-like with long claw-like fingernails and then his left hand changes and then he hides his hands behind his back. And he's completely unaware of it at first as is everyone else. It's got my two favorite kind of TFs (transformations) in them - the 'Bit By Bit' variety where a person changes one part at a time, and the 'Completely Unaware He/She is Transforming' kind where the transformee doesn't realize he/she is transforming. It's no wonder Aardman paid tribute to this scene in Curse Of The Wererabbit.What moment moved me to tears? I'll tell ya.It has to be when Richie dies, I know he's a psychopath - but that moment made me cry a little. *sobs* Richie's gone? NOOOOOOOOOOOO! Oh well, he'll come back.. but here's the slight hiccup, he won't be human anymore and he'll probably be after your blood, Seth - just a head's up.As for the funniest moment? Like I mentioned earlier, it was the scene with Sex Machine transforming into a vampire, oh and Frost's reaction to being bitten by him as well, funny as hell and one of my personal favorite scenes. (Frost: He f***in' bit me! F****' BIT ME) That scene cracked me up to no end! It is a pretty awesome movie and it is also incredibly badass, especially with the action and crime elements, the vamps are very intimidating and also intriguing. Not to mention the ever alluring Salma Hayek as the vampiress Santanico Pandemonium, who...is in fact quite hypnotic. I'll admit that the vampire with the snapping mouth on her stomach is a bit much, but why quibble? Fun fact: The color of the vampires blood is green because the MPAA has issues with it being red, they have absolutely no problem with blood - but they don't like it because it's red. It was indeed Tarantino's idea to give the vampires green blood to avoid the film from getting a rating higher than R and to get it past the censors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania.Imagine my surprise when nearly 20 years ago i was 11 years old and got a VHS copy (a highly good quality at the moment) of "From Dusk Till Dawn". George Clooney was just a new and nice screen presents at the time and the many horror action flick were in the future. At the time i didn't know what was the true genre of this movie, thought it was going to be a nice thriller.For the most 50 min. it was actually a very well made thriller, with some hostages and a very likable main hero (or antagonist) and very basic plot line. But then, suddenly everything changed. At running time i think 55 min (didn't saw this movie in many many years now so sorry for inaccuracy) suddenly this thriller changed his genre in a moment, like probably no other flick till this date (02/05/2015) has ever did. From a heist thriller this became a monster movie, with NO earlier hints on that. NO hints. This is a rare as it can be. Tarantino? No. Yes and no. Even he prepares audience for a ride in a first minutes whatever wild roads it might take them. "From Dusk Till Dawn" was a different kind of beast. Gory, bloody, over the top, and bloody entertaining.Overall, if you haven't saw this flick, you probably won't be surprised of suddenly change in it's narrative during the ride because it's surely was spoiled many time already. Nevertheless, you should DEFINITELY see this flick as it delivers goods. All in or nothing - this flick delivers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I was watching it I had no idea what to expect. The first half of the movie was OK, nothing fancy, but OK (had it stayed like that I might have given it 3-4 stars). Had some interesting scenes on how the characters where introduced. Not my cup of tea, but could be worse. Then about halfway through the movie (at the exact point when you saw the first vampire) the movie turned into something that should stay buried in the dessert for nobody to see. I'm no fan of vampire movies and I hate cliché movies. Adding extremely bad special effects to the mix just makes it worse. The action was bad, the actors were bad (With the exception of Cloony, who I'm not a fan of) and the story was extremely bad. The vampire part of the movie is SO BAD it killed the movie from getting anything from me. If I could give it 0 out of 10 I would have given it that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From Dusk Till Dawn (1996): Dir: Robert Rodriguez / Cast: George Clooney, Quentin Tarantino, Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis, Richard Cheech Marin: Horror film with ideas that lurks in the gutter of absolute disgust. That is to say that this film is not for the squeamish. It is clever and energetic with a third act that takes the film in an entirely new direction that plays like the lost reel of another film. Quentin Tarantino breaks George Clooney out of jail and they head for Mexico. Along the way they take a former minister and his two children hostage in their R.V. Once there they stop at a bar that is apparently crawling with vampires. This is where the tone changes and director Robert Rodriguez brings energy and depravity to something that starts out like his Desperado but concludes like Dracula's last rite. Clooney does well as a criminal bent on accomplishing the task with little casualty, but will have to survive an evening more frightening than any crime job. Tarantino overplays his psychotic brother who kills with little recollection until fatality kicks in at the bar. Harvey Keitel and Juliette Lewis succeed as hostages although only one is lucky enough to walk out alive. Cheech Marin makes an appearance as a nightclub owner giving a monologue on female private parts. It is a clever attempt to cross two sub genres into one storyline. Title suggests survival, which leads to a lot of blood shed. Score: 7 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An awesome movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my all-time favorite movies. It was my first R-Rated movie (Australian ratings) and I didn't even realize until it was over. That made me sad that I didn't really relish my first 18+ movie, but oh well. It wasn't my last. I watched this movie when I was about fourteen, and it is very rude. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone under the age of sixteen. My parents weren't bad for letting me watch it, I didn't really care. The main reason I say sixteen and over is because if you're younger than that, you're not going to understand the very unsubtle references to sex and violence. This is a great movie and I'm still waiting for it to come out on Bluray. Come on, they bring Gone With The Wind on Bluray before this? What a joke. This movie does feel like two completely different movies. The first half is just a normal action movie and then the second half is blood and guts and vampires. This movie is about two brothers, Richie and Seth. After they rob a bank in Texas they are on the run. They do lots of cool stuff, such as blowing up a liquor store. And then some not cool stuff, like killing their very nice hostage. A family shows up at the motel, the one where Richie killed the hostage and they decide to kidnap them. They force the family, inducing a Dad, a son and a daughter, to drive them across the boarder to Mexico. Once they get there, they make them go to a bar called The Titty Twister, lovely name by the way, where Seth is supposed to handle some business. But then the sun goes down and all the bartenders and strippers start eating everyone because they're freaking vampires! Who would see that coming? I didn't. Everyone has to work together so they don't become dinner. Overall, I give this movie a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unfortunately, I had very high expectations for the film from all the praise I had heard for it. The movie is in no way a bad movie. The second half though, is incredibly weaker than the first half. I don't typically like to write a review with spoilers in it, but for this film I have to talk about the vampires.The first half of the movie follows two felons (George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino) through various robberies and kidnappings. Tarantino plays a psychotic excellently. To me, his performance was the best part about this movie. SPOILER: When he died, I felt that the film got much weaker without his character.I'm not someone who is bothered by over-the-top action or even ridiculousness (Donnie Darko) when well executed. BUT when a man in the Titty Twister (The name of the vampire's bar. Trust me it gets worse) reveals a machine gun charity belt that he was wearing, I knew the movie was about go downhill fast. Several times during the film, Clooney and company will be standing in a circle and the vampires will just wait to be attacked several times so don't expect to ever feel worried about a character dying that you care about (mainly because you are not given much reason to care about them anyway). The band of vampires continues to play songs while everyone is brawling, and somehow a green blade made Tarantino turn into a vampire.The second half of this movie plays out like a sci-fi channel movie, and the first half plays out like a Tarantino film, with much thanks to Tarantino himself for that. The big picture is that the film is largely forgettable due to its change in tone for the second half. A big thanks to Quentin Tarantino for taking the great aspects of this movie, and making his movies continue that tone throughout the entire films instead of jump ship for gore and vampires.The verdict is, From Dusk till Dawn is still a film worth watching, but if you haven't seen Tarantino's film yet, I would suggest watching all of them before this one. Overall, the film is average. There are some really good aspects, but unfortunately some really bad aspects as well that even the good ones out. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a really "love it or hate it" kinda movie but in all honesty, I don't really get the hate. People who hate this movie tend to take it (and mostly: themselves) waaaaaaaaay too serious.Spoilers from here:So the main issue is of course the fact that this concerns two movies put together. A classic Tarantino-style crime drama/thriller (here people with self esteem issues tend to think "this is good enough for me the intellectual light of this world") and then it turns into one hour of old school 70'ies style zombie slashing (this is where those people think it has seized to be good enough for their highnesses). The second part is clear tribute to those old movies and it does the job.My disdain for haters of this movie could not be bigger cause they clearly don't understand this movie. It's not trying to be anything more than entertainment and if it is anything it's that. It's so incredibly funny, confusing, gory, crazy, etc. that I clung to the screen for two hours straight.Both parts of the movie are great in their genre and their combo is something you've never seen before. A true must-see.I was always kinda of a fan of Tarantino, I knew some of his work and liked it but now I know he's a genius the like we will never see again.The rating should be a hell of a lot higher but is being dragged down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A grisly classic - not to be missed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are few people nowadays who don't know From Dusk Till Dawn's 'twist.' Originally, it was two separate screenplays - one about bank robbers fleeing the authorities and the other about a standoff against vampires. Quentin Tarrantino decided to combine the two and package it as one film. The result: awesome.Although not directed by Tarrantino (instead, he casts himself in a leading role), it has a totally Tarrantino feel. Two bank robbers abduct a family in an attempt to escape the law and flee over the border into Mexico. Unfortunately, they run into a whole bar-load of vampires and are forced to team up in order to survive the night.Yes, it may sound like many similar films, but for a start it has an impressive cast, featuring a (young and unusually nasty) George Clooney, Tarrantino himself as Clooney's creepy, psychotic younger brother, Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis and plenty of cameos from other famous faces as either vampires of those destined to drive a stake through their hearts.Expect slow-building, rambling dialogue, not to mention the inevitable foul language and violence.If you like either Tarrantino's films or general action/horror, mixed with healthy doses of black comedy, then you really should watch this.And, guys, if you haven't seen Salma Hayek's 'snakedance,' you really haven't lived. Kristen Stewart's vampire isn't a patch on her!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Vampire movies are very hit or miss, as for every Nosferatu or Blade, there is a Twilight: Breaking Dawn or Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter rearing its ugly head around the corner. So, with a strong budget, cast and writing/directing team of Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez behind it, how does this one fare? To be honest, very averagly, as despite some great things, there isn't much that this movie had to offer that many others have done already.The story is that criminal brothers Seth and Richard Gecko have recently broken out of prison and are travelling to Mexico to give their fellow gangsters some money. However, they encounter some problems, including kidnapping some hostages, trying to get across the US-Mexico border and how their meeting point with the aforementioned gangsters turns out to be full of vampires. Can they survive until dawn? The plot is very simple, and works for a B-movie homage like this, despite occasional plot holes here and there (i.e. why the vampires kill lorry drivers specifically). The plot isn't the only thing that's very shallow. Most of the characters are two-dimensional at best, with the standouts being George Clooney's Seth Gecko, as the character and Clooney oozes cool, and Harvey Kietel's father character, a widow who is desperately trying to look after his kids and the criminals, to the point where he will sacrifice his life for them. This makes him the character with the most depth in the movie, and Kietel plays him very well with an equal amount of boldness and restraint. The rest of the characters are slightly dull, but the actors do their best with weak material. The only dud here is Juliette Lewis, acting so robotic and lifeless, bringing none of the talent and charisma she had in Cape Fear, What's Eating Gilbert Grape and even Natural Born Killers. But the film isn't really concerned with plot or characters, but rather the mindless vampire action. After a good half an hour of talking and build up, the film turns into a series of vampire fights, which to be fair are quite cool. Robert Rodriguez is a brilliant action director, and this movie shows that off in spades, as the action scenes have good choreography and a quick pace, which make them enjoyable and fun to watch. The effects are also quite good as well, as despite the fact that a lot of CGI is used, are very impressive. The vampires themselves are quite unique as well, combining influences from films like The Evil Dead and The Thing as well as original ideas to create a truly unique set of creatures. However, the despite what fun you have watching the film, there isn't enough substance to reward multiple viewings. It's essentially junk food: it's nice enough and satisfies you for what it is, but is isn't anything substantial. I understand that the movie has a strong cult following, but to be honest, this is just a forgettable vampire film that doesn't offer you much outside of fun action and some good acting. It may be very appealing to you if you were a teenage boy who didn't know any better, but to be honest, the film isn't very good, and while it's fine for one watch, it doesn't really warrant repeat viewings for those looking for more depth. So overall, this is just a mediocre vampire film with occasional moments of brilliant here and there. Nothing more, nothing less. Still, it's a better Tarantino/Rodriguez collaboration than Four Rooms, I guess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Greatest Vampire Films Ever Made. An Excellent,Thrilling,Over The Top Action-Horror-Thriller Cult Classic From Robert Rodriguez And Quentin Tarantino.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Dusk Till Dawn is one of the greatest vampire films ever made,an excellent and over the top Action-Horror-Thriller that combines terrific direction,a fantastic cast,a great script,a memorable score and soundtrack and outstanding special effects. All of those elements make From Dusk Till Dawn a Cult Classic that is Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino at their best.From Dusk Till Dawn tells the story of criminals and brothers Seth(George Clooney)and Richie Gecko(Quentin Tarantino)who are on the run from the cops and have to get across the border to Mexico with their hostages Jacob Fuller(Harvey Keitel)and his kids Kate(Juliette Lewis)and Scott(Ernest Liu). When the Geckos and the Fullers arrive in Mexico they go into a bar called the Titty Twister which is filled with bloodsucking Vampires. Now,The Geckos and Fullers have to fight the Vampires and stay alive.From Dusk Till Dawn is a brilliant and memorable Action-Horror-Thriller that was a collaboration between film directors and best friends Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino(who wrote the screenplay). Together Rodriguez and Tarantino combined their respective talents and crafted one of the best Vampire films of all-time and is a film that spawned a Television show and two Direct-to-DVD sequels and is a Cult Classic from the moment you watch it. From Dusk Till Dawn is a terrific and truly unforgettable genre film that is like a gigantic fireball that hits you in the face right from the start and has an intensity that never stops until the very end. From Dusk Till Dawn is a film that embraces it's B-movie roots giving the audience a bloody,gory and over the top Vampire movie that doesn't take itself too seriously and basically tells the viewers to have a good time giving viewers a Grindhouse movie that throws in everything but the kitchen sink giving us a Horror movie,Action film,Crime Drama and Western all in one with a dark Comedic style. One of the things that I have always enjoyed about FDTD and one of the reasons it stands out from other Vampire flicks is the way the movie is structured. The first half of the film is more like a Crime Drama focusing on the Geckos and the Fullers and the efforts to try to get to Mexico with mostly dialog getting viewers to know the main characters who are interesting and have depth. It's very much like a Quentin Tarantino film. The second half of the film is just pure Action-Horror and is very much like a Robert Rodriguez film because it is filled with Vampires,blood,guts and carnage all around with tons of excitement and chaos. The dialog and character driven style of Tarantino and the wild over the top Action of Rodriguez go together well with nothing feeling uneven or mismatched. And Speaking of dialog,the screenplay by Quentin Tarantino is wonderful with memorable dialog that is well-written and interesting. And while the dialog in FDTD isn't iconic or fresh like Tarantino's other efforts it's still a great screenplay with terrific lines. The Vampires in FDTD are ugly,vicious and brutal and are not the kind of Vampires you want to be friends with because when they attack a human the Vampires tear a person to shreds. These Vampires in FDTD are not the romantic type but are ugly and disgusting creatures who at the drop of a hat(or in this case a drop of human blood)will kill anyone with a heartbeat and suck the blood out you. The blood and gore in FDTD disgusting and comes out like water and truly feels like a Splatter movie. The Action is explosive,fiery and fast and will have viewers on the edge of their seat because the Action comes you never know what's going to happen or when. The Action scenes in FDTD are Robert Rodriguez at the top of his game. The ending of From Dusk Till Dawn is amazing and filled with tons of Action and gore that is filled with tons of chaos and mayhem that perfectly goes with the rest of the film. A terrific and memorable conclusion.The cast is wonderful. George Clooney is excellent and at his best as Seth Gecko,with Clooney being charismatic and cool. Harvey Kietel is terrific as Jacob Fuller,a preacher. Quentin Tarantino is outrageous and memorable as Richie Gecko,Seth's mentally unstable brother. Juliette Lewis is fantastic as Kate Fuller,Jacob's daughter. Ernest Liu does a good job as Scott,Jacob's son. Salma Hayek is outstanding and sexy as Santacio Pandemonium,an exotic dancer. Cheech Marin is incredible in his trio of roles(Border Guard,Chet Pussy,Carlos). Tom Savini(Sex Machine)and Fred Williamson(Frost)do great jobs as guys that the help the Geckos and Fullers against the Vampires. Danny Trejo(Razor Charlie),Michael Parks(Texas Ranger Earl McGraw),John Hawkes(Pete Bottoms,Liquor Store Clerk),John Saxon(FBI Agent Stanley Chase),Marc Lawrence(Old Timer Motel Owner),Kelly Preston(Newscastor Kelly Houge)and Brenda Hillhouse(Hostage Gloria Hillhouse)give good performances as well.The direction by Robert Rodriquez is terrific with Rodriguez always moving the camera and giving the movie a stylish look with zooms,close-up as well as high and low angles while doing a great job with the Action scenes. Wonderful job,Rodriguez.The score by Greame Revell is great,intense and fits with the tone of the movie. Fine score,Revell. There is also a great soundtrack with songs by The Blasters(Dark Night),ZZ Top and Tito And Tarantula. Cool soundtrack.The Special Make-Up and Practical Effects by the always great K.N.B EFX Group is amazing as always with make-up effects that add to the film. Terrific job once again,K.N.B.In final word,if you love Robert Rodriguez,Quentin Tarantino,Vampire movies,Horror Films or Action movies,I highly suggest you see From Dusk Till Dawn,one of the greatest Vampire movies ever made and an excellent Action-Horror-Thriller Cult Classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was only during my fifteenth ? or so ? viewing of "From Dusk till Dawn" that I realized that I've never written a user comment for this film. Now that's a quick win! Along with all the other movies Quentin Tarantino was ever involved in, I love every repeated viewing of this film and I say all the characters' lines simultaneously with them. Even now, nearly 20 years after its first release, it still qualifies as one of the most successful crossbreeds between action/thriller and my beloved horror genre, and the film still stands proud and solid thanks to the fast-paced script, the fabulous dialogs, the terrific acting performances and ? of course ? the excessive use of gore and bloodshed! "From Dusk till Dawn" starts out as a wild gangster/chase movie, with George Clooney (back when he was still desperately trying to get rid of his goody- two-shoes "ER" reputation) and QT himself as the violent and unhinged Gecko brothers on the run for State Troopers, Texas Rangers and all other various sorts of authorities. They hijack former preacher Jacob Fuller (Harvey Keitel) and his teenage daughter and adopted son, who're road-tripping in their motorhome in order to process the loss of their wife and mother. Hidden inside the motorhome Seth and Ritchie Gecko cross the Mexican border and immediately head towards an exclusive bar called the Titty Twister. The film then halfway transforms, totally unexpectedly and unpredictable (at least the first time), into an outrageous splatter flick as it turns out that the staff and regular customers of this particular bar turn out to be vampires feeding on passing truckers and bikers. This may sound stupid and far-fetched, but in Tarantino's script it works wonderfully well and the battle between fugitive gangsters and wicked bloodsuckers is spectacular as well as funny and even suspenseful. The film is chock-full of references towards classic horror films, and particularly vampire classics obviously, and stars a handful of nearly-forgotten genre icons in small supportive roles. There's a lovely little role for Blaxploitation hero Fred Williamson, as a tough vampire killer, and a (sadly too short) cameo appearance by John Saxon. Make-up genius Tom Savino clearly also terrifically enjoyed himself as a dressed in leather biker by the nickname Sex Machine. The direction is in the hands of Tarantino's equally gifted pal Robert Rodriguez, who also invited his buddies Cheech Marin, Danny Trejo and Salma Hayek. The latter's sensual dance on top of the bar tables, just prior to hell breaking loose, is definitely also one of the highlights of the film. "From Dusk till Dawn" is highly recommended entertainment that I'll undoubtedly watch countless times more. The sequels, on the other hand, suck like washed up vampire grannies.</fullReview>

Alright all jokes aside let's get to where it is really at with this movie. It starts like any other crime movie would. There is some explicit scenes, some murder an explosion. But then they kidnap a preacher and his family. This is when my pants got tight at this point I had to pause the movie and rub myself because I wasn't prepared.Then it all goes down when they get to Mexico. At that point I was like roll the credits we made it. But we did not, me and my nipples where not ready for the brutal rubbing that lay before us.The res of the movie you're just going to have to watch yourself because I can't explain it.

		<fullReview>Part of me thinks that because it's Halloween, I should just bite the bullet and watch one of my least favour genres - horror. Trouble is, how do you pick a film to watch when most horror films have no interest to me whatsoever? But where there's a will... This Robert Rodriguez effort is very much a film of two halves but one which has attained a cult following over the years. It's not big or clever but if all you're after is a lot of fun mixed in with liberal amounts of gore then you could do much worse. It is delightfully silly and assuming you don't take it seriously then the movie actually offers a pretty decent diversion from fending off those pesky trick-or-treaters.Brothers Seth (George Clooney) and Ritchie Gecko (Quentin Tarantino) are racing for the Mexican border after violently robbing a number of banks and taking a hostage (Brenda Hillhouse). But Seth has a better plan - instead, he hijacks the RV of former preacher Jacob (Harvey Keitel) and his two children (Juliette Lewis and Ernest Liu) and together with the terrified family, sneak over the border to rendezvous with Seth's contact Carlos (Cheech Marin) at a biker's bar called the Titty Twister. There is just one small problem - they are unaware that the bar is home to a vampiric cult who feast on the unfortunate patrons and it's going to be a long night...For a film with a clearly limited budget (which is why I assume Marin plays three different roles), "From Dusk Till Dawn" is another example of Rodriguez putting every dollar on screen. The action, when it does come, feels very reminiscent of his earlier "Desperado" (which is never a bad thing) but man, does it take a while to get there. The first half of the film feels like a different picture altogether - it's tense and perhaps more interesting than the second half which is explosive, gloriously over-the-top and as seedy as the Titty Twister itself. It makes you forget the excessive amount of set-up in the same way that anyone who watches the original "The Italian Job" can only remember Minis racing around Turin. Clooney and Keitel are typically charismatic as Seth and Jacob respectively and I enjoyed their battle of wills while Tarantino delivers probably the creepiest performance of his career. Lewis is also good but underused and the same can be said of the smoking hot Salma Hayek who proves that no-one can do sexy Latino as well as she can - even when she tries drinking your blood.Anyone looking for subtlety or context will be disappointed with "From Dusk Till Dawn" which is as stupid as sticking a pumpkin on your head and igniting your hair. But sometimes stupid works and there's no question that the movie is much greater than the sum of its parts. It's a lot like "Tremors" or "Bubba Ho-Tep" - movies which don't so much scare as amuse with its otherworldly beings chasing our heroes. If I were being picky then I could say that a bit more scope would have been nice and the two sequels seem completely unnecessary. It also isn't remotely frightening - which doesn't seem in keeping with the Halloween spirit but then again, neither is a toddler dressed like a Minion asking for sweets. It's too slow to be a full-on action flick and not scary enough to be a proper horror but "From Dusk Till Dawn" finds an interesting middle ground to occupy instead of disappearing between the cracks. It's bloody, bonkers and quite unlike anything else out there but it's worth the watch if you're not a genuine horror fan like me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>EL MARIACHI was one of those first-time efforts one can't help but admire, and it showed a world of promise. By the time we get to FROM DUSK TILL DAWN, it's hit and miss with the director- and FROM DUSK TILL DAWN is the very epitome of "hit and miss." The first half is tense and dramatic and, watching it, I thought at the time of its release that I was seeing one of the truly GREAT vampire movies... but, following the hottest tabletop dance in the history of motion pictures, the movie abruptly fell apart. It suddenly became a comedy of over-the-top gore fx that had seemingly nothing whatsoever to do with anything that had come before. Switching gears is always an iffy proposition in a movie, but THIS big a switch was downright shocking- partly because it's a one hundred and eighty degree turn, and partly because the switch makes absolutely no sense in any way. What COULD'VE been a Great movie ends up being a barely tolerable one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1988, Robert Kurtzman had an idea. Two wanted criminals have taken a family to get them to Mexico for a job, and where they go for the night happens to be taken over by vampires. A few years later, he Kurtzman made a short film/teaser where Joe Pilato (Of "Day of the Dead") is fighting of oncoming vampires. The 24-paged treatment was in the hands of Quentin Tarantino, a hip new director, who made a full script of the story. He gave it to Robert Rodriguez, a friend of his since they meet after their 1992 works, Reservoir Dogs and El Mariachi were at Cannes. Robert took up his camera and filmed the film, with Tarantino acting and producing. Now, with that out of the way, this is a great film! The first act is like a Tarantino film, but not as comedic, and is a slight bit more teen-ish in writing, ever so slightly. The second half is THE Romero zombie film of the nineties, with Tom Savini making it feel even more like that. I would suggest this flick just because it is a great time with a few beers, have fun!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When the movie started, I was sold to a criminal movie. The intro was the perfect setup for a Tarantino movie. Two criminal brothers on the run trying to get to Mexico. Simple and brilliant.The movie introduced two hot-headed brothers, so you know crap was gonna hit the fan and duels were gonna go down. It had everything I wanted: Black comedy, Crime, Suspense, Action, Drama, Thriller, Nudity, it even had Salma Hayek dancing half naked!At to this point, everything was perfect... but then, the vampires appeared and the whole film had a 180 degree turn. It just didn't fit with the rest of the movie.I'm not gonna lie, the different ways of how they killed the vampires were pretty cool and creative, but I felt like the first half of the movie was made by Tarantino and the second half was made by Rodriguez.This movie had a lot of potential if it stuck with the first plot. I would've rated a 9/10 if they would've continued Gecko Brothers' adventure. But I'm giving the movie as a whole a 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie opens up very nicely, which sets the the right tone for the movie. This is the typical Tarantino part,and man I really loved the opening act. But as time passes the story becomes wayward, it's like the humor didn't fuse well with the script. The twist doesn't come out properly. I would say the director was at fault here. The Final act was good, but the script was dilated by the direction and ends with God knows what kind of ending.Overall I would say the screenplay was really nice, the story was good enough but it is mainly the direction which did not make the film what it could have been. The music as always was good especially the song where Salma Hayek appears. Watch it for Tarantino.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Back in 1986 there was a small low budget horror movie called 'Vamp' starring Grace Jones as a supreme vampiress Goddess and owner of a seedy strip joint full of seedy hooker-esque strippers...it was spanklicious! Then along came Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez and they basically completely ripped off the entire idea, thus we have this heavily Mexican influenced horror splatter fest.I saw this film on release in the cinema back in the day and I thoroughly enjoyed it, this hasn't changed. I think the fun fact with this film is that it works on two levels, as we all know the film is basically one story that U-turns into another, but both work really well. The first half of the film which focuses on the 'Gecko Brothers' is a violent unapologetic crime spree road trip following the duo on the lamb. Its a strange combination of ice cool badassery and actual nastiness leaving you unsure whether you should be rooting for these two guys. Lets face it, Clooney is the slightly charming good looking cool headed leader of the pair sporting a horribly dated tribal tattoo. This guy makes you think its fun and sexy to be a criminal on the run from the law...in a cool car to boot. Then you have Tarantino who is a scrawny whiny bespectacled creep who lies and kills people for no reason, he also appears to be a sexual predator and kills (possibly raping) women. Now together this pair do make a fun fast talking duo of deperados admittedly, their bickering is amusing and well performed, visually they look quite unique in their appearance and attire and they are badass motherf*ckers. The thing is they do commit some really quite nasty crimes along the way which is played for dark laughs but it leaves a bad taste in your mouth. You can't help but feel they get what they deserve in the end and I personally find it hard to feel any emotion or sympathy for either character. Its like...oh yeah its sad for 'Seth' when 'Richie' gets killed...but wait, didn't he kill an innocent female by putting a pillow over her head and shooting her in the face?! Oh and didn't Seth burn that innocent (and cooperative) liquor store worker to death??!!The main crux of this film is of course the second part of the story when the duo reach the 'Titty Twister' in the middle of nowhere, Mexico. From a dark graphic novel style violent crime thriller to an over the top, balls to the wall, in your face soft porn vampire slaughter. What I like about this section of the film is the fact they use hands-on effects, the whole gamut of traditional methods from models and puppets to bucket loads of goo and gore. I think there is a small amount of CGI for the bats and face morphing but mostly all the death and destruction is utilising classic live action gore effects and some lovely makeup work that I'm sure Savini had a hand in. Even though the Titty Twister is an obvious set it still looks the business both inside and out with clever use of props and camera angles. You know there aren't that many vampires, you know the bar set isn't that big, you know the outside is restricted for space etc...but with the odd lorry parked in the right position, good editing, some clever tricks and even an old fashioned matte painting Rodriguez is able to present a much bigger universe on a tight budget.I think this part of the film has its ups and downs honestly. Its definitely a rip roaring brutal cadaver fest which is great fun but as the film progresses towards the finale it does become so over the top with the gore and action it loses its grip and edge. The effects seem to get a little weaker towards the end as though they were running out of cash and time. The makeup is still great but some of the creatures looked pretty ropy truth be told, what was that huge rat monster Clooney fights?! kudos for trying but the rod puppet animation used for that thing was hokey looking. I also always wondered why Hayek's character seems to turn into a humanoid reptile, that's what it looked like didn't it? not very vampire-like. The various exploding melting head close ups rock but most of the body suits and large vampire bats look very rubbery and fake right at the end.There is no doubt this is another great example of Rodriguez's visual style and somewhat over self-indulgent obsession with the Mexican theme. The added bonus of a solid cast of Tarantino regulars and aging cult stars really gives the adventure a shot in the arm too, had this been cast with any standard Hollywood stars it may not have been as appealing. I mean lets face it, this film introduced us to Hayek, Trejo and to a degree Marin for some folk...loved how he plays multiple characters and pulls it off!A true popcorn flick harking back to the good old days of 80's splatter comedy horror. What's more it makes you wanna see more of the Gecko Brothers with a prequel and easily a sequel following Seth. I won't deny the first half of the film felt vicious and a tad unpleasant, could almost say a fail for what they were clearly going for, but what horror/action fan can say they didn't get a solid kick out of the biker mayhem that followed. Easily my fave film involving and starring Tarantino, I just loved how they did his vampire makeup too, did you notice how his skull had a massive chin?7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining Thrill Ride!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'From Dusk Til Dawn' is an action-packed thrill ride that anyone can enjoy. If you are going to watch this movie to critique it, you should probably know a couple things. The acting in it is pretty decent. Clooney and Tarantino do pretty well in their roles. Not their best performances but they do a pretty good job. Dialogue is not great, editing is average. However, you will be pleasantly surprised by the makeup effects. My advice, have fun with this movie. It is very entertaining, just sit back and enjoy it.For the horror fans, you will absolutely love it! The movie starts off a little slow, but once you get to about the 40 minutes mark, things escalate quickly. LIke I stated before, you will be amazed by the makeup effects in this film. The vampires are real cool and may be some of the coolest vampires ever in a movie. Also horror fans, you will notice makeup/ special effects legend Tom Savini has a role in this film! For what he does, he is great and you will definitely get a kick out of it. Another thing viewers should note going into this movie it is more of an action movie than horror, but there is also a little dark comedy in it. It all actually meshes very well.Overall 'From Dusk Til Dawn' is a very entertaining movie. Awesome makeup effects and lots of creative stuff in this film! I would definitely recommend it to the everyday movie watcher, especially horror fans like myself. 'From Dusk Til Dawn' gets an 8/10 stars from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not what many expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember watching this with a friend who told me after the film, she was loving it until they went to Road House, at which point it turned into the worst movie ever made.Maybe it was my love of horror movies, maybe it was my teenage Salma Hayek lust going into overdrive, who knows? But I absolutely loved it from start to finish. However, my friend, Jenny made a good point about this film: it starts off as one type of movie and then morphs into something completely different. Often with a film you can get a pretty good feel for what you are watching in the first 15-20 minutes and have a reasonably good idea if you are going to enjoy it or not. This is one film where you can love the first 45 minutes and despise the rest of the film, or vice versa.George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino star as the Grecko Brothers who, after an amusing opening sequence where they rob a liquor store, are on the run from the police and end up taking a retired Priest Jake Fuller and his two children (one of whom is Juliette Lewis fresh off of Natural Born Killers) hostage as they head to Mexico to meet their friend Carlos (one of many roles in the movie played by Cheech Marin). Upon arrival The Greckos are given quite a show by a stripper (Salma Hayek) who feeds Tarantino some champagne down her leg.That's where it gets pretty different, as they turn out to be in a vampire bar and Clooney spends the rest of the movie fighting creatures of darkness, before an amusing final scene with Cheech.This was my second look at a Robert Rodriguez movie following Desperado, and as well as recurring cast members (Tarantino, Hayek, Marin, Danny Trejo) and setting (Mexico) this one also has a very similar feel.The film delivers something rather different from what you'd expect from the premise and is actually a pretty good kick ass action flick made with typical Rodriguez oddness. The cast are all stellar and it is great watching Clooney and Keitel together.It's no Desperado by any means, but From Dusk Til Dawn is a satisfying action thriller and one of Rodriguez's better films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think it's terrific - gore, humour and vampires all thrown into a blender. Terrific. Great, enjoyable and violent - with some wonderful acting and dialogue. I love Robert Rodriguez' films; they're all very entertaining and he ALWAYS does a good job. Look at the likes of this, The Faculty and more, etc. Also, Clooney and Tarantino work splendidly together - they're amazing in "From Tusk 'Till Dawn". Overall, I would rate the film an honest 9.5 out of 10. I mean, the dialogue, acting, humour, unexpectedness and so much more, it's all really good. However, it's quite a build up - though it is nonetheless superb and great to watch. Simply and violently wonderful. Thank you for reading my positive review on "From dusk 'till Dawn", guys. Oh, and P.S. the scene where Seth (George Clooney) punches Jacob Fuller (Harvey Keitel) in the face and says "it's called a punch!" still makes me laugh after all these years. Good scene - great film. Cheers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hit-And-Miss Tarantino Creates His Biggest Hit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quentin Tarantino is a very hit-and-miss sort of Director for me, as sometimes his movies are incredible and sometimes they enter the realms of being too bizarre. This one was definitely a hit for me!The film starts giving background to the Gecko Brothers (played by Clooney and Tarantino), with Clooney having originally been caught and imprisoned for armed robbery. Tarantino breaks him out, but they need to find a way across the border to Mexico (a safe haven nicknamed "El Rey"). Throughout their journey they encounter multiple obstacles from police patrols to dealing with a hostage situation. Eventually they take a former priest and his daughter and son hostage, in order to get across the border.Once they get across the border, the Gecko brothers decide to celebrate at a striptease establishment, and then from there things go to hell real quick as the staff turn out to be vampires!In typical Tarantino style, it becomes more apparent as the film goes on that his character suffers from serious mental illnesses, which ensues him to rape, and misconstrue reality. For me, the acting was incredible between Clooney and Tarantino. The action scenes, as well, are excellent, and the sudden change into a vampire survival movie is actually one that I enjoyed. The transition was not a boring one either, as there is constant action throughout the movie and the story line is consistent.This movie will always be one of Tarantino's best!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a big sucker for vampire action movies, always have been and always will and this one was a good one.Clooney and Tarantino are two great characters and although they are portrayed as the "bad guys" early in you still cling to their personalities and demeanour. In my opinion, the others, excluding Tom Savini, were nothing to be excited about.The action and humour were extremely well done and I enjoyed the weapons created near the end. The only big problem and what made me rate the way I did was the lack of characters' story, plot was not important for the story but I would have loved to learn more about Clooney and Tarantino characters.Overall, if you are a fan of these types of movies, check them out.</fullReview>

In the Titty twister fights you see heads bouncing on the ground, vampire bands playing with human guitars and Tom Savini owns a d**k like cannon. This film is so crazy but it's very good. I love it. But i cut it one star because of the vampires they don't even look like vampires they mostly look like goblins. But i love the scene where Tom Savini transforms into a rat like monster this is the funniest scene in the movie. When i saw the scene i died laughing. Really this movie is so bad that it's good.

		<shortDescription>From Dusk Till Dawn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At almost 20 years old, it's a darn shame for me to see that I have never seen this movie. So to keep my "credibility" as a cinephile, I finally said to myself "self, watch this movie now, no more waiting." I also asked myself, "what do I know about this movie?" Well, it's got Clooney, Tarantino acts in it, Salma Hayek has a sexy dance with a sexy snake, and vampires are a big thing in the movie. Even knowing all that and with the movie being as old as it is, this movie completely caught me by surprise.George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino play two criminals, Seth and Richard Gecko, that are on the run, which we find out right off the bat, in a incredible opening sequence in a gas station. There eyes are set on the Mexican border for an escape, so they spot a little family (the father played by Harvey Keitel) traveling in an RV and get the idea to hijack the vehicle and take the polite family hostage. When the group get's to there destination, a shady little Mexican bar, all hell breaks loose when vampires turn out to run the place.It sounds corny, it sounds cheesy, campy, laughable, maybe a bit over the top, but BY THE NINE, this is not only a cool crime movie, not only is it a dark, creepy vampire movie, but this is a great movie in it's own right. It's so unique and good at how it tell's the story, and you gotta give major credit to director Robert Rodriguez, because the first half of the movie just feels like a dark, gritty, crime-thriller and if the movie would've just kept that tone through out I would've been perfectly fine, but once the setting jumps the fence into Mexico, a whole other level of a movie is unleashed. George Clooney gives one of my favorite performances I've seen from him, he has this menacing screen presence that he doesn't show anymore and I thought was really good. Harvey Keitel is always great in his more gruff roles, I thought he was terrific as the father of the distressed, kidnapped family. It's a bit of a different role and he did a very good job going back and forth with George Clooney. Salma Hayek, my goodness, no words can describe the spell I was in with her screen presence. It's not a groundbreaking role by any means, she's there mostly to look good and that she does. Tarantino has a larger than normal role, he was enjoyable as well, but his real contribution to this movie is his screenplay. The dialog is so spot on and really meshes perfectly with the more crime driven first half. Vampires are kind of a punchline in movies now a days, this film gives the fanged creatures a very good treatment. There's a lot of use practical effects and make-up, the vampires look creepy and demonic and the action is filmed well. There's a shot that stands out to me in the beginning, where Clooney and Tarantino are walking away from a gas station store engulfed in flames. It's one continuous shot, and as the actors are saying their lines, in the back you see flames spitting out and little explosions throwing debris everywhere, you can tell it was done on set, and I loved it. I loved the vampire "twist" at the end, but I will say that the horror element did kind of get me at a stand still moment, only because the way the movie started as this really intense crime thriller with these two brothers intrigued me. I would have liked to see them stretch on that further, but the insane second half still did it for me, it was a fun watch, and has officially became my favorite vampire movie of all time.</fullReview>

Seth (Clooney) and Richard (Tarantino) Gecko are 2 dangerous criminals trying to cross the Mexican border eluding Police. They decide to kidnap a minister, Jacob Fuller (Kietel) who's vacationing with his daughter, Kate (Lewis) and adopted son, Scott (Ernest Liu). They head across Mexico to a bar, "The Titty Twister" and discover that it's inhabited by vampires led by Santanico Pandemonium (Hayek). It becomes a battle of good &amp; evil for the Geckos and Fullers fighting to survive. This is a great film with a cool cast and excellent make-up effects. Tom Savini (Creepshow), Cheech Marin (Desperado), John Saxon (A Nightmare on Elm Street), Fred Williamson (Starsky &amp; Hutch), Danny Trejo (Heat), Michael Parks (Kill Bill: Vol. 2) and Kelly Preston (Jerry Maguire) also make appearances.

		<shortDescription>One Part Tarantino, One Part Rodriguez, All Parts Crazy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you look at body of work of Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez, nothing could incorporate those styles more poetically and literally than "From Dustk Till Dawn." It could well be argued that their styles are mashed together like peanut butter and jelly rather than blended, the result is something fun and memorable nonetheless.The first half of "From Dusk Till Dawn" serves up a crime drama with Tarantino's signature chaotic edge along and spurts of intense violence. Without any context, it's another wonderfully tension-ratcheted Tarantino film. Then our main characters go to check out the Titty Twister bar and strip club and suddenly we're handed gory over-the-top grindhouse mayhem.The only through-lines in the film are the characters. Performances from George Clooney and Harvey Keitel in particular make for a terrific overall film experience. Movies this screwy don't usually have the pleasure of such commanding talents, but "Dusk" has them and flaunts them. What we'd do 15 years later for Clooney to play a character like Seth Gekko again ...Gekko and his brother Richie are two thieves on the run. After blowing up a roadside convenience store, they run into father (Keitel) and his two kids at a Texas motel and decide to force them at gunpoint to take them over the border. Seth is smart and cocky whereas his brother clearly has some kind of mental disability in addition to being a sexual deviant. Throw all that out the window, however, when the entire lot of them are attacked by vampires.Keitel's Jacob Fuller is a God-fearing man who puts family first and the Gekkos and later vampires test that in different ways. Characters this likable never find their way into films like "Dusk," but Tarantino characters have their own category. We empathize completely with Jacob's desire to keep his kids safe above all else.The creativity of the obscene B-movie side of "Dusk" (should I call it "Dawn"?) makes Act II something worthy of enjoying all on its own. The makeup and visual effects work together in such a way that they form caricatures of vampires. We tend to laugh at the corniness of monster makeup, but the crew here has a self-awareness. They make "Dusk" freaky and hilarious all at the same time, never allowing the audience to dismiss it as total shlock.It's clear that as much as Tarantino and Rodriguez love these kinds of movies, they're not merely imitating the genre. They're giving it the quality of ingredients that only excellent filmmakers can provide. The only things holding it back are the grindhouse genre's inherent weaknesses and general confusion over why the first part of the film ultimately has nothing to do with the second. Those who like both filmmakers' styles will find "From Dusk Till Dawn" quite satisfying in all its imperfection.~Steven CThanks for reading! Check out my site, moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A slasher flick in the style of grindhouse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first piece of advise is do not watch this movie off television but either see it at a cinema (if it is being shown there) or hire it on video. (I don't know if cable cuts this movie to ribbons, but the free to air TV stations do). Basically, much of the movie is cut, and even though it is only the 'f' word, it is still annoying, and in fact it destroys one of the jokes, the one where Cheech Marin is going on about pussy.Anyway, this is a Tarantino movie (and in fact he acts in it, playing is real psycho) and it is divided into two parts. The first is a road movie where two crims, Seth and Richard, are attempting to escape the cops and kidnap a minister and his family. The second part is a blood fest in a pub called the Titty Twister, where they fight hordes of vampires, and most of them are killed.Basically, this movie is a cross between a b-grade horror and a road movie done Tarrantino style, which means it comes out very good. As we can expect in a Tarrantino movie, we have well developed characters and an excess of violence, designed not to desensitise but rather to shock. One scene is where we see, in flashes, the results of Richard's psychosis.Now Richard is an interesting character as he is truly psychotic, and Tarantino plays him really well. He seems to be a nice, gentle man, until we see him rip apart the hostage (which, fortunately, we are spared from watching), which Seth is outwardly a brutal man, but is an intelligent, clear thinking, individual on the inside. I guess this movie deals with duality, in the way that on the outside we are one thing while on the inside we are completely different. We have seen two, and Jacob Fuller is another, a minister of God on the outside while an atheist on the inside, but then it could be the other way around as he keeps on speaking his disbelief but when it comes down to it, he does truly believe. Kate Fuller is similar, on the outside seeming to be a sweet and innocent girl, not ready to face the outside, but is one of the two who survive. Then we have the vampires, who on the outside pose as beautiful women, but turn into horrid monstrosities that seek to kill all.I also love the clever wit in the movie. Unfortunately it is difficult to recite the gags because they are all partly visual (especially the best ones). I guess one needs a weird sense of humor and an iron stomach to handle this movie, but as one person once said, From Dusk til Dawn is the best vampire movie he had ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pleasure turns into a night of hell....which is great for me to watch!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My favorite director is of course Quentin Tarantino, and although he did not direct this movie he acted in it and wrote it. The director Robert Rodriguez took a unique story and made it gory, thrilling, and at points just ridiculous. The story centers around two thugs that have recently broke out of jail and are heading to Mexico for freedom. Along the way they cause destruction and death, and take a preacher and his kids hostage. While they enter Mexico they stay at a place called "Titty Twister" and what they thought was going to be a night of pleasure turns into a night of survival. "From Dusk Till Dawn" has a great cast consisting of some of Rodriguez's usual like Danny Trejo and Cheech Marin, but the main stars are Quentin Tarantino, George Clooney, Juliette Lewis, and Harvey Keitel. Girls if you are looking for Clooney to be like he usually is, sappy and handsome, you will be disappointed. This in my opinion is Clooney's most unique role, he is frankly a bastard in "From Dusk Till Dawn". If you are looking for a amazing movie that you will fall in love with, this might not be it. But if you are looking for a entertaining, thrilling, ridiculously gory movie to watch at Halloween time, this movie is worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Starts out Tarantino, finishes full on Rodriguez</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "Grindhouse", both Tarantino and Rodriguez directed a different homage film that combined to make one movie. In "From Dusk Till Dawn", Rodriguez gets full directing credit, but "Dusk" does not feel like a single film. The first half has an unmistakable Tarantino vibe (he wrote the screenplay and co-stars with George Clooney and Harvey Keitel), despite a few goofy mis-en-scenes. A sly but ever-so-meticulously crafted tip of the hat to both classic noir and bandits-on-the-run movies of the distant past, it plays like one of his pulpy hybrids that plays by classical rules but has it's on conspicuously 90's sense of wit and subversive film-making style. The second part, which seems to blast out of nowhere during a stop into a sleazy, lushly decadent Mexico bar, is undeniably Rodriguez. A sort of Hong-Kong style crazy-making thriller mixed with florid monster movie effects and grind-house gore, it's relentlessly excited (rather than exciting) and very juvenile. "From Dusk Till Dawn" isn't so much uneven as it just feels like they're trying to make two completely different movies and don't seem to care that one doesn't feel finished and the other is never even introduced, just lunging at you and trying to bite you in the throat (it doesn't succeed). It starts out engaging and then just bleeds your senses. "Dusk till Dawn" has gotten something of a modest cult following since it's release, but I don't know how anybody would want to sit through the whole thing again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun vampire film with only minor flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Trying to hide out from the authorities, a pair of bank-robbers and the family they've taken hostage find the Mexican strip club they're rendezvousing at is the home to a race of vicious vampires and try to fight their way out before they're taken over.This here is an exceptionally enjoyable and entertaining entry with a ton of positives going for it. The fact that there's an abundance of gore here certainly helps matters, due to this one's impressive portrayal of vampires in a rather imposing light as being far more interested in spilling blood and killing than in anything else, so the deaths they inflict as well as the retaliation to take them down are suitably gory and contain a ton of bloodshed. With two massive massacres in here, the main showdown in the bar-room where they reveal their true selves and just go crazy on the victims in the room as well as the last-stand where they're trying to fight the creatures off, contain a lot of big action, great deaths and lots of bloodshed. Also making them something to be feared is the fact that the special-effects make-up for them looks incredible, from the demonic look of most of them with the fangs and deformed appearance as well as the snake-like look of the main dancer makes for a great all-around look and makes their bloodlust all the more believable. It is also hard not to notice the featured striptease in here before the main massacre, it's about as sensual and erotic without crossing into sleaze as it's going to get and is definitely a highlight in its own right. The main problem here, though, is the beginning before they get to the joint, which consists of nothing but an endless stream of profanity and not much else, making the film appear as far removed from a horror film as possible and not really delivering anything remotely entertaining due to the personalities of the people we're supposed to be rooting for. Otherwise, this is a rather enjoyable vampire effort.Rated R: Extreme Graphic Language, Extreme Graphic Violence, Nudity and children in jeopardy</fullReview>

George Clooney is very bad-ass as the anti-hero Seth Gecko. This was a good career choice for him. Unlike his role in the movie Batman and Robin, which was absolute trash. Quentin Tarantino played his role of Richie Gecko quite well also. He is more frightening than Seth Gecko. Seth Gecko may be ruthless, but he more or less of the moral compass of this movie.

		<shortDescription>Forefather to Grindhouse and Stepchild to Natural Born Killers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The way I see it, there are two distinct ways to see this movie. One could bemoan it for robbing them of a full Tarantino movie, delivered in his prime, by saddling the plot with an unexpected swerve into Robert Rodriguez exploitation. Or they could sit back and enjoy it for the utterly unpredictable, bewildering, guns-blazing, "I can't believe that just happened," speed boat ride that it is. I fall into the latter camp, and while both directors have undeniably made more intelligent, deep, well-rounded pictures, there's no denying From Dusk Till Dawn has a certain unusual charm that's tough to nail down. Tarantino's script elaborates loosely on a lot of the social observations he'd originally made in Natural Born Killers, while the film's semi-serious, tongue-in-cheek attitude is an obvious precursor to the superduo's later collaboration on Grindhouse, marking it as an evolutionary milestone of sorts for both. George Clooney steals almost every scene as a take-no-crap heistmeister who's desperate to cross the Mexican border, Harvey Keitel seems unusually understated as the soft-spoken jaded preacher, and Tarantino himself breaks out his C-level acting chops in an appropriately stiff, detached performance as Clooney's creepy, sexual predator of a brother. This isn't quite the joyride I'd remembered it as, but it still provides a few laughs and six barrels full of blood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Must for Tarantino fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a fan of Quentin Tarantino's writing and directing style I decided to give this film a try even as it being one of his less popular titles. I am very glad I did.From the beginning, the movie jumps right in and catches you with glorious original dialogue that screams Terantino. Two theft and murder suspects are desperately fleeing the country killing anything that comes in their way and taking hostages to boot. The two felons, played by George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino, are fun to hate and are portrayed with the perfect amount of evil. A thrill to watch the pair on screen together. The movie will keep you guessing scene after scene.Words can't describe how big of a turn the movie takes about half way through. It's like the original writing and directing crew stopped working in the middle of filming and handed it off to a completely different set of hands to finish. If you aren't familiar with the film the first time around like me, you will be utterly shocked at the turn it takes. We go from a criminal action/drama to a sci-fi horror in the blink of an eye. In other words, everyone starts turning into "vampires". I use quotations because they don't really act like vampires, more like zombie vampires. The creatures can barely speak and if they bite you, you turn to one of them...The end scene tends to draw out for me a little. All of the smooth and cool dialogue and story telling is replaced with cheap lines. Dramatic violence is replaced with mindless violence. It becomes a cheap slasher flick with less depth than the first half.Overall though, it was a highly entertaining movie. Tarantino dialogue, action, shock factor, cool vibe and unique style combine to make this movie an easy classic</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clooneys best role...buttt the movie is flawed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is hands down clooneys coolest and best role. It is so out of his normal comfort zone for acting and I love it. He has some hilarious moments and great acting.This movie is about two brothers (clooney and Tarantino)who are robbers. They just finished committing a robbery and needed a way out. So they high jack a motor home with the family still inside. The family is scared for their life but clooney has no intention of hurting them,i don't know if i can say the same for his brother on the other hand. They make the family drive to a bar in Mexico where some unlikely events happen.This movie is filled with great actors, clooney ,Tarantino, keitel and more. The first half of the movie is really good its up until the twist comes where it starts to get a little silly. Mainly to the fact the special effects are so bad. In my opinion they should have kept the movie going the same style it was in the first half. Overall if you like Tarantino and clooney you should probably see this movie if not don't risk it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Man this movie was so badass im not even a george cloony fan but damn he was so good and badass in this movie. The screenplay was so catchy and epic thanks to Quentin qarentino he was also good as the rapest and stupid brother he was funny to. But of course as I said before this was all George Clooney show as he was so aggressive and new things were gonna come his as the character he played. I felt bad for the family they murdered but they worked together later which was the good twist. This movie had so much twists which made it even better as the vampires came out of nowhere. Man salma hayek was sexy as the vampire I also liked her sexy dance that scene was so good. All in all this movie was excellent for all the action lovers but don't bring kids under 14.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'From Dusk Till Dawn' is the first Rodriguez-Tarantino collaboration. Clearly these two loved the 70s exploitation films that have a cult following and this is their first tribute (which would later be followed by films such as 'Kill Bill' and 'Planet Terror'). When I first saw it more than 10 years ago I hated it but for some reason I knew I would love it if I watched it today. I wasn't wrong. 'From Dusk Till Dawn' is heavily loaded with action, energy, female nudity, blood, gore, violence, swearing and vampires. Rodriguez and Tarantino pay brilliant homage to the 70s B-grade vampire flicks. Even though it was made on a limited budget, it's very well-made. The art direction, editing, cinematography and lighting are first rate. The action sequences are wonderfully choreographed. The soundtrack is a must have. I loved the writing as the lines made me laugh out loud and they were effortlessly delivered by the actors. George Clooney, Harvey Keitel and Juliette Lewis perform all guns blazing. Danny Trejo and Cheech Marin are hilarious. Quentin Tarantino is menacing. Salma Hayek oozes sensuality immediately heating up the viewer's blood. This is a homage in the truest sense and no one can do it better than Rodriguez and Tarantino. 'Planet Terror' is proof that they have only gotten better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forget Death Proof - THIS is how the other half of Grindhouse should've looked</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Written by Tarantino back in his video shop employee days, and directed by Robert Rodriguez fresh off his Desperado breakout, From Dusk Till Dawn is really two episodes combined to make a fun, funny and original, yet totally off-the-wall film.It also had an in-her-prime Salma Hayek dancing in a bikini with an albino snake wrapped around her neck - never a bad thing.Ever.The opening scene has Earl and Pete yakking up a storm in the local bottle-O. Among other things they discuss a local string of crimes perpetrated by two low life brothers named Seth and Richie Gecko, that include robbery, murder and kidnapping. It seems they are headed for the border which will mean they go right through the local area. Earl hopes that will be the case, he is the local sheriff after all.A quick reveal shows that Seth and Richie are indeed nearby, and after an action packed and frankly hilarious shootout they leave the smoldering remains of the bottle-O and hit the road.The Gecko's aren't your regular petty crims, Seth (George Clooney) is the heavily tatted mastermind, cool, calm and calculated. All business. While Richie is deeply insecure, cold-bloodedly violent and basically f*cking nuts, always a good combo.They are indeed on the way to Mexico, to be more specific a backwater town named El-Ray, where they will be meeting their fence, (the guy who will buy the stolen goods), but first they must cross the border, where they are Public Enemy #s 1 &amp; 2.Enter Jacob, Kate and Scott, a family on holiday in their camper van. Jacob has lost his wife in a car-wreck, which made him question his faith to the point that he has given up his role as a Priest, Kate and Scott are his children, the fact that Scott is of Chinese descent is acknowledged but never explained.Seth and Richie abduct the entire family and demand that they escort them across the border to safety, now even though Jacob has a troubled past he is still humble, yet steely determined, and he initially says "no chance". That is until Seth threatens to sic Richie onto Kate.Now to expedite proceedings after some shennanigans they find themselves across the border and in Mexico, where Seth directs them to a local bar called the Titty-Twister for celebratory beers.Now up to this point the happenings in this film were only improbable. Here it gets a little bit crazier.At the totally O.T.T. Titty Twister the Tarantino part of the film ends, the rest being all Rodriguez. The bar is populated by heaps of familiar character actors and film personalities, a short list includes Cheech Marin, Tom Savini, Greg Nicotero, Danny Trejo and Fred Williamson, Salma arrives later. The bar has strippers and crazy dancers, an inhouse band, surly staff and dangerous looking client?le.Nice.After some petty fights involving various staff and drinkers, (featuring what I would venture a guess as being the first genital cannon in cinema outside of porn!) the tone slips down a notch, as Salma arrives.53 minutes running time.Salma plays Satanico Pandemonium, the exotically named, exotic looking, exotic dancer, complete with the previously mentioned albino reptile. Over the next three or so minutes she puts on a dance that has the bar transfixed, and I dare say many bars in the audience were transfixed from this point too.Now up to this point the happenings in the film were only wildly improbable. Here it goes cuckoo-f*cking-bananas! 58 minutes running time.Salma, (as we know it) moves on, and all sh*t breaks loose.The remainder of the film has scant plot aside from the fact that our characters are beset by honest to goodness vampires from this point on until the credits. There are numerous sightgags, some effects work that is equal parts dodgy and inspired, and gore galore, but all of it more cheesy than cringe-inducing.Most "standard" vampire rules apply, stakes, holy water, crosses etc? and the small group of surviving non-bloodsuckers must make it to dawn to see if the final rule, that of death by sunlight, applies.There is some great dialogue, frenetic action and inspired chaos, there are also some quite hilarious intermissions, most notably Fred Williamson's 'Nam recollections that seem to ramble on and on, all the while becoming more animated.While this isn't as critically embraced as Pulp Fiction or even Sin City, and with reason, From Dusk Till Dawn is amazingly efficient genre-busting film-making. I've said before you can't watch the same film over and over again without getting bored, you need some variety, something different sometimes.The fact is that From Dusk Till Dawn is likely totally different from almost anything you'll watch this year. But it is also a great film, and hugely entertaining.Final Rating ? 8 / 10. I hate the description Horror-Comedy, but this film and Shaun of the Dead prove that it can be done well.If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"That's What I Call A _______ Show!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As most psychotronic-film fans already seem to know, Robert Rodriguez's "From Dusk Till Dawn" (1996) is a picture that cleaves fairly evenly into two discrete sections. In the first, homicidal bank robber/kidnappers Seth and Richie Gecko (George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino), while on the run in Texas, abduct a lapsed minister (Harvey Keitel) and his two kids (Juliette Lewis and, in his film debut, Ernest Liu) and force the family to smuggle them into Mexico in a gas-guzzling RV. This is a hard-boiled, suspenseful, oftentimes amusing segment, which abruptly shifts gears as the quintet fetches up at a biker bar in the Mexican wilderness, only to find that the club's habitues are nothing less than bloodsucking, zombielike vampires! And then the fun really begins!Oh, how I did love this hoot of a movie; let me count some of the ways. (1) George Clooney, easily stealing the show here with what is practically an Oscar-worthy performance, as Seth; a relatively sane (when compared to his psycho sex maniac brother, at least!), totally unflappable, wisecracking, tough-as-nails, oddly likable wildman. (2) A crackling, imaginative script by Tarantino, clearly on a roll here after the recent success of "Pulp Fiction," that is loaded with big laffs, pays homage to both classic hostage dramas AND grisly horror flix, and is liberally sprinkled with "F bombs," natch. (3) Some energetic direction from Mr. Rodriguez, whose love for genre filmmaking is evident in every scene in the film. (4) The aforementioned humor, which leavens the drama, the gore and the grue; for example, try not to laff when Seth calls the Juliette Lewis character "Gidget"! (5) A rocking soundtrack, comprised, appropriately enough, of such staggering Texas-based artists as Stevie Ray and Jimmie Vaughan and ZZ Top. (6) Cheech Marin's spiel in front of the biker bar; truly, a classic, hawking come-on for the ages. And honestly, how cool is it that Cheech plays three separate roles in this film, a la Peter Sellers and Alec Guinness? (7) Salma Hayek as Santanico (NOT Satanico, as widely written) Pandemonium, whose snake dance, with the sounds of Tito and Tarantula performing "After Dark" in support, may well be the most awesome scene in motion picture history. Indeed, Salma here, I dare say, embodies what most men would deem the quintessence of pulchritudinous muliebrity. (8) The sight of Clooney, Keitel, FX legend Tom Savini, and blaxploitation hero Fred Williamson battling four vampire chicks...action heaven! (9) The coolest crucifix ever shown in a vampire movie; the one Harvey improvises from a baseball bat and a pump-action shotgun! (10) Some extraordinarily clever violence and carnage, as the hundreds of massed, repugnant-looking vampires are wiped out in dozens of clever ways. I could go on and on, but you get the idea: This movie really is a gas from start to finish, its remarkable final image itself a justification for a sequel. Thinking back on this film afterward, I could only echo Seth Gecko's words, regarding Santanico's performance: "That's what I call a _______ show!"</fullReview>

The rest of the cast were fine, they did not add much.I loved the twist in the middle of the film, but felt it ruined a pretty good movie..The drama from the brothers and the kidnapped family was quite riveting, but then the Vampires, made it a little ludicrous...All in all, a film that will entertain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Original Grindhouse Double Feature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remember when vampires were scary? Remember when they portrayed as the beasts they really are?Though I hate the Twilight series, despite the laughs it gives me, I admit, I love the TV series: True Blood, with its romantic and adventurous with a bit of humor take on the vampire lore.That said, it's refreshing to watch how vampires are supposed to be shown. And that's only half the battle! There's two complete movies in here (three, if you count the excellent documentary: Full Tilt Boogie based on the making of From Dusk Till Dawn) and both are wonderful to watch. You have the heavy Tarantino-laced opening half about two despicable bank robber brothers Seth (Clooney) and Richard (Tarantino) who literally destroy lives in the path to Mexico and the second half ? a completely different movie using the same characters who now find themselves deep within a Vampire Haven at the Titty Twister bar.It helps I love both Clooney and Tarantino, but I'm also very fond of the multitude of other actors: Michael Parks, Tom Savini, John Saxon, Hayek, Marin, Trejo and Keitel. And everyone was on their game throughout. In addition, the music and score rocked, the dialogue was absolutely spot-on and the tongue-in-cheek &amp; no scene taking itself serious were awesome. If you like Tarantino's other films, or Clooney ? you really have to like him, you will love this excellent film. Even Lewis, whom I've despised since Cape Fear didn't ruin my fun.I've now seen this at least a dozen times, each time I thoroughly enjoy it more. Director Rodriguez seemingly did the impossible and made it work 100%: he not only put way too much in the movie, he also turned these two ruthless murderers into characters you (gasp) rooted for. Generally, I don't like the overcrowding of films, but Screenplay Writer Tarantino made it seem just like a very long and event-packed day.(Very) Basic rundown: Seth escapes prison (well, courthouse) with the help of his brother and (severe) sex-offender, Richard, and the plow through many innocents to get money from a bank and attempt to get across the border. (Side Note: Even with the hilarious Marin playing his first of three characters, the border patrol agent, this scene would probably be impossible to take seriously in today's time.)One method to get into Mexico and hide out, is to kidnap a "Lost Faith" Minister (Keitel) and his two children who are riding in their new mobile home. (The dialogue between Keitel and Clooney from the moment they meet to the end is reminiscent of Ocean's Eleven's Clooney and Pitt's banter. In other words: a whole lotta fun.)They do make south of the border and to a strip club/dive, the Titty Twister, and dominate Seth commands respect while making the kidnapped family drink and converse with him. Okay, he does get the respect he desires until, well, uh, practically everyone turns into a vampire and it's up to a select few to combat and survive from Dusk till Dawn.It's a fun experience, especially if you're into Tarantino films ? there was a lot of Reservoir Dogs here, after all. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.Everybody be cool. You be cool.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ultimate in crime-splatter-vampire-road-movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An unusual mix of crime-thriller and splatter horror, From Dusk Till Dawn is, if nothing else, a very entertaining film. It's unashamedly trashy with no pretence otherwise. But it's good quality trash none-the-less. The first half of the story sees a couple of evil brothers on the run from the law, while terrorizing anyone they meet on the way. They take a family hostage and cross the border into Mexico in their camper-van. When they arrive at their destination, unexpected things start to happen.For me, the crime-thriller part of the story is the most effective. It's tense and unsettling. George Clooney is very good as the chief brother, while Tarantino is OK as his unhinged sibling. In any case, their road trip from hell is compelling and really sets the film in motion. Once they arrive at their destination the film more or less starts over again, with all that went before effectively irrelevant as the movie turns into a vampire splatter flick. From Dusk Till Dawn truly is an example of two completely different film ideas joined together somewhat loosely. But it doesn't really matter as the result is definitely different, and it never takes itself very seriously. Watch out too for a very nice final shot that gives a whole new perspective to the 'bar' where all the undead action has taken place. And as for Salma Hayek, well, words fail me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two brothers are on the run from the cops and after finally getting over the border and into Mexico, they decide to stop the night at a remote nightclub. This sentence easily describes the opening half on the film. With Taratino's flick-of-the-tongue dialogue, the first half plays as a great crime thriller. The two brothers , Seth and Richard played by Clooney and Taratino are a interesting pair. Clooney plays the head brother in which he calls all the shots while Taratino plays the sex offender and i have to be honest, his image suits the role. His acting on the other hand is not all to great.Despite Taratino only writing the script for this film, it clearly obvious that he helped with the directing. For example the opening scene in the diner and the Trunk shot at the motel. Then comes Keitel who plays the father who has lost faith in God after the passing of his wife. As always, keitel delivers.The second half turns out to be rather different than the first half. They stop by at a nightclub in which a man welcomes everyone by screaming out a selective list of all types of Pussy. here, we start to meet even more interesting bizarre characters. Danny Trejo as masculine Razor and Tom Savini as the Sex Machine. These two brings more fun and excitement into the film and keeps it rolling without it running out of stream.The last half an hour goes like this: most bikers and truck drivers turn into vampires making themselves a huge threat towards the two brothers and the other normal beings. What we get is Over the top gore which will make you chuckle the first time but after a while begins to get repetitive. As always, we get some great one liners thanks to taratino and basically it all good, gory fun.Some may find this sudden flip hard to take in but if you stay open minded then you should enjoy this film. Seeing George Clooney play this sort of character was a joy and he was most certainly the star of the show. Everyone gave great performances except taratino who just seemed of the ball ( what is up with him and feet?) Overall, your getting two movies in one.</fullReview>

I wish they would have just left the vampire angle out, what was an excellent film prior to that, suddenly it went over the top big time. It spoiled the film a lot for me. What a terrific cast, the acting is great, particularly Quentin Tarantino. George Clooney, Juliette Lewis and Harvey Keitel also do a terrific job. Great sound effects and special effects. It does go a bit over the top with the gore. Incredible pacing, the main characters are well defined. It's certainly a film worth watching. It's not for all tastes, but I admire the effort, and it certainly rises above most of the films in this genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez are Hollywood's bad boys. The two of them completely flaunt Hollywood conventions, doing what pretty much whatever they want. The two filmmakers have very similar styles, and a co-operative production between the two became inevitable. Unfortunately, their first combined effort is something of a disappointment.Two bank robbing brothers, Seth (George Clooney) and Richard Gekko (QT himself) are fleeing to Mexico to live a life of luxury. Along the way, they hijack an RV driven by Jacob Fuller, an ex-priest, and his son (Ernest Liu) and daughter (Juliette Lewis). Stopping to meet up with their cohorts at a bar, they discover that the bar is actually run by a group of nasty vampires.The problem with the film is that it takes a while to get going. Clooney is fun to watch, but this isn't the likable criminal that he usually plays. He's a violent thug, and "charm" is not something one would use to describe his character. QT however, is ineffective as Richard. He can be a genius filmmaker when he wants to be, but he can't act. Harvey Keitel is solid as the priest who lost his faith. Juliette Lewis is miscast, and the less said about Ernest Liu, the better (he's awful, if you must know).Robert Rodriguez is trying to emulate the B-grade zombie/vampire horror shlock films that he and QT love, and while it's certainly bloody, cheesy and sleazy, it's also a little boring. When the film gets going, it doesn't stop until the end. But it takes a little too long to get there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"From Dusk Till Dawn" directed by Robert Rodriguez is quite simply two completely different films bashed into one. The product is a cringe-worthy blend of trashy violence, laughably poor effects on the vampires and Tarantino as an actor. NO WAY!!!The movie starts off quite well actually. It focuses on two criminal brothers, Seth and Richard Gecko (Clooney and Tarantino) disturbing the lives of the Fuller family (Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis and Ernest Liu). The brothers force Keitel and his family to drive their RV across border to Mexico in the aftermath of a liquor shop gunfight bonanza. There are a couple of murders involved and Richie (Tarantino) rapes and murders the hostage that they had been holding as a bargaining chip for the police. This motivates them to find new hostages, queue The Fuller family, and head to Mexico to meet with a mysterious crime lord Carlos. After having their Rv searched at the border, they successfully reach their desired destination and encounter an eccentric and raucous bar, The Titty Twister.They have no idea what they are getting themselves into...OH NO!!! After experiencing the outrageously sexy snake dance by the appallingly beautiful Salma Hayek, everything goes haywire. There's gore and vampires produced through simply dreadful special effects and the body count needlessly spirals out of control. After several minutes of muddled crap where bodies fly everywhere and ugly vampires seemingly outnumber the humans, the humans breakthrough thanks to the sunlight. Yay! Spare me.This film started of decently well, I thoroughly enjoyed the turn of Clooney, an immensely gifted actor, who portrayed ruthlessness, sadistic intentions yet feasible levels of negotiability whilst Harvey Keitel is typically impressive as a worried Dad. As for Tarantino, it was lucky that he died halfway through the film, simply because as a director he is nothing short of a genius, as an actor, he is useless.Robert Rodriguez perfectly pulls the plug on this films potential with an extraordinarily long sequence of tedious vampire slaying, excessive blood and guts and an easy ending. Oh well, what could have been. But what else can we expect from the man who offended us with catastrophes such as Spy Kids.5/10. Laughable second half to the movie. Tut tut,</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"From Dusk Till Dawn" is a Robert Rodriguez-directed film about two assassin-brothers who force a family to go to Mexico and to a strip-club called the Titty-Twister, but when they get to Mexico, they're in for something a little into the supernatural: Vampires! This is a pretty good! It's a little slow at first, but trust me, it's worth it. You may feel like it'll take forever to get to the vampires, but just hang tight. You'll get there. George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino, who also wrote the script, are great as Seth and Richie Gecko, the assassins. However, bear in mind that Cheech Marin goes on an inappropriate monologue where he using the p-word, and the one I'm talking about is about a woman's down-under. He uses it more than once, I think even more than 20 times. And that's the most I've heard it said in a movie. If you're offended by that, then this isn't the movie for you. Plus, it's really gory, and I"m talking gory, like body parts and guts. Still, it's a fun movie to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From Dusk Till Dawn is the original 'Grindhouse' Tarantino/ Rodriguez featurette, a film that feels like one person has created one half before the second guy just takes over and finishes things off in their own style. It is the perfect balance; Tarantino, who was best known for Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction at the time, begins the film with his crime fuelled tale of two lowlifes getting up to crime-driven no good before Rodriguez takes over to create an explosive finale which brings about an element of the guilty pleasure as violence, entertainment and convention round things off.Like most films penned by Tarantino, From Dusk Till Dawn begins in a road side location-come-diner (Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction and Natural Born Killers) and sees a perfect balance of terror, suspense, dry humour and that wonderful dialogue Tarantino is able to come up with when a local trooper delivers a story to a store owner about how he had a recent case of food poisoning. The immediacy of the two would-be lead characters is a jolt to the audience, foreshadowing the 'jolt' Tarantino will give us later on when he introduces elements of the uncanny at the strip club. But the terror of the hostage situation, the dry exchange between the store worker and one of the leads and the consequent exiting of the store as it goes up in flames is a one sequence example of the sort of cocktail Tarantino can fabricate in his screenplays, all demonstrated in the opening scene.The two leads are the Gecko brothers, Seth and Ritchie played by George Clooney and Tarantino himself, respectively whom are both on the run from American law enforcers following a bank robbery and a blood bath of an escape. This is something the trooper establishes happened, thus implanting a dangerous image of the brothers whilst they're off screen. What transpires is a brief journey through the desert, an incident with a hostage and then an acquiring of a motor-home thus enabling the brothers to get across the border camouflaged. When they do cross the border, it is the signal for the film to change gears and begin to mutate into something else but not without wonderful touches as applied by both writer and director.Initially, my eye is drawn to the casting and the twisting of the rules that entails, echoing the twisting of the genre the film will undergo at the strip club. Prior to From Dusk Till Dawn, Julliette Lewis and Harvey Keitel had played characters in Tarantino penned scripts; only they played Mallory Knox, the psychotic and deeply disturbed serial killer in Natural Born Killers while Kietel played Mr White and Winston Wolf in two separate Tarantino films. Their characters in this project are far more muted than in those films, with Kietel not even dropping an f-bomb despite being teed up to do so. On the contrary, Clooney is cast as Seth Gecko, a loose and rather aggressively criminal who will kill and maim without much second-thought and this goes against the role he was best known for at the time, that being as a character in the rather reserved TV series 'ER'.The scenes involving Gloria (Hillhouse), a hostage the Gecko's have taken, act as scenes prolonging both Tarantino's style as a writer and an establishing of character traits. The exchange between Gloria and Seth is brilliantly slick in its delivery and pacing whilst maintaining a distinct tone of menace that the film wants the brothers to continue to have. It also goes a long way to prolonging the trait Ritchie carries to do with sexually driven desires of malice towards women when he does what he does to Gloria and this in turn plants a seed in the audience's mind. So by the time the brothers have apprehended the Fuller family and Juliette Lewis' character has entered a room in a swimming costume, the audience is fearing the worst. Additionally, the actress that plays Gloria was Tarantino's acting coach and he's quite clearly, perhaps disturbingly so, cast her as the hapless female who has what happens to her, happen to her as a direct result of Tarantino's character.The Fuller family are indeed made up of Kate, Jacob (Kietel) and Scott (Liu); the latter of which wears a visual clue on his shirt in 'Assault On Presinct 13' as to the 'last stand' scenario the film will adopt later on. When everyone arrives at the Titty Twister club, Jacob says a prayer in the form of 'out of the pond and into the fire', again foreshadowing that entering this establishment is a big deal to the film and doesn't just act as a waiting spot. But the uncanniest of incidences follows Chet's (Marin) 'pussy' monologue at the end of which he leans over into the camera and, rather eerily so, utters an obscenity directly at us as we look up at him from ground level. It's a bizarre occurrence and for the film to suddenly break the fourth wall creates an uncanny sensation that all is perhaps not quite right with this place. Unfortunately, the tactic might be lost on most viewers due to the absurdity, and possible hilarity, of the preceding monologue.Once in the strip club, the film cools off for a while and becomes something entirely different, but something still thoroughly entertaining. There is a rather random five minute or so dance from Selma Hayek's 'Santanico Pandemonium', during which Tarantino gets to indulge in his 'fondness' for feet, a scene that he wrote for himself to partake in. Regardless, From Dusk Till Dawn remains a favourite of mine; on a film-making level and certainly on a guilty, more entertainment driven level.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seth Gecko (Oscar-Winner:George Clooney) and Richard Gecko (Oscar-Winner:Quentin Tarantino) are vicious low-lifes criminals on the run. Seth is a professional bank thief, who kills if he has to but his brother Richard is much more worse... he also rapes woman for pleasure. The Gecko Brothers are hoping to cross the Mexican boarder somehow but they decided to kidnapped three middle-class people by the name of the Fuller Family (Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis and Ernest Liu) on their RV. The Gecko Brothers are supposed to meet their contact at a seedy bar in Mexico in the middle of nowhere titled "From Dusk Till Dawn". The Gecko Brothers and The Fuller Family, they kidnapped... they are amazed what kind of bar it is. But those dancers, the bartender (Danny Trejo), the band or the sexy owner of the bar by the name of Santanico Pandemonium (Salma Hayek) are not what they seemed to be... they are actually Vampires. They prey on Truckers and Bikers to feed or to turn others into Vampires. While Seth lost his brothers, while nearly everyone in the bar turned into vampires. Now Seth, The Fuller Family and two other survivors (Fred Williamson &amp; Tom Savini) stay together to fight these creatures till dawn for survival.Directed by Robert Rodriguez (The El Mariachi Trilogy, Spy Kids Trilogy, The Faculty) made an entertaining cheesy Horror/Action film with plenty of amusing moments and over the top gore. Director Rodriguez and Screenwriter:Tarantino (Kill Bill Vol.1 &amp; Vol.2, Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs) certainly have fun with their casting choices. "From Dusk Till Dawn" is one of those movies, where the cast &amp; crew truly seems to be having one hell of a time making this drive-in style movie. Tarantino certainly has an ear for terrific dialogue, especially during the first half of the movie. Which it is totally different from the second half. Although a minor box office disappointment and the critics give this mixed reviews... "From Dusk Till Dawn" went on to be a Cult Classic on Video.DVD has an sharp non-anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. Disc one has an enjoyable commentary track by Rodriguez and Tarantino, two featurettes (One of them has Commentary with Rodriguez and Make-Up Effects Artists:Greg Nictero) and more. Disc two has an very entertaining documentary titled "Full Till Boogie", an fun behind the scenes look with the cast &amp; crew.The Alliance Blu-ray has an sharp anamorphic (1.78:1) transfer and an terrific DTS 5.1 HD Sound. But sadly, the disc has no special features. "From Dusk Till Dawn" went on to produced two prequels with Rodriguez, Tarantino and Lawrence Bender involved as Executive Producers. But nothing tops the original... it is certainly one of the most remembered Cult Classic films of the 1990's. Don't miss it. Some familiar faces like Cheech Marin, John Saxon, Kelly Preston and more appears in bit parts. Although Marin plays three different characters in the movie. (****/*****).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Definitely paving the road that Tarantino should have gone down, "From Dusk Til Dawn" is one of my all time favorite movies. Amazingly badass opening scene. From there, the way the script flows is amazing; all the characters mesh well. Keitel, Liu and Lewis play a family kidnapped by Tarantino and Clooney (yes George Clooney) in a fantastic duo: the Gecko brothers, two criminals on the run to El Rey, Mexico. They rendezvous at an open-all-night nudie bar and it turns out to be a haven for vampires. Despite the fact that they are technically vamps, I still classify "From Dusk Til Dawn" as a zombie film. It's gory, it's violent it's funny and it's grimy.I can't believe George Clooney is so cool in this. Why he didn't make more films like this, one can only guess. He makes a great low-life, intelligent criminal. Also, I wish Richard was a bit more likable. Why Tarantino made that character such a sicko is beyond me.All in all an awesome horror flick that seems to never get old. I wish Quentin and Robert still made em like this! 8 out of 10, kids.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rarely feel the need to write reviews of movies on IMDb only when I'm extremely conflicted about a film. This one certainly qualifies I had always herd about the film but never knew much about it only that it had something to do with Vampires which is odd since I consider myself a great appreciator of Tarantinos work.From the first few frames I knew it had something to do with Tarantino and 2 minutes into the dialog I had no doubt that he wrote it. The first half of the movie plays out flawlessly just as you would expect a Tarantino screenplay to do and Rodrigeuz does some wonderful directing and editing which compliments Tarantinos writing beautifully. Then suddenly without warning your slammed over the head with beyond over the top Rodriguez style 'zombie exploding' gore akin to planet terror and your wondering how someone could have snuck into your living room and changed the DVD without you noticing. The blood and puss bath is followed by Tarantinos one of a kind dialog and most thoughts of ending the film there have subsided. But your still left with the initial shock of the sudden about face from respectable film in the same league as Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs to a film thats so gore oriented its difficult to take seriously until after the film has ended and you've been able to vent about it on IMDb.Don't get me wrong I still love this film and enjoyed it immensely even though its ripe with continuity errors and it almost becomes a different film half way through you would still be an idiot to turn it off at that point. There's still Tarantinos extremely human characters in very extraordinary circumstances and a great story around that. And to be fair the gore does allow some very clever comic absurdity as only Rodriguez can provide but its taken far beyond the level needed and if it were more restrained this film would have a 9 not a 7 on IMDb, have an audience drawn in by topnotch film making not exploding corpses and would be a very brilliant film rather then a very good film.</fullReview>

No witty anecdotes or Ebert like apologies for enjoying Zohan and The Mummy.The script is great, full of one liners and dialog you just suck up. I enjoyed the opening sequence a lot too. We are introduced to Seth and Richie Gecko, a pair of bank robbers and insane? rapists. After Richie "accidentally" kills a hostage they have to get new ones to sneak them across the border.They get across the border but when they do they run into a bit of trouble with some bloodsuckers.7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Would have made a Great B-Movie!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a proud lover of B-Movies or Lower A-movies. I love the quirky humour the old fashioned and lower quality special effects and the over exaggerated plot lines.I believe this movie is a cult classic and the only reason i can think off is that it is one of the cheesiest of movies these so called cult movie fans will ever see.It has all the makings of a classic B-Movie the quirky characters, the misplaced humour in the awkward situations, the humour in the fighting scenes etc etc.The movie does have the trademark styles of both Tarantino and Rodriguez though such as the Mexican setting and the untimely killings.The acting of the movie is top-notch and is probably the only thing that is not b-movie like as even the character artistes are not bad actors and often recognisable faces (check out the person in 3 different roles).Some of the characters especially the Sex-machine was hilarious.Also the music is good but then again its the best part of many b-movies.The pace of the movie moves along perfectly and its almost a shock (and a very pleasant one )even though you know that it has to happen when the fight with the vampires start.Which is where the worst and the best part of the movie is . I can see the humour, i can see the quirkiness but i can see why some parts especially the plot inconsistencies have to be so stupid.I've given this movie a low rating only because even though i enjoy b-movies i only watch them for free on TV and i paid good money on this one.If its coming on TV don't change the channel or better try getting the DVD(for free) from someone.</fullReview>

Tarantino plays one fine psycho! The casting for the whole movie was superb and the action, although a bit far fetched, was great. No chance of falling asleep during this one! Salma Hayek is one of the most beautiful women in the world, and her "non-striptease striptease" was out of this world! What a body, and does she know how to shake it!

		<fullReview>Robert Rodriquez proved that he could work with bigger budgets when he remade his debut film El Mariachi as Desperado. Now he has even more money, but he lets From Dusk to Dawn get buried under the special effects. Based on an early script by Quentin Tarantino, it gets off to a nastily amusing start. Two murdering brothers, Seth (George Clooney) and Richard (Tarantino) Gecko, yes, as in the lizard, are trying to get across the Mexican border after several bloody encounters. They hijack Jacob (Harvey Keitel), a lapsed minister, and his kids, who are on a camping trip in their RV. Once south of the border, the group heads for the rowdy rendezvous point, a remote, all-night bar called the Titty Twister. Here, DUSK gets wierd. The bikers and strippers who hang out at the Titty Twister turn out to be bloodthirsty vampires and the Kurtzman, Nicotero &amp; Berger EFX Group takes over. The body parts start to fly, and the blood spurts skyward like a Texas gusher. The splatter grows repetitive and monotonous, lacking the gruesome wit of Sam Raimi's demented classic, Evil Dead 2. After all, how many melting heads can you watch? Keitel is terrific in a subdued portrayal, while support is provided by Cheech Marin (in three roles!).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From Dusk Till Dawn is a kick-ass, rock-n-roll horror flick. It's also entertaining as all hell, starting off as a tale of two criminals, the Gecko brothers, who have just busted out of jail, pulled a bank job, and are headed for the border. It has the making to be a great action/crime thriller and then, out of nowhere, vampires start coming out of the woodwork and the s**t hits the fan. And when the s**t hits the fan, the s**t hits the fan! It's not quite what I expected from Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino. I expected a smart, edgy Pulp Fiction-esque horror film. What I got was a big budget gorefest. It's truly unbelievable. I had lost all faith in Hollywood horror but this was a godsend; Body parts fly, eyeballs explode, blood gushes everywhere, and "anyone can die at any time" to quote Joe Bob Briggs. Two of the biggest names in Hollywood (Rodriguez and Q. T.) turned into kids in a candy shop when they got there hands into horror. And the product of that was a mean motor scooter of a movie with an A-list cast. George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino define cool. Harvey Keitel is always great and Juliette Lewis...well Juliette Lewis still gets on my last nerve. The supporting cast is awesome, including Salma Hayek, Danny Trejo, Fred Williamson, Michael Parks, Kelly Preston, and even horror veteran John Saxon. Cheech Marin takes on three roles in the film: a border patrol officer, a vampire, and a Mexican crime boss. His speech is a classic, you'll know what I mean. With all these great names, make-up and effects master Tom Savini still scored the best part in the movie: Sex Machine, the fearless vampire killer with his bull-whip and back-flips. Let me get back to the gore for a minute. This is a gorehounds dream come true. The non-stop gore onslaught doesn't start until an hour in, but it's well worth the wait. There are plenty of scenes that are unforgettable, but the coolest part has got to be the vampire band. It's a crude and cool horror film that you have to see to believe. From Dusk Till Dawn can be summed up in one word: fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*May Contain Some Mild Spoilers* From Dusk Till Dawn was a great movie. The acting here was brilliant including Harvey Keitel, George Clooney, Quentin Tarantino, Juliette Lewis, and Salma Heyak. Okay, this movie was REALLY, and I don't mean just plain really, but REALLY bloody and gory, but I guess that's what you get from most vampire movies. From Dusk Till Dawn is about Jacob Fuller (Harvey Keitel) and his daughter (Juliette Lewis), and son (Ernest Liu). They are traveling along Texas, and at the same time the two thiefs the Gecko brothers, Seth (George Clooney) and Richard (Quentin Tarantino) are also traveling, and when they meet, they take them hostage, but when they enter Mexico, they are bound for a wild bar, that is full of vampires, and they are very, very hungry. This movie has non-stop action and will keep you highly entertained. The beginning was a little slow, but as the story moves on, it gets better. I give From Dusk Till Dawn a 10 out of 10!!!! :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like Marmite, you love it or hate it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just to make clear to anyone who has not heard of marmite, it is a sandwich spread which tastes like an ashtray, hence my hatred for marmite. Now comparing Marmite to this movie has its reasons. Having read the reviews on this movie, it seems that half of you love the movie and the other half despises this movie. I have to agree with the latter half.This movie is just a waste of time, space and money. The point of having two directors in a movie is to compliment each other, but watching this film, the differences are glaring and annoying. I was appalled at Tarintino's involvement in this movie. After making some timeless classics, like Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, he lands a big flop like this. Harvey Kietel, George Clooney and Juliette Lewis should have washed their hands at this movie. The only saving grace of this movie, is the seductive strip by the volputous Salma Hayek. The beginning started of like it would be a great movie. Two psychotic brothers on a killing spree, kidnaps a family and travels to Mexico. From this point onwards the movie plummets like the shares in Railtrack. They go into a stripclub, where surpisingly enough, it is a hideout of the beloved creatures of the night,Vampires. Except gore gore gore and of course not forgetting gore. Boring, tedious and really could have done better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Damn, I am really ashamed of what I will have to say. But it's a fact. Man, we could have a new "Desperado", we cold have another gun-slinger jewel from Robert Rodriguez. But this isn't so. Because of half an hour of disappointment. I will just say this, the movie is truly great until they get into that damn bar. Then it's just downhill, and I wonder why script-writer Tarantino did it like so. Because the movie is too cool from the start. Brothers Seth and Richie Gecko are famous bank-robbers and are on the run. They are responsible for a truck-load of deaths, and they have to escape. They choose the family of priest Jacob Fuller to accomplish it. The showcase of Tarantinian trademark dialogue is genius, with many fantastic dialogue to show in the respective quote section. As I said before, the movie is really a great movie until they get to that bar, where all hell breaks loose (literally). The makers of this movie should really have a fetish for B-Movies, since all I can say is that they really made it like so, and I am talking about everything, even the special effects. You'll see for yourself, but you are warned: when they cross that door, the movie gets really B-Grade, and never recovers. A half-disappointment, half-novelty item, on the first project between pals Rodriguez and Tarantino.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love Tarantino, I love Robert Rodriguez and yes I love this movie! Tarantino stars with George Clooney, Harvey Keitel and Juliette Lewis. Clooney and Tarantino play criminals on the run who kidnap a family and use their motor-home to get them into Mexico. They are to meet a guy called Carlo in a bar called the Tittie Twister, the family are to stay with them through the night after which they will be let go. Everything goes to plan until everyone in the bar turns into vampires! The story may well sound cliched but trust me, if you like horrors with a humorous script you gotta see this movie! All the main characters acting is superb, I must especially mention Tarantino who gets a lot of bad press for his acting ambition, he makes an excellent pyscho. One of my all time favourites, I am usually strict with my scores, but i must give this a 10!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is not a cross over between B and A movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently saw Full Tilt Boogie, a documentary on making this particular flick and it did not really shed any new light from seeing the movie itself. I can see from it that Academy Award winner Quentin Tarantino is a fowl mouthed and minded egotistical child not dissimilar to much of the crew but my opinion of him aside here goes.The idea that they strongly state is that you get to know the characters very well before the turning point of the story and then they start killing them off. That concept is not a bad one but that is the only thing separating this from B gore flick grade. The vampires look and act 100% fake not to mention putrid and sickening. The gore is completely off the wall and occasionally inconsistent and the plot has one major hole. That being that much could have been prevented if they had just applied a cross to the door, not gone out and hoped for the best. They try for a deeper character exploration with the Gheko brother and in actuality the relationship for the time it lasts is strong. The refencing of the bible and religion is either insulting or redeeming. A priest has lost not his faith in but his love for God and his savior Jesus, which he evidently gets back after Holy water is successfully made. I didn't actually see it coming but that is an objective view of a priests importance.Basically the makeup is terrible, the story is predominantly shoddy and the gore is unjustifiedly bad, how could they have ever hoped for a hit with this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview> My mom wouldn't let me see this in theartre's. She said all it was was nude woman, lots of gore, and a weird little man named Quentin Tarantino. I wonder if she new those were the reasons I wanted to see the movie. It didn't bug me too much though, she lightened up. I went to go see it and was totally in awe of the screen. Quentin Tarantino is my favorite director of all time. But I'm happy he let Robert Rodriquez direct because Robert is my favorite action film director (next to John Woo). The opening scene is probably the best opening scene that Tarantino has ever written, and that is a lot. It was done in such style that I would've been happy if the film would have ended right there. The acting is very strong for a little B film. I guess that made it even more fun to watch. George Clooney made a great choice doing this because ut showed he could do more than just ER. And I really don't have any problem at all with Quentin Tarantino's acting. I thought he was perfect for the roll of Ritchie. And Harvey Keitel was great as the moral center of the film. Some people might have a problem with the extremely excessive amount of gore, I don't. But the violence is done in such a way that it is so extravagant that it seems unreal, so don't take it seriously. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two Half-movies, One Great, the Other Lame and Hackneyed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film in the theatre, after seeing the previous Tarantino films. I'm still a big fan of his work, but this film was a major disappointment.It opens beautifully, in classic Tarantino style. George Clooney performs masterfully in his role. Although I was disappointed with the film itself, it made me a quick fan of Clooney. The story develops strongly, with some classic lines and scenes delivered by all.They arrive at the bar, and we get to see nearly all of the volcanic body belonging to Salma Hayek. Then things go horribly wrong. The developments in the first half of the movie are categorically ignored and tossed aside, and the film becomes a pathetic and unoriginal B horror film. The Goonies or Lost Boys, but without the young-people's-movie charm. I remember thinking, "Okay, the momentum's dropped off, but it'll pick up. It has to." It doesn't. So disappointing. The movie finishes predictably, and I was left with the feeling that I got only half a movie for the ticket price.I would recommend catching the first half of the film on cable or DSS, just for the on-the-money tarantino dialog and action. When things go awry in the bar, you are free (and encouraged) to commence channel surfing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched this film for the about twentieth time. And I have to say that I am not a horror or splatter fan. Fried Green Tomatoes and Forrest Gump are at the same rank in my "best-film-book". I first watched it because of Quentin Tarantino and Clooney. It also had excellent critics here (it seems not in the US). So my expectations were big but became perfectly fulfilled. Great, funny dialogues by Quentin Tarntino who also is giving his best performance. And Harvey Keitel and Juliette Lewis are great as always.But From Dusk Till Dawn is George Clooneys film. He is the incarnation of coolness. This word was surly invented for having a word to characterize him perfectly. It doesn't matter if Seth is talking, drinking, fighting or even paling. It is always fun to watch him. He never was better and I am glad he got this role. Otherwise we wouldn't have become the pleasure to see him in such films as Out Of Sight.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been a fan of Robert Rodriguez since I saw Desperado. I had also seen a few Quentin Tarantino films Jackie Brown, Reservoir Dogs and True Romance. So, imagine my surprise when the plot suddenly turns from two criminals escaping the law to a bar becoming a feeding ground for vampires. However, this just makes the film even more original. George Clooney proves he is a good actor in this film and Tarantino plays the perfect homicidal maniac. Salma Hayek once again pleases the male audience without removing all of her clothes! Some of the one liners are also entertaining. Check out the listing on this site especially Cheech Marin as he stands outside the brothel advertising the "products" available.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Salma Hayek as a vampire ? WOW !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had never considered seeing any Quentin Taratino movies until I saw the previews for this one.It blew me away ! Most of you may want to fast-forward through the Gecko Brothers opening, but I think the movie really starts when Cheech Marin is calling guys into the strip joint in one of the numerous roles he plays in this movie.No,that's not right,I think it REALLY starts when Salma Hayek comes out wearing a snake {oh,to have been that lucky snake}.The rest of the movie is just fodder with nudity, swearing,violence and computer special effects.As a vampire movie,this film is the bomb.As a Clooney film,it's so-so.I'd only watch it for Salma's scenes.</fullReview>

The first half isClooney and Tarentino as desperate, sociopathic criminalson the lam and letting nothing get in their way. The Vampireangle is periphial. I liked this movie for all its weaknesses.

		<fullReview>Not a film to be taken too seriously, but a hell of a lot of fun to watch. This was Tarantino's first screenplay (first one he wrote, not first one put to film) and there's a reason for it's existence; Tarantino believed that he would get, at most, one shot at being a success in films (being a nobody working at a video rental store in LA at the time) and as such he needed to get "everything" in there. So he throws his whole wad into it; tense psychological suspense, extreme violence, vampires, hot chicks, great dialogue, and lots and lots of humor. As has been mentioned previously, it seems like two films in one. The first "film" is about the psychotic Gecko brothers, and their bloody attempt to get across the Mexican border and away from the law. The second "film" is an over-the-top vampire flick with all the cliches. Tarantino and Rodriguez are long time friends, and Quentin agreed to let him film the screenplay so long as he could play the really twisted Gecko brother. Taken as a whole, this film is the cinematic equivalent of a full-course meal... creepy, NBK-type violence at the beginning, over-the-top comedy at the end, with George Clooney, Harvey Keitel &amp; Juliette Lewis providing surprisingly top-notch performances. Salma Hayek is nothing short of spectacular because she does what she does best, which is eye candy with precious little acting. Anyone who's enjoyed anything written or directed by Tarantino should find plenty to enjoy in this film... however, this is not a film that stands up to critical analysis. It was not intended to win an Oscar, it was merely supposed to give Quentin further work in the film business... and it succeeded admirably.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was never a fan of the horror movie genre, but when I found out Quentin Tarantino wrote the script, I had to at least give this one a chance. Well, Tarantino does not disappoint. Clooney throws of his OR scrubs for a dark jacket and a gun and does it brilliantly. In the mold of Samuel L. Jackson's performance in Pulp Fiction, Clooney's character is cool, smart, and mean. Tarantino, whose acting is normally lacking, provides the perfect foil to Clooney as his derranged, quiet, and surprisingly violent brother. Harvey Keitel busts out the star power in his subtle role as a preacher kidnapped by the pair. The movie seems to be written in two parts. One is a wonderfully written crime story and the second half is when you see these well written characters battle the forces of evil. The transition between the two parts is abrupt but effective. Once in the bar that becomes the hellish den of vampires, Tarantino keeps the dialogue real and brings a sense of disbelief and determination that is absent in most horror films. This along with the original Evil Dead has shown me that horror films don't have to be terrible. It is nice to see a talented writer like Tarantino breathe life into this tired genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The man who brought us Desperado, The Faculty, and El Mariachi brings an action/horror film like no other. From Dusk Till Dawn tell the story of Seth and Richard Gecko (George Clooney,Quentin Tarantino) brothers in crime, on the run from the FBI and Texas rangers. They're heading toward Mexico when they met up with a family on vacation (Harvey Keitel,Juliette Lewis,Ernest Liu). They take the family hostage and head down to a bar where the Geckos will met a friend who has all the things they need. But upon entering the bar and having a few drinks they realize they're in deeper than ever thought. This is the film that brought George Clooney to the superstar status. He's cool, violent, and one person that should not to be messed with. You're in awe of him the entire film. Quentin is goofy, quiet, and sick. He's perfect as Clooney's annoying little brother. Keitel doesn't do too much and it works. He's a father that truly cares about his kids and will do anything for them. Lewis is sassy, funny, cute and can kick butt. She should do more action films. The girl has star power. This film is up there with Dead Alive and Starship Troopers as one of the bloodiest films of all time. There is extreme violence, lots of gore, and tanker trucks full of blood. Robert Rodriguez out does himself with this one. He made gunfights look cool in Desperado and makes the undead looks cool in this film. From Dusk Till Dawn is one bloody action extravaganza that thrills you one minute and grosses you out the next. Run, don't walk and rent this film. It's amazing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say this is not a great film. Its not as good as Desperado, Pulp Fiction, and Resevoir Dogs as an example of great directing,writing, and acting. However, the cast and directors seemed like they had fun. George Clooney was the same as he is in most of his movies, I happen to like him as an actor so that didnt bother me any. I didn't like Quintin Tarantino much, in my opinion he belongs behind the camera not in front. Harvey Keitel was good also, the rest of the cast was well picked and did a good job, especially Fred Williamson. There is a good bit of humor and gore. Not much of a scary movie. As every movie that doesn't take it self seriously it has its flaws. But overall i must say this is worth it. And on a boring summer day it is well worth the $2.99 you would pay to rent it.</fullReview>

The script is always on top form as it was written by the Reservoir Dogs/Pulp Fiction scribe Quentin Tarantino. As always, Rodriguez combines excellent character portrayals, neat camera shots and angles and Hong Kong-style action. The acting is most definitely up to scratch, especially from George Clooney and Harvey Keitel. Tarantino also has a large acting part as Clooney's psychopathic brother. A full 10/10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seeing something new I wish for something able to amaze me. Why this? Because I've seen a lot of films (3,000?) and so, after many years of cinema I have often the sensation to have seen everything is possible. One evening, some months ago, my wife went to theatre and I was alone at home. The remote control was finally only mine and I spent 2 or 3 hours looking for something interesting: nothing, as usual. I was hardly thinking to my bed when the face of George Clooney fill up my TV.....interesting......there is another man on the car.....QUENTIN!!! what happens? I'm alert like a cricket, now. Now the film begins and I want to look at it. Only an advice: prepare your drinks before the beginning, if you wake up during the film it's possible that you return on your sofa and you think: "Oh God, MY film is finished and THIS is another one".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>* * * (3 out of 5)Cartoonish horror spoof and B-movie salute, mostly memorable for late and sudden change into corny (and silly) gore. Produced and co-written by Quentin Tarantino but directed by friend and colleague Robert Rodriguez, From Dusk till Dawn is self-aware 90s genre crunching as seen through the very eyes of Tarantino (who also has a supporting role). Strictly to be regarded as such too.A stylistic homage with many honorable mentions and artistic nods - most notably to George Romero (originator of the zombie movies), John Woo (elaborate scenes of violence), John Carpenter (the godfather of modern day B-movies) and even Tarantino himself (look for the Kahuna Burgers from Pulp Fiction at the motel) - that comes across more like a boys-with-toys extravaganza than as any typical hip noir Tarantino effort.Both trademark directorial styles are present: the first half plays (somewhat) like a regular self-indulgent Tarantino gangster movie (as in Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown and Reservoir Dogs), while the last half is El Mariachi or Desperado by way of tongue-in-cheek Evil Dead. Packed with famous faces - Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis, Tom Savini, Salma Hayek, George Clooney and Cheech Marin - some of which seem oddly out of place (Keitel), while others are clearly having the time of their life (Cheech Marin of the Cheech &amp; Chong movies).The opening sequence is charmingly atmospheric - a superb Michael Parks as Texas Ranger Earl McGraw buying Jack Daniels at Benny`s World of Liquor - yet promises more than the movie ever delivers. It wrongly oozes the familiar Tarantino vibe only to abruptly abandon it and literally splatter all over the place.George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino portray the outlaw brothers and men-in-black hoodlums Seth and Richard Gecko. Packing impressive silver hardware that goes boom, dressed in immaculate "Reservoir Dog"-ish suits and riding a dusty and overly thick-wheeled Cougar, the horrors of their crimes (blatant murder, rape and kidnapping to name a few) are never completely believable. The brothers casually blast their way through Texas and seem more like cartoon super heroes than actual bank robbers with a purpose.Seth is the smart, cool and decisive one (Clooney), while Richard is the nerdy and geeky brother who continuously makes a point out of killing innocent people. Due to his unstable psyche we learn. Uh huh.The story here is George Clooney. An actor of intelligent charisma despite a flood of raw sexual appeal. He is suave, calm and given some ridiculously cool dialogue ("Okay, I want him out of here, in his car, and down the road or you can change the name of this place to Benny's World of Blood."). Clooney went on to other and better roles (forget Batman &amp; Robin) after the success of From Dusk Till Dawn, but it was this performance that completed his transition from the shadows of TV (the series ER) to big screen fame and credibility.We are also treated to another memorable performance by Tarantino (he also starred in Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs). Memorable for all the wrong reasons. His acting - or lack of it - is nearly a disaster. Pretentious and downright embarrassing in parts, it can only be deemed completely amateurish. In sharp contrast to his directorial skills it heavily taints the flow of the movie.However; From Dusk Till Dawn contains a couple of scenes that keep your eyes peeled (the before mentioned opening sequence and a seductive dance by Salma Hayek are two major standouts) - not forgetting the meticulous Oliver Stone-Light direction and editing of the end sequence where everything and everybody is either exploding, burning or bleeding. Tarantino and Rodriguez actually keep things entertaining and enough sparks flying around throughout.Watch for the snappy dialogue (Seth: "Now, is my s**t together, or is my s**t together?" Richard: "Your s**t is forever together!"), the stylish camera angles (as in filming through the bullet wound in Tarantino's hand) and the awesome Mexican inspired biker-bar soundtrack (ZZ Top, Robert Rodriguez himself and more) and you just might - just might - witness the scale on your "Cool-O-Meter" go up.</fullReview>

What our heroes don't know is that the club isreally a nest for bloodthirsty vampires!

Clooneyis just awesome as the sinister Seth, while Harvey Keitel makesan effective performance as spike-shoving preacher Jacob. FredWilliamson, Tom Savini (check out his "special weapon"!), JulietLewis, and Danny Trejo make fine supporting acts. But I thinkthe main flaw of this flick is Tarentino's performance. He wasso annoying with his whiny complaints to his brother, and Ihated is sick personality as well! I was glad he was killed off!

Admittedly the plot is a little far fetched, but it makes enough fun of itself that you can laugh at it easily. The main thing I noticed about this film was the acting. It would have been easy to lose sight of acting amidst the sex, violence and gore, but for me it shone through the guts as glory. George Clooney delivers one of the best performances if not the best that he has shown on the silver screen, and he was well backed up by Tarantino, Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis and Cheech Marin (3 in 1 guy). Good performances by Danny Trejo, the delectable Salma Hayek, and the biker guy made this a really fun ride. Clooney's delivery of his many one liners was superb, truly excellent. The fight scenes were also well done, although as mentioned already the splatter was a little over the top in places. However the acting, great sets and costumes, and a willingness not to take itself too seriously make this a fine film, and definitely one to see (for those over 18). 7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Man, this is just what horro fans wanted. Like any other Tarantino film, this one respectively winks and nods to the past, but rockets ahead to new directions. Cliches could, in this situation, come out of every scene, but don't. For instance, in the scene after the big bar room brawl, the heroes are discussing vampires. Instaed of saying "Oh, I don't believe in vampires," they get right down to the point and come to terms with it. Robert Rodriguez's guirella-style film making is great here, with a high-budget. The actors really do a good job, too. The special effects crew are really allowed to go all out here in the fight scenes. It was also nice seeing special FX guru Tom Savini make an appearence. His role, especially when he is in a fight scene, reminded me of his biker role from Dawn of the Dead. I'm glad this has found a well-deserved home on video. It deserves it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Double Feature!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film reminds me of the double features they had in cinemas of the 50s. The 'A' movie is a stylish heist/kidnapping movie, where two brothers on the run from the law highjack a camper van and order it's owners to take them across the border to Mexico. The script is so obviously by Tarintino, and he and Clooney have a great time looking cool while Keitel and his 'children' flex their acting muscles. When they arrive at a bar after avoiding the police, the 'B' movie begins. This involves about 45 minutes of chaotic gore, where vampires, bats and satanic rats terrorise the leads and any biker who has wandered into the 'Titty Twister.' But why?I admit, that this twist is totally unexpected (if you don't read the box) but the vampire section is poorly done and seems to be there just to give the special effects guys a job. Limbs fly, blood gushes, but you spend the time wondering what the script writers were thinking when they wrote this. I look forward to a director's cut when the Gecko brothers finish their drinks and leave in the morning, relatively un-bitten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How the hell did they do that?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"From Dusk Till Dawn" brings a new meaning to the phrase "twists and turns in a film. It still amazes and bewilders me to this day how instantaniously a film could change. The film begins with an over the top shootout in a party store, and comes off as, well, an over the top comedy. Much like "Pulp Fiction", it follows the lives of two vicious, violent criminals, yet the experience is fun because of the witty dialogue. This film has what you could expect from a Quentin Tarantino film: violence, wicked hilarity, and a B-movie feel. The two criminals, Seth and Richard Gecko(played by George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino) take a preacher(Harvey Keitel) and his two children(Juliette Lewis and Ernest Liu) hostage so they can get across the border and into Mexico. There, they will rendezvous with their boss and get their money at a bar called "Titty Twister". All the way through that, the movie is a comedy, constantly making fun of the situations with the dialogue and the ridiculous violence(Quentin Tarantino's hand has a hole shot in it you can see through). There, they enter the titty bar, where chicks and strippers...well, you get the idea. "This is my kinda place!" says Seth, and I doubt the audience can't agree more. After we see enough strippers, the "most evil" stripper comes out to do her dance for the audience. Pretty cool, huh. What follows is the most shockingly instantanious, 180 degree turn I have ever seen in a film in my life. The stripper leans her head back, and morphs into a vampire. At that instant, the film has changed from a hilariously over-the-top comedy to a full blooded horror film. Now we are into over-the-top gore and violence, and although the film still maintains some sort of humor, it's clear to the viewer that we are not watching the same movie anymore. That instant change left me dumbfounded and truly scared, because I was not expecting it and I no longer knew where this film was going. It is probably one of the most brilliant moves in film history! Tom Savini has a role as one of the vampire killers, and eventually, a vampire. His presence here is perfect because of his background in doing the effects and gore for horror films(he also played a similar role in George A. Romero's "Dawn of the Dead"). I liked "From Dusk Till Dawn" because of it's wit and it's truly original move, yet I am still shaken by it and can't believe that a film could change from one film to the next so instantaniously. Not for the squeamish, I'll tell you that. It's been a while since I've seen a movie this gross and gory. However, if you like Quentin Taratino movies, or just like horror movies, then you'll love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm watching the movie right now, and it's a funny gore flick. Interesting idea, people like those at the bar "living" on bikers and truck drivers - I mean, who'd miss them? Satisfying amounts of blood, gore and mindless violence is what the movie is about. And this leads me to the downside of the movie. Because afterwards, it's "So what?" It's just another splatter movie, interesting only because it's a Tarantino movie. Personally, I think both Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction were MUCH better.6/10; it IS a good splatter movie.P.S. The movie's just finished, and I was right; So what?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To put it mildly, this movie isn't for everyone. It's full of graphic violence, strong language, and topless women. With all that in mind, I find it a real hoot!The important thing is, do not, under any circumstances, take it seriously. Just sit back, relax, and have fun with it. Show it at a party, perhaps. Make sure you're in the right mood. I cannot overemphasize how awesome the cast is. Tarantino isn't much of an actor, but he's great fun here. My favorite scene is when he's hallucinating that Juliette Lewis' character is coming on to him, saying something unprintable here-how I wish I could type it! George Clooney and Harvey Keitel come off best. They play their roles as seriously as possible, as a hilarious counterbalance to the pervading goofiness. And you know what? They actually make us care what happens to them!Overall: pretty cool, although even I thought it was a bit much in parts-but that's an intended effect. Movie Fun Fact: Cheech Marin plays three roles. (And George Cloony gets an awesome line at the end!)Rating: *** (out of ****)D: Robert Rodriguez108min/Released by Dimension Films</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've always been a sucker for road/killer/horror/vampire movies, so when a movie contains all four then I'm as happy as a pig in s*#t! Of course it's even better when the movies cast contains actors of the calibre of George Clooney, Quentin Tarantino, Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis and the very sexy Salma Hayek in a delicious and highly sensual cameo appearance. The movie itself starts off as a road movie with Clooney and Tarantino as bank robber/killers who are on the run from the police. Things change for the pair after they enlist the aid of a preacher (Keitel) and his two children (including daughter Juliette Lewis) to get across the border to their rendezvous at the Titty Twister biker bar. What happens from that point is pure fun, and as long as your not the squeamish kind you should find the movie highly entertaining. Put simply the film isn't going to win an oscar, neither should it be taken seriously, but if your into this kind of movie then it is definitely one not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Atmosphere Makes "FDTD" one of the best of it's kind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To call "From Dusk Till Dawn" a B-movie would be wrong, although many consider it to be. I've been a huge Tarantino fan since "Reservoir Dogs" came out on video, and an equally big Rodriguez fan. If you know these directors beyond their films, you might know that they both share a passion for B-movie westerns and shoot-em-up gangster flicks. It seems that they combined both genres to help create "From Dusk Till Dawn," which at times SEEMS like a B-movie, only to add to it's feel. I was probably very lucky to not know what this movie was about before I saw it, which is rare. Therefore I was in for the surprise of my life when it turned suddenly from an intense "fleeing robbers" tale to a semi-horror movie. The whole film, from the very beginning has an EXCELLENT feel of creepiness to it. The film is excellently directed by Rodriguez, equipped with one of the best opening scenes I can rememeber.(POSSIBLE SPOILERS) In the end, "From Dusk Till Dawn," is full of mystery in it's own way, with alot of questions for the viewer to ponder about the origins of the evil the Gecko brothers encountered, and the origin of the brothers themselves. I don't know about you guys, but those questions have always intrigued me. Maybe that's why "FDTD" has become one of my favorite movies since I first saw it in '96.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i remember the ads for this movie showing nothing but the vampire attack footage from the second half, so i can see how a lot of people sat through the first half wondering if they had walked into the wrong movie. basically. the first half is more of a crime movie in which the gecko brothers are trying to get through the mexico border and the texas rangers and fbi are hot on their tail. once they arrive in mexico they go to a rendezvous point which is a bar called the "titty twitser". after a stunning dance by the physically perfect Salma Hayek, all hell breaks loose and the movie then cranks into overdrive as an all out vampire/gore flick.does it work? for the most part yes. what makes it work are these are ordinary people who just happen to show up at a vampire bar. and the opening sequence in the liquor store ranks as one of my favorite scenes of all time.FYI-this movie is extremely gory (especially for an R rated movie) but i'm an admitted gore-hound so the more the merrier.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great twisted tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Probably one of the best and most innovative movies of the '90s - both from a cinematic angle and storywise. Yes it is based on a script by Tarantino and directed by Robert Rodriguez, both not easily accepted as 'high-art' directors and by the Academy. Who cares ? Just ask yourself as to how many times since Hitchcock's 'Psycho' has one seen a plot jerk as unexpectedly into a totally different vein as in this movie. For those who complain that a gritty gangster story suddenly turns into a fantastic horror saloon brawl - that is exactly what makes this movie so good. Its unexpected, catches you on the wrong foot, and rearranges all the set constellations from the first part of the movie. What else ? Great, tense and very memorable dialogues, eye-catching locations ( I just keep spotting new details in the Titty Twister every time I watch the movie ) and some fine acting ( yes, even Juliette Lewis. One does hardly ever have to gripe about Harvey Keitel, George Clooney or Cheech Marin. Tarantino himself is just looney.... And Salma Hayek is one sexy mistress of the night).Good music score, too - it greatly helps conveying the mood and speed of the individual scenes, without becoming bombastic or boring. Same about the camera work, including the flashbacks/hallucinations incurred by Tarantino's character, points of view for a lot of shots and the cutting.And even if you don't care about the incredible handiwork - it's just roaringly funny and dead-pan (check the quotes section !). Just be warned, that it is not meant for the easily insulted, sensitive and romantically inclined crowd - one has to be able to stand the gore, fantastic/horror aspects ( a friend of mine never got over the fact, that 'vampires' suddenly showed up in a 'gangster'-movie ) rough language and several crude jokes, so any artsy fans of Harvey Keitel will probably get the shock of their lives . Everybody will just enjoy it !' nuff said - go see it !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay this film is really strange. It starts off as a action type flick, with two brother criminals on the run. the steal a a van and take a family hostage and are on their way to mexico. When they get to mexico and to a bar called the titty twisters, all hell breaks lose when they find everyone are vampires at the bar. From there on it's a blood bath, with gore and violence every second. When making this film I don't think they were planning on keeping to the rules of killing vampires as many things were wrong in the movie if you listen to the other movies that is. I lived the dialogue in the movie like all Tarrntino movies have. i especially liked the Gecko brothers dialogue(especially Seth) and the owner of the titty twisters when they first arrived at the bar. Robert Rodriguez directing was a plus, with an all-star line up George Clooney, Harvey Kietel, Quentin Tarantino, Juliette Lewis, Salma Hayek make for a interesting watch. It's a very exciting watch, much like a rollercoaster with twists and turns everywhere. EVEN THOUGH IT WAS STRANGE I LOVED IT!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read the script of this film over the Internet before I actually saw the film. Tarantino is a master of making typically unrealistic scenarios, and turning them into very realistic (and often a very sharp edge) screen stories. Rodriguez does for directing what Tarantino does for writing. This movie is 105 minutes of light hearted, fast paced, disturbingly enjoyable sleaze. Great fun! Cloony shines playing the same character he always does, but finally in a role that would suggest that humorless demeanor he so often abuses. Tarantino plays the "sicko little brother" with such subtlty you go through the movie not resenting him at all. He brings a certain kind of innocence to the delusional, homicidal, rapist stereotype. This is one of those action/thrillers that truly has little running against it other than it's predetermined title of a B movie. Give it a chance, have some fun...</fullReview>

Harvey Keitel as the greatest preacher since Samuel L. Jackson in "Pulp Fiction." Did I mention Samla Hayek in a bikini? The world's greatest tequila bar (with the incredibly great name of "The Titty Twister"). All this, and the incredibly effective technique used to illustrate that Tarantino's character has killed a hostage (see the movie, and you'll understand - this movie is worth seeing for every film student in the land for just the timing and skill brought to this one sequence). Not to mention, Keitel. He's the soul and conscience of this movie, and has the coolest scenes known to man - one when he gets them into the bar, and the second in his response to Clooney needing a preacher.Don't want to give to much away, but you'll see what I mean. Clooney does a nice job that didn't get enough credit, and Juliette Lewis has some good moments herself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That's what I thought after I watched the film. What's it about? Is there a some kind of message in there? I actually quite liked it while I watched it, but then the end came. Clooney and Lewis on the parking lot before the Titty Twister, and the thinking set in. The film made absolutely no sense, and I don't think I will watch it again, which is probably the worst thing I can think of saying about a film. I know that a lot of people think of Quentin Tarantino as a good author--well, i don't believe he is. A good film script consists of roughly two parts--a plot and the dialogues. Tarantino is good on the latter, no doubt there, but none of his films have a really good plot. Pulp Fiction was a handful of filmed short stories thrown together, without much sense if they would fit together. From Dusk till Dawn was worse--the pulp-fiction-like first half and the vampire slaughter fest in the second just didn't fit together. At one point I thought I spotted some kind of message in this piece of crap--when Harvey Keitel's character revealed his loss of faith and had to believe to go out and fight the vampires, but Tarantino never worked it out. And the end I felt cheated--I have lost two hours of life which won't come back. There's nothing in this film i can recommend--not even the special effects were really good. They were technically OK, but the design was just crap, senseless, and not thought through, just like the rest of it.</fullReview>

George Clooney and Quentin Tarentino make a great team as Seth and Richie Gecko, a couple of ruthless bank robbers who, along with the Fuller family (led by Harvey Keitel, in a change of pace role for the former "Resevoir Dog"!) and a Vietnam vet named Frost (Fred Williamson), take on a bunch of blood-thirsty vampires, who one of them is portrayed by the ultra-sexy Salma Hayek. From then on, it's a long, gory fight to the death. Anyone in the mood for exploding guts and blood? &gt; &gt;Even though it's not completely scary, "From Dusk till Dawn" would make a great film to watch on Halloween night. Obviously, this movie ain't for little kids, but it's the ultimate treat for both horror and action fans.</fullReview>

This movie is extreme in every way, and definitely not for the faint-hearted. George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino are the Gecko brothers, a couple of criminals who are on the run, having killed several people in a bank robbery, and then a few more as they flee. Clooney's character is evil, to be sure, but only kills when it is *necessary;* Tarantino's character, on the other hand, is a sexual predator and killer who flies into rages and sometimes kills for no good reason. The pair stop at a seedy motel, run across a father (Harvey Keitel)and his two children (the daughter: Juliette Lewis) who stop at the motel, and take the three hostage, using their RV as cover to get across the border into Mexico. Clooney's character has arranged a rendezvous with some criminals in Mexico, who will get 30% of the money the Gecko's stole from the bank. The rendezvous point is an infamous bar out in the middle of nowhere: the Titty Twister, which is *open from dusk til dawn.* Once the brothers, with their hostages in tow, have bullied their way into the establishment, the action REALLY begins. Lets just say that the bar is not what it appears to be... For those who want high-energy, extreme entertainment, this is a great movie. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Age: 13Two criminal brothers, Seth and Richard Gecko, played by George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino, begin a crime spree driving through Texas, trying to get to Mexico where a man has promised them sanctuary in exchange for 30% of their stolen money. To ensure that they get across the border, they take a preacher named Jacob Fuller, played by Harvey Keitel, and his two children, played by Juliette Lewis and Ernest Liu, hostage. Once they get across the border, they go to a bar called the Titty Twister where they encounter vampires.From Dusk Till Dawn starts off promisingly enough, with the plot of the two brothers on a crime spree, which takes up the first half of the movie. Until the vampires come in, the movie is quite good, enjoyable, and it makes sense. The second half, however, when the vampire plot comes in just completely ruins the movie. They just go to a bar and there are vampires. The movie gives you no reason why they are there, what their origins are, or how they came to being. There is absolutely no plot in it, it is just killing, killing, and more brainless killing. Everything that had been accomplished in the first half of the movie, including its plot, is just thrown out the window and replaced by stupidity and violence. Why did they even bother with the first half's plot, when it is just going to be thrown away by the rest of the movie. I enjoy violent action films a lot, but I didn't even enjoy seeing these vampires being gunned down countless times. The whole second half of the movie is set in only two rooms, and one of them for only about 5 minutes. It would have been much better if they could have proceeded into the depths of the building to encounter the vampires. I wish they had made this into two movies. The first half's plot would have made for an impressive movie by itself, and if the second half's vampire plot had been stretched into one movie by itself, it may have had time to proceed into the depths of the building, explain where they came from and why they were there. Just think of all the talent wasted in this movie: George Clooney, Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis, Salma Hayek, Ernest Liu, Quentin Tarantino, and Robert Rodriguez. From Dusk Till Dawn just ends up being a stupid, disappointing film.Australian Classification: R 18+: Medium Level Violence, Horror ThemeRating: 38 out of 100</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First and foremost, "Dusk till dawn" is not a film for those averse to violence. This is a VERY violent movie. That said, it's also quite entertaining, provided you are prepared to put aside any preconceptions about the storyline. The story revolves around the exploits of two extremely nasty brothers (Clooney and Tarantino), who will stop at nothing to escape justice, following a bank holdup. There are seemingly senseless acts of brutality committed from the outset, which serves to build a sense of revulsion for these two. After highjacking a family as hostages and fleeing into Mexico, the pair arrive at a truckers bar where the whole story takes a major turn. It's at this point that most people will decide to either love or hate this film. I chose the former. I've watched the DVD a few times now, and find the image quality to be excellent, apart from slight over coloration. The audio is equally satisfying. Sadly, there are very few additional features on the DVD. In summary, I recommend this film to fans of the action/horror genre ... just be prepared to check your incredulity at the door. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Elaborate deaths, high caliber action, ultra violence. Hmm. Sounds like a Robert Rodriguez movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a movie like From Dusk Till Dawn, there are so many things that keep it alive, yet so many that bring it down. First, the bad stuff. Nearly everyone of Quentin Tarantino's characters is mean, cold hearted and down right nasty. The movie leaves you with pretty much no one to relate to and/or feel for, so, consequently, when somebody dies, you don't really care. There is no emotion involved. Without a doubt, the only reason to feel bad when someone died was because they were too cool or pretty, or had too good of make-up and you didn't want to see that go to waste. Now, if you are a violence maniac, like myself, this movie will more than quench your thirst for it. There are some of the most complicated, elaborate, and gory deaths ever depicted on screen in this movie. Robert Rodriguez, the director, should be very proud of his work. Okay, so it won't win any directing, acting, or screen writing awards, but it's great fun anyway. And Quentin Tarantino's character is so remorse-less that it is sometimes painful to watch. Good writing, great role for George Clooney of ER, great direction, top notch action, copious violence, awesome gore, and superb entertainment. Don't miss it, especially the first vampire scene. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are looking for a serious movie, this is not for you...to the other 99% of us, this is one of the best movies in a long time. This movie had nudity, action, horror, drama, suspense, and some really good bathroom humor. tie that together with excellent visual scenes, and action reminiscent of The Lost Boys, and you have a great flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Mush Spawned Two Sequels?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a huge fan of Quentin Tarantino, I was expecting yet again a masterpiece. For the first half an hour or so, I was pleasantly surprised. (I wasn't aware of the plot so I was sure it was about two brothers on the run from the cops)As soon as Salma Hayek's dance had finished, myself and my younger brother could only watch, jaws wide open, as hundreds of vampires started to appear from nowhere. From then onwards, the film was absolutely terrible. It was so over the top, it was unbelievable. I couldn't understand how anyone could find it entertaining.(my best friend recommended it!) I felt so sorry for George Clooney(One Fine Day), Harvey Keitel(Resevoir Dogs), Juliette Lewis(The Basketball Diaries), Tarantino(Full Tilt Boogie), Salma Hayek(The Faculty) and Danny Trejo(Desperado-one of the best actors in the world) who starred in it, and Robert Rodriguez(The Faculty) who directed it. Please, if you have any common sense, you will not watch this. I still can't get over the fact that this poor attempt had two sequels. Rating=1/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I seen this movie I thought it was great, had violence, gore, sharp dialogue and Salma. I've watched this movie a countless number of times, I think its great if you don't feel like thinking to hard, its very straight forward and easy to follow. After I have seen it a couple of times I just jump straight to the part where they enter the bar (unless I feel like watching the whole thing). Also watch out for Cheech Marin, he has a very funny scene in front of the bar. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People, it's not Oscar-worthy material here, but you knew that, didn't you? I must say that I enjoyed this film. The reason why: Because I didn't take it serious. I just laid back and let the movie sweep me up. That's the key to enjoying this film. You MUST NOT take it seriously. I must say that you'll either love this film or hate it. There is no between. If you're one that's not easily offended and enjoy action and horror films, then this is the movie for you. But the graphic language and graphic violence may be too much for some viewers. What Tarantino has done is pay homage to the classic Italian horror films of the '70s and '80s. And he has done a very nice job of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's time to root for the bad guys!! With the attention-robbing first scene in the convenient store, this horror/dark comedy explodes into action. Not to mention the script which fits George Clooney's (The Peacemaker, ER) style of rapid, intimidating yet cool and laughable speech to a T. You need to walk into this movie with the expectation that this is not going to be a sweet movie to swallow. The rough language and gut-churning violence combine to make this a easily labeled "vulgar" movie. As mentioned before, the script is comical at times, giving the impression that it should be taken as all fun and games. Which it should. If you liked Desperado and Reservoir Dogs, as I did, then this should add nicely to a collection of anarchy!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really enjoying this film even though Cloony's fast and stupid mouth was beginning to grate at my nerves. I had settled down for a standard Tarantino affair from the outset and had been pleased by it all. Then the vampires came out of the closet. From then on i found this film plainly offensive. There was no further character development, and the fighting scenes were plainly incongruous nee ridiculous. It was nothing more than i would have expected from some cheap horror flick circa 1980.Did no one else get their senses aroused when the store was trashed at the beginning, or when the poor woman was killed after about 20 minutes? I did. Did you then also feel a lack of empathy for either the vampires or the slayers towards the end of the film? I did, and i felt that it was a blatant waste of a perfectly good build up in a film. Poor and disappointing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over the top and instantly forgettable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of Quentin Tarantino's earlier scripts, although this time he passes up directorial duties in favour of acting. The story really is simple - two bank robbers need to cross to Mexico, they kidnap a family and head to the meeting point, which is where the movie becomes an all out vampire action comedy. It's one of those films that is best viewed once only, and then forgotten. The highlight of the movie also happens to be the point that this movie of two-halves comes to life; a very erotic snake dance by Salma Hayek, who is so hot that the screen nearly melts.It's a dumb film, and the script has no pretensions to be anything else (take note of the Pu**y speech by the long-haired dude). Clooney is by far the best thing in it, giving a cooler than cool performance whereas Harvey Keitel seems miscast as the preacher without faith, and Quentin, well, the only time I've liked him as an actor was when he delivered that hilarious pi***ng joke in Desperado.There's gore aplenty, but sometimes the direction is pretty shoddy. Look at some of the scenes where Clooney is giving a mini-speech between bouts of vampire killing - in the background the vampires just seem to be wandering about without any purpose - it's quite cheesy really. If you want to see Clooney hamming it up, then look no further. If you're after something with brains, do not waste your time with this.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plotwise, it's shoddy, but--</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As for as plotline goes for "From Dusk Till Dawn," it's all pretty threadbare and nothing that hasn't been done before...and better. In fact, it can be summed up like this: two renegade brothers, one slicker than snot (George Clooney) and the other a homicidal maniac (Quentin Tarantino) kidnap a former preacher (Harvey Kietel) and his two kids (Juliette Lewis and Ernest Liu) in order to take their camper and flee to the Mexican border to escape the law. Stopping at a bar called the Titty Twister, they meet a trucker with an unusual gun (Tom Savini) and a fearless Vietnam vet (Fred Williamson), and together, the seven humans must battle bloodthirsty vampires who are in control of the bar.Predictable? You bet.There's not much to the plot. It's so cliched....so overused, that it doesn't really come across as anything exciting. But it is because of this fact that director Quentin Tarrintino is able to reveal his brilliance in filmmaking. His direction is moody and colorful--exactly what a vampire film needs-- with the monsters not even showing up until the second act, in Mexico. Therefore, because everyone knows this is a vampire flick, a lot of anticipation is built up. You want the vampires to show up, but you are also enthralled with the plotline that comes before it, setting all the stages up.The actors are also strong, as well as the characters that they portray. Not going too much into detail, this is exactly how characters from Pulp Fiction would respond if given the opportunity to fight undead monsters. Enough said. The three who come off the best are George Clooney, Quentin Tarantino, and Fred Williamson. Harvey Keitel also brings in his usual charm and Tom Savini of the Night of the Living Dead fame is interesting in a supporting role.But the best thing about this movie--and what separates it from other, better vampire movies is the vampires themselves. These are some of the most interesting ideas centered around vampires that I have ever seen. Never have they looked so horrifying or so nervewracking. With great gross-out special effects, this might be the first vampire film ever in which a vampire, having been shot with arrows and wounded, transforms into a giant, half slug-half dog and attempts to eat a human whole. It is absolutely amazing to watch, and I'm sure if Bram Stoker was alive, he would have watched it, rubbed his chin, and "Wow. Why didn't I think of that?"Also amazing is the ideas used to kill the vampires. It's the usual stake-in-the-heart routine, but Tarintino aims for outrageousness and hits the mark right on the head. The ideas they use to kill these guys--and the vampires themselves for that matter-- are so original--so imaginative-- that you no longer care that this movie is cliched....you just want to see what happens next.This is a perfect film to watch if you just leave your brain at the door and decide to be entertained. It's probably the best vampire film to come out in years, and the most imaginative one to appear since 1979's Nosferatu. Give it a try, and enjoy!"Everybody be cool. You-- BE COOL!"****1/2 out of *****</fullReview>

I am currently trying to watch this film on Fox-TV (very heavily edited), however, I don't remember the film being so dark and hard to see on videotape, as it is on my TV. It's virtually unwatchable. Apparently, a filter was used to darken the picture. While Tarantino is a gifted film maker in some respects, FOX-TV is not the medium to show this film. I've got to re-rent this film to see if I can see it. In conclusion, you will enjoy Scream or Scream 2, much more then this dim film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unlike most of the people who have commented on this movie, I saw it with no previous knowledge of the plot. When it suddenly changed in mid-stream from a crime drama to a horror flick, I nearly had a heart attack. I was absolutely not expecting any vampires to be showing up at this seedy Mexican bar. George Clooney did a great job acting in this film, and the writing and directing were top notch. The sound track was one of the best I have ever listened to in a movie, it fit perfectly well with the action on the screen. Last, but not least, how can you not like Cheech Marin playing three separate and totally over the top roles? This movie provided me with a great deal of pleasure, and that is all I ask of any film.

Their weapons will always crack me up, Seth with his Gun, SM with his Whip, Jacob with the bat, and Frost with a pencil.What more do you people want.And with one liners like 'Don't you ever try to run. Because I have six little friends and they all can run faster than you. 'And also a great cast, Clooney, Tarantino, Keitel, Lewiss, And even Cheech, Salma and Danny as supporting cast were great.One of my fave films.</fullReview>

All in all, the dialogue was fast-paced, the acting was good, and the special-effects were superb.

More to the point who else could have succeeded?

Then when you bring an EXTRAORDINARY cast into the picture, Spectacular effects, great plot and story line, it only gets better. George Clooney and Quentin Tarentino did a superb job, as well did Harvey Kietel and Juliette Lewis.

		<fullReview>From Dusk Till Dawn is a perfect example of a cult classic. When you want to see something with snappy-Tarantinio dialogue, real cool characters, and nonstop gore, except no substatute. This is a film that some will say is one of the worst films of all time just because half way through the plot changes but that's some of the fun in it. The first half you got the usual goods you can find in Tarantino films and then in the second half you get some of the greatests gore gliches of all time. Sex Machine using the crotch gun in battle, the vampire melting on the pool table with it's eyeballs falling into the corner pockets, George Clooney using the famous stake-drill, and best of all, Harvey Kietel shoving a shotgun through a vampires stomach while cocking it and shooting other vampires in the bar! Sure it sounds odd to mix the two different type of plots together, but that's the fun in it. This is one of the greatest hang-it-all-out action, horror, thrillers around that never lets up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm tired of people talking about FDTD as two half movies put together as one bizarre/crappy/stupid movie. What these people don't understand was that the first half of the movie, the regular bad-assed Tarantino flick, was deliberately put together to lure you into a false sense of comfort and security. "OK, I'm watching just another criminals-take-family-hostage story." And then they spring the vampires on you just to prove that no matter how bad a couple of murdering brothers are, there's always something worse. Personally, I can't think of anything better than George Clooney with a wicked tattoo, Quentin Tarantino as his deranged sex-offender brother, Robert Rodriguez directing, lots of gratuitous violence, bodies, blood, liquor, Mexicans, nudity, swearing, guns, and vampires, awesome dialogue, a guy named 'Sexmachine', Salma Hayak dancing on a table, and of course, Cheech Marin playing three roles. Oh hey, and did I mention George Clooney in the role of the absolutely coolest guy in the universe. This movie has always been my fallback movie (the one you rent when there's nothing else in). It's the kind of movie you can watch again and again and not get tired of it (although it's best to save it for special occasions). It is also, and I just realized this a few days ago, my favorite movie. Anyone who can't see this movie as one completely packaged action thriller was probably being referred to when Seth Gecko said, "I don't care 'bout livin' or dyin' anymore, I just want to send as many of these devils back to hell as I can."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who said this was a horror film? Oh, no, wrong movie, this is a *campy cult flick*! See, there is a difference, in that horror tends to be either boring or stupid yet tries to take itself seriously enough to scare people. (99% of the time they don't, that's why I've given up with horror.) Campy cult flicks are, well, campy. They weren't meant to be serious. Shut up about how it was a "bad horror film", that's the POINT: to be "bad" enough that it makes the movie "good." (See: Rocky Horror Picture Show.)Tarantino is excellent at dialogue, I had never really heard of the director but yeah, we dig him too. Originally I was reluctant to watch it because (eew) George Clooney (ick! gag) is in it, but this is one of the rare movies which can retain their enjoyability despite his presence.If you're in for a masterful cinematic experience, go see Pulp Fiction because honey, you are in the WRONG place. If you're in for a magnificent horror film, shoot yourself NOW because it ain't gonna happen, especially not with this one. If you couldn't give a flip about anything other than entertainment value, or you're a "cult-flick person" (this is where I come in), sit back and enjoy the ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok, so "From Dusk 'Till Dawn" is not for the weak-hearted, or stomached for that matter - but what do you expect when you combine the shocking, in-your-face, take-no-prisoners violent tendencies of Quentin Tarantino with Robert Rodriguez's gift for chaotic mayhem? George Clooney has never been badder or sexier (well, maybe in "Out of Sight"), and Tarantino's script provides some of the sharpest, harshest one-liners this side of hell ("welcome to slavery." "No thanks, I already had a wife.").Be warned - this film is not to be taken seriously - it's an endless bloodbath punctuated by quirky characters and hysterical, if crude, dialogue. But it's so much fun, you can't help but enjoy the ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is so violent and absurd one can't help but enjoy it. Most horror movies engage in some sort of lame fore-shadowing before the extraordinary encounter takes place, but the "horror" aspects of this movie are absolutely unexpected--so unexpected, in fact, that they cease to be horrifying. This movie is closer to a bloodbath western than a horror film--the characters are dumped into the middle of extreme carnage and asked to fend for themselves. The story is not as two-dimensional as critics of the film would have you believe--it seems many people can't tell the difference between a campy, fantastic conceit and scripted cheese. If you enjoy a well-done story and exceptional action sequences and you're not too hyper-sophisticated to love a nasty adolescent melodrama in which the bad guys do good things and good beats evil in a wave of guns and blood, then check it out. You won't find a better high-brow slaughter this side of Sam Peckinpah.</fullReview>

Then the Gecko brothers make it across the border, and BAM! You are now watching a Dimension Films B-movie splatterfest vampire movie. A hard-as-nails George Clooney commands the screen throughout, in a performance he has yet to approach in any other movie. Tarantino and Rodriguez make a terrific off-screen team.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is such a fun movie, it should be classified as a comedy. The "vampire incident" was so cartoony that the movie can't be confused with a horror. This was a showcase of talents... Tarantino stuck in some WONDERFULLY funny dialogue (my favorite, the conversation between Quentin and George in the rv bathroom), and then there were the awesome abilities of Robert Rodriguez in the action sequences. The acting was also good, and I was especially impressed with Quentin's performance. He catches a lot of flack for his *acting abilities* (and in most cases it's justified), but he did a great job in this movie. Tom Savini was also great, in his role as the coolest guy on earth. The ending was cool too... even though Juliette was left without family, she had plenty of cash to spend on therapy ;)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From Dusk till Dawn is essentially a good film but as said in the summary can be divided into two halves. The first half is equal with some other Tarantino and Rodriguez greats such as El Mariachi and Reservoir dogs. It has action (love that first scene) and a good plot.After that the movie had to go somewhere, into a certain direction, but which one. The one they chose I believe was not a great choice.THe second half of the film is mainly a splatterfest and can get quite tedious.Tarantino and Juliette Lewis are great in it though. Clooney and Keitel are pretty good.In conclusion it's a decent film, worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"From Dusk Till Dawn" is by far one of the best and funniest horror/action movies I've seen. Robert Rodriguez gives it his trademark kinetic visual flare and Quentin Tarantino provides the good writing and witty lines that we've come to expect from him. And George Clooney....damn....this is still George Clooney's best movie. Seth Gecko, the ultimate bad ass. In a way though, From Dusk Till Dawn could be perceived as 2 movies in one. The first half is the tale of the 2 criminal brothers Seth and Richie Gecko, while the other half of course is the vampire homage to horror films. Some people like one half better than the other. I, on the other hand, like them both.Overall, for some good action and some good laughs, check it out. It'll keep you entertained from dusk till dawn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From Dusk Till Dawn was an excellent film until.......those vampires!! Although it made an intriguing plot twist it was disappointing. George Clooney was excellent as Seth Gecko, and being a Tarantino fan, I thought that he played a wonderful foil to Tarantino's character Richard Gecko.This movie had all the makings for a successful action-packed movie. Murder, chase scenes, kidnappings and then everyone turns into vampires!!What the heck is going on here. I was all excited to see what was going to happen and then when everyone turned into vampires, I found myself laughing at a movie that once had me rivetted to the screen.The cast played their parts well, Havey Keitel and Julilette Lewis played wonderfully colourful characters and young Ernest Liu did an excellent job as the newcomer. Although the film became a little satirical, there were some classic Tarantino shots that make fans of his work admire the camera angles and other technical aspects. I think that the movie would have been better off going on the storyline that it originally started with, but hey, some people found it quiet enjoying. Only one other thing bothered me about this movie, the ending left me sitting in a dumbfounded state. I think this movie will become a cult favourite, in the tradition of other Tarantino works, and will surely be a fave with fans of the supernatual vampire aspect....I watch the film every now and again, and I find that it is growing on me, although I would still like to have a talk with the writers Robert Kurtzman and Quentin Tarantino.</fullReview>

It's obviously not in the same class as most other Tarantino movies, but whether you enjoyed it or not really depends on the mood you're in at the time. When I first saw it, I thought it was hilarious, and the enjoyment was enhanced by the fact that it didn't take itself seriously. Clooney is incredibly witty and charismatic, and Tarantino is at his irritating best as an actor (which isn't much). I'll probably watch this again some other time and think it's a piece of crap, but for now, I'll say it's worth getting out on video if you feel like watching a lot of gore and cool action, horror and comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is how I would expect a vampire ambush to go down! You're going through your life, minding your own business, pursuing schemes and dreams and then bam! Here they come, shaking you out of your mundane existence and ushering you (at top speed) into a world that is so opposite what you know and believe that the hairs on the back of your neck are permanently at attention. I don't believe that vampires are all romance, and although I can believe they come in different dispositions, this movie struck a chord of terror in me that goes back to the era of jumping off the bed in the middle of the night and running to the bathroom so whatever was lurking underneath couldn't grab a hold of your ankles. The setup was so sophisticated, so pat and so immersed in mundane obscenity, how could you possibly expect the evil to get so much more evil? This movie is somebody's nightmare--take it from someone who has been fascinated by the concept of vampires since they were a small child. True vampire/horror aficionados will find this movie entertaining and stimulating. I have watched this movie dozens of times and each time find some new angle that blows me away. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I truly adore this weird little piece of drive-through exploitation cinema. The first movie to mix the creative camera work of Robert Rodriguez, as well as the writing and "acting" talent of Quentin Tarantino. "From Dusk Till Dawn" begins serious in tone, then suddenly B-Movie madness shines all throughout the remaining half.Based on the notorious "Grindhouse" movie boom of the 1970's, George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino play two criminal brothers escaping from the law to Mexico. Along the way they kidnap a family trio (The father is the superb Harvey Keitel), and while waiting for the cartel they hide out in a sleazy strip joint appropriately named the "Titty-Twister". It's stupid and dumb, but that's what's so damn enjoyable about it. Robert &amp; Quentin have literally created a fantastic "leave your brain at the door" movie, and re-created that B-movie vibe with quite an ensemble cast (Most notably Tom Savini as hilarious biker "Sex-Machine"). Overall it's a fun movie with guns, over the top gore and one liners that all echo Rodriguez's "El Mariachi" movies. And when mashed together with Quentin's quick witted dialogue and humour, what more could you ask for? Final Verdict: If you liked Tarantino/Rodriguez's recent "Grindhouse" Double-Feature, then you should love this. I've seen it so many times now and damn is it re-watchable. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In spite of too much blood and violent scenes, this film would be a great entertainment on a Friday night. I found it hard to relate this movie to "Horror" as it is tagged on IMDb: vampires are merely jokes, not even close to an actual threat. One of the funniest scene for this film is to watch how ineligible can a vampire be; it reminds me of some old time antiques like "monster squad". Come on, a vampire/werewolf that walks like an old man all the time? Sure the shooting techniques are very much limited by their time, but always I cannot help compare them to "underworld" and then conclude I probably should never watch a pure vampire film before 2000 again.Well this movie is not a pure vampire film, it's much more than that. You will see Quentin plays a psycho (I didn't know he could act), how a Vietnam veteran, a sex machine, a retired priest, a escaped thief and two kids slaughter a bunch of vampires in a bar called titty-twister, how Salma Hayek perform a half-naked dance with a snake on her, and how the thief become Dr. Phil for a priest. Lots of peoples and things died or vanished in the end, and most importantly, you will laugh our loud a lot.</fullReview>

Seth takes them hostage and the five successfully cross the border. They arrive at a bar called "The Titty Twister", where Seth will meet his handler in the morning. When the moon strikes, the workers in the bar turn into vampires and the survivors must soon fight for their lives.....Sometimes, its a shame that the Internet exists, and also, people who like to spoil film. If this was released in the eighties, this would have a Psycho essence to it. If you haven't seen the trailers for this, or know anything about the film, stop reading and just watch the film, it will be a surprise.Other than that, its a fine movie, Tarantino proves he cannot act, but Clooney proves he is a star in the making. He carries the film and steals every single scene from everyone else, thank heavens for this or Batman And Robin would have killed his career, he really is that good in this.The script is hilarious, Rodriguez proves he was a force to be reckoned with, and whole movie is what made Grindhouse.The opening sequence grips you, and never let's you go. But it all depends on the twist.If you swallow it, its probably one of the greats from 1996, if not, you'll probably hate it.But when it was released, the director, writer, and most of the cast were the hottest, most cult things on earth,so it may be a case of you really had to be there to appreciate it.Luckily I was, and I love returning to this film every now and again, because its fun and exciting, which is the fundamental element of cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A script and character triumph unashamedly wrapped in glorious nonsense.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this film came out all I remember is that it was 'the' go to film for all things cool.The plot wasn't a surprise as the trailers pretty much gave everything away but the decade was still buzzing from Tarantino fever and after the superb 'Desperado' the teaming of Robert Rodriguez and his screen writing chum doing a film about vampires was too much pull for a 17 year old me.I can say without a doubt that it is a classic. Maybe not in the sense of Casablanca or Raiders Of The Lost Ark but as a style film it really can't be touched. Tarantino's screenplay drips with wit and humour as well as the usual taboo subjects thrown into everyday conversation and Rodriguez direction compliments this. Both men have made 'looking tacky' an art form when it comes to film and this heavily works in it's favour because we want it to feel sleazy and a bit dirty. Rodriguez has made some right stinkers in his time but in this era he was what I consider to be a proper fimmaker with no CGI and not much of a budget which pushes directors to be as creative as possible.The cast is about as good as it gets. George Cloony, who audiences were used to seeing as a respectable Doctor on the hit Series ER does a complete character 180 into the superb Seth Gecko a character with all the moral fibre of a rock and the patience of a 5 year old. He tears into the script like a hungry dog which showcases whole new side to Cloony's acting and who could forget 'that' tattoo, a tiny detail which really brought the visual impact of the character to life and has since been copied many times but back then it was a striking feature. It's probably safe to say that this film was a game changer for Cloony who gained new respect for such a radical change but sadly hasn't really done much else that comes close.As a few people have mentioned this is really two films in one, the first being a superb crime drama which sees the Gecko boys escape over the border with a kidnapped family, and the second is pure schlock nonsense and I am totally fine with that.Maybe it was the teenager in me when I saw this but nothing could make me or my pals smile more than a bit of blood, guts and vampires interlaced with ridiculous humour. Some say the vampire section brings the crime thriller down but I think the thriller part raises the profile of what is already a really cool film.So many people go by formulas, right ways to do things and rules. Where art is concerned and this includes film, music etc. there can only be guidelines and it's great to see a bunch of people making a film the way they want to make it and that means throwing whatever off beat, off topic nonsense they feel like into the mix just because they simply think it would be cool.A superb and sleazy trashcan of a movie that's not afraid to play with childish notions because it knows it's a cut above most film snobs polished favourites.</fullReview>

However, I enjoyed a lot this movie, which I consider to be his most interesting work, being quite funny to watch(In a twisted, disturbing way)from beginning to end.It works perfectly well as "Tarantinesque" crime-thriller film, but it also is very effective as a deranged vampire flick."From Dusk Till Dawn" has all the excess and craziness that any viewer could expect from a film directed by Robert Rodríguez, but is also a highly entertaining experience, having lots of awesome and funny moments throughout the whole movie. The special effects and the music were excellent. Also, Salma Hayek was unbelievably hot here... What more could anyone ask for? Personally, I think that "From Dusk Till Dawn" was Robert Rodriguez's masterpiece. I enjoyed it more than his "Sin City" adaptation and "Machete". And of course it was much better than his awful "Spy Kids" movies.</fullReview>

So what if they just "tease" bikers in that seemingly normal bikerbar? No, it's kill kill kill "before the dawn comes" as is the name of the game, vampires at least give some major challenge. Also as is mentioned early in the movie, this is a flick for us "Wild Bunch"-fans: ultra-violence with characters to care for. And in any case it's on comicstrip-level from start to finish anyhow, in the lines of "RoboCop", all of them zombie-movies etc. To review this otherwise is just plain stupid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Half a great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What we get with 'From Dusk til Dawn' is half a great movie and half a pretty conventional boring one. Don't get me wrong I love me a good vampire film but these vampires aren't very interesting at all. What is interesting is the heist and hostage plot at the beginning of the film that suddenly derails into a merely okay vampire film.I think there are moments in the first half of the film that match some of the great Tarantino moments. I love the black humor in the relationship between Seth and Richie. They are genuinely very interesting characters who are kind of repulsive but you can't help but be interested in them. The first twenty minutes of the film are brilliantly constructed. The liquor store scene is thrilling, suspenseful, and yet very funny at the same time. But what is even more interesting is the time spent at the motel. I love the scene where Richie interacts with the hostage as we know something terrible is about to happen to her but in typical Tarantino fashion he invites her to indulge on the TV with him. The Keitel plot line is seamlessly translated into this. I genuinely like his character and the interactions between him and the Gecko brothers are brilliantly played out. Keitel has a conversation with Clooney's Gecko about religion and faith at the wheel of a hideous RV which is fascinating and deep but is played through Tarantino wit. I was hooked. There is genuinely a very interesting take on religious themes with the Jacob character. Putting a religious man in Tarantino's world is just really bizarre and really fun and yet the dialogue doesn't make fun of the weight of this character. There's a tragic quality to him. Keitel gives a great performance.And as our characters reach the Mexican border things get less interesting. Vampires come from literally out of nowhere. Wow and I found myself saying just as this thing was getting good. Of course I knew the film was about vampires going in but I was hoping that it would continue through this lens. These vampires pop up out of nowhere and waste no time rampaging through everything totally putting whatever character development that was established to rest through gore. I like vampires I do but these vampires aren't interesting or scary. They aren't charismatic or sexy and they don't even talk. The make up design for them is cartoonish. It just isn't interesting at all. I've seen this done thousands of times before and it just is dumb because I don't see anything resembling a point happening here. And forget Tarantino's dialogue because once these vampires show up the only type of lines you'll be hearing are "Stake him!", "I've been bite", "Bloodsuckers" and that sort of thing. The thing that frustrated me most was seeing Keitels character in vampire make-up because he looks absolutely ridiculous. In a way that symbolized what I felt about the film. It could have been great if it stuck with the first part of the story but that RV made a wrong turn into stupidity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Funnest Horrorr Films Out there</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the creative minds of Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino comes this odd flick. I stumbled across it on TV and was fairly intrigued so I watched the encore presentation. I was actually pretty thrilled by it. The movie starts off with the guise of a genuine Tarantino flick, with great dialogue and the tense atmosphere of a tense crime thriller you could say. With acting presence of George Clooney, Tarantino himself, Harvey Keitel, and Juliette Lewis, it flows quite nicely. Plus, f*ckin Tom Savini!!! Film scholars and fans of horror will nod their heads in agreement. Then enter the lusciously delicious Salma Hayek, and from then on you are thrust into an entirely different film. It's this transition I believe that throws many off, but it works due to the performances and the thrill of the action.The film loses its sense of seriousness to a degree, but it serves up quite a bit of bloody, gruesome yet funny action. For what it is, the film is very entertaining and very different from what you usually get. I was excited to hear there were two sequels, but they're as dismal as the usual trash. "From Dusk till Dawn" is a truly unique horror experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The notorious Gecko Brothers, two of America's most dangerous criminals, are on the run from the Texas police and the FBI after a crime spree through the Southwest. Across the border in Mexico, the mysterious Carlos offers sanctuary to criminals on the lam, but first they must slip past the border patrol. Enter the Fuller family: Jacob, a minister who has lost his faith and his children, the vulnerable teenage Kate and her younger brother Scott, on a road trip in their new R.V. The Gecko Brothers kidnap the Fullers and high-tail it to freedom with the promise to let the family go once they hook up with their criminal connection in Mexico. The rendezvous point is the Titty Twister, the wildest bar this side of the Rio Grande. The night is full of seductive promise as the group settles back to wait for Carlos and his boys to arrive at sunrise. But unbeknown st to the brothers or their hostages, the management and staff of this particular establishment have a taste for blood--in the vampire sense.The opening of this movie is total different to the rest of the movie as starts of like something in gangster movie.I am NOT a huge fan of vampire movies,, i just can get into then,, the one I have seen are Samles lot and 30 Days of Night l like those movies , I have also tired to watch blade movies, i just can not get to that all and now back to this movie.This as great scary vampires in this movie, i really liked how they changed out the blue sometimes, which make the movie really scary and some of deaths scenes were really good.This movie as some great Amazing Special Effects which were really Gory and some of transformation are really great and the make up effects for the vampires were really good and made they look really scary.There do have a lot of blood and gore in this movie and a lot of nudity (but not overboard) and they add some nice humour into this movie too, there are some really funny scenes in this movie which will make you laugh.The acting in this movie is really good from the whole cast. I going to give this movie 9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This certainly is one of the most peculiar movies I've ever seen. It starts of as an everyday Tarantino crime movie with all of his typical trademarks, then suddenly it has vampires killing everyone. Some see the movie as uneven and weird for that reason, but personally I see the vampires as a welcome surprise that add to the surreal atmosphere. They're an extra feature, and a pretty great one at that, because these vampire scenes are really top notch. They're a great combination between over the top violence and morbid humour, a perfect fit for a grindhouse showing. The whole second half of this movie just screams love for the genre, this is essentially a big-budget fan film. They even hired Tom Savini as an actor just because they could. This movie just really gets the adrenaline pumping, which is what I look for in any horror movie, I just rarely find it. The names of Tarantino and Rodriguez raised a lot of expectations, but in my opinion all of them were met.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two best friends come together to make a fun, eccentric modern B-movie that i thoroughly enjoyed!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino met at the Cannes film festival (when Tarantino won best picture for pulp fiction) and they got talking and found out they had similar film interest. Rodriguez said to Tarantino that he would love to make a horror film in Mexico and alas Tarantino had already written the script and offered Rodriguez to direct it!. Almost a natural bond between the two that has amounted to the production of this bloody, fun and quixotic b-movie that is 'From Dusk till Dawn' Its a film of two parts, one part is the saga of the criminal gecko brothers (Tarantino and clooney) trying to get into Mexico and away from the American law where they can pursue a happy life. In order to do this, they abduct an innocent family who are grieving the death of their mother/wife who recently died tragically. They're fragile and weak so being abducted by two psycho criminals isn't the ideal treatment for them!. It also becomes apparent that Richard Gecko (Tarantino) has an ardent sexual desire for the young girl of the family. Tarantino plays a sick deranged and mentally disturbed character that seems to be a sexual offender. While Seth Gecko (clooney) seems to be more calculated and clever than Richard, he is still criminal trash that only cares about himself and his brother. The Geckos hide the families bathroom in their caravan and force them to go through the Mexican/American border. This first part is a sample of some typical quick, crisp and stimulating script work from Tarantino that is a true joy to watch.Now onto the second part, after arriving into Mexico, they are told to meet a friend at a sick bar called the 'titty twister'. The bar turns out to be a grisly place where vampires feed on the visiting truckers. Upon arrival, we are served with an orgy of gore, vampires and true outrageous b-movie horror!.As for the performances of the cast, Clooney's performance was top notch and he captured his character perfectly. As for Tarantino, he was nominated for a razzie for it!. While it wasn't the greatest acting I've ever seen, it was fine! and you have to remember that hes a director not an actor!. Keital was great as always. Juliette Lewis (who was earlier in Tarantino's natural born killers) plays a very different character to the deranged one she played in NBK, shes an innocent girl that has unfairly suffered the loss of her whole family.Some people prefer the first part to the second part and vice-versa. But personally, i enjoyed the whole film and although it wasn't a masterpiece or anywhere near as good as Tarantino's other work, I give it a 6 simply because of how much i enjoyed it.This is sheer entertainment but be aware, you may not get the b-movie style and hate it! But still its worth a watch! 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I'm a mean m?.,m?. servant of God" ? Jacob Fuller This would probably be one of the most interesting renditions of a vampire tale of have ever seen. It can be considered as being two movies in one whether it is or not. The first half of the movie is your typical Quentin Tarantino gangland movie. Its starts off with the Gecko Brothers Seth (George Clooney) and Richard (QT) who have just fled a grisly bank robbery and end up kidnapping a retired preacher (Harvey Keitel), his daughter (Juliette Lewis) and his adopted son (Ernest Liu). This half is pure Tarantino for a number of reasons. It is filled with long and interesting dialogue, which makes for good conversation; there is a lot of violence and foul-mouth language. Those reasons would probably be the exact same reasons why I think that this movie is spectacular.This half is almost a cliché, prior to the bank robbery the brothers try to hitch a ride to Mexico so that they could live off of the stolen money. However, Quentin steers away from the cliché by adding in a retired preacher who lost his wife. I love Harvey's performance of a father figure and servant of god rather than a gun-totin' hit man. His character is almost believable. The chemistry between Clooney's Seth and Tarantino's Richard are almost humorous but in the same sense very violent. I think that they work amazingly together. Of course when they get to Mexico the brothers have to stop at a strip club and from there on, it takes a swan dive into hell.The strip club is populated by a sleazy bartender (Danny Trejo), a luscious vixen stripper (Salma Hayek), the raunchy doorman (Cheech Marin), an ex war vet (Fred Williamson) and of coarse the suave Sex Machine (Tom Savini). All of these characters, especially Trejo, Hayek and Marin do a great job in acting out their characters. Even Cheech Marin is scary as hell being a vampire. Tom Savini's Sex Machine is probably one of the funniest characters in a horror movie that I have seen and they all play their parts to perfection. Even the mariachi band does a great job playing there part when it comes time for their transformation.I'll go further to say that vampire strippers are the best concept for this sort of genre. We shouldn't be surprised that QT thought this on up. There is also the cheese factor. There is a lot of corny scenes and cheesy one-liners as well as cheesy fight scenes such as a spaghetti western-style fight scene between the survivors and the vampire strippers. Another great cheesy scenes is filling squirt guns with holy water and making condom balloons with holy water. If you are not scared by now then you'll surly be laughing by now since this movie is so ridiculously well made by Quentin and Robert Rodriguez. Of course the cheese factor does sort of steer away from the story and the unnoticeable plot but I still enjoyed myself.The set was great. Half of the movie takes place on the road and the other half takes place in a strip club that looks like a ancient pyramid decorated with Christmas lights, frill, vodka bottles and naked women. The front of the club looks like skid row gone horribly wrong, with motorcyclists and a huge tire fire, with skinned cow skulls and empty beer bottles lying all over the place.In a hasty conclusion this movie was fun to watch, very fun to watch and although it has it's cheesy moments it's still a great vampire flick by two great writers and directors that should not be missed. I would highly recommend this film to any horror and gore nut out there. I certainly liked and I hope you do to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm Sex Machine, pleased to meet ya?From Dusk Till Dawn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This year's Grindhouse was not the first of such collaborations between Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino. One could argue that their production of From Dusk Till Dawn laid the seeds for that schlock-fest extravaganza. I remember while watching Planet Terror thinking how overboard Rodriguez was going, and loving every minute of it. Revisiting this film, however, showed how he didn't stray too far from where he had already been. Sure Tarantino's dialogue is at the forefront for much of the film's duration, but when the action amps up and the vampire gore starts splattering, one can see the connection with Rodriguez's later film. Overall, this movie delivers big time. The laughs are many, the pop culture references are sprinkled throughout, the characters are all fully fleshed no matter how little screen time they are given, and the action is great to watch.The story is a simple one. The Gecko brothers have pulled off a heist and need to get to Mexico in order to pay off their partner. They kill and steal along the way until meeting up with a pastor who has lost faith and his two children in an RV. Taking the family hostage, they make their way south to a sleazy topless bar awaiting said partner's arrival. This specific bar, however, is inhabited by vampires who feed on its customers once the sun goes down. What is first a crime tale of men on the run soon turns into a fight for survival against the supernatural.While Rodriguez handles the directing well, showcasing some nice special effects and make-up work, it really is the script that shines. Tarantino has crafted a tale with just enough realism to keep it from going too far overboard. The dialogue is sharp and with himself and George Clooney starring, the delivery is spot-on. Quentin's Richard is a lunatic, pedophile/rapist who recently broke his brother Seth out of jail so they could complete this job. Seth is the brains of the operation and understands all the angles. His temper leads to many great one-liners and his release of tension when they cross the border successfully gives us even more. The relationship between the two is classic and I don't see Tarantino giving a better performance ever. His low-key psychopath is effective and I love his soft delivery of lines when his brother is not in the room to hear him.Our entry point into the film opens the action perfectly with what on the surface appears to be a generic scene between a sheriff and a gas station proprietor. When the officer goes to the bathroom we are finally able to meet the Gecko boys and understand what is really happening. Richard goes crazy, Seth shows his vindictive side, and John Hawkes is brilliant as the man stuck in the middle, doing what he is told, but subverted at all times by Richard's bloodlust. The rest of the film, until they meet the family that sticks with them to the end is full quality dialogue and acting. That family consists of Harvey Keitel, great in a role that is uncommon for him?the good guy, Ernest Liu as the son, with a nice realistic turn, and Juliette Lewis as the daughter, giving many memorable moments, especially opposite Tarantino.It's when they arrive at the Mexican bar and the vampires show themselves that the film really picks up. The script remains witty, but the supernatural flair infused with it brings a freshness that keeps the film from ever hitting a rut. Cameos are plenty, Cheech Marin, Salma Hayek, Tom Savini, and Fred Williamson among others, blood and guts are everywhere, and the violence rises to a crescendo. Clooney is allowed to run free, to great effect, with Keitel there at all times injecting a bit of calm wisdom whenever possible. From Dusk Till Dawn is far from a masterpiece, but it is fantastic entertainment and can be played with Grindhouse to create a highly enjoyable night of carnage.</fullReview>

This movie is clearly intended to be a melange of farce, action, and comedy. And it succeeds in all three respects admirably. This reason I feel people are upset with movies like this is that they come into it with false expectations. Some expected another Pulp Fiction, others expected a Dawn of the Dead.

		<fullReview>I got From Dusk Till Dawn at a used DVD store for two bucks, and it was a good deal. This is really a mesh between a Quentin Tarantino crime picture and a Robert Rodriguez horror film.The first half involves Tarantino and George Clooney as Richard and Seth Gecko trying to get into Mexico and away from the FBI and the Texas Rangers since Richard broke Seth out of jail, helped him rob a bank and spilled a considerable amount of blood doing so. They kidnap Jacob Fuller (Harvey Keitel) and his two kids Kate and Scott (Juliette Lewis and first-timer Ernest Liu) and use their RV to get across the border. When over the border they go to the Titty Twister, a rowdy bar for bikers and truckers, where Richard and Seth plan on meeting their friend Carlos, sometime between dusk and dawn, so they can give him a cut of their loot. Little do they know, the Titty Twister is a front for a group of vampires who prey on unsuspecting truckers and bikers.From Dusk Till Dawn is a violent, campy, and mostly entertaining movie. Tarantino wrote the screenplay and does a stellar job as Richard Gecko, and Rodriguez directed it which makes it feel a bit like Desperado and Pulp Fiction thrown together with some campy horror.The main things I liked about this movie were the actors. George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino are really convincing as two criminal brothers. When Seth finds the dead, raped body of a woman who was supposed to be their hostage, he asks Seth if it's his fault and if he (Richard) thinks that's what he (Seth) is like. I also liked Harvey Kietel as a minister who seems to have lost his faith and Juliette Lewis, who I usually find annoying, as his daughter. Plus, Salma Hayek is ultra-sexy as an exotic dancer.I preferred the first half of the movie to the semi-campy gore-invested second half. The vampires look like a cross between zombies and vampires, which I don't think works very well, and the special effects are obviously fairly low budget, plus I'm not a huge gory-horror movie fan. While the effects are fairly cheesy, I got the feeling they weren't supposed to look very real anyway since their are a lot of jokes and visual gags. A group talk about ways to kill vampires is amusing and pokes fun at vampire movie clichés and Juliette Lewis has a funny scene where she is unsure about stabbing a possibly bitten trucker.Overall I'd give From Dusk Till Dawn seven stars of of ten, it's a entertaining movie with some fun performances and an original story, but the effects are awkward since it's hard to tell whether they are purposely cheesy or just low budget. Check it out if you get the chance.</fullReview>

But I was proved wrong, and Tarantinos screenplay (although not his best) plays really well with Rodriguezs' exceptional directing. I would recommend that people see this movie without thinking of other fantastic films that follow the names that star in it. This film has it's own charm, and although the special effects do make you laugh sometimes, it's not a bad thing!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would love to be able to write this without spoiling it for others but the mere fact that the whole film revolves around the surprise addition of the vampires in the middle makes it impossible to do so. What starts as a simple hick town robbery gradually sucks the viewer into the gritty desert border motel where the kidnappers have holed up. So far so good - the rape and subliminal flash violence is unsubtle and expected from Tarantino. The delightful irony of the sex attack and the subsequent capture of the virginal "fallen preacher"'s daughter sets the mind to thinking of a psycho type sexual thrills movie. When the violence does erupt after the heavy macho bar room brawl scene it comes as a a delight that its not sex its vampire stuff you never dreamt of at the start. Even after all the vampire stuff and the final blow out with the bats, Tarantino saves the final little little kicker for the wide angle shot of the ancient temple at the end - we've only seen the tip of the iceberg! A great film .... not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another Quentin Tarantino hit is here. This is dealing with the world of Vampires. What is it? "From Dusk till Dawn". You got two dangerously deadly brothers on the run from law enforcement officers. Seth and Richard Gecko(George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino) are cold and cunning, they killed and kidnap these guys are making a run. When Seth loses it when his brother Richard rapes and kills the teacher they kidnapped. That makes Seth mad at him all right, he would probably kill his brother as well. So they ditch that nice Mercury for a RV containing a widower(Harvey Kitel) and kids(Juliette Lewis,Ernest Liu). I don't know what goes on in the mind of Richard but Seth keeps his cool at all times. When the group goes South of the Border, it's an all-night truck stop. Giving to the term tourist trap. It's a trap all right. When this tavern is owned by blood-sucking vampires, there was no time for these people to scurry. The killers knew what they were up against. So the family help the killers and the other tourists rid themselves of these pests, sadly some of them fell victim to the blood-suckers. Cheech Marin had a lot of roles in this movie, and the pyramid was indeed surprising to see along with the trashed rigs at the bottom. This movie is all about the dangers of tourist traps, they weren't kidding! Great movie great cast, excellent results! Rating 4.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

I remember hearing a lot of hype about this film back when it first came out in 96', and even though I am a avid horror fan, I just got around to seeing the movie now. I honestly don't know what to think of this film?the first half is a Quentin Tarantino-style crime romp, with his usual trademark sense of off-beat humor. Then the second half of the film: Blood, gore, monsters, blood, gore, monsters, more blood, gore, monsters?I think you get the picture.It's certainly enjoyable and funny in that the characters, Tarantino's especially, are funny and likable, and the script, penned by Tarantino himself, is witty, clever and often imaginative. The actors all do a great job too; I loved Harvey Keitel's dead-pan delivery and Mr. Clooney is his usual sly self.Then, of course we have what the film was designed for?the gore and monsters. The boys at KNB effects deserve a pat on the back for they're contribution here. The creature effects were great and the gore was over-the-top but convincing and plentiful as hell. Unfortunately, this film was made during the digital boom so some pretty lame "morphing" effects were employed for the scenes where vampires melt after being killed, but this is only a small complaint.If you like gore or off-beat horror films, you'll probably enjoy this film, just remember to turn your brain off before watching it. On the whole it was pretty entertaining.6.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought Rodriguez did a very good job with the movie, however, I believe the movie should have been left as a crime drama, and not turned into this horde of vampires attacking people. It had A lot of potential even when they went into the titty twister, until the whole vampire thing happened, I think it just went downhill and became corny, and a lot of the acting from most of the characters was on the downside. The story was perfect for a crime movie. Tarantino and Clooney were great acting. The camera work was very well done until the titty twister part came. Overall, if the movie stayed in the crime genre, it could have been amazing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From Dusk till Dawn-George Clooney, Julliette Lewis, Harvey Keitel, Quentin Tarantino, Ernest Liu, Cheech Marin, Fred williamson, Danny Trejo, Tom Savini, Salma Hayek, Michael Parks and Tito Larriva.WOW! This is one of those fun to watch on a boring night movies, and it is great. It is about two thieves (Clooney and Tarantino((Tarantino is also a murderer)) who take the Keitel, Lewis, and Lui family who take them to a Mexican strip club which is run unbeknownst to them, vampires. It is silly and gory, but at the same time, really great. Michael Parks plays Sheriff Earl McGraw in the opening, and is a great actor. He has been in Kill Bill 1 as Earl(despite the fact that he dies in this one), Kill Bill 2 as a Mexican pimp, From Dusk till Dawn 3 as the star of it and other films. Hayek has the best striptease in this too and she is HOT!!!!! 8/10 stars. R for gory violence, some sexual innuendo, language and nudity.</fullReview>

George Clooney going from cute doctor on a TV series to a multiple murderer bad boy with a psychotic brother. Harvey Keitel shifts from a bad mofo (ref: Taxi Driver pimp, Capricorn 5 killer cyborg, wild man in the jungle in Piano) to an old preacher man who's lost his faith. The dude with the whip and the 'Nam vet are unforgettable. Juliette Lewis was more than the streetwise tramp she usually plays. Cheech, Cheech, Cheech...This movie has EVERYTHING! Sharp dialogue, warped characters, heroism, humor, horror, kick ass special effects, ingenuity, and the unexpected. It goes over the top with no apologies. It demands suspension of belief.Just flow with this movie. Set your emotions on free fall. Immerse yourself in the experience.I foresee many many viewings of From Dusk...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tarantino + Rodriguez = Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although it's not Tarantino's best work, this movie has to be one of the coolest movies ever in my opinion. As most people have noticed it is part gritty crime flick with witty dialogue and part popcorn horror flick. Robert Rodriguez and Tarantino really helped create a classic. George Clooney's Seth Gecko has to be one of the coolest movie characters in history, next to Samuel L. Jackson's Jules Winnfield, and Harvey Keitel's Mr.White. Clooney deserved the popularity and fame he received after making this movie. The supporting cast is great too, Harvey Keitel, always excellent in any role he plays, Juliette Lewis, gorgeous and also great, Cheech Marin, playing three characters, great as well, Salma Hayek, although a short role as one of the villains, pretty good too. The snake dance, along with her role in Desperado is what really launched her into Hollywood stardom. performance-wise she only said a few lines all to George Clooney right before he kills her which I think happened too fast and me and i'm sure most men wished Tarantino could've stretched Salma's character's life a bit more. The other complaint I have is that the body count was too high and I wished at least Sex Machine and Scott could've made it, maybe he could've saved Scott from getting bitten by his own father and all those vampires towards the end. I loved how Rodriguez brought the retractable penis gun back from "Desperado" but this time we actually see how it works. Rodriguez does a great job directing his movie, his camera work, especially in the first part of the movie is excellent. The make up, props and stunts, pretty good for a low-budget flick from 1996. It's not Oscar material, but it's still a classic in it's own right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Individually, both Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino are astounding filmmakers. Films like Pulp fiction, Reservoir Dogs, El Mariachi and Desperado have shaped the lives of the many young people that have grown up with them.But put these two together and the result could have swung either way. It could have been extremely good, or on the other hand it could have been Four Rooms (shudder!!) Well let me just say that 'From Dusk till Dawn' has to be one of my favourite films in years. The reason for this? I've never seen anything more original than this movie. The first half sets itself up to be a heist movie, Resrvoir Dogs Lite if you like. Two Brothers, Seth and Jacob have robbed a bank and taken a preacher and his children hostage. Their aim? To make it across the border to Mexico where they will be safe from the police and destined for a life of luxury. They stop off at a strip bar called the Titty Twister, where they are scheduled to meet their dealer. They all sit down, relax and watch in awe as Salma Hayek entices them with a sexy dance routine involving beer and her foot. Then she turns into a VAMPIRE!!!!!!!! Well i didn't see that one coming! The next half of the movie sees George Clooney (In a role played to perfection) and the rest of the survivors fight off the fiends from hell. I haven't had so much fun with a film since Back to the Future. Its one of those films that you can endlessly quote to exhaustion. I'm tied up at the moment between 'What do you think i want you mean old b*****d' and 'Psychos do NOT explode when sunlight hits them. I don't give a f**k how crazy they are!' Both by Clooney. The film is full of touches from both directors. The trunk shot found in all of Tarantinos films has not gone amiss and the trademark Rodriguez Clutch gun is here as well. The script is brilliant and the action scenes are handled masterfully. The soundtrack is a standout with the opening theme Dark Night destined to stick in your head for ages. It just cant do no wrong. Well, i lie. Whoever cast Ernest Liu should be shot as the child has no obvious emotion. His death scene should be satisfying yet ends up being cringe inducing. But apart from that the film excels and is the perfect way to while away 90 minutes of a weekend. Rent it, buy it, tape it. Whatever you do just make sure you see this film and then spread the word around. This film Rules!!!!!!!!!!!1</fullReview>

		<fullReview>FROM DUSK TILL DAWN (1996) cast: George Clooney, Quentin Tarantino, Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis, Ernest Liu, Salma Hayek, Cheech Marin, Danny Trejo, Tom Savini, Fred Williamson, John Saxon.plot: Seth (George Clooney) and Richie (Quentin Tarantino) are two criminal brothers on the run from the cops. They kidnap a father (Harvey Keitel) and his two kids (Juliette Lewis, Ernest Liu) and hide out in a strip bar called The Titty Twister in Mexico. Soon, they discover that the strippers and bartenders are actually bloodthirsty vampires and team up with a few survivors in order to battle the bloodsuckers and make it out by dawn! the good: Great vampire flick which pays tribute to films like DAWN OF THE DEAD and THE EVIL DEAD. It has the nudity for the t&amp;a hounds, the gore for the gore-hounds, awesome action for the action lovers, and kick-ass interesting characters for those who love their good characters. Clooney was calm and cool and had the best lines, Tarantino had great presence and even though he was a raging psycho-path he was a cool character and I learned to love him, Keitel was great as the fallen preacher who lost his faith, Lewis was pretty cool as the Christian daughter-turned-vampire hunter, Liu was OK as her brother, Hayek was awesome as the vampire queen and had one cool dance scene. Trejo and Marin made cool vampires. And Savini and Williamson were kickass as the civilians who know how to kick vampire ass. John Saxon also has a cool cameo as a Sheriff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've heard about this movie for a while. I've seen all the big ones, R Dogs, all 3 Mariachi Movies, both Kill Bills, Pulp Fiction, Four Rooms, etc. So I was excited when I found out this one was going to be on TV.I like vampires. I like Tarantino and I like Rodriguez. I thought this movie would be better than sliced bread! Well...I was wrong.If you take it for what it is, a bad vampire movie, it's not that bad compared to other vampire movies (ie Underworld) but if you step and you look where it come from, from one of the best directors of our time (in my opinion) and one of the best screenwriters of our time(in my opinion) and this is the best they could come up with? Yes, some of the dialogue is witty ('I already have a wife') and you can hear the "Tarantino Voice" But the over-the-top violence ruined it for me... Bodies everywhere, gallons of blood...it took away from the story (or lack thereof)The one thing that thrilled me about this film? I finally know how the Rodriguez Crouch Gun is used...I smiled from ear to ear when they showed that. I've heard so much about it. Music isn't that bad either.In conclusion-See it, but know there are better movies done by these people. I'm calling a **/*****...but I tend to inflate ratings...

The film starts out being about two violent criminals running for freedom to Mexico.Once they get there, this whole movie is spoiled, because out of nowhere it's got vampires everywhere with gore and guts gushing galore. This is where I stopped watching the movie. What a waste of time!I am amazed that ANY actor would choose to be in this movie. I am especially amazed that Harvey Keitel accepted the role. For Clooney, wanting to get away from ER, well, it was a DUMB decision to start here. How did he ever recover? I guess his good looks saved him.I'll bet big bucks that if you asked each of these actors how they felt about having been in this movie, they would all be horribly embarrassed and regretful (except for possibly Tarrantino).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hidden masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING! Do not read this if you haven't seen the movie. (spoilers) Do watch the movie, though. From Dusk Till Dawn is a hidden masterpiece of film. The most noticeable thing about this movie is the sudden change halfway through the movie. It goes from bank robbers on the run to bank robbers fighting vampires. This was not done because of bad writing, it was done because of excellent writing. The amazing writing makes the totally ruthless bank robbers into guys you root for. Only a few writers can show the two stars killing people like nothing and along the way making them almost good. The audience doesn't want the Gecko brothers to get caught, so who (or what) can have the strength to get in their way. Seeing the Gecko brothers are untouchable you have to have something other than cops stand in their way and that's when the vampires come into play. The vampires is a source that makes you root for the Gecko brothers because their nasty and all in all worse than the gecko's. So, you root against the vampires. Also the vampires really bring out Seth's nice side. He ends up helping the family he kidnapped.The movie is filled with great one-liners and really great imaginations. The movie is made for someone to sit back and have a lot of fun and I do every time I watch it.Most definitely a 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was never intended to be a serious 'project'. Both Rodriguez and Tarantino wanted this movie to shout back to their favorites. Typical for Tarantino (and gone horribly wrong with Kill Bill). I love the beginning to this film. I've watched it more than a few times, and probably worn out the rental version that I pick up every couple of months (should get around to buying it...). I first saw this on TV and excitedly watched a cheer-for-the-bad-guy heist movie. BUT, 30 min it turns itself around. Completely. It becomes campy, and silly, and the giant shout out. Honestly, I would have loved this movie to death had it continued with the original story line. I do like it as is, but it's a bit of a shock to have the entire premise turn on you. Not bad, lots of fun, and be damned if you try to take it seriously.</fullReview>

This was directed by Robert Rodriguez, whilst True Romance was directed by Tony Scott. What starts out as a classic criminals on the run turns into a vampire movie. So, you get two movies for the price of one and you're out of the theatre in under two hours. The whole cast seem to be having a blast with this and the combination of thrills, spills and excellent script will leave you breathless. Not much of a story, but who cares !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER There are worse movies available out there, but not many. This one at least does have nice use of colour, and Salma Hayek looks nice, but I can't think of many other redeeming points. The action/thriller is boring, and incredibly predictable, the morality is non-existent, the characters are ludicrous and the acting tends to be over the top and cheesy at best. Then it tries to be a vampire movie, with all the success of the worst of that genre, and none of the class of the best. If you didn't know it was a vampire movie, I suppose the twist might have been surprising, but it quickly turns to a step beyond the most moronic of such movies, even worse then Buffy the Vampire Slayer (which I like despite its weaknesses). I watched this movie because so many are raving about the great Quentin Tarantino, but it this is an example of his work, I will go back and watch old Ed Wood movies in preference. Oh, it also claims to be a comedy. How? Comedies are supposed to make you laugh, even horror/comedies, but this thing was so ploddingly boring that nothing humorous ever emerged. And Seth Gecko actually is a ******* b****rd for abandoning that girl at the end.</fullReview>

Cold-blooded, kill-happy brothers (Clooney, Tarantino) take ex-preacher Keitel's family (and their mobile home) as hostages en route to collect their stolen loot at their rendezvous point-a strip bar in Mexico, unbeknownst to them, run by vampires! Hyperactive, hedonistic gunplay-gorefest, scripted by Rodriquez and Tarantino, allows for Clooney and Tarantino to `be cool' and impress with wise-guy attitude, but they're entertaining themselves more than the audience. Limitless blood and gore gets poured on, which could last for three movies, but it all depends on your gross-out intake. Marin gets away with playing three roles. Followed by two direct-to-video sequels. Running Time: 108 minutes and rated R for strong violence and gore, language, and nudity. **</fullReview>

Instead I got a messy horror show suitable for teenagers at a drive-in.Sometimes the violence is too violent, and to me, what happens to the hostage in the hotel is over the line.Secondly, the notion of somebody who has accepted Jesus then turning into a vampire is just plain wrong. If you've accepted Christ, then greater who is in you than who is in the world - period! Scripturally this movie is not correct, and SOMEBODY on that film crew should have noticed and corrected that. Yes, it would have changed the film. For one thing, it might have made it more interesting.Thankfully, Quentin and company have gone on to better work.

		<fullReview>*SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT*"From Dusk till Dawn" is neatly divided into two parts. The first half is a crime/road movie. The second half is a showcase for gruesome special effects. Put both parts together and you have an excellent vampire slaughter flick.Clooney and Tarantino are the Gecko brothers. They are on the run from a bloody bank robbery. They nab some hostages and bolt for Mexico. Once there, they decide to kick back in a strip club. Too bad for them it's loaded with vampires. The slaughter begins.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It's painfully obvious that the first part of the movie exists only to give the strip club massacre scenes some counterweight. "From Dusk till Dawn" has only one purpose: To show off the gory special effects as vampire after vampire gets impaled, melted, killed, destroyed etc. Fine with me. A good time was had by all.One last thing, Salma Hayek gives the greatest strip club performance ever. She doesn't even get naked. Now that's quality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Have you ever noticed that modern horror movies can sometimes run parallel with porn movies, containing horrible (yet sexy) actors with no purpose but to become eye candy as they are devoured? ?From Dusk Till Dawn' is the Avatar which finally broke this new mold and raised the bar for future horror movies to come. Plot: Two bad-boy thieves and a Faithless preacher's family become turbulently entangled on their escape to Mexico to seek sanctuary which will arrive at the break of dawn. All they need to do is make it through the night at what would seem to be the sleaziest bar in Mexico. Then Salma Hayek happens.Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino are not amateur film makers. Harvey Keitel and George Clooney are not rookie actors serving lunch on Melrose for a day job. What we have here is a flimsy idea backed by Hollywood's finest. Tarantino's ?Rebirth of Cool' combined with Rodriguez' flair for the dramatic gives the audience a joyride throughout. From every head gesture by Clooney to every `P^$$y' remark by Cheech Marin, you can tell the actors really had fun with this one. And let me tell you it's nice seeing actors having fun, for all of a sudden their true talent surfaces. Of course the soundtrack is more than adequate, only one more element drawing you in to this world of murderers and thieves. The film editing is actually very appropriate and only enhances the overall intentions of the film.*Spoiler*After watching the film a few times more I began to realize the story is more a fantasy, where El Rey is merely a mythical location for sanctuary. The subjects were put more or less to a test of faith. It is not uncommon for these movie makers to include some folklore and legend. This movie dives in to regions of the occult and makes reference to Anne Rice's idea of the Theater of Vampires. When Salma Hayek begins the body shot, the coin flips. The movie becomes Hitchcock morphed in to ?Evil Dead'*End Spoiler*Bottom Line: What if Quentin Tarantino began drinking half way through his screen writing process and decided to make his action/comedy into a B-Movie Zombie Flick? Would it stand up in court? Answer: Yes it would. What if Rodriguez had to come up with a movie to rival ?Desperado'? Would he sell out to Hollywood? Answer: ?From Dusk Till Dawn' (Then Came ?Spy Kids'). At a great pinnacle in their careers, QT and RR assemble an extraordinary cast to execute what some may call the worst movie ever and others may deem genius</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Directors Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino have different styles of making pictures for audiences, where they would have different taste in violence and culture in their movies; now they work together with a different project: Vampires! Though Robert Rodriguez brings in the Latin spice and Quentin Tarantino brings in the pop culture with the black and white gangster suits, it's a wild ride.The synopsis of "From Dusk Till Dawn" deals with the murderous Gecko Brothers, Seth (George Clooney) and Richie (Quentin Tarantino) who are on a running spree from the authority. Seth is the play-it-cool and older brother while Richie has his own psychopathic thoughts; and in the film's prologue, Richie shoots a deputy for no reason, but assumes that the clerk ratted them out.As they are on the run, The Gecko Brothers have a female bank teller hostage in the back of their trunk and later while Seth is gone, Richie rapes her and makes up an excuse for why he killed her.After Richie screws up the plan, knowing that they might get caught, Seth decides to take action and force a minister named Jacob (Harvey Keitel) and his children Kate and Scott (Juliette Lewis and Ernest Liu) to take them to Mexico, or else they'll be executed one by one.Jacob takes his RV with the kids and the Gecko Brothers where they make it across the border and go to a strip bar where Seth and Richie have to meet some associates. In the strip bar, bikers and truckers punch each other while strippers dance around them.Everything turns to hell after a lap dance in which the battle begins when all the strippers turn into vampires killing a supporting character and the rest of the bikers and truckers as the survivors try to make it to the night without getting killed."From Dusk Till Dawn" is like the "Evil Dead" series where it is fun from beginning to finish with George Clooney in his first breakout role and the collaboration of Rodriguez and Tarantino makes this film a funhouse.</fullReview>

Then everyone, including a leather-man and a war vet, has to band together to ward off impending doom. What begins with a real power-house fire (literally), takes it's share of big punches from it's inability to even out what's written that shouldn't necessarily be filmed, and what's filmed that need not be written.George Clooney may be the king in a motel living room, but he doesn't quite fit in later at the bar. Juliette Lewis plays too many different personality traits into her part. Cheech Marin portrays 3 obnoxious characters, the best of which being the last. But again, this wins huge favors for it's terrific special effects. One scene which was omitted from the film features an effect that was an homage to a film by John Carpenter, The Thing, where a monster's stomach opens to reveal a mouthful of teeth.The creative pairing of Rodriguez and Tarantino doesn't quite work out here. Film loses serious steam as it progresses- especially just as the cast enters the bar.

		<shortDescription>A disappointing, indecisive mind-numb film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is about two bankrobbers and their three hostages who stop at a bar in Mexico. Once there all kinds of boring "i-saw that-a-mile-away" type things happen, as they fight against the dark forces who own and patronize the bar. For the first half this movie is a crime drama about the relationship between two brother bank robbers. Then, halfway through, it becomes a campy, shoot-em-up, blood and guts gore fest that totally forgets the first portion of the movie. This movie is to quirky to be horror, not funny enough to be dark comedy, and too strange to be anything else. If it is simply a man-vs-monster movie, then why the beginning bits with Richie and the first hostage, or the entire opening convenience store sequence? Why the incredibly lame (belongs in Wild Wild West) gun of Sex Machine? There are many scenes and developments that don't really fit in the movie.There were a couple of fun scenes in the movie, during the fights etc, but even those were not truly enjoyable as they really shortchange the vampire legacy. Since when do vampires explode when shot, or melt when stabbed? This movie is more akin to Buffy (without the wit or charisma of that show) then to anything remotely resembling the Count Dracula type vampires. George Clooney is good, along with Keitzel (sp?) but you know a movie is lame when the best thing about it is Seth Gecko's tattoo.A watchable movie, but only good if you are in an inebriated state.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing it's explosive opening (pun intended), I knew that From Dusk Till Dawn would not be your average thriller. What starts out like Natural Born Killers ends up like Evil Dead. That's what I love about this movie- you just have no idea what to expect. Also, as most movies even remotely related to Quentin Tarantino, this has a great cast. Everyone from Harvey Keitel and George Clooney, to Cheech Marin who has not 1, not 2, but 3 roles.Don't expect too much character developlement or symbolism in From Dusk Till Dawn, you won't find it. Make sure to expect a lot of vampires, though. You won't be disappointed in that area. There's plenty of gore and catchy lines, I garantee that you'll be kept entertained during the course of the movie.I really liked From Dusk Till Dawn. It's no Citizen Kane but it's good in it's own feild. Pure entertainment. My rating: 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I find myself drawn to Quentin Tarantino (even though I try to constantly avoid any of his violent offerings)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is the product of Quentin Tarantino's dark mind. It's bloody violence cleverly disguised as cartoonish, vampire shenanigans.But I actually want to talk about sex according to Richard Gecko. Apparantly it's all about sucking toes.Richie Gecko (Tarantino) is a violent, psycotic, odd, perverted would-be-rapist who thinks that his brother, 'I'm a professional f*cking thief' Seth Gecko (swooney Clooney) is something more than what he really is. Seth is in fact an intelligent, poker-faced, straightforward thief. Richie's just insane. He has an obsession with the by-products of being bad, murdering, raping and swearing just a few of them. And so by the time the vampires pop up endures toe-sucking, seduction and death at the hands of sexy but evil 'Santanco Pandemonium' (Selma Hayek). (she turns into a human-snake and sucks his neck dry). Another Tarantino induced fantasy I wonder? To be ravaged by a sexy woman and er....being sucked to death..)I dunno.What I do know is that I am fasinated by how Quentin wrote all this dark stuff into this comedy/action/horror/drama/porno flick and make it acceptable and enjoyable. Crack open a beer and enjoy it for what it is. A clever, fun flick. Interesting to the max with Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis, that Cheech bloke, and someone else I recognise.Hey I must have liked this film, I bought the DVD and I'm female for christssakes! 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From Dusk Til Dawn - A unique &amp; original Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'From dusk Till Dawn' is a vampire/horror flick unlike most others. Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez came together after finishing 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Desperado' (respectively) to make this film, which was when they were at both (arguably) at their peaks (peaks in fame, it is much hard to say when someone had their creativity peak). The uniqueness of this film stems from how there are no vampires, or hard-core action, for the first half of the film. Then it shifts gears and turns into a blood-bath shoot'em up show. Until this change in the style of the film happens, this show could have been finished in endless ways (I can't really give examples of this without spoiling the film. with the exception that before you see any vampires, they could of finished this movies as a non-vampire movie). The start and middle of the show can stand independent of the rest of the film (it still leads up to the end of the film). I found the dialog to be cleaver and funny. George Clooney fills the shoes of the main character very well (that is, he acts as a smart confident professional criminal). This movie is, without a doubt, a cheesy and cheeky horror show. But as long as you know what kind of film to expect, 'From Dusk Till Dawn' can be a very enjoyable flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical Tarantino sadistic incoherence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had nursed a mild interest in seeing this movie since it came out.I liked the energy of Desperado, though I despise the pointless, unfunny sadism of Tarantino. I knew he was in it, but I didn't know that he wrote it. I fast-forwarded through the first hour in which Clooney and Tarantino play sociopathic thieves. I wanted to see them both die. I do not find Tarantino's "isn't it just NUTS that nice, innocent people get their brains spattered apart while scumbags live through it all??!?!? huh?!?!!?" aesthetic very interesting, and that's what the first hour was. I kept saying to myself, well, is something going to HAPPEN in this movie? When the vampires finally do arrive, it is just pointless, seemingly unorchestrated attacks, one after another, until the end. I rented this not because I'm an art movie snob, but because I've been on a cheap horror jag, but throwing in all the best bits from all the other movies one has seen does not make a good movie itself. Even during the mayhem, this was BORING. It also seemed so DATED! It was like "Oh yeah, the Tarantino 90s." A friend of mine told me he watched Pulp Fiction, which he worshipped at the time, and it seemed really trite and lame now as well. Our only consolation is that Tarantino's career will soon be forever over. Skip this one.--- Check out website devoted to bad and cheesy movies: www.cinemademerde.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enormously enjoyable trash classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'From Dusk Til Dawn' is one of the very few recent movies that can hold its head up high with the very best exploitation movies of the 60s and 70s. Think AIP. Think Roger Corman, Jack Hill, Lucio Fulci, Larry Cohen, William Lustig. If any of those names mean anything to you then this movie is absolutely essential viewing! Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino, hot off the successes of 'Desperado' and 'Pulp Fiction' respectively, found themselves of being in the enviable position of being able to take Tarantino's early script intended for a low budget b-grade horror/exploitation movie, and being able to make it with a lot more money than originally envisioned, and with their dream cast of characters actors and cult favourites. They obviously relished this once in a lifetime opportunity, and really took all the way, ending up with one of the most enjoyable and entertaining movies in years. George Clooney, a household name via 'E.R', but let's face it, a veteran of many awful and forgettable TV shows and movies, is a revelation here in a star making lead role as Seth Gecko. Tarantino himself gives his most convincing acting performance to date as his psychotic brother Richard. Harvey Keitel gives first class support as a vacationing ex-priest who unfortunately crosses their path. Juliette Lewis plays Keitel's daughter in a slightly underwritten role that only has a few standout scenes. The rest of the cast is outstanding and includes everyone from Cheech Marin ('Up In Smoke') to Tom Savini ('Dawn Of The Dead'), Michael Parks ('Then Came Bronson'), to Fred Williamson ('Black Caesar'), John Saxon ('Enter The Dragon') to Danny Trejo ('Heat'), as well as mega-babe and Rodriguez regular Salma Hayek in an unforgettable sequence as Santanico Pandemonium. This is the ultimate beer and pizza movie and on that level is difficult to fault. A highly recommended fun filled modern trash classic!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A fun movie from Robert Rodriguez and a great cast of George Clooney, Quentin Tarantino (who wrote the story), Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis, Selma Hayek, and Cheech Marin (who played three roles). This is a rather violent, action movie that could have easily been a turn off, but Robert Rodriguez took Quentin's story and they made an entertaining movie. Quentin's characters always seem to have so much life to them and I think that's what makes the movie better. It could have easily just been a cheesy, totally unbelievable action/horror piece. Not that we're going to walk away thinking what happened could really happen, but as I was watching the movie I wasn't considering the plausibility and was just enjoying the ride. Nice little bits of comedy thrown in which I think made it that much easier to take the violent parts. I loved the neon sigh outside of the "Titty Twister".*** (Out of 4)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I tell some of this movie so if you ain't seen this movie than don't read this review. I have always enjoyed watching scary vampire movies for entertainment. You know, movies like the 1931 Classic Dracula where Doctor Van Helseing hunts Dracula to end his reign of terror? Or, what about John Carpenter's "Vampires", where the slayers find the nest, awake the bloodsuckers and the vampires are steaked and baked! I knew the movie "From Dusk Till Dawn" was a vampire flick so I watched it. But, after watching it, I realized there was something different in this flick then just a vampire movie. Let me explain what I mean. I'm leaving the actors names out because you can see them on this sight or the other viewers reviews. "From Dusk Till Dawn" begins with a genuine All-American hero, a Texas Ranger by the name of Earl McGraw who is tough and ready to go after two outlaws, the Gecko's, who escaped from prison. Ranger McGraw enters an isolated Texas liquor store where he speaks to the clerk about the situation of the escaped felons. He buys a beer and goes to the restroom totally unaware that in the back of the same liquor store the outlaws are holding two hostages at gunpoint. The Ranger then returns from the restroom with his back to the outlaws. He begins his conversation with the clerk where within an instant he is shot in the back of the head in a cold, cowardly act of murder. Falling to the ground, he is repeatedly shot. Afterwards, the outlaws murder the clerk and the world of liquor goes up in flames. From there the outlaws rape and mutilate an innocent woman. All of this happens in the first few minutes of the movie. The outlaw Gecko brothers then take a family hostage in their RV and cross into Mexico. There they are to meet an associate Mexican druglord at a bar, the Titty Twister, a bar that is owned by bloodsucking vampire goons. From there on, there are more unsavory charactors getting crazy and that's before the vampires even attack. But, when they do attack, boy do they ever! It is some of the most satanic, evil, bloodsucking vampires that I have ever seen in a movie. The makeup man and one of the writer's of "From Dusk Till Dawn" is Robert Kurtzman. This dude must be one of Hollywoods best horror, gory makeup artists. He has been a makeup artist for John Carpenter's "Vampires" and 2001 movie "Thirteen Ghosts" and thats just a couple of the many scary ones. The trouble with "From Dusk Till Dawn" is the entire movie is that I wanted to see the Gecko brothers get killed as bad as any bloodsuckin vamp-goons and thats pretty bad. What I discovered is deeper than just a vampire flick. "From Dust Till Dawn" is typical Hollywood verses the backbone of America with the unnecessary vicious murder of a Texas Ranger and two other murders. Robert Rodriguez, Robert Kurtzman and Quentin Tarantino show their disrespect for law and order, decency, morality and their outright hatred for our American heroes! Out of a scale of 1-10, I give this movie "From Dusk Till Dawn" a big, fat zero. Thats 0 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From Dusk Till Dawn is a good example of Quentin Tarantino's unfathomable desire to participate in fun but pointless endeavors rather than utilizing his talents to make more masterpieces like Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. FD2D is essentially half a crime movie followed by a filmmaker's thesis on horror film special effects. While visually interesting, the second segment of the film, for which it won its devoted fans, is pretty unintriguing, as it poses us with a battle of horribly disfigured biker ghouls against a troop of characters so unengaging that you're not really sure who to root for. The great irony of FD2D is that it wastes the undeniable talents of Harvey Keitel, while Tarantino, not previously known as a good actor, actually puts in the most entertaining job of anyone. In any case, From Dusk Till Dawn is a bad film, as are all of Rodriguez' films (yes, including El Mariachi), and I urge you to avoid it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A "dumb and dumber" Clooney &amp; Tarantino meet the vampires...about as gross as any movie can get...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was a complete turnoff for me. I only watched it for George Clooney and wondered how he could sink so low as to want to use this as his big screen opportunity.It's a strange combination of slasher/vampire film that has no focus and splits up into too many directions to form a coherent story. The characters have as much depth as cartoon creations and all of them are as freakish and pathetic as anyone can get. George Clooney mumbles his way through his role in a way that suggests he'd rather be back in "ER" with its own kind of gore than splashing the blood of vampires. Frankly, he ought to be better at choosing material than this mess.The story starts out as a gutsy crime drama but soon veers into downright nightmarish activity at a Mexican border bar staffed by vampires. Nudity, foul language, vulgar expletives--everything is poured on thick to appeal to today's younger movie-goers who have an appetite for sex, sadism and buckets of blood. About as gross as any movie can get without leaving you with a queasy stomach.Of course, you'll get the opposite opinion from those who think Quentin Tarantino is the master of pulp horror. This graphic depiction of vampirism is sure to have them raving that this is a masterpiece only a genius like Tarantino could have invented.Clooney still has to prove himself on the big screen. His "Batman" and "Perfect Storm" appearances still indicate he should have stayed in "ER" awhile longer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In its duplicity lies the film's beauty... (RISK OF SPOILERS. SNIPPETS OF DIALOGUE CONTAIN CONCEALED OBSCENITIES)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The change of pace halfway through helps the film, because although the audience should have been having a perfectly good time up until then, it keeps us glued firmly to our seats lest we miss any more surprises. The film would surely have flagged had it continued in its linear direction, but the change in tone ensures that's never allowed to happen. The film begins at almost breakneck pace and never slows down. The tone of the horror is B-movie stuff, but that's okay, since the characters evidently KNOW they've encountered some surreal events. Whatever else you can call dialogue from Quentin Tarantino, it's never boring, and the characters are all sufficiently interesting to keep us wondering just how they'll cope with their descent into the maelstrom. This is supported by the excellent casting. Whatever the titles may say, Clooney is the real star of the show, as evidenced by my favourite lines section at the end of this review. The man has charisma to burn, and he displays plenty of it here. The film is such a compendium of unexpected moments that years from now some instances will be regarded as 'classic'. Heck, the whole film deserves to be regarded as such for it's daring approach to such an established legend. You are almost sure to form bonds with the characters, quote the dialogue and reminisce with friends about favourite moments. It's that kind of film. Relax, have a few favourite snacks/refreshing beverages handy. Preferably have company while you watch; and have a ball. It's DEFINITELY not high art, and there are times when it threatens to derail itself completely, but it's glorious fun.MY BEST LINES: - "Don't you ever try and f***ing run on us, 'cos I got six little friends, and they can all run faster than you can." - "Is my s**t together, or is my s**t together?" MAN: "What's your name, girlie?" GIRL: "Kate" MAN: "Sex Machine, Kate; pleased t'meetcha" - "I just rammed a wooden stake into my brother's heart because he turned into a vampire, and I don't believe in vampires. Apart from that I'm peachy Kate, the world is my oyster." - "You touch my brother with that stake, biker, and vampires aren't gonna have to suck your blood, they're gonna be able to lick it up off the floor" - SETH: "I don't care about livin' or dyin' anymore, I just wanna send as many of these devils back to hell as I can" JACOB: "Amen" - "I may be a b****rd, Kate, but at least I'm not a f***in b****rd" and my absolute favourite: "Psycho's do not explode when sunlight hits them, I don't give a f**k how crazy they are!" - Dave - </fullReview>

		<fullReview>"From Dusk Till Dawn" is a disorganized mess which doesn't know what it wants to be. Does it want to be a horror film or a cops-and-robbers flick? A domestic drama or a human comedy? The movie seems to want to have it both ways and the result is an unbelievable mess!It was written by Quentin Tarantino and directed by Robert Rodriguez. Both are talented writer/directors. What went wrong?Well, for starters, Tarantino's script has no focus; it tries to be the horror equivalent of "Pulp Fiction" but without that film's slickness and charm. His performance is even worse. Someone should tell Quentin that while he is a really nice guy and is a talented writer and director, he should stay behind the camera. I imagine he pulled this script from the bottom of the drawer after "Pulp Fiction"'s success.Second, the film's first half is jumbled and boring. We want to see the good stuff and we get it but we have to sit through an hour of crazy talk and boring nonsense. And the vampire stuff is way too over the top to be effective. That is what plagued "Fright Night Part II" and the same happens here.There are some good moments among the sleaze. Cheech Marin is funny in a triple role; and George Clooney works hard to salvage this mess. He has a great screen presence and great films such as "Three Kings" and "The Perfect Storm" confirm it.But even they cannot save the irreparable damage from the first half and while stylish and funny, "From Dusk Till Dawn" is too little too late.* out of 4 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vampires, plenty of gore, a great Quentin script and Salma Hayek dancing in a bikini. (A fantastic film!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This still ranks as one of my favorite horror/thriller films of all time. It really caught me off guard the first time I saw it since I was expecting wall-to-wall vampire action throughout the film (as it was advertised.) But the film is much more than just vampires.SPOILERS AHEAD: What makes this film work so well, is that for the first hour or so, the film is actually a fugitives-on-the-run film with George Clooney and Quentin Taratino in great form as the Gecko brothers. They're trying to figure out how to get across the Mexican border after making a bank robbery in the heart of Texas. They end up taking a family hostage and using their motor home to get across the border, so they can set up their rendezvous with Carlos. They end up going to a strip bar called The Titty Twister and that is where the movie takes it's fun twist.It just so happens that this bar is run and populated by VAMPIRES! The movie then turns into an all-out gore fest (I'm surprised they squeaked by with an R-rating) with plenty of over the top action. Why this works is that the viewer spends plenty of time getting to know the characters very well, so when they are plunged unexpectedly into this otherworldly situation it makes it believable and we care about what happens to the characters. Everything about this movie is top notch, from the acting, to the outstanding gore effects by the maestros at KNB. Plus, any movie where the gorgeous Salma Hayek gets to do an extremely sexy dance wearing a fine bikini has got to be good. Plus getting to see Fred Williamson and Tom Savini really getting into their roles is a treat. A great and highly original film that is definitely worth a look if you didn't care for it the first time around. It's easily one of my top ten favorite films of the 90's.Tons of fun and extremely entertaining.Rating:9.5</fullReview>

Bravo to Harvey Keitel for his great, against-type portrayal of Jacob Fuller (can that guy ever give a bad performance?), and also to George Clooney, who did a great job as Seth. I'd say that the hardest thing for me to swallow about the plot was not the vampires, but the idea of Tarantino and Clooney as brothers (how, exactly, did that happen?).

		<fullReview>This movie is both silly and stupid, but I like it. I like silly and stupid, and this is a great movie to watch on a Saturday with a couple of friends. It has demented humor, and I can be a twisted sort, so I got a few laughs. It has it all humor, action, and a very ruf edge. This is not a terms of endurment type film, for what its worth the acting and directing is very good. It is a unbelievable film, with a stupied concept, like Repo Man, and just as entertaining. If you want to be entertained, watch this one for the fun of it. This film is not for the serious at heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is there a better actor than George Clooney?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, first of all let me just make this very clear. I have never watched one single episode of ER in my life ( honest ). So what I am about to say has nothing to do with some ridiculous love for the show. Having said that, let me tell you that George Clooney makes this film the classic that it is. It is a great fi, because of Tarantino's writing and Rodriguez' style and it has a fun story and the other actors are really good in it. But there is just something about Clooney that makes every scene that he's in believable. His interpretation of Seth Gecko is so amazing and so believable. Take for instance the scene in the bar when he is teaching Kate how to slam a shooter. He downs his own and then slams his glass down three times on the table. It is tiny subtleties like this that make his interpretation of his character so real. Every scene that he is in is a lesson in acting. He can take any dialogue, whether it is bad or good and hit just the right note. Take for instance the film A Thin Red Line. Now that was a really really really bad movie. But when he was on screen for 30 seconds, it made me forget that it was a bad movie and I was absorbed by what his character was saying. Now that is power.Someday Clooney is going to win an Oscar and when he does people will look back at his career and say " You know what? He was really good in that weird Tarantino film. " And I'll say I told you so.This film is a lot of fun and it has a lot of twists and turns and plus Tom Savini is in the film and that is worth seeing as well. But for a clinic in acting and a great character he has to work with, see this film, you will be so happy you did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film knowing nothing about it except the director and cast. I'd been warned it was awful, and I and my wife would periodically say, "how could she have hated such a fun movie?" It was a zippy. violent action flick.Then, half-way through: vampires! I mean, if you'd seen the trailer and knew it was a vampire flick you're reaction could have been "at last, vampires," but my reaction was "huh?" This is not a plot twist, this is a derailment.That was my first shock. My second shock was coming to imdb and finding all these favorable reviews. The movie looks to be two separate movies of Tarentino's, one good action flick and one bad vampire movie stuck together because he couldn't finish either one. In spite of being a terrific film for the first hour, the second part was so bad that I would tell anyone who asked that the movie sucked, pure and simple. It was stupid with a capitol STU.Eeech.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know the love of Quentin Tarantino for B-movies, even exploitation movies, so you can't expect too much from this one. Robert Rodriguez shoots it fine, although you can feel in the quiet moments, the 'quasi lulls', that it was not really his movie.What's very good in From Dusk Till Dawn is the dialog. Tarantino is definitely a master movie speech writer. He may steal from the ton of movies he has digested, he, the mad movie-hungry monster, he does it really fine, as a real connoisseur, not as a low-life grave-digger.What's really bad in the movie? The sick violence meant to be entertaining. Rich Gecko is a sicko and Tarantino thinks he is being funny. It's horrendous to depict such a degree of realistic violence tongue in cheek. Seth Gecko is supposed to be cleaner, while no smarter, yet that doesn't even it out. If that's the way it was intended then Seth Gecko is a bad excuse for his brother's excesses. The part in the desert where the body count goes way up is much more gore than the exposition with the Gecko bros but it's only cheap teenage stuff. You may feel it's dull as I do, or enjoy it because you like cheap; the fact is: sick realistic violence in the beginning is not washed out by the funky carnage that makes the bulk of the movie.Ironically enough, the disturbing start was more interesting than the contrived party in the Mexican desert. The last shot was great though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two mediocre films for the price of one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Story: Seth &amp; Richard Gecko, two violent criminals on the run from the law, kidnap an ex-minister &amp; his children in order to escape into Mexico. While waiting for a contact at the Titty Twister, a dusk-till-dawn bar for truckers &amp; bikers, they are attacked by an army of vampires &amp; must fight till dawn to survive.It's not often you get to see two different directors (&amp; good friends) combine their talents to make a genre film such as this. Working from an old script that Tarantino wrote when he was still a video store clerk, Rodriguez creates two different films for the price of one. The first 40 minutes consist of a fairly average getaway film. But instead of being hip, there is no wit in the dialogue, the acting is mediocre &amp; the characterizations one-dimensional. Plus George Clooney's character tries to be likable but fails. Things get worse when the film changes once the characters reach the Titty Twister. The gore flies think &amp; fast, along with credibility ? the characters learn how to kill vampires in next to no time, yet later have a discussion on how to kill them. Fred Williamson's speech on how he decimated a Viet Cong squad is purely unnecessary. Tom Savini's biker Sex Machine wields a genital-shaped gun, one of the most stupid weapons ever designed &amp; later turns into a huge rat for no reason at all. There is a lot of blood, but it has no real effect.Score: 4 out of 10</fullReview>

Good dialogue, great actors, etc. Then it was just turned into nonsense....heads flying off, blood shooting out of limbs, etc....horrible. I am not a fan of vampire movies, but I would say that this is the worst one that I have ever seen.

		<fullReview>This is a non-stop roller coaster ride of a movie. If you are a fan of Robert Rodriguez and / or Quentin Tarantino you will hands down love this movie. Whether you are a fan of the vampire genre or every horror movies, From Dusk til Dawn is a movie devoted to the traditional cult movie with its storyline and cast. The most interesting thing about the movie is its cast. You have many big name stars, but none of them are Hollywood esq. actors. Most if not all the actors were at one time in their lives, struggling actors. Many have done independent / low budget movies because they would never say "no" to work. Harvey Keitel couldn't find work for years, George Clooney started out on the Facts of Life and Juliette Lewis keeps surprising us all with the kinds of movie roles shes chooses. Salma Hayek, Cheech Marin and Tom Savini add their talents to the movie as well. All three are best examples of actors who got to where they are with their own talent. Neither one had to sell out, use other people or have a cousin working in the industry for them to get an opportunity to be in movies. From Dusk til Dawn is a labor of love to the popular cult genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beginning with a fine story of two brothers on the run with a kidnap victim in tow, looking for a means to escape and live the high life. After Tarantino's character murders their hostage, they turn to Jacob (Keitel) a faithless priest travelling with his children to help them cross the border. Scared for his children's lives, he help the murderous duo reach the 'Titty Twister' a dodgy bar in Mexico, and that's where film number 2 begins.Very quickly the movie becomes a vampire slasher flick, that is extremely gory and all in all pretty unexpected.The film remains humorous throughout and never quite takes itself seriously enough to be become cheesy and the cast are all on top form throughout.For its originality and high octane entertainment i give this 9/10. its just sheer mindless (and bloody) fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'From Dusk 'Til Dawn' is one of the greatest exploitation movies of all time. As wild, creative and unique as any of the cult favourites of movie history, it has an extraordinary ability to cross genres. Gangster, road movie, action, horror, comedy... it's fitting that all of the lead characters are so different (preacher man, adolescent girl, Chinese boy, super-cool gangster, retarded killer... versus a bunch of vampires!)The key difference here is that movies with this kind of outrageous energy are usually zero-budget labours-of-love... whereas this one stars George Clooney, Harvey Keitel and Juliette Lewis, and is scripted by one of the best writers in Hollywood.But this is the key point. Despite it's budget and cast list, this is STILL AN EXPLOITATION MOVIE! It's not a cross-over mainstream multi-plex hit like 'Pulp Fiction' or 'Reservoir Dogs', this is genuine, anarchic, genre film-making. So if your favourite movie is the F***ING SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION or worse, Star Wars, then GO AWAY! This film ISN'T FOR YOU! WE DON'T WANT TO HEAR YOUR OPINION! We don't need you whining on about how it was 'two films in one', or about how you were 'really into it until all that weird vampire stuff happened'... Stick to your Adam Sandler DVDs, you were never going to understand this type of film!Phew, that's better. I think I'll go and lie down in the dark now...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely love this film, every time it comes on T.V. It never tires me, it's always a joy to watch.This is a Vampire movie with an attitude, and humorous dialogue. George Clooney is not my favorite actor, but his performance is good in this one. Robert Roderiguez of the SPYkids movies directs this Horror Adventure.Seth Gecko (Clooney), and Richard Gecko (Tarantino) play Two Murderous Criminal Brothers on the run from the law, and their only chance of escape is moving to Mexico (a place that is now full of wanted people in the Movie world). To devise a quick route to their destination, they take hostages, a Trailer-travelling Family- Jacob Fuller (Keitel)as a preacher who lost his faith, his Son Scott Fuller (Liu), and his Daughter Kate (Lewis).The delusional Richard takes an obsessive interest in Kate and this distracts him from his duties. By luck they reach the Mexican border and force the Fuller family to go into a Strip bar called the TITTY TWISTER for a meeting of a crime boss.Santanico Pandemonium played by the sexy Salma Hayek (who is now playing Frida) does a belly dance and shows off her curves, I don't fancy girls, but somehow Salma doing that serpent dance made me twist my sexuality for 2 minutes. That is the most seductive scene in movie history, or of my History!!! And I don't mind watching it all over again.....and again.It's not long before the Gecko Brothers got themselves into trouble, as a result Richard's hand was shot and bloody, turning frenzied Salma into a lizard-like blood Sucker and attacked and bitten Richard, who becomes a vampire; Seth had to end his brother's life. Seth is angered and retailiates, by begging the survivors including the Fullers to fight for their lives, and the blood bath begins.They are fantastic one-lines coming from the Actors that flow more than the River Nile, for example Vampire Musicians were on stage, Sex machine (Savini) said to Frost (Williamson) 'let's kill that F****** Band' and the blood Sucking singer sticks a finger gesture 'F*** you and Good Night' *Kaboom* the band blows up. Kietel becomes a Preacher with attitude using a Crucifix-style Gun. Salma tells Seth that he will be her slave and pet dog, Seth replies with a gun 'No Thanks, I already had a Wife'. and the ending is bloody good. Pure Classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Among the best of its kind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I hear the words campy horror, a specific handful of names come to mind. One of them is Rodriguez and Tarantino's From Dusk Till Dawn. Thought it is extremely Silly, Gory and so far into the red zone that it is at times just shy of black, the film not only delivers the goods, but it delivers them which a descent sense of black humour, a sensational make up effects job, and a cast of characters that you actually end up kind of liking more than one usually does with these movies (well some of them arn't so likable). Once you watch it, you'll know what I mean. If this is your thing and you haven't seen this flick yet, you really and truly should.It is a "hot God damn day" in Big Springs, Texas when the movie starts, Seth and Richard Gecko, are the most notorious bandits in the state and are responsible for the deaths of a good twenty people (both cops and civilians) After blowing up a liqueur store in scene one, they know they have to get over the border before the FBI get them (the Mexican border that is, not the Canadian). The Gecko Bros highjack a retired priest and his family who have a big RV, and devise a plan to get across. After they do, the gang heads for a bar with the degrading name "Titty Twister". It is inconveniently in the middle of nowhere. There they plan to have a night of drinking and parting, but all is not as it seems. All the staff and dancers turn out to be vampires, and in a few moments of extreme gore they kill everyone but our heroes and a couple of bikers. Can our gang survive the remainder of the night, fighting back with what little means they have?I did a lot of research on the movie before I saw it. All sources say that this is the goriest film in modern cinema. In a way it is, but Robert Rodriguez has a couple of tricks up his sleeve. He makes the gore look intentionally unrealistic (ex. Green blood, lots of goo) because if it looked to convincing, the MPAA might give the film an NC-17 rating or perhaps even ban it from theatres. Regardless, From Dusk Till Dawn is still pretty gross but it is not vomit provoking (unless of course this is your first movie).There are a lot of other things to say about From Dusk till Dawn, many of them good, but a few which are not so good. Regardless, it is not one to be missed. As Rodriguez says, it is a good film to get drunk on with friends at night, just don't make it a date movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Instructions to watch From Dusk Till Dawn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you have never seen From Dusk Till Dawn, I think the experience will be more enjoyable for you if you follow these simple instructions: - Put the DVD/Blu-Ray into the player and press "Play" - Yow will start watching a movie about two fugitive robbers, one of them a paranoid, sex-obsessed psycho, who cross paths with the family of a preacher who has lost his faith after the tragic death of his wife.- Enjoy the tense and riveting thriller, which boasts some great dialogue, brilliant direction, and good performances from a cast that oozes charisma; even Tarantino does a decent job. (The only weak point is the Chinese lad who plays Harvey Keitel's son, and who seems incapable to convey any emotion whatsoever, but it's just a minor drawback.) - When the characters arrive at the Titty Twister, you might notice the film starting to become a little corny, but don't worry, just hold on for a minute, the best scene of the movie is coming up.- Marvel and drool at the phenomenal physique of Salma Hayek, whose body is so perfect in this movie she seem almost superhuman. Even if you're a lady, you will have to agree that her scene is definitely something out of the ordinary.- As soon as the music ends and George Clooney says the famous line, "Now that's what I call a f***ing show!", STOP THE PLAYER.- Not just stop the player, but eject the disc, put it in the box, and take it back to the video store right away. This is to avoid the temptation you might have to press "PLAY" again sometime later in the day, which you would regret.- Now go for a walk, or sit in your favourite a bar with a drink, and try to imagine how the story might continue from that point on. Maybe Tarantino jumps on Juliette Lewis and forces Harvey Keitel to finally confront the brothers and bring them to justice (with the help of Satanico, who ironically turns out to be a devout Christian); maybe when Carlos arrives he turns out to be an undercover Mexican Federal working with the FBI and the brothers continue their escape taking the family (and Satanico) with them deeper into Mexico and becoming more and more desperate along the way; maybe "Carlos" double-crosses them and they are all forced to hole themselves up in the bar and fight together for their lives against the Mexican mob...- but WHATEVER you come up with, I guarantee you this: it will be better than the absurd silliness that Tarantino and Rodriguez cooked up, ruining what could have otherwise been a very good film. Therefore, your viewing experience of From Dusk Till Dawn will be better than that of all the people who have had the misfortune of watching the whole thing from start to finish and witnessing how something that could have been great was trashed by a childish whim.- You're welcome :-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From Good to Awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know, before this movie, I never thought that Quentin Tarantino could've been involved in anything bad. Well my friends, I have seen the devil, and its name is From Dusk Till Dawn.This movie follows the rest of Tarantino's catalog and centers around a couple of lowlife thugs. In this case, it's the Gecko brothers, Seth and Ritchie (George Clooney and Tarantino himself). They're on the run from the law and about to cross the border into Mexico and Freedom. Their ticket out is the Fuller family (Harvey Keitel, Ernest Liu, and Juliette Lewis) also heading into Mexico. The Gecko brothers take the family hostage and, after making it across the border, hang out at the designated meeting place: a topless bar.Now for the fun part. It turns out that the bar is a late-nite hangout for vampires. And guess who's on the menu tonight?Appalled yet? I am. It's not that I'm against the idea in the first place, but these are two different movies duct taped together by one dance sequence. Sorry guys, it just doesn't work.When watching this movie, I felt like I was driving in a car that, for no reason whatsoever, suddenly jumped into a higher gear and took off at full speed. The first hour of the movie was more than watchable; it was pretty damn good. I loved the characters of the Gecko brothers and I thought that the movie would be about the conflict between the calm, calculating Seth and the unpredictable Ritchie, who will shoot or rape whomever he pleases. In fact, when he first sees Juliette Lewis' character, he imagines her asking him for oral sex. Ritchie, in my mind, was the time bomb of the movie, waiting to go off and throw the plot into a tailspin. Whoo boy, was I wrong.The second hour of the movie is the schlockiest of horror films you've ever seen. After seeing Robert Rodriguez' "Sin City", I knew that he had a taste for on screen violence. Well, this movie is more of the same. The vampires of the movie are the best that 1996 special effects could produce. That doesn't really say much, but man, are they gory. People's arms are ripped off their bodies, heads are hollowed out by shotguns, and one vampire is vanquished by having his heart ripped from his body and staked by a toothpick. Fun wow, huh?The first half of the movie had Tarantino's trademark element of humor. For instance, the first time we see Seth and Ritchie, they are trying to get out of a liquor store that a cop has just entered. Once the cop leaves to relieve himself, Seth and Ritchie, guns drawn, start having a discussion about whether or not the clerk tipped the cop off. It's hilariously funny and timed to perfection. Those first scenes should set the tone for the rest of the movie. And as I've probably spent too much time belaboring, halfway through, the film takes a sharp left turn. Over a bridge. Down a ravine. And into a tar pit.I wouldn't be so livid if the second half of the movie was well done. The vampire sequences in From Dusk Till Dawn have all been done before in other vampire movies, and frankly, the new parts just don't make any sense. While watching the film, I counted the following elements that caused my jaw to hit the floor, only to be reeled back up and let go again: 1. A cross composed of a shotgun and a baseball bat. 2. A hydraulic stake 3. A Holy Water Super Soaker (Can you say "Bordello of Blood"?) 4. Characters having personal moments while being devoured hoagie-style by vampires. 5. A mariachi band that, at the moment of truth, morphs into a band of mutants with bloody corpses for instruments. 6. Lines like "Okay Vampire Killers, let's kill some f***ing vampires!" 7. Multiple appearances by Cheech Marin.See what I mean? What isn't tired is plain ridiculous. And there are more examples of absurdity in this movie. You could find them yourself, but don't say I didn't warn you.Harvey Keitel, who's had a history with Tarantino, plays Jacob Fuller, a priest who lost his faith in God when his wife died. There's nothing necessarily wrong with this character or how he's portrayed, but tell me this, why is it that whenever there is a story concerning evil or Satanic creatures, the local priest chooses to question his faith then? Juliette Lewis plays his daughter. Honestly, I wish I could've gotten to know her better. Lewis is a very talented and beautiful actress, but I guess when you're stuck with a part that is basically a young girl reacting to the situation around her, it's like putting a ballet dancer in a full-body cast. The only defining personality trait about her is that she gets really good with a crossbow when the going gets tough. I mean, really, she's like the Teenage Terminator! (Not a bad idea.) And I can't really call it a "defining" personality trait because everyone gets it at the same time in this movie."From Dusk Till Dawn" just plain does not work. Tarantino and Rodriguez are very talented filmmakers, and they've proved that time and time again, but they have given both their resumes a black eye with this mutated hybrid of "Reservoir Dogs" and "Assault on Precinct 13." If you value the works of either person, avoid this movie like the vampires it portrays.</fullReview>

Everyone knows this is probably his worst movie, but you have to consider its stiff competition. Reservior Dogs, True Romance Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, and the Kill Bills are all fantastic. This movie is entertaining, funny, and it has well developed characters. Nothing is too far fetched, as long as you consider it's a movie about vampires. It's not a horror movie. Nor was it meant to be one. It is not a comedy, but it is funny. It does not really fit into any genre. It's just two hours of an dialog and action.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've read many reviews about the movie and most say that the two different stories within the movie just don't seem to connect very well. I don't really agree. I think the dramatic shift change made the movie more interesting, even though the shift change could have been made a smoother. The thing that brings the movie's rating down is the fact that the action gets really old after awhile. The action is in the EVIL DEAD style, but it just doesn't have the same way of keeping you entertained as it did in EVIL DEAD. The movie still isn't bad though. I would advise that you watch the movie because of the great PULP FICTION style dialog in the beginning of the movie. There are a bunch of really great lines. Overall, I give the movie a 6 1/2.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A grusome, fun look at Vampires and Crime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by the Producers of both "Pulp Fiction" and "Desperado," everybody thought that "Dusk Till Dawn" would probably be a masterpiece: the cream of the crop of the corroborations of two great film makers. Boy, were those optimists wrong. "From Dusk Till Dawn," in my opinion, is the combination of "Evil Dead: 2" and "Pulp Fiction". It yields grusome action with a scary twist with a crime world twist with a funny twist. If you like grusome, funny violence, then you'll like "Dusk Till Dawn". This movie, despite all the bad publicity, is actually a pretty good movie if you don't mind blood, gore, nudity, and profanity. If you're a teen-ager, you'll love it; if you're older, especially if you're a parent, you'll hate it. Choose wisely, but either way, just enjoy the work of two directors who just wanted to have some fun. My rating: (professional) 6/10, (sheer fun) 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Horror Film From The Mind Of Tarantino? YOU CAN'T GO WRONG!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was such a blast! I liked it so much, I watched it two times in a row! When the credits were rolling, I wanted more, so I just played the film again right away. The acting is great, the direction is better then great, and there is not even a word to describe how good the writing is!The two main characters in the film are Richard Gecko and Seth Gecko. They are brothers and partners in crime. They are on they're way to Mexico for a big "business deal"But they need a ride there, so they take a family of three hostages, and force them to take them where they need to go. Little do they know, that they are on they're way to a living hell. Anyone who watches movies must see this film. It is almost perfect. It would be perfect, accept for the fact that the kid who plays Harvey Keitel's son can't act. But aside from that, everything about this movie is awesome. Harvey Keitel's performance as the loving father is great and very convincing. George Clooney's plays the part of Seth perfect. Nobody else could have done it better. People will see a whole new side of Tarantino when they see him play the part of Richie. He is a total psycho.A must see!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A father (Keitel) and his children (Lewis and Liu) are kidnapped by the dangerous Gecko brothers (Clooney and Tarantino) who are dangerously desperate to get past the Mexican border to start anew, but when they seek refuge at the Titty Twister (an isolated strip club and brothel), the criminals and hostages must work together if they want to survive the bloodsucking staff. Suffers from the FULL METAL JACKET-effect, where the first act easily tops the remaining two acts after taking a major turn in events to leave the audience feeling like they're watching an entirely different movie. Tarantino is never at his fullest potential when partnered with the skin-deep action-driven talents of Rodriguez. SFX absolutely amazing for 1996, though; and a fun picture to revisit every seven or eight years. First appearance of Earl McGraw (Michael Parks).*** (out of four)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing and Incredibly Stupid film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know this is hard to believe : a Quentin Tarantino scripted movie being stupid, lacking plot and direction?! Duh! I knew it: No one would believe me if I said this movie was one of the worst films I have ever seen, so much more because I believed it to be one of the 'hidden gems' from Quentin's (and Robert Rodrigues too) closet.The film starts out well with the brutality and dialogue typical of a Tarantino movie so much so it ticks the boxes: 1) Smart ass dialogue? Check. 2) Violent deaths? Check 3) Ear splitting gunshot explosions? Check.But when we were just about to unravel the characters: the director and screenplay writer decided to bring out a boner and turn the movie into a sad hackneyed horror comedy movie? Mr. Tarantino, was it too much to ask for a plausible idea that seemed great on paper and on film too.Disappointing and terribly campy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been a "vampire-watcher" for over 40 years, and I'd rate this one and John Carpenter's "Vampires" right behind the Bela Lugosi masterpiece. This one's actually a better movie, but consider the standards of the times. I've got a close friend who's a clinical psychologist, and one of his techniques for helping patients deal with manipulative co-workers, narcissists, etc., is likening those 'bad' people with vampires or werewolves. He uses movies a lot in his therapy. I told him one time about this movie--in pretty serious detail--and he ran out and bought it. He said it's now a major part of his work. He was fascinated with the relationship between Seth and the defrocked minister; how the whole bar turned from a fun place into a nightmare; and even the weapons used as being appropriate for the characters. I watched it again from that viewpoint, and damned if he's not right. This is a lot deeper than one might think on the surface.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vampires QT style, makes you wanna have it no other way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Dusk Till Dawn is another QT event or treat. Half a Natural Born Killers film, the remaining half, a vampire one. And don't think for a second, either, cause it's a QT product, it doesn't work as a vampire film. You're sorely mistaken. In my opinion, it's actually better that a lot of other vampire films, in terms of gore, makeup, and in the ways the vampires are put to rest, and how the remaining score of players, deal with fending them off, amongst some great QT tongue and cheek dialogue, he must of had a ball, writing this. It has a great start too, in a convenience store, before it's turned upside down by the Gecko brothers, in a shootout, before it's torched. Clooney is cool, charismatic and deadly, while Quentin, the sex offending sicko, does a fine job, indeed. We really fear these guys at first, where in the second half, we're rooting for em' to kill off the vampirish evil. Keitel turns in a much different performance, as a preacher, who's lost his faith. He's impressively good. Him and he's two kids Juliette Lewis, good, and his adopted Asian son, Ernest Liu, of obvious amateur ilk, are kidnapped and are used by the Gecko's as their ticket across the border. The first half of the film is rather nasty, one scene especially involving QT who's raped and killed a 50's female hostage, while Clooney goes out and some Big Kahuna burgers. Clooney also has a talent and charm, to be comedic. He really has his moments. Then comes the next half, where they make a giant mistake indeed at their rendezvous point, The Titty Twister, a truckers and bikers bar, offering lap dancers by hotties, Mexican food, alcoholic beverages, also a rocking band, plus a deadly vampirish secret of course. The gore and fight scenes are choreographed second to none, you feel the helplessness amongst this bloody mayhem, which is full on at first, aided by ghoulish and loud music scores. Perfect. Tom Savini as Sex Machine always comes prepared, with his waist ammo, that comes in handy for snatching beers of other rough folk. And Williamson (the Hammer) even looks big as a vampire, and one ugly son of a bi..h to go with it. Cheech Marin shows us what character acting is too, in three roles in which is bloody good. In one role as the dj host, outside the twitty twister, he informs us of the large inventory of pu..y that the Titty Twister provides, before getting hammered by Clooney too. I didn't realize either how good Danny (Machete) Trejo (a real life prisoner at one stage) was as an actor, who plays a bartender who gets into a little bit of a feud with Clooney, over the particular clientele of the Titty Twister. What we get here folks is one hell of a ride, and we do not wanna get off. I liked too how the Geckos came together with the Fullers, as friends, at the TT, before hell is unleashed, where earlier, the family would of truly been killed, if crossing them. QT, is one smart and lucky son of a b..ch who gets to suck Salma Hayek's toes. She's hotter in this, then Desperado, and she really can act too. One scene that was in bad taste, but was guilty amusement, was earlier with Kelly Preston as a news reporter, is giving out the tally of victims killed, at the hands of the Gecko, but saying it with a vim and excitement. But let's not forget, this is from the pen of Tarantino. FDTD, a different, less Tarantino hit, cinematically, stands apart from his others, but definitely put this one on your QT bucket, if not viewed it. It's vitally imperative, you do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Tale of 2 Genres!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Dusk Till Dawn is a masterful tale that mixes and matches up two successful genres very well: the hardcore crime drama and fantasy horror. The first half of the film incorporates some hard-boiled crime drama and some Taratino-influenced dialog. The second half, however more generic, is still a joy to watch especially with all the vampire action. So what I'm trying to say is that this film is an awesome "B" movie and is a fun, action-packed adventure.Robert Rodriguez's film is about two notorious brothers, the Gecko Brothers who kidnap a former priest and his two kids to escape across the border. While at a bar in Mexico, they come to realize that this bar holds house to extreme evil so they must gang up to defeat these creatures of Satan.The acting is pretty good and juicy. George Clooney shows in his first film role what a charismatic actor he is. Harvey Keitel and Juliette Lewis are pretty good in their roles as well. Even though I don't see Taratino as an actor, he gives a juicy and raw performance as the younger Gecko Brother.Overall, this film is an example of a pure "B" film. This film provides all the giddy fun you come to expect. The vampire designs are actually quite terrifying and semi-realistic. This is one of those films that successfully mixes two genres and escapes unscathed. I had a fun time with this film and I liked the balance of crime, horror, and drama. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>well, what just happened?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Somehow I had not heard about this movie by Rodriguez and Tarantino, and I did not read anything about it before I started watching it. I had no idea what I was getting myself into. Now, I am a big fan of Tarantino and a slightly lesser fan of Rodriguez but I love Sin City and Planet Terror among others. The First hour of the movie felt to me like a typical Tarantino movie, with witty and clever dialogue, a lot of violence, and in this case a hostage situation. I thought to myself... YESSS! I am totally going to enjoy this movie, and I sure did........Then our characters arrive at a bar called the Titty Twister,(about and hour into the movie) and I did not expect the rest of the movie to take place there. But then out of no where.... VAMPIRES! And nothing but a couple of laughs and vampire slaying till the end credits roll. We never know why the vampires are there, I guess its suppose to be just... One of those things, it can happen to anyone hah!I think I might have enjoyed this movie for what it is, had I known beforehand this was i vampire movie. I just feel like they abandoned the story line of the first half when the vampires came. And I was in no way prepared. Overall, a great first half, brought down in my opinion by the shallow vampire packed second half. Well, I should have known I guess, this being a Rodriguez film. Im still giving the movie a 7/10 just because of the first half, could have gotten a higher grade had it gone in a different direction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's interesting to see these young Film maverick's at work. Shot, Cut, and Directed by Robert Rodriguez and written by Quentin Tarantino. In this early effort you can see many a thing that will become trademarks. But one must say this is far from either one's best.It is like a workout, flexing the muscles and developing the chops. There are some glorious bits here and there is enough to satisfy Film Geeks and the lovers of Drive-In/Grindhouse Flicks because that is where this colorful, violent, trashy, thing comes from.Like most Rodriquez stuff you have to bring a strong stomach and be ready for some outrageous goings-on. There is a perverted gory atmosphere and some darkly funny Tarantino dialog and the make-up and SFX are quite good.This was Clooney's big screen debut and he doesn't disappoint. The rest of the Cult Movie cast, are also along for the ride and seem to be having a grand old time. It's a loud and wild event and if you go with it there may be some eclectic enjoyment but may have some scurrying for the exits.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A gangster/vampire hybrid masterpiece!!! I saw the film when it first came out, about 16 years ago now, back at the time people didn't know it was a vampire flick until they saw it! Nowadays, most people are aware of this even if they haven't seen it, which certainly takes the surprise element away when you watch it which for me was a big part of it. I remember when Salma Hayek first turned into a vampire during the film, I thought up until that point it was your good yet typical gangster film, how wrong was I!! The film is full of funny one liners, mostly delivered by George Clooney. Other main stars are Quentin Tarantino, Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis, Danny Trejo, Salma Hayek &amp; Cheech (who actually plays 3 different parts in the film). My only problem with the film was Ernest Liu, who plays Scott - his acting skills were......lets say "not great".... I like the end when Juliette Lewis drives the RV away - the camera pans back to reveal that the "Titty Twister" bar is the top of an Aztec temple, obviously the source and true home of the vampires! DO NOT bother watching From Dusk Till Dawn 2 or 3, they are both really, really terrible films!!!To conclude, From Dusk Till Dawn is gory, funny - a fantastic film!! One of my all time favourites.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the very first scene in this movie, I was hooked, and I could tell this was going to be a good and enjoyable film. And of course I was right. The story is pretty simple, but how it unfolds is the best part. It starts off as a crime drama. The dialogue is done in the usual Tarantino way. A lot of funny lines. The transition in the middle of the film was well done. One minute the Gecko brothers are having a good time, the next it's a complete splatter house.The Gecko brothers were fun to watch, and equally as amusing to listen to. Harvey Keitel's part was well played, same with the kids. Rodriguez regulars(Danny Trejo, Cheech Marin) are here as well. Even if they had a small part. Tom Savini is also present and he has some pretty funny moments as well.The fist half was a interesting crime drama, if it was like that the whole time I wouldn't have complained. The second have is all out mayhem and violence, loads of special effects.I highly recommend this, genre's were blended just right, and it leaves you satisfied after the credits roll. Rodriguez and Tarantino work well together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, this movie begins very violent and similar to Tarantino's movies. Killing for no reason and coldness when dealing with other people. As many people already said, this movie is basically divided in four scenes: the bar scene, the motel scene, the bus scene and the iron maiden rock bar scene. In all scenes characters act the same way, showing they've been properly developed. One implausible thing to notice is how the kids made light of their dad being about to die-- no children act like that, but I can understand it's just a horror movie. I really liked all the scenes until it became a "Night of the living dead", full of never ending action scenes, which bores me. All the others scenes are very creative and entertaining, but the undead scenes made me rate this lower than I was ready to do. Good movie anyways.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is, and always will be my favourite movie. I'm obsessed with it. It actually holds a dear place in my heart as I'm very attached to it. It's a bit of a strange situation. There has been many a time where I've dreamt of taking Juliette Lewis' place and being a badass with Richie and Seth. I've also wondered whether or not Quentin Tarantino would like a letter from me declaring my love for him, I don't know. Like I said, I'm in love with everything to do with this film. There are many reasons why.1. It's a 'horror' movie and horror is the best genre. 2. It's got George Clooney in it and in this film, my god. 3. Quentin is a fantastic director and kind of cute idk. 4. It's got some of the best one liners in it I've ever heard. 5. It's set in Mexico and Mexico is wonderful. 6. It's got guns and drugs. 7. Vampires and boobs. 8. Tattoos and alcohol. 9. Blood and guts. 10. Basically all things that make a movie legendary. 11. It's pretty much non-stop action. 12. It kind of inspired me to want to be a director.Okay, enoughs enough. The acting may be not the best, or the SFX may be a bit unrealistic e.g. when one of the vampires melt with fear or one of their eyes squirt green goo whilst chanting devil words. The bar that all the action occurs at may be the seediest one you'll ever see, BUT, you just have to accept the awesomeness of it! I can't say much more but what I will say is that if you haven't seen this movie, bloody well see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quentin Tarantino is certifiable, and this proves it. Even by his standards, this movie is off the charts. Q.T. plays Rich Gecko, who, along with his brother Seth, have rob ed a bank, and are wanted by the FBI for murder. They stop at a motel on their way to Mexico, and kidnap a reverend Jacob(Harvey Keitel), his daughter, Kate(Juliette Lewis), and adopted son Scott. The family RV is used for their planned escape to Mexico. The sick mind of Tarantino writes a fantasy sequence where he gets dirty talk requesting oral sex from Kate; what a perv, the man is deeply disturbed. Along the way they make the big mistake of stopping at a club which houses vampires. A dancer appears on stage, dressed in a bikini and carrying a snake. It is Santanico(Salma Hayek smolders) and she dances as chaos breaks out. It's bloody vampire time and we get an overdose of flying body parts. Robert Rodriguez directed from the Tarantino script, and the two seem to have been separated at birth; crazy minds think alike. Don't expect Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs, but From Dusk to Dawn is above average for the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrible blandpire flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With names on this "movie" that have then newcomers Tarantino and Rodriguez on them, you'd probably expect something half-way decent. If you have an discerning taste in quality films, you'll quickly realize that this "movie" is probably one that when mentioned to Clooney, Tarantino, or Rodriguez, will probably get you those contemptuous stares of "you're just being an a$$hole". But in my opinion, it isn't trash talking if it's true. This venture starts out with Tarantino and Clooney as brothers who're hiding out from the law. In particular a bigoted sheriff played by veteran actor, Michael Parks, who's in a liquor store shooting the breeze with a backwood, desert rat named Benny about what nosey, small hicktown, busybodys talk about. Then the sheriff does his job of exposition on two a-hole brothers who're in the middle of a robbing/murder spree which started in Kansas after Tarantino's character busted Clooney's character out of a corrections facility. Now if the "movie" had taken a more serious tone from the beginning, in true Tarantino and Rodriguez fashion, it might have actually been good. Where I think it all goes bad is when the two plus Harvey Keitel's character and his adopted Chinese son and daughter take temporary refuge in Mexico at a dive against their will. Since the family are captives hijacked for their "self-contained" R.V. by the brothers.What follows is mess of cliché'd special effects and fairly cheap make-up effects and gratuitous violence preceded by oodles of topless women who are *gasp* blandpires.This "movie" is just gory for gore's sake. To compensate for a lack of story, imagination, and for Tarantino a lack of clever dialogue. The only redeeming virtue in the entire movie is Salma Hayek's exotic/erotic dancing with a yellow boa constrictor for good exotic measure. This is the only semblance of class or sophistication in the entire "movie" since she remains clothed in a luscious, velvet bikini.Then the festivities end when the blandpires show their true colors by slaughtering en masse a whole barroom of patrons. It is as dumb as it sounds. This "movie" makes no contribution to the blandpire sub-genre. Interview with the Vampire and Bram Stoker's Dracula brought back the romanticized and urbane blandpire established by Stoker and Lugosi, Blade Agave gave blandpires a more realistic and scientific weight to their folklorish nomenclature of sunlight, garlic, silver and so on. Then 30 Days of Night stripped all that away and made blandpires nothing more than savage parasites truly to be feared.All From Dusk til Dawn manages is...uh...well you got gratuitous profanity by a master dialogue scribe and equally copious amounts of gore. What is kind of funny about it, is that all of the "actors" behave as though this isn't the first, second, or even tenth time they went to a dive and encountered this sort of a debacle! And to think this is what Clooney gave up E.R. for. But it get's worse, he followed this up with that dreadful Batman and Robin and all it's ingloriousness and homo-eroticism. But hey, not every movie can have the same pedigree of Heat, Braveheart, or Citizen Kane. It's because of crap like this that you truly appreciate when a good movie graces our televisions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just A Fun Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of Tarantino. Maybe a huge fan. A little obsessed, I guess. That's why I finally had to see From Dusk Till Dawn. I just had never seen it before, and realizing it was available on Netflix, I queued it up and enjoyed. I was expecting something more like Rodriguez's more recent Planet Terror, which I liked for it's homage to exploitation cinema, but wasn't crazy about as a movie. But I had to see it; it's written by Tarantino! But man did I enjoy this movie.It starts as a classic, if not even more over-the-top Tarantino film. Seth and Richard Gecko (George Clooney in what must have been a fun role for him, and Tarantino himself lending his acting "talent" to the narrative.) are extremely violent criminals on the run. And Richard's a little crazy. He's not a great actor, but Tarantino does his thing as an awkward, violent sociopath. When Richard kills the brothers' hostage, they need to find some new leverage. Harvey Keitel is a now-retired preacher traveling with his two kids in their motor home. When they stop at the same hotel as the Geckos, mayhem ensues.As Richard and Seth travel with their new hostages in their motor home, we see some conversation among the hostages and the hostage-takers. It's kind fun stuff, just to hear. I've said it before and I'll say it again, Quentin Tarantino is a genius with his writing. Some people call it crude, some people call it nihilistic, I call it entertaining. Some great lines from the whole cast, with exceptionally good delivery from Clooney. So that's that, the brothers escape across the border with their hostagesto Mexico to meet their contact at a bar. The Titty Twister! The iconicbar filled with beautiful women, some tough bikers and road-wanderers, and alcohol. Oh, and vampires.Everything builds to this. Everyone knows it's coming. It would be interesting to see reactions to the film from people who don't know the twist. But I guess it can't be a twist if it's considered the central plot of the movie. I'm rambling, let me get back on track.So the vampires come and the film shifts from crime to cheesy horror, and almost comedy. That's really what this is all about: a mash-up. It's great, really. Even the poster for the film features what appears to be a torn poster with Tarantino and Clooney pointing their guns, and behind it the image of a vampire. It's like the film was on track to be a standard movie, and our characters just happened to walk into the wrong bar.If you're still not sold, then there's no selling it to you! It's definitely a movie that a lot of people will hate. I don't want to use the term "film snob" but... Some people just won't enjoy the movie, I get it. Me, I was genuinely loving every second of it. I'd be willing to admit if Tarantino's script faltered, as I've seen happen with True Romance and Natural Born Killers, but this is gold! Perhaps it's Tarantino's friendship with Robert Rodriguez that allowed for such a great collaboration.So there. I'm a little late on my viewing of this, but I'm glad I saw it. Actually think it's something I'll buy on DVD, add to the collection. It's a campy movie with violence, sex, and swearing for the whole family! Well, maybe not the WHOLE family, but if you can stomach it, I think you'll like it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Blending genres is a neat idea that doesn't always work. There has to be a good balance between the two and they have to blend well. There are numerous films that mix Comedy and Horror, a lot which did it successfully. But in lesser hands it can be a real mess. Quentin Tarantino is known to be one of the biggest film buffs to ever live. That's one of the main reasons he's a good choice for a project like 'From Dusk Till Dawn.' Beginning as a heist/hostage movie, it eventually takes a turn and enters Horror territory. Is it perfect? No, but it sure is a hell of a lot of fun.Pros: Great performances by actors who create some memorable characters. Snappy writing. Suspenseful first half. Nice cinematography. Loaded with humor and campy goodness. Moves at a good pace, especially in the second half. Good job on the make-up and gore effects. Some really exciting set pieces. Neat production design job on the bar.Cons: CGI that hasn't held up. Tarantino had proved himself to be a fine director and writer, but he's not such a great actor. The two halves don't fit together as well as they could.Final thoughts: Vampires were not so popular in the 90s, but Tarantino and Rodriguez made them cool again. Instead of giving us the same old thing they put them in a new situation. OK maybe it's not much in the scare department, but it more than makes up for that with fun and mayhem. If you're looking for a popcorn movie with lots of action and grue you won't find much better.My rating: 4/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted to respond to the current top review, "True Tarantino." First of all, to call it "true Tarantino" and never mention Rodriquez is either misleading or ill-informed. Tarantino wrote the script and played one of the lead characters, yes, but he did not direct the film. He actually denied various subsequent levels of involvement with the film in order to concentrate on his portrayal of Richard Gecko after completing the script. I believe Rodriquez deserves as much credit here as Tarantino, and after the second half of the film, KNB Effects deserves as much as either of them.That said, to say that the effects weren't "very good" is just silly. While the effects can often be campy and over the top to the point of being unrealistic, it's a monster film, and it treats the effects as such. These aren't your everyday "actor with false teeth" vampires, these are Evil Dead II style demons, creatures that resemble less Lugosi and more The Thing, mutated, weird, and disturbing, and more concerned with entertainment than realism. You must also consider that some of these effects were highly functional, not just simple makeup jobs but interactive builds that sprayed fluid, changed shapes, and moved about. You must also consider that this is a 15+ year old film. If you're looking for visual effects that blend practical makeups with CG elements in every shot, or worse, nothing but CG for "effects," then you're looking for the wrong thing here. Aside from a few blends, melts, and effect fades, everything you see was done in front of the camera, in person, for real, and it looks that was. None of the effects look like something you couldn't reach out and touch, and they all live up to some of the best and highest regarded horror and scifi effects created for film. I'd love to see what the OP thought was a "good" special effect.All of this aside, this is a fantastic film. The first has is engaging, interesting, and unique, tugging you along for the ride in a familiar fashion to other Tarantino scripts in a decidedly Tex-Mex Rodriquez style. It slows down only to let you get involved with the characters, and is at no point boring or dismissible. If you take someone who has never seen this film, and doesn't know what it's about, and sit them down to watch it, the range of expressions and reactions you'll get to the mid-movie vampire shock are worth repeat viewings with a new audience. After the shift in story arc, the following scenes are fun, entertaining as hell, and right up the gore/camp/gun alley of anyone who enjoys the Evil Dead series (for whom KNB also did the effects). I can't imagine a more consistently entertaining film in this genre. It's one of my all-time favorites and it's always fun to see again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First half is fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed this movie very much. The pairing of clooney and Tarantino resulted in unexpected fun and unpredictability. The only problem with the movie that i could find was the sudden switch from reality-action to fantasy-horror, which happened in seconds and made the second half of the movie faster paced and unrealistic. I think that Rodriguez had a hard time choosing between a film about reality or fiction and that is where the movie fails.Myself being used to Rodriguez and Tarantino twists found it typical of their writing style, but to others unfamiliar with some of their work the movie's second half might seem rushed and filled with gore for the sake of gore.I praise Clooney and Tarantino for the flick's first half, their characters were believable and intense!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had high expectation.That is why I rented the movie but my opinion about the movie is not going to match my expectations because it was nothing horror. It was just a nice crime and poor horror stories combined with no sense. 2nd Half of the movie sucked bad... 1st hour was fine as long as it was just crime it was fine but when the horror part came, It was awfully horrible. Still I am giving it generous 4 stars but I sure won't recommend it to anyone.Best part of the movie is script probably which is only good at first half. 7.1 rating is high for a movie like this.Its pretty bad movie. Still no hard feelings Robert is still a very good director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two desperate criminals take a family hostage in order to escape to Mexico; once safely over the border, they head for sleazy strip-bar The Titty Twister, unaware that the establishment is home to a nest of vampires who feed upon the client?le.Fans of Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino certainly get their money's worth with From Dusk Till Dawn: not one, but two genres?gratuitously violent crime action followed by over-the-top horror; a smart script that contains just the right amount of cool, quotable, quick-fire dialogue (as opposed to the overlong boring monologues that QT can sometimes be guilty of); sexiness in the delightful forms of Juliette 'Jailbait' Lewis and Salma 'Salsa Hot' Hayek; fantastic splattery gore from effects gods KNB; and a superb cast that includes George Clooney (proving he can play 'bad'), the always dependable Harvey Keitel, plus cult movie legends John Saxon, Fred Williamson, Tom Savini, Danny Trejo, and Cheech Marin.Still firing on all cylinders from his El Mariachi sequel hit Desperado, director Rodriguez ensures that From Dusk Till Dawn is an absolute blast from explosive start to blood-drenched finish, packing the film with wall-to-wall mayhem, stylish visuals, macabre comedic touches (watch for the hilarious bit where one vamp is killed on a pool table and his eyeballs roll into the corner pockets), and cool Tex Mex rock music. And although the story borrows heavily from other films at times?most notably, 80s teen horror Vamp?it matters not a jot: I'm sure you'll be having far too much fun to care!After all, who could fail to enjoy a film that features a biker named Sex Machine (who is armed with a spring-loaded crotch cannon), a sexy dance scene starring the gorgeous Hayek (who allows lucky old Tarantino to indulge in his foot fetish), Juliette Lewis requesting oral pleasure, George Clooney revving a pneumatic stake, Marin listing the wide variety of pussy available in The Titty Twister, and buckets and buckets of juicy, top-quality gore? Not me, that's for sure!8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.</fullReview>

The movie's been around for a while, but I guess I wasn't into the genre around the time it came out.. "From Dusk Till Dawn" is a horror/comedy/action movie that will have you interested from the start and never lets go till the very end! Its serious, funny, scary and at times a tiny bit cheesy..and I loved every minute of it! I'm sure you will too!

		<shortDescription>A strip club that just keeps pulling those suckers in,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino team up to give us this hip, over the top, fairly crazy crossbreed crime/horror movie and the end result is quite a good time.George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino play the Gecko brothers, two tough criminals who need to get over the border to Mexico and hole up in The Titty Twister bar until they can meet their friendly contact in the morning (Cheech Marin, in one of three roles he plays here). To get there they end up taking a family hostage (and ex-preacher played by Harvey Keitel and his son and daughter, played by Ernest Liu and Juliette Lewis) and using their R.V. to make their way safely over the border. Unfortunately, someone forgot to warn them that The Titty Twister is no place to stay while waiting for the sun to rise.There is plenty here to keep all red-blooded males extremely happy. Naked women, crazy violence, "cool" gunplay and Salma Hayek playing Santanico Pandemonium (the sexiest dancer in the place). With others in the cast including Danny Trejo, Tom Savini and Fred Williamson this is also a treat for horror genre fans.Rodriguez directs with his usual flair, the script is full of some great crudity (Tarantino, thankfully, writes better than he acts though he does quite well here, to be fair) and when things start to take a turn for the worse we also get treated to some great FX work and a variety of unique death scenes.On repeat viewings it's easier to notice many of the flaws and shortcuts used to get the whole thing done but it's also easy to soak up the sheer cool fun of the film and consistently enjoy it. Well worth a watch.See this if you like: Desperado, Vamp, Bordello Of Blood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone has always said: what an enigma, what a genius, what a master screenwriter and director is Quentin Tarantino. The popularity of Tarantino's films is undeniable, but going into From Dusk Til Dawn I had almost no expectations. The movie was a Christmas gift from my parents, mostly my dad, an avid vampire enthusiast. I kind of doubted how much I would really enjoy the movie; I had sat bored through more than a couple ultra violence killing spree movies.That, I can say, has forever changed. It's kind of weird to even explain, because I'm still kind of weirded out as to what exactly it was about that movie that is so incredibly amazing. I can't decide if it's the sick and twisted s*** perpetrated by Richard the delusional and pedophile rapist, who drinks whiskey off the foot of (guys, girls, c'mon) Salma Hayek, or the holy water flamethrower, the groin six shooter, or the first time you see a human turn into a vampire on screen, or the pounding in your chest as the tension rises indefinitely as two children and one man face off against a bar full of hungry bloodsuckers. Seriously, this is an amazing, one of a kind film. It's unlike anything you'll see anywhere else. I can appreciate more (cough) grown-up plots or stories, but honestly, a damn good movie is a damn good movie. If you pass this up because you have preconceptions about what a movie about killing vampires is, you are sorely missing out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Black Comedy turned Nightmare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is perhaps most famous for its twist about halfway through the story. It is quite a twist on the film's reality, I'd say comparable to the one in "The Matrix" in that absolutely nothing is the same after. Also, like in the aforementioned film, the twist makes sense... but only if looked at from a certain point of view.The story goes from a caper black comedy with a pair of crooks who are on their way to Mexico to escape US law enforcement. They take some hostages and narrowly slip through the border and to a meeting point, a bar with exotic dancers. It seems that their dreams are just about to come true and they'll be sipping margaritas safe from the confines of prison... but then what happens? Our very frightened protagonists find themselves locked in the bar, that is now basically a prison, but it is not run by law enforcement officers, it's worse. It's not even run by the Gestapo... it's worse! No, this place is worse than their worst nightmares and too bad for them that it is real, since it seems everyone has been given an automatic death sentence. The bar is run by vampires who feast on visitors in order to stay alive.Is the twist odd? Yes, very much so, but with a screenplay by Quentin Tarantino, only some sort of off the wall unconventional twist can be expected. Tarantino himself has a supporting role as the very weird and deranged brother of George Clooney's character. At this point Tarantino was known for crime capers and to an extent this is one too, but it fits into Tarantino's list of movies the way his character is in the film: a total weirdo with a penchant for violence. Also Robert Rodriguez has yet to make something quite like this as well...Overall, this is an odd and very violent movie that is decidedly not for all tastes, but it's dark wit and sense of humor cannot be denied. See it to get a glimpse of something quite different. --- 7/10BsCDb Classification: 16+ --- violence/gore</fullReview>

They are, in every way but the makeup, traditional Romero zombies. Just as a reminder: Vampires: Move superhumanly fast, act super-intelligent, hunt alone, seduce and kill over a period of days or weeks except when in a hurry, do not turn every victim into potential competition for food.Zombies: Move slow, hunt in ever-growing groups, act clever at best, always kill and partially eat victims as quickly as possible, turn every victim into another zombie to swell their ranks.From Dusk Till Dawn is a zombie movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun till the break of dawn.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On their way out of Texas, leaving a deadly-crime spree in their wake, two brothers (George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino) scoop up an unsuspecting family (led by Harvey Keitel) and make their way across the border into Mexico. Home-free and troubles be damned, they party it up at a local strip joint that is open from dusk till dawn. In the morning, they will receive a generous pay-day, but in the meantime, must fend off a gang of deadly and sometimes seductive vampires."From Dusk Till Dawn" is a film about vampires, but you tend to forget about that in the first hour, as Tarantino's script focuses sharply on its characters. You'll feel like you're at the table with them as they share shots of whiskey, and when the excrement hits the fan, you're thrown off-balance by the complete 180 the film pulls. Now, depending on your expectations, the third act both ups the ante and makes the film, or it totally shatters the well-developed plot. If you love gore galore (hint: Robert Kurtzman, who provided special effects for the film, also conjured up the original story), this is your film. If anyone knows how to shoot a "shoot 'em up" flick, it's Robert Rodriguez, and he effortlessly transitions from character moments to over-the-top blood and guts and guns (check out Tom Savini's legendary gear) at the turn of a dime. Truly professional film-making is what we have here.Despite the fact that the film switches it up on you just as you settle in, the end results are so much fun that it's forgivable. If you can't enjoy vampires being jack-hammered with a giant wooden-stake, then this certainly isn't the movie for you. The film is whip-smart, at times hilarious and at others, sincere. It's also got a solid cast worth noting. George Clooney plays against type, and likewise, Tarantino is less annoying than he is in his other acting roles. Harvey Keitel more or less steals the show at times, as the most professional and likable of the bunch, but you'll get a kick, no doubt, in seeing Cheech Marin playing three, count 'em, three roles in the film. "From Dusk Till Dawn" is essentially a brilliant mash-up of Tarantino's unique story-telling and characters and Robert Rodriguez's signature action and effects sequences, most certainly foreshadowing the duo's epic collaboration, "Grindhouse," a decade later. Those expecting anything but a good time will be sorely left in the cold.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Texas thief George Clooney (as Seth Gecko) teams up with kinky, demented brother Quentin Tarantino (as Richard Gecko) for a serial killing blood-fest; then, the two high-tail it to Mexico. They are driven there by ex-minister hostage Harvey Keitel (as Jacob Fuller) and his underage children, Juliette Lewis (as Kate) and Ernest Liu (as Scott). Hard-drinking Mr. Clooney thinks Mr. Keitel and Mr. Liu are "fags" because Liu is Asian. Horny Mr. Tarantino imagines Ms. Lewis wants him to eat her. Eventually, the bonded quintet wind up in an orgy at the "Titty Twister", a vampire-infested Mexican nightclub conveniently "Open Dusk Till Dawn"...This film makes a very uncomfortable change in direction; it should have either stuck to the serial-killing brothers, or introduced the "undead" theme earlier. It doesn't always hit the mark, but director Robert Rodriguez and writer/co-star Tarantino inject some humor into the story. The way TV newscaster Kelly Preston reports the serial brothers' body count is fine satire. And, Clooney is like Cary Grant on acid. Probably, the film's peak is a very effective opening, with John Hawkes and Michael Parks excellent as the "World of Liquor" store clerk and his Texas ranger customer. Too bad they couldn't keep it up longer.***** From Dusk Till Dawn (1/19/96) Robert Rodriguez ~ George Clooney, Quentin Tarantino, Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From Dusk Till Dawn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I realize that Quentin Tarantino is a polarizing figure who has both admirers and critics because his films usually feature extreme acts of behavior that test a viewer's threshold and tolerance for cinematic violence and excess. His characters have dialogue that is often outrageous, explicitly vulgar, and even cartoonish. There's a quality in FROM DUSK TILL DAWN where it feels less like a naturalistic landscape and more of a trip into some ultra-violent, profane, frighteningly subversive place, directed with style and lack of restraint where QT and director Robert Rodriguez(..whose previous films, particularly DESPERADO, show just why he was born to form a partnership with Tarantino), throw caution to the wind, whipping up a gratuitous brew of machismo, visceral shocks, and over-the-top dialogue clashes. There's plenty of wicked, audacious humor, and you can just sense the perverted joy and child-like enthusiasm as you watch the film..this was definitely a labour of love for Rodriguez and QT.The cast is a phenomenon for a buff like me, particularly seeing Tom Savini battling it out with vampire Danny Trejo, Fred Williamson pulling a heart from the chest of a massive bloodsucker, and Harvey Kietel standing off a drove of ugly fiends using a baseball bat and shotgun in the image of crucifix. A deliriously nifty gag shows how "equipped" Savini really is where it counts! Also, seeing The Hammer get his cigar lit by a table dancing mamacita is also quite a highlight. Tarantino's homicidal Richard Gecko is a truly repellent character(..he's a seriously warped sex offender whose "deficiencies" drive him to kill those women he's drawn to)with a fixation for feet. The ultimate showstopper has the jaw-droppingly sexy Salma Hayek, as dancer Santanico Pandemonium, moving her audience into silence with quite a smoldering number. Clooney gets many chances to round off QT's constant supply of attitude-laden, very aggressive dialogue, his forceful presence ably fulfilling the role of an antagonistic criminal, who isn't afraid to use his gun, but would rather just succeed in his goal to reach a safe haven.The movie's a tale of two halves..before and after our cast of characters drive into the Mexican Titty Twister bar. Fugitive brothers, Seth and Richard Gecko(George Clooney and QT)are on the lam, heading for Mexico, blazing a violent trail through Texas, where their ticket to safety, as law enforcement and FBI are out to get them, lie in the RV of a former minister, Jacob(Keitel)and his children, Kate and Scott(Juliette Lewis and Ernest Liu). Getting across the border, preparing for a rendezvous with an associate, The Bros Gecko think their troubles are over. The meeting location is the Mexican strip club, for truck drivers and bikers, the Titty Twister. What they don't expect is that the club is actually a front for a coven of vampires who use the place as a method of luring their meals! So Seth, once his bro becomes a neck feast for a bloodsucker, must forge an alliance with Jacob and his kids in order to somehow survive their dead-serious crisis...getting some assistance from others, such as "Sex Machine"(Savini)and Frost(Williamson)who are able to outlast the first assault against the vampires. The opening half displays Seth's difficult trials with his unpredictable brother who seems unable to control himself. The vampire battles are heaven for gore aficionados, as bodies are ripped limb-from-limb along with plenty of effective uses of stakes driven through vampires in gruesome, unusual ways. KNB supplies the magnificent make-up effects. Some of the computer generated work is a bit noticeable, but I was satisfied with their work. Cheech Marin is a hoot in three roles, Kelly Preston has a cameo as a reporter, and the great John Saxon gets to stop by as a cop threatening to catch the Geckos.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A new Robert Rodriguez film will be hitting the theaters very soon, not really the long- awaited first sequel of one of the very best maybe just the very best comic book film ever made or the maybe-it-goes-straight-to-DVD-or-maybe-it-gets-a-theatrical-release Grindhouse presentation Machete (can't wait!) but a film more in the vein of his Spy Kids trilogy and his 2005 The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D. Now, I haven't seen any of those films however I do want to check out Shorts and hopefully I will be enjoying it on the big screen the day it opens (in my country Shorts will be released on 7 August 2009 and two weeks later from that Friday it will be in American theaters) but meanwhile I want to visit for the very first time some RR films, so maybe I will check out Spy Kids, well hell as for today I have yet to see plenty of RR films (the four I mentioned plus his two first ones, El Mariachi and the TV movie Roadracers, and The Faculty). This one, From Dusk Till Dawn, was before today in that list, well I had seen before some bits of its first part (and certainly the famous part of Salma Hayek) but just today I finally saw it in its entirety.And From Dusk Till Dawn has two parts, Salma Hayek sort of marks the end of the first part, the part in which she kills Quentin Tarantino's character but not really literally, the only part in which Hayek is sexy and yes here Hayek stops being sexy?you don't believe me? Well, I can tell you, second part is carnage with only few moments for our characters to really think about what's going on, to really be sure about what they are dealing with. And is great, very memorable fun, with Tom Savini and Fred Williamson (as Sex Machine and Frost, respectively) joining our main characters, but wait I haven't say much about our main characters so: Tarantino plays what is my favourite of his characters, I mean not my favourite of the characters he had written but just of the ones he has played. Tarantino, who also wrote the screenplay, plays Richard Gecko (by reading some other comments I can say most of the people hated Tarantino here, for me it's a lot of great fun with him), sex freak, crazy bastard, criminal and brother of George Clooney's (you can say whatever you want about Clooney but he is great in the Coen brothers masterpiece O Brother, Where Art Thou?, he is awesome here so?) character Seth Gecko. Both had killed in a week 5 Texas rangers, 8 police officers and 3 civilians and while the authorities say they will caught the fugitives within the next 48 hours the Gecko brothers are on their way to Mexico. The introduction to the Gecko brothers is just superb, as a whole it's a really great opening, and certainly is clear who is who, who is the craziest son of a bitch, who will make things harder for himself and for his brother. Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis and Ernest Liu play the other main characters, the family Fuller, victims of the Gecko brothers, they did what they had to and they were going to leave Mexico to can tell later on their unfortunate encounter with the Gecko brothers but when the carnage is on?"what, were they psychos?", Cheech Marin is also very memorable here!Why I waited till now to see this film, this awesome film? Damn, but now I'm so glad I finally saw it, just loved each second of its two parts, it's awesome fun, underrated and one of favourites from RR/QT!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mental. Absolutely mental. That's how I'd sum up From Dusk Till Dawn. Revolving around the Gecko brothers and their attempts to cross the Mexican border to safety by using a family and their motorhome the first half provides us with a really compelling action film in a similar vein to Tarantino-directed films. What then occurs is camp, B-movie style, splatter, vampire nonsense pretty much until the conclusion of the film as Clooney and friends attempt to escape the bar with their lives intact. Weird..but I love it! Yes the switch in genre is surprising but it works and I applaud Rodriguez for daring to do such a thing. Many people have criticized FDTD for doing this but in my opinion the switch is a refreshing change. There are countless films that go along the same way as FDTD was going but there are not many films that dare to do this.It's easily Rodriguez' best effort to date and really shouldn't be viewed as anything but good fun! Clooney is fantastic in the first half of the film (as is Tarantino) although both of their performances do get a little shadowed as the vampire mayhem kicks in. Finally, FDTD boasts a script filled with witty dark humour that had me laughing on many occasions. Bravo! 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Good Action/Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I want to say first that the first 40-45 minutes where not at all what I expected, but even though there was no horror the writing was so unique and interesting that I still wanted to see what happened. That being said I think this is by far Robert Rodriguez's most mature film and that it really showcases his directing ability. The fact that a horror movie can have no horror for the first half of the film and still be entertaining is a testament to Quentin Tarantino's brilliant characters. When the horror does come in it is indeed fast, furious and gruesome and may not be for the faint of heart. The performances are also very good George Clooney gives a solid performance and makes Seth Geko mean and yet vulnerable, even Tarantino's performance was good. You can tell that the crew that made this movie all worked incredibly hard and the result is well worth the effort if you ask me. Well I can't really say anything else with out spoiling the movie completely so just watch it for yourselves, and hopefully you can also survive From Dusk Till Dawn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is basically a movie about two robbers, their hostages and a host of drunken truckers and bikers fighting off vampiric strippers in Mexico. Sound good? OK, well, welcome to Robert Rodriguez' From Dusk Till Dawn, the only movie I've ever seen that has managed to so effectively make you afraid of mostly naked women. That has to be some kind of an accomplishment, and Quentin Tarantino is in this movie too - with a writing credit and a healthy post-Pulp Fiction sensibility to boot. That only adds to the surreality of the whole thing.So the movie pretty much jettisons along at rocket speed, with lots of silly moments and some really cool head explosions and gore later on when the slaying starts literally out of nowhere. Why are there vampires in Mexico? I don't know, all I know is that I'm not visiting any strip bars down there. This movie is worth watching though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From Dusk 'Til dawn is a film that pulls many punches. They are such drastic left turns that you as the viewer can not see it coming. The writing and acting are so good it is hard to turn away. There is a scene at the end of the first act, an exchange between Tarantino and Clooney (who make a surprisingly good duo). Clooney as Seth is the more powerful brother and overshadows Richie in every aspect of life, and in this scene it is no different. Seth still loves his brother, even though he is a vicious psychopath. He is the only one he has, they only have each other. The shear power of this scene will resonate and when you think of this movie later on, this is the scene you will refer to. It is that good and one of the best scene committed to celluloid in the entire history of film. This is Quentin's second best script and Rodriguez's best film for it. George Clooney plays an ultra-suave bad ass and Quentin plays an aforementioned psychopath. Harvey Kietel, however,plays the foil to Clooney's Seth. Keitel plays Jacob, a priest who has lost his faith in the Lord. This comes into play when they are faced with vampires Seth is sure are from Hell and Jacob does not. Even though, in the middle, the film completely changes tone and setting, it never loses it's human dynamic. Being a gore hound myself, I can not help but love the second half. I must say Quentin and Robert are brave filmmakers. This film turns out to be incredibly gory and violent and awesome! No never mind to the "best" films ever, this is one of the greats. It is about Seth and Richie as brothers and it is also about Seth and Jacob as blood brothers. Blood brothers against the world, or in the case of the second half, the bowels of hell itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Weirdest Twist Of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you hadn't gone into From Dusk Til Dawn without knowing about the vampire bits, WTF would be the most accurate thing you could say for sure. I mean honestly, it starts off criminal bros kidnap family take em over the border, while being fairly good we've seen it before. We get to the Titty Twister. Still good, wow! Cheech Marin and cult actor Danny Trejo! Then ever more wow! Selma Hayak seductively dancing! Wow! Then heads roll, green and red body fluids spray and George Clooney has to kill a vampire Quentin Tarantino. OTT, violent, sexy and oozing style this movie is a mind-blowing experience and will make you return over and over again. It's real strange stuff but real good s****.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quentin Tarantino is a genius, and I'm not even sure I know why he is a genius. The opening to this movie rivals Pulp Fiction as some of the coolest work the man has done. Yes, Rodriguez directed, but Tarantino wrote and acted, and I consider this to fully be his movie. Every Rodriguez film where Tarantino had no major influence has totally sucked and been a bore-fest.The first half is awesome Pulp Fiction-ish stuff, but once they get to the Titty Twister it turns to awesome 30 Days of Night-ish stuff. The only problem I could find with either half was the creature effects were pretty outdated and really took away from the feel.With that said, the characters are completely believable and freaking fun. The plot is pure genius. I didn't even have to check the time for how long it had left even once, which is pretty much something I do with every movie. I wasn't bored for a second, and I get bored insanely easily.It's even better if you have no idea what is going to happen, and I highly suggest you watch it like that or have a friend watch it like that. This movie is one that really relies on surprise to fully love.This movie is one that understands entertainment, not just a petty cliché moral. How much better can a movie get?5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's impossible to love this movie. Half of it seems like such a straight-up post-heist thriller, and then all of a sudden, bang! Vampires, man! I knew about the twist before, because of this wonderful spoiler-free world we live in (I complain, as I spoil the movie) but it still caught me off guard.It really captures the feeling that people get when something completely unexpected happens. After all the vampires came out, the rest of the movie seemed like just a dream. Nothing seemed real.Just a great, great movie in general. Robert Rodriguez, you are a genius.And then he did Spy Kids, ladies and gentlemen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was just flipping through channels and just happened to catch the ending of Desperado, and the next movie opened, and it looked decent (Afterall, what else was I to watch at 1:45 a.m.?). So I knew nothing about the storyline. You can imagine my utter surprise when this crime/hostage movie turns into a vampire thriller when Selma Hayek morphs into a vamp.Honestly, I enjoyed the suspense of the first half better than the second, because I'm not really into vampires. But, it was still good, and I was so hooked, I had to watch until the end even if that meant staying up until 3 a.m.I think I would have enjoyed this movie considerably more if it would have stayed on the "normal" hostage/crime thriller it began with. Because it basically went from being a believable somewhat psychotic thriller to being totally impossible and unrealistic.The ending, too could have been a lot better. I appreciate all the irony, and how you don't really know what happens to Kate in the end..yes, we see her drive off, but who really knows whats to come of her. And although I appreciated Richie dying, part of me wishes it could have been one of those "everyone gets out alive" movies. There's not many of those, but who doesn't enjoy a happy ending? Which, of course, I'm sure Quinton wasn't really looking for a happy ending when he wrote it...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From Dusk till Dawn is that rare movie these days it's a movie willing to take a chance and to try to be what it is a pure escapist film one that tells you at the first scene to shut your brain off you'll enjoy it better that way. People who analyze it too much won't be able to enjoy it for what it is a fun story that has a quick twist in the middle and it is there where the real story begins. In the beginning we meet Seth And Ritchie Gecko two outlaw brothers trying to escape the law and head towards Mexico. It's complicated by Ritchie's poor judgment skills and the fact that he is delusional and that gets them both into trouble. Did I mention that Ritchie is a murdering Sex fiend with no sense of being Subtle whatsoever. Ritchie's idea of solving a problem is by killing who ever he's arguing with at the time. Seth is a master of conversation he would talk his way out of trouble but push him and he'll kill you stone cold dead. The First half is a crime film in which Seth And Ritchie take the Fuller family hostage Ala The desperate hours. They Use the Fuller RV to get into Mexico and wait at the Titty Twister a bar catering to bikers and truckers. Seth And Ritchie are waiting for Carlos a Mexican Crime lord who offers Seth And Ritchie safe Haven in El Rey for thirty percent of their loot. Once we enter the titty twister the movie changes Gear and steps up the pace it becomes a horror film complete with vampires. And a Standoff worthy of Howard Hawks. I wonder what Hawks would've done with this script and I tell myself he would've done it the same way. The Action is hot the Dialogue sharp and witty and the characterizations of the main characters is on target. This is by no means a academy award winning film but it has everything a serious film lover wants, Good direction A fast Pace A Good solid story And Superb acting from it's cast. Harvey Keital is solid and dependable as always as the minister Jacob Fuller fated to become a Fearless Vampire killer. And Quentin Tarentino is a good strong comedic actor turning a vile character like Ritchie into a almost likable person. George Clooney delivers the performance of a life time as Seth Gecko in a role that's got to be remembered as one of his best. If You don't believe me watch for yourself You are in for a special Treat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure Win</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by Robert Rodriguez, written by Quentin Tarantino, starring George Clooney, Quentin Tarantino, and Harvey Keitel, From Dusk Till Dawn is a film you can predict the level of greatness based on the cast and crew alone.It's about a two thieves, who are brothers. They need to get into Mexico to meet a guy, so they take a father and his two girls hostage and make them get through Mexico. They go to a strip bar, vampires attack, and fun ensues.The acting was good. Some actors were passable, while not great. But that made George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino, who acted very good, that much more badass. Harvey Keitel was really good, too, but I don't think as good as he was in Reservoir Dogs. Some other actors I noticed were great, as well. All in all, it was either great or good, so it's more than passable.It actually felt strange seeing George Clooney in a Quentin Tarantino/Robert Rodriguez film, since I have never seen him in one, and they tend to use many of the same actors. Not bad at all, George Clooney was a badass guy in this film, and I really liked his character, it was just a strange thing seeing him talk to Quentin Tarantino, at least for me.The action was fun. It mostly occurs in the last 40 minutes, but those 40 minute are very fun. The effects of the vampires were fun and decent. While not incredible, they worked.One thing I noticed is that when the first vampires reveals itself, and the action began, I, at first, felt sort of sad. The first hour has nothing to do with vampires, and that first hour really felt like a Quentin Tarantino screenplay. When the vampire fun begins, it starts to get a Dead-Alive, or Evil Dead 2, feel. I mean, more realistic than those two films, but still had the same feel. Hell, one of the vampires is playing a human-guitar. Yeah, that's kickass, but it's different from the realistic first hour. Although, after that short sadness I felt, and I got used to the action, I really enjoyed it. I think if the first hour was separate from the last 40 minutes, and each half had more in it, I would like it a little more. Especially the first hour, I absolutely adored.Overall, it's a great film. The action is great, the acting is good, if not great, and it had a pretty cool plot. I will most definitely buy this film. If you like the plot, if you like the cast and crew, or if you just like purely awesome action, I recommend you see this film. I would recommend a rental before a purchase, just to see it, but if you buy it I'm sure you would love it just as much. As I was told when I was recommend this, this film is "pure win".8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Succeeds where "Grindhouse" failed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As far as I'm concerned, "From Duck Till Dawn" succeeds where "Grindhouse" failed. This earlier collaboration between Robert Rodriguez (who directed) and Quentin Tarantino (who wrote the script) effectively captures the trashy mindless spirit of many early exploitation classics, while the special effects manage to remind the viewer the film was made in recent times. I guess that since its never ostensibly made as a tribute it manages to be much more accurate in capturing the drive-in spirit. It has plenty of delicious sleaze (particularly Salma Hayek's memorably sizzling striptease which further demonstrates Tarantino's bizarre foot fetish), graphic violence, and some pulpy dialog courtesy of Tarantino (while it isn't nearly as standout as "Pulp Fiction" or "Reservoir Dogs", the dialog is nicely snappy).The direction by Rodriguez is very good and keeps it all moving at a lightning quick pace. I like him a lot mainly because, even if I don't always enjoy his films themselves, he always seems to be only making movies for himself. The screenplay by Tarantino is, as mentioned earlier, not as memorable as some of his other work, but thats probably because this was an early project. The acting is generally good. George Clooney proves that when he's good, he's really good as an actor. Juliette Lewis and Harvey Keitel both prove to be criminally underrated actors. The only weak spot is unsurprisingly Tarantino. Hes annoying and nasal the whole way through. As talented a screenwriter and director he is, the man could never act. Still, it is essentially a big b-movie, so you don't exactly expect memorable performances. You expect trashy entertainment, which "From Dusk Till Dawn" delivers completely. (8/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, where do I start? Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez, two amazingly creative film makers, both had a hand in this film which made me have to see it. Now I went into the film with high expectations and was not disappointed at all. It was not necessarily what I expected but it turned out to be a non-stop, action packed ride. Great cast, good acting, good writing and an excellent filmmaker (Robert Rodriguez). I couldn't think of another director who could make a film such as this one and make it actually work out the way it did. Of course there is pretty graphic violence in it but most people would expect this if you've seen any of Rodriguez's other movies. Overall I recommend this movie to anyone who wants a rush of action-packed cinema. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>90 minutes of pure fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As others have said, this is a movie of two halves. Quentin's and Robert's. There's no doubt about which they are. From the very beginning of them both. The shift between is immediately recognizable as well. I doubt even a little effort was made on anyone's part to cover any of this up. Why should they? They aren't kidding anyone, nor attempting to do so. This is clearly, from start to finish, meant to be enjoyable, and guess what? It is. Whether that makes it their weakest piece is up for debate... I personally don't believe so. It's no secret that Rodriguez does his best work when the writing is done for him... just take Sin City... and he actually emulates Tarantino's directorial style well, keeping his own, highly energetic and cartoon-inspired, under wraps save for his portion. Aforementioned, however, is a more skillful script author(and herein, actually a pretty decent actor). So with them each filling the respective role they fit better, we're set for solid entertainment. And they certainly deliver. So do the effects crew. The music never leaves anything to be desired. The action is awesome. There is quite a bit of blood, gore and violence in this. Straight, single males also have plenty to look at. Clooney is bad-ass, with credit to QT for putting the words in his mouth, literally. The acting varies, but it's never downright poor. Savini isn't bad. The humor is twisted. The tone is cheesy. The pacing is about spot-on. The plot remains interesting throughout. Characters are relatively developed, certainly sufficiently. If you'll allow me to briefly digress... those viewing this and subsequently wanting a similar gaming experience, I would advise against going for the licensed release, of 2001... I did only play the demo, but I was rather underwhelmed. I instead suggest Vampire Slayer, the free and legally so modification for Half-Life, as it is very obviously inspired by this. Turning my attention back to the film... go for this, those who are into Quentin Tarantino's dialog and story-lines, and/or Robert Rodriguez' action and visuals. There's a DVD of this available with featurettes, music videos, the full-length documentary Full Tilt Boogie and alternate footage. There is also an informative commentary with the two who came together to make this, and it's definitely worth a listen if you like this. I recommend this flick to any fans of the people who helped create it, the ones who belong in one or more of the aforementioned groups in particular. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like GRINDHOUSE, this movie is half Tarantino, half Rodriguez?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a bit peculiar because it mixes two very different kinds of plot and movies' genres, and that's just because of that it works so well. In the "first half" we watch a crime story with two outlaw brothers, SETH GECKO (played by George Clooney) and RICHARD GECKO (Quentin Tarantino) running away from authorities, after robber a bank and kill a few people. They kidnap a family, composed by a Pastor who lost his faith, JACOB FULLER (Harvey Keitel), his daughter KATE (Juliette Lewis) and his son SCOTT (Ernest Liu), and cross the border into Mexico. Arriving there they all go to a motorcyclist's bar, in the middle of nowhere, which claims it self to be "open from dusk till dawn". The "second half" begins! After a great show by "SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM (Salma Hayek)", a bloody and gory fight starts between these mentioned characters (and some new and funny ones which only appear in the bar, like the "SEX MACHINE") and some vampires (which are the owners of the bar and the stripper girls). A very different kind of plot and "movie" begins! From a crime and kidnapping story it passes to a gory vampire slasher! The main idea is quite original and funny, and we can feel Tarantino's touch on it. The screenplay is from him, in spite of the original story not be. I think it's another classic of the 90's, not because it's an excellent movie, but because its main idea worked very well and was quite refreshing. I also appreciated its humor and the great acting from the main actors. Tarantino included! The soundtrack is also fine, especially when they arrive at the bar. On the other hand, we can also notice Robert Rodriguez's directing through the many action scenes, done in his personal style? In fact, I would say it was the first experience where Tarantino and Rodriguez joined their personal styles to create a film. We can watch such idea more developed and matured in their recent GRINDHOUSE, but I think it was the very beginning. Because like GRINDHOUSE I think this film is separated in two very different parts: the first one with Tarantino's cinematographic style; and the second one with Rodriguez's!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Starts off like a Tarantino film, but becomes a Rodriguez movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a very unique movie. Yes I say that a lot, but its true. Especially with From Dusk til Dawn. Tarantino and Rodriguez always make great films together, and this was no exception. The film starts off in a basic "Tarantino Movie" sense that is seen and felt in Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. However, it quickly becomes a Rodriguez film in the blink of an eye, and it has the "Rodriguez Movie" feel that his other films have. The actors which appear here are seen in many other Tarantino and Rodriguez movies. From Tarantino's films, we have: Harvey Keitel (Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction), Michael Parks (Kill Bill, Death Proof), small parts such as Lawrence Bender (Producer in a lot of Tarantino films) even Tarantino himself. And from Rodriguez's movies we have: George Clooney (Spy Kids), Cheech Martin (Spy Kids, Planet Terror), Danny Trejo (Spy Kids, Planet Terror), even Tom Savini (automatically makes this movie awesome). This was a great combination of directing and story. The characters here were all very memorable and were given a great story to work with. Many will argue that this movie is very violent and gory, well, aside from Spy Kids, all of Rodriguez's films are violent, mindless, and very cold at times (see Planet Terror or Sin City if you want an example). Yet this movie was underrated for it. Only a 6.9 while Planet Terror got a 7.7 and Sin City got an 8.4 (all ratings as of 3/2/08). I guess people were expecting a Tarantino movie like Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs and were unhappy when they saw what type of movie this was. I thought it was great. Harvey Keitel was very good. George Clooney was surprisingly the best actor here. Tarantino played a very good psycho also. Juliette Lewis and Ernest Liu were also very good. My man Tom Savini was great as Sex Machine (I love the gun trick he uses). Fred Williamson was also good as Frost. Cheech Marin was good in all 3 parts he played, Danny Trejo and Salma Hayek were great. There were no bad performances as far as I could tell. This was a good movie and deserves the same respect as movies like Sin City, Reservoir Dogs, and all of those. 9/10 seems like a good rating for this movie but just isn't what everyone else agrees with. See this movie if you are a Rodriguez movie fan, you will enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I were allowed to split this up, I'd give a "10" to the first half and a "1" to the second, only because Salma Hayak was in it. Other than that, it's a mindless, ludicrous, gratuitous, gore-fest, with unnecessary religious overtones.It started off so well, and could have rivaled "Pulp Fiction" in all departments if they had so chosen.Mr. Tarantino is ill-advised to "act" in any of his films; he came very close to ruining Pulp Fiction with his unbelievably crass "dead n*gger storage" routine. Fortunately, he wasn't quite so bad here, but they certainly should have cast somebody else. Anybody else.I would even go so far as to say the second half was as bad as Kill Bill II. Yes, that bad.George Clooney is flawless in this. He steals every scene he's in. Harvey Keitel demonstrates why he is one of my favourite actors. Juliette Lewis does herself proud, and makes me wonder why we haven't seen a lot more of her.If you liked Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs and you haven't seen this one yet, I would recommend that you watch it attentively up until they arrive at the Titty Twister, then turn it off and invent your own scenario as to how it might've ended. Trust me, you'll be a lot better off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is about 2 criminals on the run with 3 hostages. They enter a strip bar for a drink, and this changes their life forever.To sum up, this film is crazy in a good way. Only Quentin Tarantino can make a film like this. The plot is interesting, the first half is a typical fugitive story, while the second half turns into a gory horror film about vampires. The initial half successfully portrays Richie as a deranged psychopath. The second half is very gory, as body parts, slime and blood fly in every direction every second. Due to the visual exaggeration, the resultant effect is not so scary, but entertaining and at times even comedic. This film is entertaining and crazy at the same time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lets cut straight to the point. This is no masterclass in cinema, this is no thought provoking, intellectual study of human nature, or anything for that matter. Reality and subtlety go straight out the window for this flick. It starts as what looks like another "bad robbers take hostages" movie, but soon enough descends into a 'feast your eyes on this' gloriously OTT, bloodthirsty, semi-comic piece of gore porn.It tells the tale of bank-robbing brothers Seth (Clooney)and Richard (Tarantino) Gecko, who are on the run from the law after several murders. Soon enough they run into a small family travelling in an RV, the father Jacob (Keitel) daughter Kate (Lewis) and son Scott (Lui). The Gecko's use them and their RV as means to cross the boarder into Mexico, where the brother have a meeting with a drug baron arranged. The meet is to take place at a brightly lit, Gothic looking venue called the "Titty Twister" out in the desert. It is about now that the film starts to turn into another genre, the hostage plot steps back into the shadow as the bar's employee's turn out to be seriously, and I mean SERIOUSLY bad news.Does this mean it is bad? NO, I actually thought it was awesome upon first viewing and still do now. Its one of those totally uninhibited films you can sit back and enjoy without having to think too much. It is gripping from the start, seeing the Brothers run into various obstacles whilst evading capture, then later watching with baited breath as the remaining survivors trapped inside the Titty Twister contemplate their rather unfortunate situation.Clooney is especially good as wise cracking but highly dangerous Seth Gecko, its quite a change from his other roles. Also look out for horror maestro Tom Savini, 80's movie star Fred Williamson, Cheech Marin playing 3 separate roles and of course what film set in Mexico wouldn't be complete with out Danny Trejo.</fullReview>

Nevermind, the film has some excellent script moments, some excellent cinematography moments and some superb action sequences. However, the movie just falls short of being excellent due to limp performances by the other cast members as well as lumbering towards a mad and terrific ending. George Clooney's last statement to Juliette Lewis is one of the coolest one liners ever and helps define him as a future movie hero.

		<shortDescription>Keeps you entertained</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some say that this movie started out slow. And naturally for a movie that gives you so much insight into characters where most of them are going to die by the end of the movie I normally find it kind of boring and pointless, too. But not this one, in this movie the characters were pretty entertaining and I found the events leading up to the massacre to be quite entertaining also.There's the out of control sexual predator brother, his murderous "only when need be" older brother, a preacher that lost his faith, and two his teenagers. The only thing that really got on my nerves, though was how they tried to make the preacher man seem like he was a good guy bad ass when really all I thought it was was annoying. And then there was the plot hole of how this strip club managed to operate killing all truck drivers without none of them kicking their asses like they did in this movie and also why considering the fact that they were hauling semis why no one would go and look for them.Other than those two things I found this movie to be great! And would recommend it to anyone!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the unlikely marriage of "Pulp Fiction" (1994) and "Evil Dead" (1981)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sourced from a story Quentin Tarantino penned in his youth and dusted off in the wake of the "Pulp Fiction" impact, this Robert Rodriguez effort achieves this incredible hybrid. I must say I am uneven about the two authors of these credentials. For Tarantino, I thoroughly enjoyed "Kill Bill: Volume I and II" (2003/2004) and at a pinch "Reservoir Dogs" (1992) but "Pulp Fiction" isn't in my straitjacket of the most memorable movies made in the nineties. As for Sam Raimi, the "Evil Dead" saga hasn't got a prominent place in my favorite horror movies but "a Simple Plan" (1998) and the adventures of Peter Parker/Spider-Man gave me a positive side from him.I could have the same judgment about Rodriguez himself: I saw "the Faculty" (1999) when it was theatrically released and I forgot all about it. Ditto for "Sin City" (2005) which was visually a black splendor but I don't remember much about the story. On the positive side, "From Dusk Till Dawn" entertained me until the last shot. It's cut in two distinct parts. The first one has more the look of a road-movie imbued with thriller with stunts, shootings, corpses galore and a dash of suspense. It's the part I favor the most. The second half of the film changes territory and takes a leap into the gore movie sourced from the eighties with blood, special effects to satisfy the genre. There is also a little of George A. Romero's masterwork "the Night of the Living Dead" (1968) and I do think this part is weaker than the first. The action becomes a bit sluggish and special effects are sometimes too intrusive. But perhaps, it was an inescapable rule to this kind of story.The amount is a film rooted in two different cinematographic genres and if it's a little hard to swallow, it means to jump on a genre while jettisoning the other, Rodriguez's effort has positive things in its contents to have a good time. Sequences are shot with care and shrewdness like the very first one. Like in "Reservoir Dogs", we won't properly see the bloody break-in but just verbal facts from the characters and the TV. It is also permitted to hail Tarantino for his sharp dialogs. My favorite lines are when George Clooney and Tarantino take Harvey Keitel and his son hostage and Juliette Lewis arrives in the room from the swimming pool:- What's, um, going on? - We're having a bikini contest and you just won.Later in the van on the road that leads to Mexico:- Where are you taking us? - Mexico - What's in Mexico? - Mexicans.Black humor shouldn't be neglected like the sequence when the journalist says the increasing number of killed people after the hold-up. And the actors seem to have fun as much as we do, notably Clooney and Tarantino in psychopathic killers who shoot first and ask themselves questions then.This B movie won't cater for all tastes for evident reasons but as it is painstakingly made as a whole, the alliance Rodriguez/Tarantino paid off well and it's a film to which I would return with pleasure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now vampire strippers are cool and the director does a great job. The cast is amazing and the story really works. The vampire effects really works and the CG effects works and keep an eye out for Cheech who plays three different parts, all perfectly. Can you point them out? George Clooney is a very likable rogue and Quienton does a great acting job. This is one of the most unique twists on the vampire genre. It is unexpected fun flick with lots are thrills and action to make the most hard core action fan at the edge of his seat. It's just perfect, almost, not quite. But close to perfect. Now this is a flick that is worth watching over and over again. 8 STARS.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be one of my very favorite vampire films of all time.And I love a good vampire film.The thing that really struck me about this film is it's out of left field segue-way into the vampire section.First it's a bank heist film,then it's an escape over the border film.Then without so much as a minor foreshadowing ,it's a vampire film.Rodriquez's photography is so awesome it's unbelievable.His shots are tight crisp,and really convey intense emotion.It has to be my all time favorite George Clooney performance.He plays the ultra cool amoral anti-hero,mixed with a Bruce Willisian machine gun speed quips and one liners.It was almost existential in its conception.Every actor gave a wonderful believable performance,especially Tarintino,and Keitel.I would give this film two thumbs up(three if I had them)The first five minutes is worth the price of admission alone.Ydnar</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two for the price of one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, what's wrong with a film that is actually two films? Some commentators seem to suggest that's necessarily a bad thing. Nothing says films have to be linear, straight line things - and you can bet that anything Tarantino is involved in probably won't be.I was a little surprised when what started out to be a taut and thought-provoking brutal crime film noir turned into a comedy vampire flick, I'll admit. Didn't see it coming at all. But, was I offended or feel cheated? No. Both 'halves' of the film were enjoyable in their deferent ways. Tell you the truth, Tarantino's character in the first half was SO evil I was actually wondering if I could sit through another forty or fifty minutes of such tautness waiting for him to harm Juliette Lewis in some way. That is, of course, just a tip of the hat to Tarantino's writing skill.Not that the film didn't try to at least tie in the vampire slash-fest at the end with the thriller at the beginning. For example, Tarantino's evil, sex-crime, murderer was at least killed, in his turn, by a woman (a sex crime in itself) and so there is a measure of poetic justice (well, a lot of it if you think out how each of the characters dies I guess) in all of this.This is definitely one to just kick back and enjoy, though. Too much introspection will ruin it for sure. The music is terrific and Clooney is possibly the best I've ever seen him. Don't slag Tarantino off of for acting either, he's pretty good in this - more for what he doesn't say than what he does.In short, halfway through this film you think you're watching something special and are going to get value for money and, in the end you do but maybe not for the reasons you think at the halfway mark. It's a film that is ultra serious and, in fact frighteningly horrifying, at first and then just laughs the crap out of itself and the horror genre for the rest of the time. I think (and I'm no expert) that Tarantino and Rodriguez are saying here that REAL LIFE is far more terrifying than HORROR. If so, they hit the nail on the head perfectly.Very hard not to like.PS: Cheech Marin (of Cheech and Chong) plays three parts and they are all a hoot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a good example that George Cloony can play any type of role...Great action and great performances by many...Scenes are outlandish but will make you laugh, make you cry, and make you scared...This is a movie that you have to see more than once to get the full content....Harvey Keitel is always a classic, George is tremendous, and Julie is always a beauty to watch and enjoy...she is loaded with that special kind of sex appeal that exists in some actresses that can play such a gross role and still be loved...The vampire scenes are a little far reaching but they are put together so that they arouse you feelings and attention and at the same time add some Cloony comedy to the entire farce of a great flick. the film makes you think, makes you devious, makes you love the absurd, makes you want more , and establishes the hunger for more of the same. Someone should do a follow up, but I wonder if George Cloony is still on the market for this type of action. Tarrantino-like flicks are appealing to those with open minds and desire for the macabre and this movie definitely fits all of the above.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What the heck?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie from the beginning to the end. First of all, we have the whole hostage situation with the Fullers and the psychotic Geckos. I honestly loved the two brothers because they were just plain psychotic and killed for the hell of it. It was completely evil. I honestly thought this would be a good movie, and would not end up being a big steaming pile of crap. Then, disaster struck. Honestly, this is the worst thing I have ever seen a movie do. Worse than the Rollerball night vision sequence (I say shamelessly), and worse than the steaming excrement found in the ending of Windtalkers - when the Geckos + Fullers cross over the border. As soon as I saw the "Titty Twister" neon light, I knew this movie was over. Cheech Marin's speech was gross-out and funny, but no line could save this piece of dung. When the lead dancer made that Looney-Tune-esq morph into a vampire, I literally spit soda all over the floor. My nose felt like it had just had a gigantic hit of crack from the mass explosion of soda that fell onto the floor below. The lead dancer then leaped forward and bit Tarantino's neck, which had to be either the stupidest or most awkward scene ever made, or maybe both. The movie degenerates from there, with an entirely clichéd vampire flick that came from nowhere. The only way I could describe this is the following: imagine a senior citizen center with a nice bingo game going on, and then 5 seconds later guerrillas rush in and mow everyone down and raze the place. That's exactly how this "twist" was. Finally (Spoilers) everybody dies but Clooney and Lewis, who walk out of the vampire hell hole leaving Lewis to go anywhere she wants. If they played the Cast Away end theme with Lewis looking off in the 3 other directions that didn't have mutilated corpses in them it would not have been out of place. In fact, it might have done this lame piece of crap justice.3 / 10</fullReview>

Hard to envisage them as brothers though unless one of the parents was totally different to the other.The second part is a horror film with Clooney, Keitel etc taking on a bunch of vampires.Overall fairly good as a bit of mindless entertainment. I enjoyed the second half more than the first.Decent performances by all the leads but hardly stretching.That dance by Salma though ... WOW</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gruesomely entertaining dark splatterhouse comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Dusk Till DawnIt is exceedingly difficult to categorize such a film as "From Dusk Till Dawn". Indeed, this may be a founded difficulty, as the film seems almost like two very different films each half completed, then mashed together in the middle. At first, the film seems like a standard Tarantino film, with his standard eclectic sense of dialogue and penchant for heavy violence and frequent profanity, following the story of the Geckos, two fugitive outlaw brothers (George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino) on the run from the cops, trying to make it over the Mexican border with their family of hostages. (Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis and Ernest Liu) However, when they reach the seedy Mexican bar arranged as a safe-house for the Gecko brothers however, the film takes an abrupt face. That's when the Rodriguez influence takes over, and the film suddenly turns into a splatterhouse intentionally bad for the sake of being entertaining monster flick, as it is revealed that the bar's workers are none other than... get ready for this... vampires. If it sounds stupid and incredulous... well, it is, there's no doubt about it, but that doesn't stop it from being one of the most ridiculously enjoyable splatterfest black comedies around.It's an odd little combination without a doubt, but for whatever reason, the bizarre mash of Tarantino's stylish wordplay and Rodriguez's later gore-fest seems to click, and the film comes together in a surprisingly entertaining fashion. It's nice to recall in this day and age of gravitas in monster movies that it is possible to make a monster flick only for the sake of being macabre and entertaining. The vampire effects are rather terribly done, but this is probably an intentional aspect, as it fits the oddly comedic tone of the picture perfectly. Only in a movie such as this could a director get away with giving a long monologue about Vietnam before being viciously bitten by a vampire, or a guitarist playing an instrument made out of human body parts. Such instances of coal black humour make up the most memorable parts of the film. Rodriguez also manages to draw impressive performances out of his cast, especially in the case of George Clooney, playing strongly against type in one of his first film roles as Seth Gecko, the tough as nails outlaw who is forced to become a sort of antihero to survive the vampire attack. Harvey Keitel also gives a powerful performance as the father of the kidnapped family, an ex-pastor forced to re-confront matters of faith. Keitel brings a sense of class and dignity to what is without a doubt one of the silliest films he has ever taken part in. Although Quentin Tarantino has received a lot of flack for writing himself into the script, he actually gives a fine performance as Richard Gecko, Clooney's paranoid and homicidal brother. Tarantino serves as the comic relief for most of the film's first half, especially in his first scene. Juliette Lewis gives a decent performance as Keitel's daughter who is also taken hostage, but Ernest Liu as the final kid in the family gives a rather lacklustre and unbelievable performance, almost (but not quite) ruining the superb scenes when Clooney talks to his hostages while riding their stolen RV. Salma Hayek also makes a sumptuous addition to the film, performing her snake dance, one of the most memorable stripteases in film history... without even removing any clothes!For those with low thresholds for gore or swearing, or those seeking out a more realistic and enlightening film, it is doubtful From Dusk Till Dawn will prove to your tastes. But for those willing to leave reality at the door and just enjoy a ridiculous yet absurdly entertaining vampire romp complete with intentionally inferior special effects and enough blood and gore to satisfy even the most bloodthirsty viewers, fraught with comedy as black as the night, this is the film for you.-8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flashy and profane</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stylish, violent thriller concerning bank-robbing brothers (George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino!) who kidnap a preacher and his two kids in order to cross the U.S. border into Mexico; they eventually wind up at a biker bar full of vampires. The satirical edges in Tarantino's barbed screenplay continually make light of all the bloody carnage, and one wonders if we're supposed to laugh at the non-stop barrage of shootings, stabbings, gorings, and bodies on fire. Undeniably energetic, unsubtle, high-voltage stuff; it has a terrific cast including Harvey Keitel and Juliette Lewis, but it won't be to everyone's liking. Followed by a straight-to-tape sequel, which involved none of the talents here. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Dusk Till Dawn is my favorite movie ever. I think that it contains all the elements of a fun, exciting and re watchable movie.The acting is my favorite part of the movie. Clooney is so bad an actor that he's fun to watch. He actually is unable to say lines in the script, and they leave the bad takes in the final cut of the movie. He also has some very memorable and campy lines, such as "Okay ramblers, let's get rambling", "okay hard drinkers, lets drink hard, I'm buying" and of course, "Okay Vampire Killers, lets kill some f****in' vampires!" Tarantino was much better an actor, and his character had many dimension which made him worth watching. Keitel was awesome as always, deeply philosophical and really bringing life to his character, and all the others played their bit parts with enthusiasm and humor.The plot is pretty bizarre, but it just works. The first part deals with the escape of two outlaw brothers. They killed a lot of people and are looking to escape to Mexico, and kidnap Keitel and his family to smuggle them over the border. They arrive at the rendez-vous point, the titty twister bar, and wait for the arrival of Carlos, their escort. Pretty soon all hell breaks loose and the survivors band together to fight a horde of vampires who have been running this bar.The gruesome violence, which is even more graphic in the DVD is just awesome and fun to watch. Homages are paid to many great movies, like the wild bunch, and the special effects are just spectacular. The dialog from the survivors is just priceless, from when they discuss how to kill vampires to when The Hammer tells his Nam flashback, to the stunning finale and final goodbyes.I cannot think of a more bizarre, fun, and deep popcorn thriller. Highly recommended to any fan of vampires, action, Tarantino, or clooney's god awful acting (which works for the movie). 10 out of 10</fullReview>

It's got a great build up which totally misleads you to the other half of the movie, which is in itself sheer genius how they put vampires in such a seemingly normal road thriller.Quentin Tarintino is impressive as Richard Gecko, delivering great lines in a very unique way, I personally think he's under rated as an actor. George Clooney is very, very cool as his brother Seth Gecko, however it was predicted that he would survive and turn out being the good guy.This movies is in all honesty a brilliantly unique film with many great characters, e.g Sex Machine, a very sexy dance by Salma Hayek and some great vampire killing.

		<fullReview>I watched the film about a week ago and i think i have to post my comment now.I love this movie, it's one of my favorites. The film is split in 2 parts: first the movie shows how the gecko brothers try to get to Mexico, the second part is about the "titty twister" where they fight against vampires...the movie is exciting (especially the escaping), and its absolutely fun because of the Tarantino dialogue and cult scenes. if you want to watch an exciting and serious vampire film, watch another movie. i think Tarantino and Rodriguez made all that vampire stuff just for fun and to make something really weird, crazy and surprising (and they did it damn good,). some ppl say that they are disappointed because they suspected a good horror film. in my opinion it's not really a horror movie, the fun is the most important in from dusk till dawn.if you could REALLY laugh in pulp fiction or movies like sin city (not just grin, really LAUGH) this movie is perfect for you.i recommend it for every Tarantino/rodriguez fan. a really must-see.10/10</fullReview>

Now he was pure genius as the fallen preacher. There is even Cheech Marin as the boarder patrol man who you can hardly recognize. (He does return as another character, a vampire. But forget that).

		<fullReview>From Dusk Till Dawn is Rodriguez' best directing feat to-date and I cannot even believe how awesome it is. It stars the very elite of badass cinema--George Clooney, Quentin Tarantino, Harvey Keitel and Juliette Lewis. The two former play brothers and partners in crime on their way to Mexico for a big business rendez-vous and on their way they take a family of three hostage in order to get a ride there. You may think you have the good taste not to enjoy something as silly as its premise, but as far as horror films go, this is quality. Harcore quality.I will tell you what makes From Dusk Till Dawn awesome and what sets it apart from other films. The first half of the movie looks like it's taking the form of a hostage drama and you're left thinking that it will probably culminate in a couple of murders once the brothers reach their destination in Mexico. This part is very nicely handled as it builds up tension in the plot and at the same time has this barren Western feeling as the vehicle swooshes through the desert. The dialogue is very Tarantinoesque (he wrote it, after all). Then, as they reach their rendez-vous point they enter a titty bar somewhere in Mexico. Only, this isn't your average shady strip-club but it is stock-full of vampires at night. God, this part is so random. So what starts off as a hostage drama suddenly turns into a full-on war against vampires, with the family and brothers left fending for themselves against these awful creatures all night long.From Dusk Till Dawn is foul-mouthed, gory, brutal, funny and extremely unpredictable. It also contains one of the most haunting final shots ever in a movie. I highly recommend it. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So, I already knew before I watched it that it had something to do with Vampires. But, by the time you get half way into the movie you completely forget about that, because you're so involved in the rest of the story. George Clooney gives probably his best performance as Seth, a robber and killer with his brother and side kick Richie played by Tarentino. The two hold up in a motel, and kidnap Harvey Keitel's family which includes Juliette Lewis as his daughter, for their motor home since the cops are looking for the two convicts.They reach the border to Mexico, and this is where the movie really begins.It turns from a con-man type film into something completely different. Really, really different. Basically it kind of turns into a horror movie. I loved it, and thought it was one of the best films I've ever seen. And, I can't wait to watch it again. I will however, not recommend this to anyone under the age of eighteen. It's pretty gruesome at times, and there's a lot of foul language, and graphic dialogue, not suitable for anyone under that age.But, for everyone else, check it out. Even if you're not normally used to watching horror films or slick-'em dice-'em type movies, you might actually like this one. It's pretty clever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rarely go in for horror flicks. Actually, never. I didn't realise this would be one when I started the movie, but the horror was done tastefully :).Any road, I wanted to make a mythological statement, which can be taken for what it's worth. Christianity is not the only religion that would have power over vampires (supposing they existed). Greek religion has several Gods who would be effective as well. I'm thinking primarily of far-darting Apollon. His attributes are light, archery (arrows are usually made of wood) and He killed the Python at Delphi (the vampires had a decidedly reptilian look).Lewis put me in mind of another deity who was known for archery: Artemis, the virgin huntress.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dusk stars George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino as Seth and Richard Gecko, two professional thieves, also brothers, who are on the run from the FBI in Richita, Texas.The opening 15 minutes is as cool and entertaining as you will likely find in any movie as we are shown Seth (Clooney), the older brother, a thief and scoundrel, but deep down an honorable man who wants nothing more than for he and his brother to get across the Mexican border with their stolen loot, so they can retire in paradise. And the younger brother, Richie (Tarantino), an unhinged psychopath and r@pist who enjoys inflicting pain and death on those unfortunate enough to cross his path.The first half of this movie plays like a psychological thriller, as Seth tries to contain his brothers psychopathic tendencies long enough to get them across the border to safety. When an Ex-Priest (Harvey Keitel) and his two children Kate and Scott (Juliette Lewis, as white trash as ever, and Ernest Liu) stumble across the Gecko brothers, they are taken hostage and are forced to smuggle the brothers over the Mexican border in their motor home.The second half of this movie then becomes an action horror as the Geckos and their captives take refuge in a Mexican bar named the Titty Twister. Unfortunately, the bar is full of crazed Vampire monsters with a lust for blood and the brothers are forced to team with their hostages if they are to make it out alive.Now I DO like this movie, though for the life of me I don't know why! The acting is good, and the action scenes (Pre-Vampire) are well done. The sudden shift in genre halfway through the movie doesn't sit right with me though, as much as it is a novel idea, I feel it came way out of left field and it left me shocked when I first saw the movie.There are some cheesy moments of dialogue, mostly from Clooney, too. The movie, like my opinion of it, cannot seem to make up its mind.Bottom line though, the movie does entertain and Salma Hayeks sexy dance is worth at least one viewing of the film on its own. Also, look out for several cameo appearances from Cheech Marin (of Cheech and Chong fame) playing several minor characters. If you are a fan of action horror and violence, then this film will work for you. Otherwise you probably will not like it. But I do!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is just a time pass. Not worth to repeat. The first half is boring but logical..the second half is completely different as if two movies with same characters are merged together. In the second half the movie goes interesting but quite hard to make your own sense believe that what we are seeing can be defined. I have seen many great movies based on concepts that doesn't exist in our world but the director and writer (with their skills) make our sense believe that what we are seeing exists at least for about one and half hours. But to my horror this movie is just a.....what should I say....just for time pass with no great expectation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Modern Horror Isn't All Bad...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An age-old horror theme taking a turn into the Tarantino generation results in what could be the most clever modern vampire epic since FRIGHT NIGHT, and in my opinion, has held, and probably will hold for a while, that rank.FROM DUSK TIL DAWN will have you craving for vampire gore throughout much of the first hour or so, but the pacing is nice enough to let you glide gracefully until you reach the climax, until then, all the great Tarantino writing and the Robert Rodriguez style action keeps you entertained and interested.Sure, this film isn't for all horror purists, but when was the last time a film was loved by every single viewer who ever watched it? You won't hear me complaining at all about FROM DUSK TIL DAWN. It's a prime example of what a modern vampire flick should be, since every other possible way to make a good one has already been the key essence of those blood-sucker films from the 1920s until the mid 1970s.There is now a fictional universe that is understood by a handful of people. Mayhem is everyday life. Guns lock and load every second. Simple people are pulled into the character's troubles against their will. Big Kahuna Burger joints spring up as fast as any McDonald's or Taco Bell. Foul language is just kind, normal speech. This is a universe that is only fully recognized by its creator. This is the Tarantino Universe.---(Don't forget to pop a Red Apple in your mouth and light up!) -D.T.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well Made Action Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**1/2 out of ****Now here is a cool idea. A film with a Quentin Tarantino plot and Robert Rodriguez action. It makes you almost believe that it could be twice as good as PULP FICTION (1994) and DESPERADO (1995). And it is, kind of.The plot is relatively complicated. Two brothers, Seth (George Clooney, who does very well here) and Richie (Director Quentin Tarantino who is just plain scary in this film) are on a crime spree(NATURAL BORN KILLERS should ring a bell)and kidnap a priest and his two children. They drive to Mexico and find a biker joint, whose residents cause quite a damper on their evening. The second half of the film is pure action and mayhem at its loudest and its most explosive.Here is the problem with this film. It feels like two completely different films in one. The first half of the film is just like another QT classic. It has all the plot, over the top action, and intelligent script. It is a really great road movie. But then, the halfway mark approaches. The film turns from cool to Wacked Out. We no longer have the cool dialog and neat characters. Now we have a film, somewhat like a horror film, that is too quick, too strange, too random, and too action packed for us to care about anything other than what neat special effect they have next, or, who is going to survive. Kind of like a Rodreguez film.Still, if you are looking for a really fun movie full of action, adventure, laughs, and horror, this should suit you fine. If you are just in it for the Quintin Tarantino or Robert Rodriguez stuff, you might be disappointed. I enjoyed this film a lot. But I was kind of hoping it would be a lot more organized.Watch for Selma Hayak is a small but unbelievably sexy role. The film is worth watching just for her.Rated R for strong violence and gore, language and nudity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nicely twisted -- all time great insomniac special</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the kind of movie you stumble across on cable while channel surfing in the middle of an insomniac night. You see Harvey Keitel, George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino, but you can't place it among their more familiar efforts, especially if you missed the opening credits and you don't have a channel guide.By this point you are hooked in what seems like a crime-spree/hostage/road flick. The journey surprisingly leads to a biker bar/roadhouse/strip joint in the middle of nowhere Mexico, where Salma Hayek performs what is perhaps the most erotic snake dance ever committed to film. Without fully stripping, she dances on a table, slips off here heels, puts her bare toes in Tarantino's mouth and pours liquor that runs down her leg into his mouth.All of a sudden, the bar denizens turn into vampire ghouls and all hell breaks loose, with plenty of gore. All the while, you ask yourself: "What IS this movie?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a classic movie from Rodriguez/Tarrantino containing an impressing set of actors (Clooney, Keitel, Lewis, Hayek etc).The movie is split in two distinct parts. The first one follows a standard Tarrantino formula with absolutely terrific dialog and cool scenery. The second part of the movie is more action-oriented although still filmed with a lot of style (reminds me of Desperado).Favorite line: Seth: If you try to run, I've got six little friends and they can all run faster than you can.

		<fullReview>Two dangerous convicts hold up a convenience store and end up executing a Texas Ranger and engaging in a bloody shootout with the clerk. After leaving, they take family hostage, a once-preacher father and his son and daughter. They make them a deal, stay with them until coming dawn and they will be released unharmed. They hole up for the night in a back-roads bar just over the Mexican border. Unknown to them though, they will soon be fighting for their lives against the bar's real owners, a group of vampires with a taste for blood and gore.This is a joint film between Quentin Tarentino, the creator of such classics as Pulp Fiction and later Kill Bill, and Robert Rodriguez, the creator of El Mariachi and later Sin City. With Rodriguez directing and Tarentino writing, producing and acting, this film is a force to be reckoned with. The script is classic Tarentino, with references to other cult classics, his own and others, and the dialogue is flawless in getting us close to the characters. The style of Desperado and El Mariachi is seen here too and shows why Rodriguez is one of the most coveted directors in Hollywood.The acting next to the crew is what really gets this film going. In the opening scene alone, a Texas Ranger played by Michael Park shows what real acting is in his short role of only a few minutes. George Clooney and Tarentino as the convicts play off each other well with Clooney being the quick-witted professional and Tarentino playing his younger brother with a psychopath hiding beneath the surface. Tarentino plays his role well, but Clooney shines as Seth Gecko with classic one-liners and acting ability. Harvey Keitel is great as the preacher father who lost his faith in God and Juliette Lewis as his daughter shows acting potential as well. Smaller roles by Fred Williamson and make-up artist Tom Savini do not go unnoticed either.This movie is almost two films in one as the opening half gets us into the characters and the second being a twist into horror as the characters fight for their lives against the vampires. People may find that one half suits them better than the other, but no matter what, Rodriguez, Tarentino and the actors take us for a ride that few will forget.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this movie is quite disturbing at the start, where it portrays murder of an innocent woman and the horrible slaughter of a shop keeper. Tarantino's acting is questionable but Clooney and Keitel are formidable. I think The end is brilliant. What would be best would be if Tarantino had cut out the disturbing start of this film and gone from when they enter Mexico. Obviously he could just as easily re-do the start to make it less controversial, maybe with the brother's escape from jail. The scene with vampires is brilliant. I didn't know that was how the film was going to turn out, but Tarantino is brilliant in directing these final scenes. I was expecting a most un-supernatural ending, such as a shootout with the police, but the vampire slaying ending is absolutely brilliant. :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Gecko brothers (played by George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino) will make you laugh, make you cry, or do just about anything else, as they take Jacob Fuller (Harvey Keitel) and his two kids (Juliette Lewis and Ernest Liu) hostage in the Southwest after a successful bank robbery. For the freedom they so desire, they decide to flee to Mexico in Fuller's RV and when they finally are south of the border, they stop at the first bar they see for a drink; unfortunately, the dark, dank pit is inhabited by blood-sucking vampires. The "Titty Twister" is full of vampire-like bar-employees and truckers who desire the fresh meat that arrives every so often. Extreme, gory violence ensues as the Gecko Brothers and Fullers try to defend themselves and prevent from becoming vampires along with the seemingly only sane and non-vampire at the bar, Sex-Machine (Tom Savini). The violence and music made me laugh, and I enjoyed every minute. Cheech Marin has multiple roles and director Robert Rodriguez makes his signature move (family-member roles) by casting cousin Danny Trejo as one of the bar patrons.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From Dusk Till Dawn (1996)Seth Gecko and his brother Richard are on the run after a bloody bank robbery in Texas. They escape across the border (with some "new company") to Mexico and will be free the next morning, once they've paid off their contact. They just have to survive for a night at the rendezvous point, which turns out to be a bar on the brink of hell, populated with Vampires.When you first look at From Dusk Till Dawn, you already it's a horror film. However, when you actually watch it, it's very different. The first 70 minutes of the movie are horror-less, and develops what seems to be an interesting Tarantino-like crime story. As this theme continues for most of the film, you start to think, "Wait a minute, this would be a great film without the horror." It seems, whilst trying to write a horror-flick, Tarantino actually created another epic crime movie, and added a less-than-average horror plot to it at the end. However, for what's it worth, the movie is none-the-less, great. Clooney and Tarantino play the Gecko brothers. Two thief's and outlaws who are fresh from a bank robbery and on the run from the start. Clooney is Seth, a cool acting, fast talking and quick thinking thief who, along with his brother Richie, a sex offender-psycho-rapist (played by Quentin himself) kidnap a family and force them to carry them across the border to Mexico. Seth tells the father of the family, Jacob Fuller (Harvey Keitel) that he'll let him and his two kids go safely, after they wait peacefully at an organised rendezvous point for Seth's connection, Carlos. However, the club is a hell hole ran by a gang of ruthless Vampires.The plot is, actually, not that bad. The main problem I have with the film is how the Vampires were portrayed. They look more to me like Zombies. Each Vamp looks different, and random monster spurt up now and again which lowers the, well, coolness of the film. Even Quentin himself said they looked like Zombies. Apart from that, the script is awesome. In fact, the film looks like it was directed by Quentin himself. Robert Rodriguez did a good job in living up to his previous film, Desperdo.If you look hard enough, you'll also see many Tarantino trademarks and references to his other films. Sort of like an added bonus, really. Oh, and look out for the dance scene with Salma Hayek...Overall: A great film with a cast of talented and strong actors, an excellent script from Tarantino, and superb direction from Rodriguez. Not a masterpiece, but it could have been close without the zombie-styled-vampires and mindless horror fighting. Still, great. (4/5)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quentin Tarantino writes a horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you read my one-line summary and have seen any of Quentin Tarantino's other movies, then you probably know what to expect from this one. It's violent, depraved, twisted, darkly comic, and it has great dialog. This description applies to just about anything Tarantino is involved in, and "From Dusk Till Dawn" is no different in that respect. Where "From Dusk Till Dawn" differs from other movies written and/or directed by Quentin Tarantino is that it is the only movie that he has done where the second half of the movie is devoted to a bloodbath involving a horde of vampires, a Mexican strip club, and a guy with a gun hidden in his codpiece. If that last sentence didn't inspire you to go out and rent this movie right now, then I feel truly sorry for you.This movie is what every cheesy horror movie often fails to be: it's a lot of fun. The sudden change that the movie undergoes from being a typical Tarantino-style film about two criminal brothers who take a family hostage while they make their way to Mexico to being an all-out, over-the-top gore-fest featuring vampire strippers is very strange and really doesn't make much sense, but if you're anything like me you really won't care as you sit back and enjoy the pure insanity that could only come from the mind of Quentin Tarantino as he writes a horror movie. Of course, part of the reason why this movie works as well as it does is that everything is handled with a tongue-in-cheek sense of humor that keeps the movie from taking itself too seriously. While the violence is incredibly graphic (this is easily the goriest vampire movie I've seen in years), it is slightly lessened by ridiculous sights such as the vampire band leader playing a guitar made from a human corpse, Cheech Marin tastefully telling customers of the vampire strip club about the variety of pu**y available, and the aforementioned codpiece gun.From watching this movie, it's pretty clear that no one involved was looking to make a cinematic masterpiece, but it was clear that everyone was having a blast. It's as violent, over-the-top, and pulpy as movies get, but I guarantee you probably won't see a movie like this for a long time. Just sit back and watch the insanity and have fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Second... greatest... vampire... movie... EVER!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Second greatest cus let's face it you can't beat the original Dracula. You've got Robert Rodriguez, directing a story by Quentin Tarantino, in the style of Sam Raimi, with a plot akin to a George A. Romero zombie movie. How can it go wrong? It can't! Hell this film is a veritable orgasm of all that is great about horror and crime films. And don't take this for a simple vampire flick either, make no mistake this film is hard core with its crime storyline too. The entire first half of the film is exactly something you'd expect from Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez, heavy dialog, gruesome violence, bad guys you love to hate, and bad guys you just love. But once the fangs come out all bets are off. Think of Night of the Living Dead, but in Mexico, with Vampires instead of Zombies, and with much more innovative weapons. Man you think Uma taking on the Crazy 88's was intense, Crazy 88's weren't blood sucking demons that could only be killed by impaling them through the heart with a huge chunk of wood. If you love vampire or zombie films, if you thought Pulp Fiction and Resiviour Dogs were just a ingenious as I did, if you loved Rodriguez's Mariachi series or even if all you know about him is how awesome a job he did with Sin City, you owe it to yourself to seek out this gem of a film. I guarantee you will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very seldom does a film come along, that leads you in one direction and then does a complete three-sixty at break-neck speed. This is the case with "From Dusk Till Dawn". For the first half hour or so we think we're watching a "Tarantino" flick in the usual fashion, bad guys verses even badder guys but we soon find out we're wrong. This trick worked great on my wife who hates horror movies. At the center of our story is the "Gecko Brothers" (George Clooney &amp; Quentin Tarantino) on the run from the law and taking hostages along the way. The "Gecko's" find their way to Mexico to meet with a Mexican Mob connection (Cheech Marin), who is going to bring them to a safe haven for a cut of the loot. The meeting place is a rowdy strip club in the middle of nowhere called "The Tittie Twister". We soon realize it's filled with some really nasty vampires, who enjoy ripping heads off and tearing people to shreds. A great cast of characters, including "Tom Savini" as "Sex Machine" and "Cheech" playing multiple rolls. One liners fly with the blood and guts to great effect, making this a truly enjoyable bloodbath film for any horror fan like myself. Always in the top five of my favorite "Gore Films".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is really two films in one. First it is a crime film with a double act, one of whom is cold and calculating and the other who is sick and deprived but dependent on his partner. Tarintino is all over this film, in particular this part. The sheriff at the beginning is the sheriff in Kill Bill and of course the Tarintino staple dialogue is intoxicating throughout this film. I haven't even mentioned vampires yet!!! That is probably because their presence in the film sneaks up on you like it did to the characters. The two sides to the film is like the two sides of the world that characters experience, one with real life monsters like Seth and Richard Gecko, (Clooney and Tarintino), to the one with monsters from hell, VAMPIRES! My point is that this is the vampire film that doesn't feel like a vampire film. It's like Desperado if it was written by Tarintino and had a few vampires in it. That leads me to my other point. In Robert Rodriguez (director) and Quenten Tarintino (Screenplay Writer) two of the greatest modern film makers combine to make something gritty, a realistic vampire flick. BRILLIANT!!!</fullReview>

Heading to Mexico City to make a deal, with some contacts, they hold as hostage, a former preacher who has lost his faith (HARVEY KEITEL), his daughter (JULIETTE LEWIS) &amp; his adopted son Scott, in their camper van &amp; head en route so a seedy Mexican bar called the Titty Twister, located out in the middle of the desert, a place overrun my bikers &amp; truckers to wait for the contacts to arrive before dawn. However that's "if they make it to dawn", since the owners who run the place, are blood drinking vampires! Soon the family that was abducted by the Gecko brother's &amp; that wanted to escape them, find themselves along with a former Vietnam veteran (FRED WILLIAMSON) &amp; a biker named SEX MACHINE (A fun turn by special effects guru TOM SAVINI) teaming up with the brothers to take down hordes of the bloodthirsty creatures who have quickly slaughtered all of the other patrons. Turning the bar from a bar to a slaughterhouse, with said victims then returning as vampires! Can the remaining humans get out of the bar alive, or will they to become permanent members of the night shift?FROM DUSK TILL DAWN is a very fun movie &amp; a real treat for all action/vampire fans! The film is very suspenseful, it's sexy, has a host of great characters, some you feel for some you don't &amp; some you can't help but remember weather you liked them or not &amp; there's plenty of awesome monster make-up &amp; blood flow &amp; some amazing monster &amp; human kills to satisfy the most demanding of horror movie &amp; action buffs! Quentin Tarantino has crafted a highly entertaining monster epic, that also has a truly excellent story &amp; character &amp; dialogue development to match the films sexy tone &amp; it's special effects showcases. The film opens with a very clever twist, in which a sheriff stops by to talk to a convenience store clerk about the escaped Gecko brothers. The clerk acts natural &amp; laid back, only for the Sheriff to leave to use the washroom &amp; the Gecko brothers to emerge from behind some shelving, to show that the guy was being held up before the cop arrived! The Gecko brothers are displayed as cold &amp; uncaring gangsters in the first half, especially Tarantino's character, the oddball Louie, a former sex offender &amp; murderer who butchers one of their hostages, when Seth is gone to get them lunch (Seth doesn't share his brothers homicidal tendencies). Yet oddly about the midway point, they actually become somewhat sympathetic characters you care for, especially when the action start to spill out &amp; that goes for Harvey Keitel has a failed man of god &amp; his children whom are not only well written &amp; likable, but whom we actually feel for right from the start &amp; especially hate to see gone at the end. While characters like the tough Vietnam veteran &amp; the biker known as Sex Machine are just wild &amp; weird enough that you can't help but get caught up in their quirky characters. The film is certainly well directed by ROBERT RODRIGUEZ, who established some pretty cool shots &amp; lighting work. Clooney really shines as Seth, while Tarantino is merely adequate as Louie. SELMA HAYEK is sexy as the head stripper Esmerelda &amp; does a fantastic show when she first appears to the patrons on stage. Her character is definitely a memorable one &amp; is fun to watch for the brief time she is on camera, (she should have had a bigger role!) The special effects work by K.N.B. is perhaps some of the best done monster make-up to ever grace a film, while the vampire creature designs are very impressive &amp; the stunts are absolutely amazing! I especially liked the set design for the bar, especially for the exterior shot when the group first arrive, it's bright colours contrasted just perfectly against the setting sun in the Mexican desert, is so beautiful it's almost like a painting. To be truthful, the film starts out as an action film in the first twenty minutes, before switching to a hostage thriller in the second half, before finally being turned into a high octane action horror flick in the last forty minutes. Yet the constant switches in genre, oddly never hampers the film at all, since as I said before, the characters are so good &amp; so well played &amp; the dialogue is so smart &amp; at times funny, that you hardly recognize it. Highly recommended to horror &amp; action fans, you don't want to miss FROM DUSK TILL DAWN! Look for JOHN SAXON in a cameo role. Later a TV series. Followed by a direct to video sequel FROM DUSK TILL DAWN 2: Texas Blood Money &amp; a prequel, which was more a remake set in the old west &amp; dealt with the character of Esmerelda, the head stripper seen in this film &amp; how she came to be a vampire, called FROM DUSK TILL DAWN 3: THE HANGMAN'S DAUGHTER **** stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie can be seen in two ways i guess. The first way is to see it and not think, in which case you can just look at it as an entertaining vampire-flick. The other way to look at it is to think a little and realize that this is really two movies in one.The movie starts out quite slow and somber. Two brothers are on the run from the law, having broken out of prison and leaving a trail of dead police officers behind them. They are heading toward the Mexican border at top speed. Their paths cross with a family consisting of a father and his two children. Thinking that it would be easier to cross the border in a motor home with a family the brothers take them hostage.For about half the movie this is not so different from what you would expect from Tarantino. Some quite funny dialog, George Clooney as the foul-mouthed hard-case. And Harvey Keitel as the world-weary preacher being taken hostage. Then the other half of the movie changes style completely. From a rather comfy thriller of sorts it erupts into a splatter-filled vampire-flick. And i guess this is where many people start having trouble with this movie.However, i must confess i really like this movie. In forging these two styles together Robert Rodriguez shows that he has the fingertip-feel needed to balance them out. While there is certainly a lot of gore the comedy never leaves the movie. I found myself sitting with a more or less constant smile on my face throughout. Sometimes, in very rare cases, the sum of the parts are bigger than the whole so to speak. And this is such a case. I rate this 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film 'From Dusk till Dawn' is a fantastic film for the excellent choice of actors, great soundtrack and extreme storyline made this film into a one of a kind. I can understand, however, a person not liking this film, but in order to appreciate this film you have to have the right mindset. By doing so you must realise that you can't take this film seriously and that its just another typical black horror Robert Rodriguez/Quentin Tarentino film. What I love about this film is how extreme the storyline changes on how an ordinary family gets kidnapped by wanted criminals, Seth Gecko(George Clooney) and Richard Gecko (Quentin Tarantino) and is forced by these criminals to smuggle them in their camper-van over the Mexican border and how the story changes from that to blood sucking vampires killing everybody in the Mexican biker nightclub. I quite like this style of directing for the director Stanley Kubrick has a similar directing approach, for many of his films story lines do tend to rapidly change half way through the film in the same way. Another directing trademark that Robert Rodriguez and Stanley Kubrick have in common, that I'm quite entertained by is the micro-second subliminal film shots that was filmed in this movie, in which the same micro-second subliminal filming was also done in Stanley Kubricks film 'A Clockwork Orange' This happened when Seth Gecko(George Clooney) walked into the motel room and viewed the woman hostage lying dead on his bed, in which his brother Richard gecko (Quentin Tarantino) had just raped and killed.The actors Juliette Lewis(Kate Fuller), George Clooney(Seth Gecko), Quentin Tarantino(Richard Gecko and Harvey Keitel(Jacob Fuller) are ideal actors for this film. What intrigues me about Harvey Keitel, George Clooney and Juliette Lewis is not the fact that their good actors, but is how confident their acting is, for in my opinion these actors (and a few other actors) are three of the most confident actors in Hollywood. What I like about Quentin Tarantino is that although he's not a great actor, the role that he does play in this film (and others) he does well at, for his eccentric acting, humour and wacky outlook makes me love watching him in films. Anyway if you haven't seen this film, I suggest you to watch it, for if you like George Clooney and Harvey Keitel you'll definitely like this film.</fullReview>

It starts out as one thing, establishes the opening mood very well, and then half-way through, just as we're really starting to get into it, it completely changes in tone, atmosphere and even genre into something slightly less impressive. I'm left wondering if it was Rodriguez's intention all along to create a flick that, very movie monster-like, is one thing by day and something very different altogether by night. Against a daylight setting, it's a crime thriller/character study wrapped up in a road movie, complete with sparkling dialogue, neat direction and interesting characters ? and, as with any film revolving round a road trip, the real fun is always in the getting there. Maybe that's the problem ? our heroes get to where they're going before we've even reached the midway point. It's here, in the nocturnal-based scenes, that the film undergoes its massive transformation, morphing into a rather raucous and grotesque kind of popcorn horror (though admittedly a tad too gruesome to inspire much of an appetite for popcorn consumption) with blood-sucking vampires, exploding heads and bodily fluid leakage aplenty. In merging the two distinctive halves together, I'm not sure just how successful it really is. It's certainly very different, captures the viewer off-guard as it goes, and the latter half still manages to provide decent, if mindless, entertainment, but it ultimately can't help but prove a mild disappointment in not quite living up to the slickness promised in the initial scenes.The earlier scenes are the ones I personally prefer watching. It's here that the characters, when we're first introduced to them, are at their utmost best ? the composed and easygoing criminal fugitive Seth Gecko, his immature, anti-social younger brother Ritchie, and, from the other side of the tracks, Jacob, a preacher-turned-agnostic widower with two teenage kids, all of whom are forced to accompany Seth and Ritchie on their run from the law when their paths inadvertently cross. The interaction that ensues between all five of these characters is excellent, the acting is fine (Clooney and Kietel both pull off their roles with ease, and, contrary to some critical bandwagons, Tarantino isn't bad at all) while there's a certain sprinkling of depth to them each that you desperately want the movie to work with. It's tempting sometimes, on repeated viewings, just to tune out once the vampire scenes get underway, not so much due to the goriness involved, but because what becomes of these characters from then on is a little unsatisfying. There are a few rewarding moments in between as both the kidnappers and their hostages begin to show signs of bonding and mutual understanding, but the beastly confrontations that soon entail never truly enable them to develop to their full potential ? well, face it, what we have here is a brilliant ensemble of protagonists who could have faired easily as well in a more sophisticated adventure than the one they wound up with.The humor in the sunlight half is also better accomplished, and fits in perfectly with the tension ? healthy servings of macabre quirkiness as Ritchie examines his hand wound during the opening credits sequence (ouch?nasty), and the inspired bickering between the two fugitive siblings as they exit the scene of one of their crimes, none of which detract from the screenplay's tenser moments. The nocturnal half, meanwhile, is obviously too silly to pass itself off as serious horror, and a mite too ugly to be all that amusing (still get a few giggles here and there, but what it mostly triggers, amidst all the guitar-strumming on dismantled human body parts, is unease). Even Tarantino's excellent scripting skills get a little bogged down in the subject matter around here, to the point where his zesty style seems completely absent. It would be wrong, however, to imply that the sequences involving those nefarious blood-suckers are lacking in a distinguishing edge of their own ? Rodriguez does a good job with the atmospherics here in particular, highlighting the claustrophobic, infernal feel of the vampires' lair and giving it an appropriately nightmarish quality. That's probably the thing that works best about it.What 'From Dusk Till Dawn' ultimately amounts to is an energetic and very enjoyable kind of summer movie, memorable and unusual enough to be worthy of the cult following it grabbed soon after. If you can accept it for what it is, then its entertainment value is guaranteed, and, as a loyal Tarantino fan, I've found plenty of things to savour. Still, a part of me will always wonder about the intelligent character drama that might have been had the Gecko brothers chosen to travel down a slightly different junction.Grade: B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two Movies For the Price of One!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "From Dusk Till Dawn", director Robert Rodriguez give us a Hitchcockian twist on the audience. The first hour of the movie is a heist film, as two brothers have robbed a bank and need to reach their contact in Mexico. The movie is suspenseful enough on it's own, as George Cloony and Quentin Tarantino (who also wrote the film) play the bank robbing brothers, Seth and Richard. They take a family hostage, lead by father Jacob (Harvey Keitel) and children Kate (Juliette Lewis) and Scott (Ernest Liu), and use them to sneak into Mexico. That's when the movie changes from a heist thriller to a vampire scare-a-thon. The meeting point is a strip club where vampires run the show. You can almost hear Tarantino snicker in the background, wondering how he was able to get two of his favorite movie genres into one film. Tarantino also indulges in a passion, I'm sure, of his, as he licks whiskey off of Selma Hayek's toes (his reputation of having a foot fetish is well documented). I was really enjoying the heist aspect of the movie, but I suppose there wasn't enough there to fill entire movie, so the decision to go another way was a good one. The out of left field aspect of the vampire story is jarring and will surprise audiences who don't know it's coming (I guess that counts you out, as you've read this far). The blood and gore that does come from the vampire story is well done and does harken us back to the 1970s super-gory movies. Even Fred Williamson is in this movie. How much more B-movie can we get? There are lots of little jokes thrown throughout the movie, my favorite being Tom Savini's attempt to hide the fact changes are happening around him. The movie will entertain those who like both movie genres that are featured in From Dusk Till Dawn, but those who are squeamish about cursing, blood, guts, decapitations, vampires, or Cheech Marin, maybe this is not for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>vampire part</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know why most of the people don't like the second half of the movie if it is the most important part. The picture is about the vamps not of the crime life of the brothers, the first half of the movie is just an introduction to the vampire massacre and it works as a 90? turn to make this movie different of all others I like this movie for that. this is not a Quentin film is a Robert Rodriguez film and we don't have to expect a great plot but an action film with humour parts. Obiously the Tarantino's touch make this movie better but as I say before this movie is an action movie not a crime movie. Besides the acting of Clooney is really good and we have Juliette Lewis and Salma Hayek in the movie what more we can ask?. I know that the first part of the movie is great but is just the intro to the movie only that in this movie the intro was longer and more interesting than in others films. i don't know English very well so sorry if this comment isn't write correctly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've read two pages of reviews and no one has made comment on the very end of this movie. The two surviving characters say their good-byes and then as the camera pulls back to reveal heaps of older model vehicles (maybe pushed behind the titie-twister over the years by the vampires?)and the back of the titie bar which is actually an old Mayan ruin. What meaning does this now give to the movie? The characters in the movie state that they don't believe in vampires but they believe what they just saw. I wonder is this a battle between two evils? If so how do we explain the preacher and his family.Did anyone take notice to this glimpse and if so does it change your perception of the movie. I was entertained with this movie until I spotted this at the very end and spent a lot of time thinking about this glimpse given to us. Does anyone know if there is book attached to this movie?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun and provocative movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is not for people looking for a serious film, but fun, provocative. Salma Hayek was very beautiful with her snake dance. The funny thing is that she hates snakes. I wonder how they got her to dance with that huge yellow snake. This movie was done pre-Fools Rush In, and I only recently began watching her films before Fools Rush In. She was great in Desperado and in this film as well, although, her part was fairly minuscule. I hope she continues to do well. Its amazing that she is nearly 40 and her body and looks have maintained a 25 year oldish look. If you have seen After The Sunset, you'll know what I mean. I'd recommend this movie to those who don't get offended early and just want to watch Salma with her snake dance. All in all, this movie is more than OK but not great. I give it a 6.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cool movie, great cast!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie , I had no idea what it was about. I was pleasantly surprised to find out it was a gory, vampire, splatter-fest. The movie starts out like its just going to be a couple of bad-asses running from the cops, tearing it up along the way. Then, after the best part of the movie (the snake dance), the movie takes a strange turn and turns into something totally not what you expected. This movie is heavily influenced by both Tarantino and Rodriguez and the movie is a direct reflection of their styles, which I believe are very similar. I really cant think of any characters that I didn't like. Everyone was cool , the makeup was decent, and the pace of the movie keeps you interested at all times. This is a really cool movie, and I'm really glad I bought this years ago. I wish they would release a better DVD with more features and 5.1 . Whenever they do, I'm picking it up that day because this movie still carries a good replay value.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!When you take two of the most witty and talented directors of the decade and let them play with vampires, gangsters and cowboys, the outcome is always going to be interesting at the very least. FDTD manges to be more though, delivering more of what made each director popular in the first place- great dialogue and originality. A movie with a dedicated group of hardcore fans, though i'm sure the same can be said for any movie, it blends genres seamlessly, almost like Audition, fooling the viewer into expecting another run of the mill gangster film. The film features many good ideas, not all of which come off, and is so far the closest Tarantino has come to making his version of Rio Bravo. Great ideas, good script, good acting and direction, and some nice effects, again questioning the necessity for over-abundant CGI. It perhaps could have been a little longer, especially the Titty Twister section, with further development between the surviving characters, but maybe that would have changed the style and tone of the movie. For blood and banter, movies don't come much better than this. 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was watching this movie at a friend's place while I was editing a sound file that our band had recorded earlier that day, and so I didn't catch the title of the movie or the theme. I began to pay attention about 5 minutes in, and it seemed to be a pretty good murder-bank robbing kind of movie. However when the two brothers ventured down to a Mexican strip bar with a family of hostages, everybody turned into a vampire all of a sudden. It came as a shock to me when the dancer first transformed into a blood-thirsty vampire, seeing as I'd expected it to be a serious, more realistic movie. However it turned out to be a pretty good movie, and they managed to squeeze endless profanity and gore into almost every 10 seconds of the movie. The movie ended abruptly, and when the credits came on it seemed that the movie had only been going half an hour. Overall it's a good movie, could have been better though. 6.5/10</fullReview>

Just to cap things off, the anthemic "After Dark" by Tito and Tarantula is spine-tingling rock perfection.The only problem is that the scene is so good that its actually worn that part of the film out on my video.

		<shortDescription>Solid Entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Rating: *** out of ****. Not every film that has Quentin Tarantino's name on it is a masterpiece but each film he's been somehow involved in is at least of good quality(I'm not counting Natural Born Killers since he disowned the film). From Dusk Till Dawn is not an exception. For this film, Tarantino wrote the script but instead his good friend, Robert Rodriguez is in the directors chair. While this collaboration is not without weaknesses, these two talented filmmakers turn out solid entertainment. From Dusk Till Dawn is actually not a story of Tarantino's. On the set of Reservoir Dogs, the make up artist for the film, Robert Kurtzman, told Tarantino that he would work for free if he turned a story(about vampires) he wrote into a film. So four years after Reservoir Dogs, From Dusk Till Dawn arrived in theaters. Even though this is not Tarantino's story he puts his stamp on it (even if that means having a sizeable role in the film). The first half of the film is more dialogue than action. The dialogue that Tarantino penned for this film is not quite up to what he wrote for Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown but there's still some snap to it. The second half although more concentrated on action, still has some good lines ("Psychos do not explode when sun hits them. I don't care how crazy they are.").The second half of the film is when director Robert Rodriguez gets to shine. Rodriguez has always had a talent for shooting action and that shows here. The over the top action is shot with flair and flawlessly edited (Rodriguez also handled the editing). Rodriguez never allows a dull moment in the entire movie. If theres a major flaw in the film its that I found the film too gross. I know it is supposed to be that gross by intention but it was just a little too much for me. There's nothing wrong with the make-up work though, which is excellent. This is not an actors film, but the performances work here. George Clooney is excellent here. He's given the best lines from Tarantino's script and deliver's them flawlessly. Tarantino himself is acceptable in his role. Effective work is provided by the rest of the cast.From Dusk Till Dawn will probably not appeal to everybody. If you dislike gory films than you should probably avoid From Dusk Till Dawn. I enjoyed it as a bloody, stylish and not too serious piece of entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a fun, great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>-may be a spoiler- From Dusk Till Dawn is a movie that audiences are afraid to call great. But it is. It is perfect for what it is, which is a bloody, exaggerated mess of gore and good style. Robert Rodriguez could join a list that includes such directors as Michael Mann or Guy Ritchie. Directors that have revolutionized what is cool or what the audience wants out of its antagonist. Because these directors are so good at what they do, they make good films. From Dusk Till Dawn is a great film. It can be watched repeatedly, and each time the viewer will want to be more and more like George Clooney. When watching this movie, do not be afraid to say that it's wonderful. I am sure there are a lot of movie-goers that will only call epic films such as Apocalypse Now or Citizen Kane great films, and are afraid to include From Dusk Till Dawn on that list because they feel like the overall structure and design of the film evokes something different than those epics, or that the film itself is underdeveloped. But the fact is, these people are missing the point. There is one theme in this movie just like there is in, say, Born on the Fourth of July. It wanders into a certain territory that Born on the Fourth of July does not, and vice versa. And, the result is, a film just as good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There is nuthin like this! (Possible Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Dusk till Dawn - one part tense road movie thriller, one part b grade spatter feast - is truly an original film. It tells the story of a couple of brothers who are on the run from the law. They head for the Mexican border to rendezvous with some gangsters at a sleazy strip bar. Along the way - they pick up a family and hold them hostage. This movie is just brilliant fun. The first half - is a tense thriller (very much Tarantino) - it explores the tense and often uneasy relationships between the two brothers and their hostages. Once they hit the bar (towards the middle of the film) - Rodriguez (the Director) and Tarantino release the pressure - by letting the group and the viewer take down their guard - in a alcohol and sex fuelled fiesta - Mexican style. Of course - the film takes a giant twist into a all out blood fest with vampires..... what did you expect!?! This movie is just tops - with great, stylish directing and writing from the Rodriguez / Tarantino team - and great performances by the hard, sexy and super cool George Clooney and Harvey Keitel (as the preacher who gave up god). There are great side characters including the doorman Cheech Martin and the awesome Sex Machine (I only wish Sex Machine was in the film for longer!). The blood fest with the vampires is totally over the top - it would have been better if they had added some of the deleted scenes (as shown on the special edition DVD/laser disc) - they have to be seen to be believed. There is nuthin like this!.... so watch it now!</fullReview>

Razor sharp dialogue, by the master himself, Quentin Tarantino. Delivered tongue-in-cheek by George Clooney and the cast. The gas station scene while they're shooting each other at the same time is very funny. It's funny, ironic, stupid, scary, super gory and watchable. Just don't let your kid's watch it. It's night- mare material. Robert Rodriguez directed and edited this masterful vampire, horror movie. The tity twisters add tremendously to the track, especially with Dave Alvin's "Dark Night" and the track to Selma Hayak's table dance. Delicious.</fullReview>

It is a bit bloody though and some of the scenes left me half viewing them from between my fingers it was so gory. George Clooney was very good and was funny at times. And the special effects where okay. I got really confused when they suddenly started to fight vampires but I thought it was a nice twist.

		<shortDescription>Insane, Gory Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a wild, crazed, demented, sick, loud, gore-splattered, profanity-laden, explosion-heavy, hot and sexy vampire film. It's also a lot of fun if you can stomach all the previously mentioned elements.Seth and Richard Gecko (played by George Clooney and the amazing Quentin Tarantino) are fugitives on their way to Mexico amid a storm of bullets and fire. After hijacking a motor home and the nice family it belongs to (jaded ex-minister Harvey Keitel, daughter Juliette Lewis and son Ernest Liu) the strange group is heading for a notorious Mexican strip joint called The Titty Twister. Unfortunately, the group has no way of knowing that the bar is staffed by some really nasty vampires.Some of my favorite people are in this odd little flick: the aforementioned Tarantino (who has never done anything that I don't like), the amazing Keitel (totally cast against type here and doing an amazing job as always), the smolderingly beautiful Salma Hayek, playing the sinuously sexy dancing vampire Satanica Pandemonium, and Cheech Marin, who actually has three roles in this movie but who stands out as the doorman of the Titty Twister, enthusiastically announcing all the varieties of, um, women and their sexual organs to be found within. It's absolutely hysterical...but only if you're not easily offended by the common nickname for house cats being used to describe the female genitalia. Quentin Tarantino also does an outstanding job in his role as the delusional Richard, who imagines he hears crude come-ons from any and every woman he spends too much time around. Keep an eye out for early evidence of his now notorious foot fetish in the scene he shares with Salma, her white snake (nice Bram Stoker touch, by the way) and her bare feet. The violence is explosive and virtually non stop by the third act. The make-up effects by Tom Savini (who also has a role as a biker named Sex Machine) are pretty damn cool, but as with every film that Tarantino has touched, the real action lies within the words spoken by the actors. The script is fast and clever and as incredibly funny as it is offensively sick. This is half vampire film, half Spaghetti western with a little Reservoir Dogs thrown in for good measure. And it's really damn fun too. Fans of Tarantino should enjoy this, and vampire fans tired of the same old formulaic films might just enjoy this odd side road into new territory. The easily offended should stay far away. The rest of us without an ounce of PC will be laughing our tasteless butts off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, I know a lot of people don't like this movie because it involves vampires, but I'm going to have to disagree. This movie was sheer genius. Tarantino and Rodriguez piece it together perfectly. In the first half of the movie they don't want to just throw the horror at you they want you to be introduced to all of the characters to have a slight background of them so that you feel for them when they die instead of: Oh here's this hot chick gettin naked, OH SHE JUST GOT STABBED IN THE EYE SOCKET.OK WHO'S NEXT. Tarantino and Rodriguez did not want that to happen so they felt they needed the first half of the movie to contain no horror at all.Now for my view on the horror aspect of the movie. In my opinion the horror part of the movie was awesome. When you see Selma Hayek do her dance (by the way she is a snake charmer wink wink) and then look at Richie's bleeding hand. You know that the horror is about to hit. Now I thought the fighting off the zombies scenes were awesome. When you see Seth, Jake, Sex Machine, and Frost standing there getting their weapons equipped as the vampire strippers prepared to chow down, didn't that scene give you chills because it was so cool?Well, in my closing I must say that this is one of my all time favorite movies. I just think that it appeals to different types of people. Thanks for reading.-T.J.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two very different movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just finished watching 'From Dusk Til Dawn' again, and it seems like two very different movies. Before the vampires arrive, the movie appears to be a somewhat dark 'road movie' where the criminals are the antiheroes of the film. Anything which could have been interesting for character interaction is done there, but it gets thrown out the window for the second half of the film -- once the vampires show up. The acting, filming, and story for the first half of the film is excellent, but the second half throws it away. A shame, really.George Clooney is a skilled actor, and his 'bad ass' character is played well. Even if he is a complete jerk in the film, he's a professional, and operates with skill and panache. He prides himself on what he does, and it shows throughout the entire film. That, in and of itself, makes him a good character to watch even if his actions and goals are not ones you can approve of.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found that this movie almost offered too much to be true when I first read about it. Tarantino alone would make me watch this movie, not considering the draw power that Harvey Keitel and Juliette Lewis have over me in terms of other great films they have both been in. I was unsure of how George Clooney would act in a role written by Tarantino, but to my surprise he handled it very well. I felt that Clooney and Keitel pulled together the entire film as it was dangering close to falling apart.I enjoyed Tarantino's screen play and his acting as well as they both offered a unique style of quirky humour that only Tarantino can deliver. The movie did alter extremely suddenly at one point, which I knew was approaching but I was disappointed as I had begun to like the charismatic start to the film and the dialogue of the characters.I'd say that this film is entertaining, its definately worthy of a few watches but I'm yet to be convinced on both Vampire movies and movies directed by Robert Rodriguez. Very good, but not great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a "fun" gore-festival</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love to brag about being a "film connoisseur". I'm of that breed that basically believes unless a film is depressing, realistic, witty, and thought-provoking, it's useless (unless it's art-house or foreign then that's ok). Well, okay I'm not that simplistic and stereo-typical, but I do have high standards. Occasionally though, I do enjoy a basically pointless thrill ride, and this is one such film.Tarantino writes, and it shows very much in certain parts. Clooney gets some great one-liners. Harvey Keitel is perfect as the level-headed preacher and adds a very odd aura to the film. The movie is basically split in two - a very weird crime drama (like Tarantino writes any other sort), then an all-out vampire gore fest. Both parts are completely enjoyable, though it might require a slightly sick/macabre taste to call this "enjoyable". I'm not usually into all out gore violence, but like Natural Born Killers and Kill Bill, this movie has a way of making you like and want that extreme brand of campy violence. The vampire scenes are really great, and I thought the makeup was absolutely fine (noticed some people complained). This is one freaky film, but it somehow never crosses that line into the grotesque as most horrors do. It's full of blood, decapitations, and unnatural behavior to say the least, but it's not presented as serious, instead it is very absurd, knows it, and flaunts it (unlike most camp which is unintentionally campy). This is not the usual horror fanfare; it's a whole category all to itself and it's "fun".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From Dusk Till Dawn (1996/Robert Rodriguez) {written by Quentin Tarantino} *** out of ****The opening is pure Tarantino. A Texas Ranger pulls into a gas station and makes everyday chit-chat with the cashier. And then, before you know it, people are getting shot, the gas station is exploding, and the opening credits start. Even though the opening is excellent, the second half of the movie is not as good as the first half. "From Dusk Till Dawn" is written by Quentin Tarantino and directed by his good friend Robert Rodriguez. Both of their famous trademarks are made in the movie. The story is of two criminal brothers (George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino) who drive across Texas taking hostages (Harvey Keitel and Juliette Lewis) and hope to make it across the border to a rendezvous at a bar. But what they find is a bar where the customers come straight from Hell. Like I said early, the first half of the movie is excellent. It begins as the coolest movie I have ever seen. What more could you ask for? You've got George Clooney, one of the coolest actors today, in a film done by two of the coolest guys in Hollywood (and one of them is even in the movie!). And Salma Hayek is the sexiest woman on the planet! After seeing her dance, I completely forgot why they were even at the bar. But then....it happened: The Vampires. The second half of the film takes a turn for the worse when it goes wacko and all the customers in the bar turn to Vampires, and the brothers and the hostages are forced to work together to fight against them.This is truely a great film, not in the fashion of Citizen Kane, but just for the entertainment and coolness factor. This is one of the rare movies that you never want to end. If it wasn't for the poor second half, I would give it a higher rating, but in the end, the film defines cool.-30-</fullReview>

I knew very little about the film as I was unprepared for what this movie was about to bestow upon me. I was interested in the film because I am a huge fan of Tarantino. All I can say is that I had the most amazing movie going experience of my entire life!!! I loved both the first half of the movie which was very Tarantino-like (great story, dialogue, and direction). But the second half of the film was a lightning-fast paced ass-whooping time. The Vampire twist threw me for a huge loop....and I LOVED IT! Everything about this film is awesome. Great cast, dialouge, humor, action, gore, violence, and pace. Go see From Dusk Till Dawn!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must be getting corrupted in my old age. Everything about this movie offended me - the language, the rotten characters (the characters, not the actors), the excessive violence and nauseating gore. It was also trashy with no redeeming social virtues. I don't know why, but I really enjoyed it. It was funny and scary (very scary) and it kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time I was watching it. I think it must be somewhere in the Robert Rodriguez touch. I have trouble with Tarantino (I really didn't like Pulp Fiction, even it is one of the beat movies ever made.) Just make sure you don't let any kids or really sensitive people watch it - they'll have nightmares for 6 months. But if you've got a strong stomach - enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you like a movie with a split personality, you'll love this one! The first half of this strange tale is a straight gangster saga -- two brothers on the lam kidnap a family and use them and their motor home to get across the border. Once safely across into Mexico the group goes to a bar called The Tittie Twister to rendezvous with a protective Mexican gang. But unknown to all, the bar (only open from dusk till dawn) is a hangout for a bunch of vampires who view the interlopers as food for dinner. A fight for life breaks out, and the brothers and their hostages must team up to stay alive, so the second half of the movie is one long maelstrom of violence and carnage. This movie spawned not only a sequel but a prequel as well!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cult status?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I mean, why not? All the conventional elements of a "cult" film are squarely in place. It's campy and goofy, after all, and chock full of "guilty pleasure" value. Plus, it was nothing more than a nominal hit, its domestic gross barely outstripping its budget.But "From Dusk Till Dawn" is, in my estimation, more deserving of earnest appreciation. It's not simply a cheeky mess that takes on an ethereal kind of following. No, I contend it's pretty sharp filmmaking in all facets.The dialogue is incisive and memorable. Clooney gives a tour de force performance. The supporting players -- Cheech Marin and Juliette Lewis, specifically -- hit the mark. And from start to finish, you get ample doses of the talents that Quentin Tarantino expounded upon and the ones that Robert Rodriguez apparently forgot.This isn't conventional horror schlock. It's bloody and dryly comedic at times, for certain, but "From Dusk Till Dawn" brings so much more to the table than what the genre usually provides. The hybridization of two very distinct directorial styles, and the woeful marketing of the flick, left a lot of the viewers feeling disappointed; however, there's an element of unfettered genius in this film that was lamentably ignored upon its release.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cool vampire action.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is more action than horror, and almost plays like two movies. The first half of the film has George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino as a couple of homicidal brothers on the run from police trying to get to Mexico. Along the way the kidnap Kietal and his family. The second half has them in a bar, where after awhile all heck breaks loose as it turns out this bar lures drivers in to kill them as the employees are all vampires. Great action in this movie, though not much on horror. This movies best scene is when the vampires first attack and then the ending scene where they have to fight the vampires off. Often bloody and violent this movie does not disappoint. Though it does take a little while to get to the cool vampire scenes. I think they could have shaved a little time off, but all in all it was still a good movie. And check out Salma Hayek's brief but effective appearance.</fullReview>

However, I see that the tagline for the movie is Vampires, No Interviews. Still, the film starts of conventionally enough, with Clooney and Tarantino in one of his few decent acting roles as brothers on the run from the law. They kidnap Harvey Keital and family, before driving to this Mexican Bar. You start to wonder where this is going, and then all of a sudden - Vampires Appear!! Why!! I mean this is crazy! Where did that come from, it is as if they got together and said, OK, I've got a fairly decent Tarantinoesque crime thriller, lots of violence, Clooney would be great for the role of the sane brother, but I don't have an Act II. Then someone says - I know - lets have Vampires appear led by a sexy sadistic Salma Hayek, and the kidnappers and kidnapped will set aside their differences to fight their undead enemies, and I know, have Juliette Lewis fall in love with George Clooney at the end. I would sincerely love to come into this film completely ignorant again just to watch the moment when they all turn into Vampires, but then again I would also like to go back in time and never go to see Star Wars Episode Franchise I, but we can't have everything can we?!</fullReview>

Harvey Keitel is also great as the former Minister who along with his family is forced to take Clooney and Tarantino to Mexico because they have just robbed a bank and killed a whole bunch of people . Cheech Marin is also hillarious in no less than three separate roles in this movie .The movie also features cool music and great Special effects by KNB FX group. Highly recommended !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From Dusk Till Dawn has both Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez behind it, it can't possibly fail. The first half of the movie is an excellent taught thriller which is both clever and observant. The characters are perfectly well developed in the short space of time and the script is imposing and pretty much defines what black comedy is. The second half is a brilliant piece of light hearted gore fest fun. The violence is ludicrously over the top and the set pieces are incredibly entertaining. Everyone involved seems to be having fun and thankfully they all realise that it would be impossible to take it seriously. If you can switch off all sense of reason and your credibility detector then this is a hugely entertaining, fast paced, exciting, silly romp which is guaranteed to bring a smile to the face. Top quality entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well? What can be said about this film? I was one of the lucky few who went to see it at the pictures. I didn't really know what it was about, although i had heard that there was a hostage involved. What happened next had me on the end of my seat. What started off as a fairly straightforward crime thriller soon turned into a horror film about vampires. I couldn't believe it. I had never seen anything like it before.  Impressed, i bought the video when it came out. Sadly, i noticed some flaws. I realised that the special effects are actually pretty poor, which was something that had escaped my attention at the cinema simply because of the giddy thrill of it all. Also, the script is not the hottest thing in town. However, despite all this i still enjoyed it; all the performances are excellent, although Tarantino is a bit TOO good as George Clooney's psychotic sex offender brother. Think about the films he makes and look into his eyes. See what i mean? This is not the greatest horror film ever (nor is it the goriest), nor is it Tarantino's best film. It's simply an enjoyable, action packed horror comedy that makes for perfect saturday night entertainment. Although the bit where the vampires kill the kid is a bit harsh!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With some credible and well thought out action scenes mixed with some gory vampire cliché, Director Robert Rodriguez gives us one of his best productions yet, in which George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino pair up to play the ruthless Gecko brothers, criminals and gun slingers of the west. When they take a family hostage, in hope of crossing the border into Mexico without getting caught by the cops, they do so very successfully. Soon enough though, things go wrong when they discover a late night bar, overtaken by bloodthirsty vampires. The plotline may not strike you as anything special, but once you've seen this, you'll find it to be a fun and exiting escapade between normality and complete insanity!</fullReview>

I've viewed it twice since then, and still liked it very much. This was probably for the performances by Tarantino, Clooney, and most of all Keitel. George Clooney proved himself a credible actor in this movie, I think. Although I agree with what has been said previously about his character being quite disturbed; I still found myself liking the guy. While that may say something about me, I'm sure that I'm not alone here.

		<fullReview>This movie is a great example of Quentin Tarantino's dark humor. Starts off with two brothers running from the police, FBI, and other law forces. When Richard Gecko, the younger and crazy brother played magnificently by Tarantino himself, kills the state trooper and their hostage for no apparent reason, they must find a new way to get across the border to Mexico. They take the Fullers hostage (Keitel, Lewis, Liu) and successfully get across the border. Their accomplice, played by Cheech, has them wait for him at an isolated bar and then, the trouble starts. A bar full of vampires, what do you do? Fight your way out in some of the goriest and best slaughter scenes I have seen, all along making hilarious wise-cracks. All around a great movie and a must see if you like Tarantino's work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very unpredicable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me first tell you how I watched this movie, but it will probably be too late for you to get the same out of this movie that I got.I was up late one weekend night and I just turned on my cable movie channel and started to watch this movie I had no idea what it was called or what it was about.I started watching it and was getting very into it. It starts off as 2 bad guys hi-jacking a camper driven by a father and his two kids. I was curious as to where it was going and how the family of three handled the situation.Well they get lead to this "bar" out in the middle of no where than all of a sudden this movie turns into another movie. My eyes nearly popped out of my head.Great casting, great directing, great acting, great action suspense. I loved this movie. It was so unpredicable that I had no idea where this movie was headed or what would happen to each character.I have since recommended this movie to other. I have told them if they had never heard of it to rent the movie and do not read what it is about. Just watch it. And it never falls, they get half way thru the movie and my phone rings. Great movie. I will remember this movie experience for the rest of my life. One of my all-time favs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Opinion is divided on this film amongst Tarantino fans (even though he didn't actually direct it). Most say 'Starts off well, but then gets crap'. Admittedly, the switch from crime movie to horror movie is far from seamless, but I have to say, I loved every minute of this. The horror is strictly of the gross-out carnage variety, and some may say it's too violent, but for me, the violence is a spoof, whether it was intended that way or not. It is a way of sticking two fingers up to the detractors of today's violent movies, much in the same way as Natural Born Killers (a film which I hated). I don't know how much of a role Tarantino played in the conception of the gore, but I personally see the second half of the film as satire, plain and simple. I mean, check out that tongue in cheek reference to John Carpenter on Scott's T-Shirt- in other words, 'think of the violence of the films of the 70s and 80s, and yet you say that 90s celluloid is too violent?!'Satire aside, I feel that the film does stand on its on two feet. The characters are entertaining and well drawn, right down to minor players such as the Sheriff and liquor store clerk in the opening five minutes, and all the performances are spot on. Comic relief is provided to a great extent by Cheech Marin(playing three parts), Tom 'sex machine' Savini, who I also believe is a makeup man (though apparently not for this film), and the fraternal bickering between Clooney and Tarantino, who are gold in the lead roles. The Fullers are also great, successfully portraying both a family unit and individual characters. Robert Rodriguez's direction is spot on, as in the popcorn actioner Desperado, and there's also a welcome appearance by Rodriguez regular Danny Trejo. The script is loaded (a befitting use of language if there ever was one) with great lines,most of them from other films, and the soundtrack is also excellent.Watch this now!- whether you love it or hate it, it's sure to leave a lasting impression on you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On the MTV Movie Awards, George Clooney won for Breakthrough Performance. Not only do I stand by this win, but because of From Dusk Till Dawn, Clooney has become my favorite actor. It's true that in the middle, it is a bit slow, but the beginning scene (one of the best opening movie sequences I have seen on a movie) and the entire T*tty Twister scene (the main focus of the movie) are action packed. Even when there is no action, with the help of the four actors (Clooney, Tarantino, Keitel, and Lewis), the film is still interesting. Note: This movie has extreme pervasive language and EXTREME gore (because it is a vampire movie). You also cannot take the story seriously. If you get passed the language, gore, and basic story, you should have a fun time with this movie. Honestly, it is one of my favorite movies!!!!!!!</fullReview>

Nothing remarkable like acting, directing, scenario, but I watched it about twice and would definitely watch it again. I can say for sure that this is not that kinda movie that underestimates you, it simply doesn't promise anything at all, and so it won't be responsible for eventual "disappointments".

		<shortDescription>Despite it's bad points, a great horror film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you don't know the story behind it getting made - basically, Robert Kurtzman wrote the story, he wanted it turned into a screenplay. He did makeup effects on Pulp Fiction for free in exchange for Tarantino writing the screenplay.There's basically two problems with the film. One, is that Rodriguez isn't all that good at the horror genre. The other is that the story has a few sour points - especially the ending, which feels artificial to me.The first hour is great, because Rodriguez is good at that sort of story - gangsters on the run. It's so good, it makes the second half - the vampire story - a little too jarring. I love the concept of getting an extensive background on the characters involved in a horror film, instead of simply thrusting a bunch of people into a situation before we even get to know them. What sours it is how the vampire story is handled. It's very conventional. We get some additional characters to contend with in the second half, and while they're playing stereotypes on purpose, they seem too cartoonish even in the midst of gooey vampires. I will grant that Rodriguez has some fun with the stereotypes, though, such as Fred Williamson's speech.That's the main problem with Rodriguez's vision. I don't like the vampires in the film. They're gooey and gross and ugly. Now, I'm not into the vampire mania of recent years, but I just found the vampires too uninteresting. They've lost what makes them unique as villains, and could be nothing than a bunch of raptors. The film also delivers just a touch too much gore - I like gore, but it has to be in proportion to the mood of the film, and this was a little heavy - not surprising considering the story came from a great splatter effects artist looking to show off his craft. Still, it detracts, especially after how nicely the scene where Clooney discovers what's happened to the hostage while he was picking up food is handled.While this seems like I'm on the negative side of the film, I'm not - I love it. The dialogue, Tarantino's domain, is sharp, funny and interesting, just like his previous films. It's delivered very, very well by Clooney and the rest of the cast - moments such as his "Pyschos do not blow up when sunlight touches them!" speech, Juliette Lewis's casual "Thanks" after Clooney knocks out his brother, his dialogue with the hostage at the beginning of the film, and his and Keitel's dialogue on the way to Mexico. Great stuff, and it makes the film more than worth watching if you're a fan of the horror genre.I also have to say that Salma Hayek's dance is possibly the most erotic thing ever put into a wide-release film. It's worth the price of admission alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read one EXTREMELY wordy review of FD2D here already. So I don't think another scene-by-scene run-down is necessary. I wasn't surprised to see similar comments to the one my friend made as we left the theater; complaining that the movie changed right in the middle. Although I admit that it would have been nice to see the first story, about the fugitives escaping into Mexico, end in the standard way, the abrupt turnaround was a welcome surprise. If you read most of the reviews on this movie, chances are they will mention the turnaround. So now you know. It completely changes gears on you. Got it? Now, if I can ask a silly question, what's so bad about being surprised? Was it REALLY a serious loss to have the movie take the turn that it did? If they had kept on going with the standard Tarantino/Rodriguez storyline, yeah, it would have been okay. But not too memorable. Mostly predictable. Same for the vampire angle. Seen that plenty o' times. What else ya got? Splicing two completely different plots together like this is, to put it mildly, rare. That's why it deserves a second look, at least. Granted, it would have been disastrous if this had become Hollywood's next big gimmick, a la "reality tv," but it didn't, and I don't believe that's because the movie simply didn't work. I believe it's because it's a chance most filmmakers aren't willing to take. Put the images up on the screen that people will be familiar with, lay out the snappy one-liners, make with the funny and the action and the obligatory romance. Give the consumers what they want. Hey--Screw the consumers! Have some fun with the project! That's what these guys did. This movie is tense and fun. It's different. The fact that so many people didn't like it is what makes me smile the most. It reminds me why different is usually good. It's also cool to see George Clooney as a bad motor-scooter. It suits him. And every guy I know who has seen this movie wants to get a tattoo like George had, but none of us has got the cojones to do it....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie without having heard anything about it beforehand. The movie starts out as quite a promising action-movie, which lasts for about half of the movie. After that the group of the main characters arrive in Mexico at the Titty Twister Bar (open from dusk till dawn). After a couple of scenes in that scenario the movie takes a quite unexpected and ridiculous turn becoming a vampire-splatter kind of movie. After a short while you hope the movie will get back on track soon, but unfortunately it never happens. Despite the promising first part, this movie is a total waste of time. It seems a little like after writing the first part of the movie the writers puffed some serious weed and started hallucinating.I'll give 2 stars to this movie for wasting my time.</fullReview>

It also brought the 70's 'Blaxploitation' actor, Fred Williamson, back into the Hollywood scene in the 90's. Because Tarantino went on to direct 'Jackie Brown', you can be forgiven for thinking that Tarantino is a fan of the 70's 'Blaxploitation' films and actors, and enlisted the talents of Fred Williamson and Pam Grier.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>TWO WORDS: AWE-SOME!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"From Dusk Till Dawn" is one of those films that never tires out, no matter how many times I've seen it (which is well over 100). With Quentin Tarantino's brilliant writing and Robert Rodriguez's flashy direction, how can we go wrong? Though Tarantino didn't take the director's seat, it has that priceless Tarantino feel. And rarely do I watch a film where the uniqueness of the screenwriter shines through, even though it wasn't directed by him. Thanks to Tarantino's magic dialogue, we're blessed with some of the most quoteable lines in movie history: "If you make a noise, Mr. .44 makes a noise; if you ask a question, Mr. .44 answers it." "I said 'plant yourself.' Plants don't talk." "Don't you ever try and f**kin' run on us...because I have six friends, and they can all run faster than you can." I practically have every line from the movie stored in my head and I love watching the film on repeat viewings and screaming out the lines with the actors. Rodriguez created some spectacular action sequences. That opening scene in the liquor store is breathtaking. The flashy special effects and lavishly original slam-bang action in the strip club is also breathtaking. This movie makes you wanna cheer!One of the key elements that adds to this film's engaging quality is the character development. How often do you watch an action film where two characters are about to get killed, yet there's a character development sequence preceding their death? That's how the movie opens. The tone is set with a conversation between an overworked Texas ranger (Michael Parks) and a puny liquor store clerk. All the other characters are well-developed as well. Yet the development of these characters never seem to ruin the pace. In fact, it brings you into the film even more. The rugged soundtrack helps accentuate the rugged Southern feel. The performances are great. George Clooney is a very convincing villain, and was perfectly cast. Quentin Tarantino is good as his paranoid, whiny, perverse, psychotic brother--though I don't know if that's much of a stretch for him. The great Harvey Keitel gives a brilliant, subtle, underrated performance as a faithless former minister, who now has to regain his faith when faced with these demons (vampires) from hell. I think it's one of his best performances, and definitely a lot different from his usual roles. Cheech Marin is amusing in three (that's right! three!) performances: a border patrol guard, a greasy bouncer and a Mexican dealer. Eddie Murphy, look out! Juliette Lewis, though she's significantly older than the character she's playing, plays a nice supporting role. Another score for the tremendously talented actress! You go, girl! Newcomer Ernest Liu gives a fine debut performance as Keitel's adopted Japanese son. Salma Hayek is sexy as ever in the role that put her on the map. Personally, I felt the film worked out better as a crime drama than a horror movie. I enjoyed the second half, but I enjoyed the first half a lot better. The horror portion is very well-done, and not the least bit cheesy, but the film seems to go a little off-balance in its transition. Nevertheless, it's still a blast! And Rodriguez is very original in reprising one of the most-known sub-genres of horror: the vampire movie. He does a great job at combining dark comedy with the gratuitous violence and gore. For example, when Cheech turns (into a vampire) he approaches the terrified Juliette Lewis and says, "You know what people say about me: I suck!" The montage sequence where the remaining heroes prepare weapons to defeat the ghouls in the bloody climax is very nifty. Let's just say this is the first vampire movie I've seen where a character is armed with condoms filled with holy water. "From Dusk Till Dawn" is a macho guy flick with style and substance. One to cherish and enjoy over and over again. I love this movie!!!My score: 8 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film, if nothing else, deserves high marks if only for its complete tounge-in-cheek attitude to the whole Vampire scenario. The start of the film is fairly cool, with a good introduction to the two characters who will play a big part in our adventure, but then it kind of dies down until they reach the...ahem...nightclub.Then the action really gets going and the humour gets more and more dark. "Sex-Machine"'s machine gun is an absolute show stealer and the attitude of the Preacher's young daughter, expertly played by Julliet Lewis, steals the show from Clooney. Clooney's whole attitude is just superb and I had heard reports of bad acting in the film, but I find that hard to believe. Tarantino gives a wonderful, if slightly disturbing, performance as Clooney's perverted brother and Harvey Keitel is good as the preacher.I just couldn't finish here without a word for first the special effects, which seem totally different to all other Vampire movies, and Salma Hayek, who's role is far to brief, unlike her costume!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CONTAINS SPOILERSWhen I get round to writing a history of Hollywood I will state that the most over rated film maker of the 1990`s was Tarantino. He got lucky with RESERVOIR DOGS and the critics have loved him ever since. What the critics don`t seem to notice is his failings as a screenwriter and FDTD best shows up these failingsFirst up are the two main anti heroes. Are we supposed to empathise with them ? How ? They`re a couple of cold blooded killers on the run who blow away a few people in a grocery store at the start of the film . And Tarantino rapes, murder and mutilates a hostage a few scenes later. Sorry but I`m not too keen on serial killers and sex offendersThe dialogue sucks too . I suppose we could all nominate our own worst line from the film , mine`s is : " No thanks I already have a wife " . I suppose it`s stupid to point out that Clooney`s character never mentioned he was married , and was only included `cos it sounds cool.On top of poor dialogue and unsympathetic characters we have the worst example of " Mixed Genre Film " . Most Hollywood movies are mixed genre but they don`t start off as a violent crime thriller then mutate into a gory horror film. TITANIC is a love story cum disaster movie , TAXI DRIVER is an urban thriller cum redemption plot , APOCALYPSE NOW is a war film cum horror movie. These films intwine the genres, FDTD doesn`t, it`s just two genres tacked together , and tacked very badly at that.Robert Rodriguez does a good job at the directors helm , I doubt if he`ll ever win an oscar but he casts well . Without doubt the best piece of casting is Selma Hayek . Selma Hayek in a bikini , Selma Hayek in a bikini dancing on a table , Selma Hayek in a bikini dancing on a table in slow motion...... I`m all prepared for slavery</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll agree From Dusk Till Dawn is very entertaining. However, that doesn't mean it's any good.There's nothing wrong with mixing genres within a movie - Woody Allen did it very successfully in Crimes and misdemeanours - but Tarantino needs to use more subtlety than he shows here. This films starts as a crime thriller then suddenly, and I mean suddenly, turns into a horror flick. The change of genre and the ham fisted way it's done indicate, to me, a lack of direction.I get the feeling Tarantino started writing this film fully intending it to be criminals on the run drama. However, half way through writing he realised he had no second act, let alone an ending. He could have gone down the Wild Bunch or Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid roads, but instead he decides to take it into a completely different film all together. That doesn't work and I'm amazed more people didn't pick up on it.This is a truly appalling film. For all the talent on show here is this best they could do? All should hang their heads in shame. Tarantino's a great writer and director; Rodriguez a great action director; Clooney a leading man of some repute; Keitel and Lewis are outstanding talents but they're all upstaged by the vampire special effects. A sorry state of affairs.The only positive thing is that I liked the references to Assault on Precinct 13. First through the boys T-shirt and, best of all, the scene where they fight off the vampires at the end of a corridor. The scene bears an uncanny resemblance to the ending of Assault on Precinct 13.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WOW....There is not even words that can describe this movie. It is amazing in every way possible. Clooney and Tarantino make an explosive pair!!

This is one of those movies that can send chills up your spine for a week. This is not a movie that should be missed. 10/10 ***** stars out of 5. A must see.-if you like this movie too, feel free to email me at the address above!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favorite Vampire Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hands-down this is just a great movie and my favorite vampire movie of all time. Its great cause it doesn't take itself seriously. Come on stripper vampires but its fun and thats the most important part. The movie had everything that I have come to expect from a Robert Rodriguez movie. The action was plenty. The movie is essentially Desperado with vampires. Many of the techniques that he used in Desperado are apparent in From Dusk Till Dawn as well as the some of the weapons. (people who have seen both movies know what I'm talking about) I recommend this movie to anyone who likes vampire movies. It's that damn good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Thin Line Between Suspense and Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** From Dusk Till Dawn is one of those movies that surprised the audience big time. Starting out as a real suspense/thriller the audience will be taken to the edge of their seat.But then half way the film the plot suddenly turns 180 degrees and we are in the middle of a great, funny, gore, horror movie. For those who didn't know what to expect it was a real shock. "How the hell can a great thriller like this turn into a cheap horror flick?" they must have thought.Well the answer is simple. Because it is a Rodriguez-Tarantino production which proofs "you never can tell" what will happens next.When I saw this one at the Cinema in the Netherlands, just a few people knew what they were going into. But most of them had no idea what to expect. So during the break (In the Netherlands most theaters have a 15 minute break halfway a movie) people in the Lobby were talking about this great thriller. The break started at the moment that the brothers, together with the camping family, reached the Titty Twister, just before they went in. Everybody was wondering what the twist would be. But I bet that even their wildest imagination didn't come close. After the interval the movie went on and within a few minutes everyone changed into vampires. Not long after that most of the audience walked out of the theater. They could not believe what was happening to the story. Such a sick twist. How was this possible? The people that stayed were in for a big treat. And at the end we all cheered and clapped our hands for a while. This was great.The director took us from a great suspense movie into an even greater horror/comedy. He showed us that the distance between the two genres is in fact nothing more than a thin line. For those of you who think the same way about this great picture, you should buy the DVD Collector's Edition. It's full of great special features (incl Full Tilt Boogey, a full feature film about the making of this picture). I rewarded this movie a 10 out of 10 because I still enjoy it every time I see it</fullReview>

It just seems like a kind of kidnapping thing, but then BLAM! you're in a sleazy strip joint and Salma Hayek is doing a really wild show with an albino snake and suddenly...vampires everywhere!

		<shortDescription>ONE OF THE BEST FILMS I'VE EVER SEEN</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think "From dusk till dawn" is a masterpiece. I have to see it in Italian, unfortunately, but I'd like to see it in English too. The bad Gecko brothers are incredible, the elder, Seth, is a thief, sometimes a killer, but he's not as crazy as his "little" brother Richard, who's a real psychopathic, full of visions that in his ill brain seem to be real. For instance, he causes the death of a man beacause, only in his mind, he saw him asking for help. But that wasn't true at all! Moreover, he imagines that a girl, the priest's daughter, asks him for a special...favor...well, you must know...The best surprise of the film is the one in the "Titty Twister", where a lot of people become blood-thirsty vampires. Bad Seth will have to need God's help, to defeat 'em. I do suggest to see it, if you still haven't. My vote is 10, from 0 to 10. Bye bye.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely blood sucking great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The combination of Taratino's writng and Rodgriguez's direction make this a winner. Some slated it for not knowing what it wanted to be a con escape thriller or a horror, but to me this sets it apart from the usual vampire flicks. The casting is wicked, Harvey Keitel (brilliant as ever) Juliet Lewis, Cheech Marin (brilliant in all 3 roles), Tarantino, Salma Hayek (Hubba Hubba) and of course George Clooney, who for me can do no wrong. Since his departure from ER he seems to have gone from strength to strength, and sad muppet that I am I even liked him as Batman.The script is a bit predictable at times maybe but some of the one liners are great, and the interaction between the characters is well done, no-one particularly steals the show (apart from Hayek when she does that dance) and Tarantino and Clooney as the two convict brothers are really good.Brilliant film, that's different enough to make it interesting and as with any film that has Tarantino's influence it has a stonkin' soundtrack.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can only say it in one word: Awesome! This is the absolute best vampire film I have ever seen and also the violentist. Other more recent vampire films like Blade and Vampires are great but From Dusk Till Dawn is by far the best. George Clooney is cool in his role as a play-it-by-the-rules bank robber and Quentin Tarantino is totally wicked as his psychotic younger brother. From Dusk Till Dawn is also in my opinion probably one of the more original vampire films out there. The idea of vampires in Mexico is completely original. Viewers be warned however, From Dusk Till Dawn is incredibly violent, there is a lot of cursing, and Cheech Marin makes a barrage of funny one-liners that all include a certain female body part. Anyway, to sum it up, From Dusk Till Dawn is an original film, with an original plot, and some great casting and Salma Hayek ain't bad to look at either. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dusk Till Dawn is a cinematic masterpiece. It combines horror and black comedy with supreme experience. Rodriguez's direction is perfect and all the performances are terrific. All the roles are perfectly casted and add to the incredible atmosphere of the film. The film is clever because its two different types of films combined. A chase\cops &amp; robbers film and a horror film. In the first half, you begin to like the characters and then, when the plot twist hits you like a sledgehammer, you are worried about the characters and you go through the same horror they are going through. All in all, From Dusk Till Dawn is a very classy film, with great makeup and a blistering soundtrack. Don't miss this movie if you are a fan of action\horror\comedy films. 5 stars</fullReview>

"Dusk til Dawn" is a movie about criminals on the run, and then becomes a great action-horror flick half-way through. Seth Gecko (Clooney) is one of the great characters in all of cinematic history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are two words I'd like to use to describe this film, one of which is "dross" and the other wouldn't get through the IMDB guidelines. This looks a cracking movie when you first sit down to watch it; full on Tarantino style, including some clever camera work in the motel room scene (watch carefully for the Pulp Fiction references.) Then they enter the bar, again all looks good. Then someone turns into a vampire. At this point, immediately evacuate the room, for your first great impressions should not be spoilt by the anticlimax that is to follow. I fully relaxed at this point, I was no longer engaged in the film. I almost lost sleep over, but not quite, the decision to either give this a 3 or a 4. In the end I opted for the 4 because a) the beginning is great and b) Juliette Lewis makes the film entirely more watchable. No wonder the sequels were straight-to-video.</fullReview>

In addition, Tarantino's character seems to be there just so he can see his mug on the big screen. Harvey Keitel is the only cast member whose character carries any weight, and even at that his script is so stilted so many places that it's impossible to listen to him speak with a straight face.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>...Not as bad as I remember it being...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just got done watching From Dusk Til Dawn on TV, and I've got to say, it was much better than when I watched it on video a few year's back at a friend's house. While George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino's acting jobs were utterly horrendous, Juliette Lewis and Harvey Keitel, as usual, were fantastic. However, they could not save this movie. It has an incredibly thin plot, and no character development. I must say the censors at Fox did a great job taking out all the breasts and swearing. I seem to remember Clooney saying three four letter words for every normal word. And the name of the bar on TV was the Kitty Twister, and I seem to remember it being named something *slightly* different when I saw it on video. If it really did have that slightly different name in the uncensored movie, one must really give credit to Fox' censors, as even the LOGO for the bar said Kitty Twister. From Dusk Til Dawn is a bad movie. Unfortunately it takes itself far too seriously to even be laughably bad. Fortunately Fox had the good nature to intersperse the film with commercials every 10 minutes to break up the monotony. On video you won't be quite so lucky. Avoid this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like Pickles and Ice Cream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a troubled film. If you're looking for a good Tarantino-esque crime drama, you'll be disappointed; if you're looking for a good horror spoof--no dice, either.This film is like pickles and ice cream--separately, you may like either, but together they taste horrible--and it would take a decidedly skewed state-of-mind to accept then at the same time. The film begins very promisingly as a dark and gritty gangster film and sloppily switches to a gratuitous sendup of Hammer horror films. "From Dusk Till Dawn" represents everything that is wrong with the post-postmodern film world--if you can't innovate, imitate. Unfortunately, Tarantino and Rodriguez don't seem to be able to do either very well, anymore. Clooney's character is as interesting as his stereotype can be; Keitel looks like he's doing the filmmaker a favor; even Salma Hayek comes off as unsexy and completely non-threatening as the "main" vampire. What you get, instead of "two great tastes that taste great together," is a film-schoolish, "look at me" barrage of excess that leaves a bad taste in your mouth.Don't say I didn't warn you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Robert Rodriguez and writer Quentin Tarantino make a great team. This marries the splatter fun of Rodriaguez with the delicious dialog from Tarantino.Seth (George Clooney) and Richard (Quentin Tarantino) are bank robbers. Richard is a little insane and breaks Seth out of court. They take the Fuller family (Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis, Ernest Liu) hostage. Once in Mexico, they stop at the wild bar Titty Twister to wait for Carlos expected before dawn. Just when things couldn't get any crazier, Salma Hayek starts dancing.This is a well made simple gore fest. It doesn't let up until they reach sunlight. It's a film where Rodriguez has thrown everything into it. Tarantino actually works well as manic maniac. It's kind of his thing. Clooney brings his superiority to his character. He does need to be more menacing. That's probably the only minor complaint I have. Clooney seems out of place at times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enough of the 'cool' crap. Please.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not realize exactly how much I detest this film until I saw it again last night. The sight of Tarantino with a gun just makes me want to smash my own television. The sight of Tarantino killing someone makes me want to cry with despair at the state of the film industry. I can only hope that one day George Clooney faints with the genuine realization he chose to be involved in this heinous vile film. Why cannot other people see Tarantino as I see him and his awful cretinous mutilation and degradation films? I cannot be the only one. Every film he makes is sheer humiliation violence towards women. They are not 'cool'. They are designed to ridicule violently every character because Tarantino sets out to defile everyone and everything because he cannot create. He is a destroyer: of images of beauty, of the human form and I am sick of hearing how 'cool' he is and that the films he makes are 'cool'. Clearly every woman in his films and especially this one are simply there for him to manhandle and humiliate, defile and then to kill... that is if he does not get to have rough sex with them first. The scene in the motel with Gloria the hostage who is crying with fear... she gets used as a gun gag and her brains are splattered on the wall. This is so vile and so cruel and especially that as a character in this film she is a middle aged woman, someone's mum and an ordinary woman. Tarantino's psycho character encourages her to relax so he can rape her then blast her face off. This apparently is funny. Hence my rousing identification of the true destructive and defiling nature of this rotten film. The showgirls in the Titty Bar are shown hacked up and tossed in a heap...because all beautiful women in Tarantino films really are monsters and if you don't f**k em first you'd better kill em. Tarantino's films are specifically designed by him to simply rip to shreds anything that is humane and beautiful and of value. His film world is one of emotional and physical brutality and the sheer obvious hatred of women of all ages. FROM DUSK TILL DAWN is a vile cinematrocity and should be studied for what it truly is. The scene where Harvey Keitel is begging his kids to murder him is just an atrocity on every standard of life any society holds with value. In this film Tarantino has written it as a part of his 'wacky adventure in the dirt'. Next time you have an accident in the street and lay bleeding in terrible pain and some pitiless passerby by says. "ooh cool' as you pass out from the pain.. think of how well Tarantino has infected their psyche and eroded their humanity via his assault on society by films like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very entertaining action packed horror film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Dusk Till Dawn starts with two wanted criminals on the run, brothers Seth (George Clooney) &amp; Richard Gecko (Quentin Taratino) are wanted for murder &amp; robbery. They hatch a plan to cross the border into Mexico &amp; kidnap a preacher named Jacob (Hervey Keitel) &amp; his two kids Kate (Juliette Lewis) &amp; Scott (Ernest Liu) to help them, hiding in the back of Jacob's large motor-home they manage to get across the border to the relative safety of Mexico. Seth has arranged a meeting with Mexican crime-boss to pay him off to let them stay at criminal hideaway El Rey, the meeting is set to take place at the Titty Twister bar which is actually frequented by blood sucking Vampires...Edited, co-produced &amp; directed by Robert Rodriguez this action come Vampire flick is a bit of a gem that I have seen several times since it first came out &amp; enjoy it each &amp; every time. The script was by star Quentine Taratino who had just had bags of commercial &amp; critical success (hell, he even won an Oscar for the screenplay) with Pulp Fiction (1994) &amp; he followed that up with From Dusk Till Dawn which is a terrific Vampire horror film with a touch of heist flick about it. As has already been mentioned by the whole world &amp; it's brother From Dusk Till Dawn can be split straight down the middle, the first half being a crime film with the Gecko brothers on the run from the law &amp; during this half there is absolutely no indication that the second half of the film will explode into a full blown exploitation Vampire horror flick. Personally I think the sudden shift in tone, structure &amp; even genre is a masterstroke &amp; keeps the film unpredictable &amp; it just feels totally &amp; utterly right. There's plenty of action &amp; gore, there's plenty of one-liners &amp; amusing dialogue &amp; it moves along like a rocket so it's never boring. Most of the character's are very good although I don't like how Tarantino made the Gecko brothers so unlikable, as the stars I would have thought they should be likable &amp; not setting fire to innocent connivance store clerks which is the first meaningful thing we see them do.Director Rodriguez does a good job here with plenty of action &amp; gore. It's clear both Rodriguez &amp; Tarantino are exploitation fans &amp; From Dusk Till Dawn is stuffed full of homages &amp; nods to a style of film-making long gone. In fact the name of the film itself is taken from the signs found on drive-ins which showed this type of film. These signs indicate the length of the shows, which ran "from dusk till dawn". There's a fair amount of violence &amp; gore although nothing too graphic since it needed to get an 'R' rating, there's slit throats, decapitated heads, ripped out hearts, blood spurting, lots of severed limbs, exploding &amp; melting Vampires, chucks bitten out of flesh, holes in hands &amp; other assorted bodily mutilations. The film has a nice style &amp; looks very nice as well. The special effects are generally good although the CGI computer effects look a bit dated now, having said that most of the effects are of the on set rubber &amp; fake blood variety.With a supposed budget of about $20,000,000 this is very well made with high production values. As well as being stuffed with exploitation homages in the script there are several cast members who will be recognizable to any horror film fan including Tom Savini, Fred Williamson, Harvey Keitel, John Saxon in a disappointingly little cameo, Cheech Marin, Danny Trejo &amp; Salma Hayek also gets a small role. The acting is pretty good &amp; the best thing thing Clooney has ever done.From Dusk Till Dawn is a really fun action horror film that has a large plot twist about halfway through which I thought worked great. Followed by two straight-to-video sequels From Dusk Till Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money (1999) &amp; From Dusk Till Dawn 3: The Hangman's Daughter (2000) which were both poor &amp; killed a potential franchise before it even started.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably one of the most awesome movies ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion there are only 3 movies in the world that are really underrated/misunderstood; "Mars Attacks!", "Starship Troopers" and this movie. It makes me mad and sad when any of those movies gets flamed for all the wrong reasons.Yes, this movie is pulp, just the way as it was intended to. Robert Rodriguez is just a big movie-nut who also happens to make movies himself. He makes movies obviously for the fun of it, where profits and budgets don't seem to be his biggest priority. He just makes the movies he wants to and enjoys doing, they way he wants to. He's of course not the only director in the business that does this but he perhaps is the only director that also has the right connections while doing so. It makes Rodriguez unique in its sort and also one of the best and most enjoyable directors in the business. Amazing how many famous and respected actors actually agreed to appear in this movie. Guess it truly helps when you're friends with Quentin Tarantino and his name gets attached to the project as well. Would Harvey Keitel or Juliette Lewis else would really ever do a movie like this? Also a really gutsy move to case George Clooney in the most tough and carrying role of the movie. He still had his 'be good' "ER" image all written over him at the time. It wasn't until after this movie that he really got token serious as an actor and got cast in big production movies such as "Batman &amp; Robin", "The Peacemaker" and "Three Kings". The story is totally original, in its own twisting and weird way. The first part of the movie the movie seems like a crime movie in which two brothers are on the run. However from the moment the character enter the Titty Twister bar in Mexico it turns 360 degrees, spins 3 more time and makes a barrel-role. That's how it best can be described. The movie becomes an extremely gory and ridicules vampire-flick, in which all the gloves are off. This movie is basically the ultimate dream for every B-movie type of horror lover. Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino are obviously also two of them. They really didn't needed to make this movie, Quentin Tarantino had some big and respectable successes with "Reservoir Dogs" and "Pulp Fiction", prior to this movie and Robert Rodriguez just had his big breakthrough with "Desperado". They just made this movie because they could and they really wanted to.The movie does have some great tough characters and the script has some good dialog in it, with some great humor as well. Not necessarily the typical sort of Tarantino sort of dialog but great nevertheless, in a different kind of way. He obviously had fun writing this movie, by putting in as many crazy and gory elements in it as possible. But the movie is still of course mostly a Rodriguez movie, made in his typical 'Mexican' sort of style, that is consistent with his earlier movies "El Mariachi" and "Desperado".The movie is kept deliberately simple and silly. It enhances the fun incredibly and this might very well be also one of the most fun movies I have ever seen. It's delicious pulp, without any intentions. It's made purely to entertain and on top of the that, it's first class made, with people such as Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez involved and it has a great respectable cast in it, with persons that above all are very well cast into their roles. Most of them also seem to be in this movie just for the fun of it, which really shows on the screen. It helps to make the movie work and make it all the more entertaining to watch. Actors such as Danny Trejo and Cheech Marin of course also show up as always is the case in a Robert Rodriguez and the Salma Hayek cameo role is already sort of a classic and while leave the fan-boys drooling.The movie does not have the greatest special-effects or make-up, though the small details of the movie are done really good, but this is sort of usual for Robert Rodriguez movies and fits in with the rest of his movies and style. You can tell that they did their very best to make every sequences as gory as possible. It's however done in such an over-the-top and clearly intentional way that the gore becomes one of the humorous aspects of the movie. It's some very graphic stuff, so clearly this movie is not just for everyone.A totally awesome movie!10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie was garbage. All the references to vampire movies and Tarantino's previous work. Big deal. As interesting as a jackhammer pounding away at the pavement. The film does some misdirection. Misdirection is great. Hitchcock made first-time viewers of Psycho think the movie was going to be about a woman who embezzled money, and who perhaps got second thoughts about what she did. Then he turned the tables on movie-goers with the shower scene. Of course, the surprise is gone from Psycho because we all saw it. Rodriguez and Tarantino try table-turning in this film because the viewer thinks the movie is about a kidnapping. And then the movie turns into something else. The problem is that the something else is schlock.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From Dusk 'till Dawn: The Worst American Movie Trap Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow. I really didn't see that coming out of the bushes to beat me with a bat and stomp all over me. I'd rather tear out my urethra and drag in on to a freeway and try to lasso rear view mirrors through the open windows of cars than watch that again. This is coming from someone who's second favorite director is Quentin Tarantino. This movie appears to be decent when all of a sudden, a pivoting point of lameness comes out to haunt you. I wouldn't even have bothered to watch this but once the vampires arose, my buddy said "Oh yeah, this movie is about vampires." Thanks, I'm glad I know that now. This movie was such a disappointment, I will hunt down Robert Rodriguez and urinate on his epitaph which will probably say: Don't Bother. I can't believe he came from humble beginnings with things such as Four Rooms (The Misbehavers) to epic pieces of art such as Spy Kids 3D: Game Over. This movie is very bad, trust me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From high quality till silliness.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Clooney's acting career sure started off shaky. There was the ridiculous "From Dusk Till Dawn", the hokey "One Fine Day", the pathetic "Batman and Robin", and the predictable "Peacemaker". By early 1998, it seemed like his career was going nowhere, but then he starred in "Out of Sight" and proved that he could do good roles (continued with "O Brother, Where Art Thou?", "Ocean's Eleven", and "Syriana"). As for "From Dusk Till Dawn", it started out good but then got silly. Maybe it was fun (especially Cheech's "pussy" monologue, and the position of that gun), but otherwise nothing that we haven't seen. Salma Hayek was sexy though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Best Vampire Films Ever Made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best Vampire films ever made, tons of fun!. It Starts out like a crime flick then in the 2nd half, it turns into an action/vampire film , in my opinion either direction would have been cool, i was perfectly happy with the 2nd half, it was action packed with tons and tons of gore, lots of fun!, but if it stayed a crime/thriller that would have been cool too. The characters were all awesome and Clooney blew me away with his bad ass performance. It's well written and well made!, and it just entertained the hell out of me. The Directing is Fantastic!. Robert Rodriguez does a fantastic job here, with great zoom in's , great closeup of the vampires, wonderful effects, good use of colors, it's also pretty stylish in some scenes, and he kept the film at a very fast pace! good job. This is a Gorefest! we get a bloody gunshot wound to the back of the head with blood and brains spurting, lots of extremely bloody gunshot wounds,hole blown through hand, gory flashes, bloody corpse, knife in the hand, lots of extremely bloody vamp biting(and i mean extremely bloody), severed head, a very gory corpse, is used as a guitar (you heard me), and we see it over and over, slit throat, 2 decapitations, TONS and TONS of Melting Vampires, lots of ripped of limbs,ripped out heart, gory deformed vampires, TONS and TONS of extremely bloody Stakings, and Impalings legless vampire,a few head explosions, gory arrow hits, weird mutations, and about 20 exploding vampires yes this is indeed a gore fest i probably forgot some stuff too!. The Acting is Wonderful!. George Clooney gives an AMAZING performance here, he is a bad ass, actually likable, and i just couldn't help but love him!, his chemistry with Lewis and Tarantino was great, and he kicked that ass!, and was perfect for the part, and also my favorite character in the film!. Harvey Keitel is EXCELLENT here as usual he is a great actor , and one of the best of all time (in my opinion). and did a fine fine job here, he also kicked that ass, and was very likable as the preacher, who has lost his faith in god. Juliette Lewis is also EXCELLENT here , she is GORGEOUS, kicked that ass, and thankfully wasn't one of those wimpy daughters who just stood there and did nothing. Ernest Liu does decent as Scott, and was fairly likable but didn't have much to do. Quentin Tarantino is great here, he was a nut,kicked that ass and had great chemistry with Clooney. Salma Hayek is GORGEOUS, and does very well here, but wish she had more screen time. Cheech Martin is good in his roles. Danny Trejo, Tom Savini,Fred Williamson, John Saxon and Kelly Preston all do excellent in there small roles especially Savini. Overall One of the best Vampire films ever made and i suggest you see it this instant! ***** out of 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember seeing clips a few years back on From Dusk Till Dawn, just of Selma Hayek turning into a monster, so obviously I knew I missed out on a bunch of information so I skipped out on the movie. But I know it's mentioned quite a bit because of the Quentin Tarantino fans out there, so when I came across the film in Hollywood Video, I didn't hesitate. Also not to mention that we have a few stars in the film besides Quentin, we have George Clooney, Harvey Keitel, and Juliette Lewis. So I just watched the film and while I think the story had a complete turn around, we went from a hostage/robbers story to a vampire horror story. It happened so quickly that I was a bit out of it after the film, but at the same time I really enjoyed the action. It was unbelievable, I'm not just talking about the vampires alone, I'm just saying how the family knew automatically to use weapons. Well, there are a few things, but I'll explain in a minute.Seth and Richie are two brothers who are robbers and killers, they are on the run to Mexico. They kidnap a family with their motor home van and cross the border. There Seth wants to meet a friend that can get him started with the money that him and his brother robbed from a bank, they decide to meet at the local strip club that is open from dusk till dawn. There Seth, Richie, the family end up getting something a bit out of their league and what they expected, vampires, and they're hungry for some blood.The acting is alright, enough to get by as believable, I mean, don't get me wrong, the cast was awesome, but it was a bit of a question to me on the roles they took on. While the story is very cool and creative, like I said, it turns so quickly into something else and they also leave with questions. This wasn't Quentin's best work, but I liked this movie better than Jackie Brown. I would recommend this movie for horror fans, because I know every Quentin Tarantino fan has already seen this film. But it's a cool movie, just I know that it could have either ended better or answered a few more questions.7/10</fullReview>

Unfortunately he later realized that anything he stuck his name to would make some money, so he dug it out and let people make it.Bad bad bad!Before the vampires pop up the movie is like a cheap rehash of Reservoir Dogs with gun violence, a dark torture-death, and witty banter. Then it seems Tarantino squatted behind some bushes and used the remaining script pages as Charmins, because the the next two thirds of the movie felt like a group of wild monkeys throwing their own feces onto the screen.</fullReview>

I'm pretty sure George Cloony had to beg for a second chance to even get back into the movie business. Anyone who is about to watch this movie, I'm warning you that you might not ever want to see another Quentin Tarantino movie ever again and might change your thoughts about him. Certainly Tarantino's worst screenplay, in fact, it is one of the worst screenplays ever written. What an embarrassment to Tarantino's otherwise flawless resume. It practically sinks his whole career. This movie contains pointless nudity and violence (Tarantino's character rapes and kills a woman simply for the sake of shock value). It is also far and away Harvey Keitel's worst performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bizarrely entertaining - loud, trashy, vulgar...fun. Not great, though.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coming into this I knew it would be action over content - after all it was directed by Robert Rodriguez. The fact that the script was written by Tarantino didn't really mean anything since I had gathered from various sources that this was Tarantino's homage to the "splatstick" genre (of Evil Dead, etc.) and as a result the script probably wasn't so hot compared to Pulp Fiction.For the most part this is true. The first half of the movie IS really good in terms of cleverness and Tarantino-style stuff - good dialogue, interesting plot and unlikeable characters...unique. The second half, after they cross the border into Mexico - as others here have pointed out - becomes the Evil Dead segment of the film, where everything turns into some over-the-top, bizarre, gross-out vampire blood-'n-guts movie with bad special effects and cheesy scenes. (Albeit fun ones.) Some have complained that the transformation from seriousness to sudden vampire comic book content is too fast and the story would have been far more interesting had it been rooted in realism for its entire duration. Yes, and no. Rodriguez set out to make an homage to the spaghetti western/Evil Dead genre and did so. Tarantino's script is just the baseline for it all. It's like a bunch of friends got together and decided to make a movie - albeit friends with fairly good reputations as filmmakers. George Clooney, Harvey Keitel, Tarantino - not a bad cast! Had this been presented as an epic crime movie Tarantino would have helmed it. However due to the fact that he provided Rodriguez with the script and even performed a commentary track on the film's DVD release (something he does on none of his own directed films) just goes to show that Tarantino wasn't in it for the praise - he was in it for the fun and experience. Ditto for everyone else.And in that regard this is a pretty fun movie. Like Rodriguez' DESPERADO, it's a guilty pleasure for viewers and cast - a bunch of highly esteemed actors get together and have a blast.So no, this is not a great movie. The second half could be replaced with a more serious half and I think it would probably be one of the best thrillers ever if this was done. (Just imagine how great it could have been if it had been brought to a poetically justified ending with some sort of Gecko Brothers/law enforcement shootout a la Butch Cassidy/Bonnie and Clyde.) However I understand that's not what Rodriguez and crew set out to do with this movie - they just wanted to make an entertaining cult popcorn blockbuster flick.And they succeeded. It's entertaining and hip and stylish. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film begins as a nice, slightly predictable crime/thriller, when it suddenly takes a terrible, unexpected turn into sci-fi/cheesy horror flick. Why are there vampires in the bar? Why does Frost suddenly reminisce about Viet Nam? Why does a vampire with no head turn into a giant rat? Although there are a few humorous moments and kitschy references to other (better) movies, I was just left scratching my head and confused as to why I was still watching this awful movie. It seems as though Tarantino was tired of making good movies and needed to turn out a terrible combination of crime and vampires. Leave this one on the shelf!</fullReview>

If two guys kidnapped your family, forced you to drive into Mexico, and landed you in a club of angry vampires who kill said family... would you suddenly find yourself wanting to run away into the sunset with one of these men? This is a ridiculous movie and proof that Quentin should stick to his talk-ridden gangster flicks. The acting is dull, the vampires are typical and brainless, and the super soakers full of Holy Water.... The ending is what put this one in the turkey books for me.

Doesn't it remind you anything. I am not arguing anything, but just think of it. It would be the Tarantolino brothers. When it comes to movie, I would say it was perfect in the crime part. You could feel HIS (Tarantino) spirit in every detail, you could definitely know it was HIS Universe. Brilliant Michael Parks, absolutely great dialogs, attention to details - in other words everything was great. The question "did poor boy mouth "help me" or not" nearly killed me.But when the second, action part, began I was disappointed. HIS spirit was gone.

		<fullReview>You have to understand that this movie is a combination of two totally different stories and they are very different in quality.First story is about the brothers (Clooney and Tarantino) and their crimes. They take a family hostage and head for Mexico. This part is nice&amp;good, I was interested to see more, but the plot suddenly turned to some cheesy&amp;corny vampire story. This second story has no style and is totally awful. But Clooney does his best to save this part and I must say thank you to him, because otherwise there would be totally no purpose to watch this movie till the end (even Selma's striping is not sexy... She was doing that much better in Dogma).So, the summary: first part was good and I would be glad to find out the ending of it without stupid vampires (I give 7 out of 10) and the second part about the vampires is awful (I give 2 out of 10, not 1 because of Clooney acting). My advise: turn of TV when it comes to the bar in Mexico.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, at least it started out well.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie about two weeks ago with a friend and new very little to nothing about it when I began watching. I vaguely remembered something about vampires being in the movie, but as the film began, I thought my memory must've been wrong, because this was a movie about two bankrobbers/murderers named the Gecko brothers, Clooney (Excellent as an anti-hero character) and Tarantino (not as excellent).The first half hour is quite good, thanks to Tarantino's great script and solid acting by Clooney and his hostage Keitel, a preacher with two children who has lost his faith due to the death of his wife. After they cross the border into Mexico to avoid the police and FBI, they go to a not so family-friendly bar to meet their accomplice in the robberies.Then the entire movie falls apart.It turns out that all of the people that work in the bar are secretly vampires, and an ultra-gory biting and stabbing scene follows, complete with decapitating and removing beating hearts.Now don't get me wrong, there are some well choreographed vampire fight scenes in this movie that can be attributed to director Rodriguez, but the transition between the Gecko Brothers escaping to the vampire hunting is so choppy that it feels like two completely different movies just crammed together. After the movie was over, my friend and I both agreed it was one of the dumbest movies we had ever seen and were both severely disappointed. How could Tarantino, the genius behind such works as Pulp Fiction, be behind this disaster? I'm still wondering.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two Movies In One</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is unusual in that it is really two separate movies in one: the first half is a crime story and the second half is a vampire extravaganza. THE BAD NEWS - Harvey Keitel plays a Baptist minister who has "lost his faith" after this wife's death and intimates that those who have it are fools. In truth, he's just mad at God after what happened and he dos somewhat come back to his faith at the end. Of course, it takes a killer to preach to him at the end! Only in Hollywood do we have this kind of secular nonsense preached! The whole Keitel character is so theologically weak and ridiculous that it's past me getting upset over it. I just hope viewers aren't stupid enough to believe this kind of minister is normal (and acts and talks as like he does in this film.)Anyway, people watching this should also be aware that there is a lot of "language," meaning tons of f-words said by about everyone. There is a lot of gore, too, in the vampire half of the film. So, if you expect all this or aren't offended by it, you are in for one wild ride because.....THE GOOD NEWS - Despite with very low morality of this movie, it is extremely entertaining and never, despite multiple viewings, gets dull although the violence gets to be a little much at the end. It would have been a better film had it been cut about 10-15 minutes. George Clooney, as the more stable of the two killers, "Seth Gecko," is fascinating to hear. Although obnoxious, he is easily the the most fascinating character in a film filled with weirdos. It's one of the most interesting characters Clooney has ever played.This is stylishly filmed and humorous in parts. It has the Richard Rodriguez ("El Mariachi trilogy) look all over it: stylish, outrageous and cartoon-like at times. Actually, many of the characterizers here a pretty perverse, especially Clooney's brother and partner, "Richard" (Quentin Tarantino). What a sicko he is! At least Tarantinto played himself, making his role easier to play.The people at the bar in the second half of the film (featuring actors Danny Trejo, Tom Savin, Fred Williamson and Selma Hayak) have to be seen to be believed! You want to know who sleazy this can get? Just listen to Cheech Marin's "pussy" speech outside the bar. That about says it all.Finally, the music in here is very good, if you are a fan of the blues and especially the Vaughan brothers. This is one of those "guilty pleasures" I can never decide whether to own or not. I got rid of it, but wouldn't mind seeing it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>FROM DUSK TILL DAWN (Robert Rodriguez, 1996) **1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is another film I'd been wanting to watch ever since it was released. As some of you may know, I'm not much of a devotee of Quentin Tarantino - even less so Robert Rodriguez - and my main interest in it was to see how they approached the horror genre. I wasn't all that surprised to find that it's much more of a Tarantino/Rodriguez hybrid of cool dialogue, excessive violence, foul language and slam-bang action than an out-and-out vampire film! Anyway, the first half (which is the non-horror part, incidentally) is the best with George Clooney and Tarantino himself (still a worthless actor and mean as mush) on the run after a heist and kidnapping Harvey Keitel's preacher and family on their way to Mexico. When we finally get to the vampires, it's like the film-makers didn't quite know what to make of them and wanted to get it over with - as we only see a succession of humans getting bitten and transformed into the undead themselves, until dawn arrives and the vampires left standing are destroyed by sunlight.Tarantino gets to wear monster make-up and an embarrassed-looking Harvey Keitel dabbles in gung-ho action heroics - but this section does feature a delightful double-act in fx master Tom Savini (playing a character called "Sex Machine" and decked-out with a cannon device in his pants placed on top of his crotch!) and former 'Blaxpoitation' star Fred Williamson. For the record, Clooney is likable as ever, Juliette Lewis does her typically confused yet aroused teenager, while Salma Hayek is a sultry snake dancer billed as "Santanico {sic} Pandemonium" (but her appearance is much shorter than I had anticipated, given the prominence she is given in stills I had seen from the film!).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Embarrassment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A promising beginning quickly gives way to shameful exploitation and excesses that are unworthy of the participants involved, and even the most adept rationalization will not excuse them from taking part in a project that is so blatantly devoid of anything even remotely close to possessing any redeeming aspects or qualities whatsoever. Screenwriter Quentin Tarantino and director Robert Rodriguez had apparently attained the kind of stature within the right kind of circles that gave them free reign going into the production of `From Dusk Till Dawn,' and the results are something akin to what happens when you turn a couple of undisciplined youngsters loose in a toy store and then refuse to hold them accountable for the mess they make. The thing is, the people involved here are artists, who collectively and individually, have proven themselves capable of achievements beyond the norm; and as an audience-- collectively and individually-- that is what we have come to expect from them. And that's not saying that every time out Tarantino has to give us a `Pulp Fiction,' or that Clooney or Keitel are expected to turn in an Academy Award worthy performance. But given their credentials, it is not out of line to expect them to deliver a product that includes at least some semblance of dignity, integrity and quality. And, unfortunately, none of the above are to be found anywhere in this `B-' schlock Rodriguez and Co. have fostered upon an unsuspecting public.The degradations begin when the morally bankrupt Gecko brothers, Seth (George Clooney) and Richie (Tarantino), go on a spree of murder and robbery on their way to Mexico, where they're to meet up with a colleague who will provide them with a safe haven-- for a price, of course. Near the border, to facilitate their crossing, they kidnap a minister, Jacob Fuller (Harvey Keitel), and his children, Kate (Juliette Lewis) and Scott (Ernest Liu). Seth sees the motor home Jacob is driving as the perfect vehicle to get them to their destination, and the recently widowed Jacob-- who is currently struggling with his faith-- sees no choice but to go along with the demands of his captors. What Jacob cannot know, however, is that he will be taking them to a rendezvous that will deposit them all veritably at the gates of Hell.In the opening scene, a Texas Ranger, Earl McGraw (Michael Parks), walks into a somewhat secluded liquor store where he has a conversation with the young clerk, during which they discuss the news of the Gecko brothers. Of course, Seth and Richie are already at hand, and the ensuing violence sets the stage for all that follows. And right up to the part at which the first shots are fired, courtesy of a riveting, if all too brief, performance by Parks (this is actually the film's best scene), it's actually a good beginning to a very bad movie. At this point, the film has had it's moment, and it's all downhill from there.With this screenplay, Tarantino-- who made a name for himself (and rightly so) with `Pulp Fiction' and `Reservoir Dogs,'-- developed a blueprint for excessive (even for him) violence and moral abasement, then handed it over to Rodriguez, who took the ball and ran with it. Straight down into the ground. The characters and situations created in this film give a negative value to human life and propriety, even taken within the broadest cinematic terms of expression. And the use of advanced technology and F/X by Rodriguez toward such an end as this is contemptible. Totally without redeeming value, this film appeals to nothing more than the basest instincts of the infantile mind, and is an embarrassment to the craft of filmmaking.If you bother to sift through the detritus of this visual and psychological malady, you will actually find a decent performance by Clooney, though given the context in which it exists, it will take an extremely objective eye to discern it at all. Seeking out a good performance here is like attempting to remedy the stench of a pig sty with a can of air freshener. And it's tough watching someone you admire as an artist wallow (and willingly yet) in such claptrap as this.As far as the participation of Harvey Keitel in this, one can only wonder what could have prompted such a decision. In fact, one can speculate that Jacob Fuller's loss of faith occurred after he read this script.The supporting cast includes Salma Hayek (Santanico Pandemonium), Cheech Marin (in three roles), Danny Trejo (Razor Charlie), Fred Williamson (Frost) and Kelly Preston (Newscaster Kelly Houge). A disaster that should never have been allowed to see the light of day, `From Dusk Till Dawn' will no doubt find it's own niche in the `cult film' Hall of Fame, and unfortunately there are those who will embrace this nonsense out-of-hand. If made by amateurs or an aspiring filmmaker who simply did not know better, the existence of this film would at least be understandable and acceptable within the context of those given terms and conditions. But with the names and talents of the likes of Tarantino, Clooney, Rodriguez, Keitel and Lewis attached, there is no excuse for it; no excuse whatsoever. In the final analysis, this is nothing more than a demonstration of the blatant misuse of the magic that is the movies. I rate this one 1/10. </fullReview>

George Clooneys character literally becomes a new Character when they reach the strip club. The movie is bad. THe whole vampire storyline is brought into the movie for no reason at all. I know that they wanted us to be excited by the sudden change in atmosphere, but it just plain sucked. If it would have been done right then it would have been cool, because it was a cool idea, but it was not pulled off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is probably the worst one I've ever seen, the plot is something that even Ed Wood couldn't have concocted, unbelievable, gratuitous violence and gore. I'm surprised that Clooney's career survived this bomb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, This movie is amazing. I have never been so incredibly taken aback by a movie in all my years of film-watching. To put it bluntly: this is the worst piece of sh*t I have ever had the misfortune of watching. Nothing more needs to be said...it simply sucked.-1 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Pre-Grindhouse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Dusk Till Dawn (1996) **** (out of 4) Robert Rodriquez takes a Quentin Tarantino script and turns out a wild ride of a film that pays homage to the grindhouse cinema. Two fugitives (George Clooney, Tarantino) are trying to get across the Mexican border and takes a family (Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis, Ernest Liu) hostage. Once across the border they stop at a bar, which just happens to be full of vampires. Even in the horror community the opinions are split on this one but I love every second of it. I loved how the film starts out as a crime drama and then does a complete turn into a horror film. Both halves of the film work fine with me due in large part to Tarantino's script but the cast is simply wonderful. Keitel is great as usual and Clooney made a wonderful debut here. The supporting cast of Lewis, Tarantino, Tom Savini, John Saxson, Fred Williamson, Salma Hayek and Cheech Marin are incredibly fun to watch and bring the film up several notches. There's some great gore, strong laughs and a great dance by Hayek, which shows Tarantino's foot fetish once again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie sucks...and bites...and chews...and gnaws.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another Tarantino no-brainer exploitation film, "From Dusk Till Dawn" tells of a couple of bad guys on the run who hook up with a family and end up in a Mexican truck-stop strip joint doing battle with Vampires. The story is lame, the screen play boring nonsense, and the film is a redundant mess until the un-dead meet up with the really un-dead and battle it out in a major Vampire vs Human bloodbath. The only value here is some cool effects as Vampires explode, morph, melt, and burst into flames. Recommended for mature audiences with not so mature taste in film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Total trash with bulls**t story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The hype is not understandable!The only good part of this movie are the hard and partial funny phrases spoken by the main actors.The silly rest is a mixture of "trash-buffy" the vampire hunter and splatter of the ugliest sort.Stupid story and dumb action with absolutely no sin.If you are bored and not interested in sinful entertainment than maybe you can fill 2 hours with this crap of a movie.Have fun..if you can.Besides..maybe it is more fun to take your girlfriend take a walk, go to the cinema or play a game of billiard in the next pub you know.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Flipping the dial late on a Friday evening my wife and I watched this film begin. We immediately thought it silly with the filthy language and senseless killing. We kept with it, thinking George Clooney would pull it from the depths it was headed. Instead he just took it deeper. The minister's family tried to give some balance, but he was reduced to blithering rather than emboldened by what he experienced. Then the bar bums and naked women turned into vampires. The body count was immense and gross. This movie had more violence than Private Ryan. I can't recommend it to anyone for any reason.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good lord! Worst movie I've ever seen since 1975, where in a student film - a pig's throat was slashed. I was shocked to think the same person who directed "Pulp Fiction" could have directed and co-starred in this fiasco. Misogynist...and gratuitous violence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I get round to writing a history of Hollywood I will state that the most over rated film maker of the 1990's was Tarantino. He got lucky with RESERVOIR DOGS and the critics have loved him ever since. What the critics don't seem to notice is his failings as a screenwriter and FDTD best shows up these failings First up are the two main anti heroes. Are we supposed to empathise with them ? How ? They're a couple of cold blooded killers on the run who blow away a few people in a grocery store at the start of the film . And Tarantino rapes, murder and mutilates a hostage a few scenes later. Sorry but I'm not too keen on serial killers and sex offenders The dialogue sucks too . I suppose we could all nominate our own worst line from the film , mine's is : " No thanks I already have a wife " . I suppose it's stupid to point out that Clooney's character never mentioned he was married , and was only included because it sounded cool. On top of poor dialogue and unsympathetic characters we have the worst example of " Mixed Genre Film " . Most Hollywood movies are mixed genre to an extent but they don't start off as a violent crime thriller then mutate into a gory horror film. TITANIC is a love story cum disaster movie , TAXI DRIVER is an urban thriller cum redemption plot , APOCALYPSE NOW is a war film cum expressionistic horror movie. These films intertwine the genres, FDTD doesn't, it's just two genres tacked together , and tacked very badly at that. Robert Rodriguez does a good job at the directors helm , I doubt if he'll ever win an Oscar but he casts well . Without doubt the best piece of casting is Selma Hayek . Selma Hayek in a bikini , Selma Hayek in a bikini dancing on a table , Selma Hayek in a bikini dancing on a table in slow motion...... I'm all prepared for slavery</fullReview>

		<fullReview>kdubs41 from Pittsburgh couldn't have put it betterWhen the vampires made their first appearance my wife suggested this might be one of the characters' hallucination accounted to bad tequila, the kind served in truckers' bars. Still, after fast forwarding the rest of the film we had to admit that something went terribly wrong in the production, turning a promising Tarantino / Keitel / Clooney combination into something totally unworthy of watching.Interestingly, as the movie moves into the supernatural, the level of acting and the quality of the script both crash and burn faster than any vampire hit by direct daylight.Could it been the result of some very bad tequila?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From Dusk Till Dawn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From director Robert Rodriguez (Desperado, Sin City) and writers Quentin Tarantino and Robert Kurtzman (director of Wishmaster), this is a fantastic black comedy action horror. Basically brothers Seth (young looking George Clooney, during his success in ER) and Richard (Tarantino) are fugitive criminals have done a bank robbery. They kidnap the Fuller family, father Jacob Fuller (Harvey Keitel), daughter Kate (Juliette Lewis) and son Scott (Ernest Liu) to help them get across the border into Mexico. They have arranged to meet a kingpin (for a payoff) at a bar called the Titty Twister, and they have all night to drink and enjoy themselves. When a situation develops where they get their guns out and start shooting, this is when the exotic dancer Santanico Pandemonium (Salma Hayek) is the first of many to suddenly turn into a vampire, which (even with the clue title you don't expect it to turn into a horror film, because of previous events). The few people that have got through the first bunch of the vampires, including Sex Machine (Tom Savini) and Frost (Fred Williamson) are using what they know to defend themselves from the approaching terror, including making crosses, stakes through the heart, holy water and guns. Also starring Cheech Marin as Border Guard/Chet Pussy/Carlos, Desperado's Danny Trejo as Razor Charlie and Kelly Preston as Newscaster Kelly Houge. The special effects and make-up is impressive, plenty of gory explosions of blood, guts and goo, and some humorous inventive Tarantino style moments, including a penis shaped gun (barrel and two side chambers in Sex Machine's crotch), a dead torso as a guitar, and of course, a very sexy dance by Hayek, which was number 3 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments. Very, very good!</fullReview>
