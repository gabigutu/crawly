		<shortDescription>A forgotten classic which should be re-evaluated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me this wonderful rollercoaster of a film bears repeated pleasurable viewings. Its about the tangled lives of three very different people. Holly Hunter is the obsessive workaholic producer. Albert Brookes plays the unprepossessing but brilliant journalist. William Hurt is the affable but dumb new kid on the block, news anchor.The classical love triangle emerges with the stunningly witty and self deprecating Brookes in love with Hunter but she of course is attracted to Hurt.This film works on many levels. At the very least it is a brilliant comedy with the one liners flying so thick and fast that each viewing bears a new harvest of ones that you may have missed last time. Its also a film about attraction and unfulfilled romance.But perhaps most importantly the film examines the modern obsession with physical appearance and its ultimate triumph over intellect as a valued human attribute. This is personified by the meteoric career success of the Hurt character in contrast to Brookes relative decline.Despite being fifteen years old the film has some startingly relevant messages about modern news values and the continuing decline in journalistic standards.This film is a classic in every sense and it is difficult to understand why it has been so neglected</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smart scripting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>BROADCAST NEWS marks the first time I saw Holly Hunter and I was mesmerized at her focus, quickness, passion, and finally her eccentric prettiness and sex appeal. The movie is hers from start to finish, and makes the 'love triangle' subplot almost unnecessary. She's so smart in the film (a rarity for a lead female) that you almost think if her only romantic choices are William Hurt's style-but-no-substance anchor or Albert Brooks's neurotic but intellectually arrogant reporter, she'd be better off with Robert Prosky. Though I can best relate to Albert Brooks (the guy who loves the smart, alluring girl who only sees him as a 'brother'), he still ticked me off a bit. My favorite scene in the film is him pouring his heart out to Hunter on a front porch confessing his love, then taking her by surprise and kissing her romantically (the only time he gets the chance). When he goes petulant later in the story, it's a bit hard to take. Fortunately, the James Brooks script and direction are a joy throughout, culminating in two perfect scenes: one with Joan Cusack unraveling seconds before a tape feed, and a marvelous 360 (?) pan thru the studio showing a live news feed from producer to anchor in one shot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of My Favorite Comedies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is one of my favorite comedies of all time. The dialog is crisp, the pace is fast. Not only is this a clever comedy, this is an interesting look at what goes on behind the scenes in the television news business.There are so many funny lines...a couple of my favorites:Ernie Merriman: (sarcastically) It must be nice to always believe you know better, to always think you're the smartest person in the room. Jane: (seriously) NO, it's not, it's awful!!Aaron: He must be good looking Jane: How do you know that? Aaron: No one invites a bad looking idiot to their room!The performances of Holly Hunter, Albert Brooks, and William Hurt were absolutely brilliant! Even years later, I remember this movie well. Often forgotten is the wonderfully funny Joan Cusack! I love the scene where the newsroom personnel are racing to beat a deadline. There are so many funny scenes that it's hard to pick a favorite. I highly recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sadly true and great.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I say sadly because if you see this movie now, you realize how low our media has sunk- all the warning signs are in this movie.It's a great film, I think the last great James Brooks film, but others may disagree. It has rich characters (who are believable as well), great acting, great writing, and although the music got a little cheesy, I even liked that.William Hurt has never been better. Holly Hunter is stunning. And Albert Brooks walks away with every scene he's in- this triangle of people is beautifully drawn and compelling and made the whole movie soar above it's vital and important topic of the News, and how it's slowly being compromised in our nation.Watch this with NETWORK for a truly fun and frightening evening.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm sitting around going through movie listings and not really seeing anything I want to see. My appetite keeps saying, "Something like BROADCAST NEWS." That's what I want. Something smart and funny, with adult ideas and great acting and writing, and a directorial style that doesn't call attention to itself. This may well be Hurt's best performance (is this or THE BIG CHILL, to my mind): however eccentric, Hurt is smart, and to play an unintelligent person without making sure -- wink wink -- the audience knows -- wink wink -- hey, I'M not stupid... well, that's fine acting right there. Hunter is note-perfect, and Albert Brooks is a revelation. (And he can read and sing at the same time!) Great, great work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The World of Network News...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>BROADCAST NEWS brings the world of network television newscasts to the screen in a very realistic way--where ratings rule and flash wins out over substance and the "charisma" of the anchor who brings us the news is seen as more important than the news itself.The film was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture and acting nominations for each of the three leads. Amazingly, no statuettes were achieved.Holly Hunter deservedly won an Oscar six years later for THE PIANO, but her portrayal of Jane Craig, the no-nonsense producer for the Washington News Bureau, is perhaps her most memorable performance.Craig is an "old-school" newswoman who came up the hard way, by being a good reporter. She is disturbed over what is happening in the broadcast industry as she sees quality being sacrificed over the battle for good ratings with a cheap pricetag. Hard on her peers in her demands for excellence, even against the flow of pressure in the other direction, she manages to turn everybody off, including potential relationships. Whenever she's alone with her thoughts, even for a moment, Jane breaks down in tears, then is incredibly able to go right back into a professional mode at a moment's notice.William Hurt is Tom Grunick, the young newscaster with no experience but plenty of good looks--and, after all, that's what the public wants. Tom finds himself attracted to Jane, but she is at first upset with what she perceives is his undeserved success. Tom Grunick is exactly what Jane Craig has been campaigning against.Later, though, even Jane succumbs to Tom's charm, much to the dismay of newswriter Aaron Altman, played by Albert Brooks.Altman is the antithesis of Grunick--a gifted journalist who really knows his stuff, but lacks the presence and confidence that Tom displays before the cameras--and he's been secretly in love with Jane for years.Brooks is one of the funniest actors of all-time. When the station starts to cut back in personnel to cut expenses, Brooks' character, Altman tries to save his job by trying out for the weekend anchor position. In the middle of the newscast, Altman breaks out in the worst case of "flop-sweat" in history--"Even Nixon didn't sweat this much."Frustrated when he sees Tom getting ahead of him career-wise as well as winning the affections of Jane, Aaron pours out his heart to her, calling Tom 'the devil.' "He'll be attractive, he'll be nice and helpful...he'll get a job where he influences a great God-fearing nation...he'll never do an evil thing, he'll never deliberately hurt a living thing...he'll just bit by little bit lower our standards where they're important...just a tiny little bit.........and he'll get all the great women."In the end, Jane finally recognizes Tom for the phony he really is, but that doesn't stop him from going all the way to the top. Altman, rather than compromise his standards, leaves the Washington Bureau and goes to work at a small station in the Pacific Northwest where he will be appreciated. Years later, they all meet again and find they've come to accept each other and how they fit in the grand scheme of things.Anyone who has spent any time in the broadcast industry will recognize some of the inner workings of this crazy business--and will be able to laugh and cry right along with Jane and Tom and Aaron.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clever, witty and funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James L. Brook is one of those directors who always seems to take a quirky look at life. He isn't only the producer for "The Simpsons," he has some classic comedies under his belt -- "Broadcast News" is one of them.Although it doesn't match his later effort "As Good As It Gets," "Broadcast News" is still a very clever, funny and witty movie about a television broadcasting station and all the problems they suffer. There's a great comedic sequence of physical humor where Joan Cusack is running around the building trying to rush a news tape to the editing room in a matter of mere minutes before it is to be broadcast live on TV.This isn't only very truthful in terms of how hectic broadcasting stations are operated, but also a skillful and honest portrayal of human beings.A low-key, subtle movie with good acting (especially from Hurt, who I don't always like so much) and apt direction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beware of TV news!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Essential viewing for anyone who watches TV news as it may help to become a little more sceptical, or even cynical. On a personal note I recall taking a course some years ago about being interviewed for TV - what to do, what not to do. The course instructors impressed on us that TV news was a "branch of show-biz". That depressing view, which is probably even more valid today than when it was made, is reinforced by this film. Never mind journalistic integrity, what counts is the ability to look good and smile nicely. And make sure you don't sweat on camera.The interactions between the three main characters form the centre-piece, each with his or her own ambitions, capabilities and beliefs. Brooks takes these differences and sets them into the volatile setting of a TV news studio, and adds more than a pinch of love interest to the mixture. The result is a complex, if somewhat overlong, portrayal of how we compromise every day in order to meet our ambitions and take others with us. It is always entertaining, although the final scene was, perhaps, unnecessary given everything that had gone before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Winner From James L. Brooks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Broadcast News" deals with news journalists who are all trying to keep their sanity in an insane business. William Hurt (Oscar-nominated) is the man who will do anything to become the head news anchor with his television network. He knows that the top anchor (Jack Nicholson) will be retiring soon and he must have that seat in front of the camera. Holly Hunter (also Oscar-nominated) is the smart producer who realizes that not everything in the news business is just black and white. Albert Brooks (Oscar-nominated as well) is the reporter who does not take anything too seriously. He is a great newsman, but does not have the drive or charisma to make a splash like Hurt does. This is definitely a black-comedy because the comedy comes to a screeching halt throughout the film to make way for heartrending drama that is both realistic and sometimes difficult to take. Brooks' screenplay is smart for the most part, but the film is flawed in several areas. Sometimes the direction is not clear. I think that Brooks was going for something like "Network". He comes close, but this film is in a lower class than that movie. The performances are top-notch. However, Jack Nicholson's token appearance is somewhat wasted here. He shows up for one or two minutes at a time and his character is never explored. More Jack Nicholson would have provided more insight into Hurt's character and his motives. Though flawed, "Broadcast News" is still a very good film that is a winner for the most part. 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intelligent, brightly written newsroom comedy...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>BROADCAST NEWS opens with a series of brief vignettes that are a clever way of starting a story about TV anchors who have no clue as to what they're reporting about.At a speech before a group of would-be reporters, all of whom are bored by her presentation, most of them leave. When the last one exits, the co-host of the event says quietly to HOLLY HUNTER: "I don't think there will be any Q&amp;A." Subtle line in a brilliantly written low-key comedy, a farce about the show biz aspect of TV anchoring.WILLIAM HURT is the inept news anchor who finds himself working with HOLLY HUNTER as the network anchorman. Hurt badly needs help in remedial reporting and Holly refuses to take the bait--at first. He knows he's only capable of looking good, but is not a reporter. He proves to be a quick study as long as his earpiece is working and he's getting all the straight info from executive producer Hunter.Holly's other anchor friend (ALBERT BROOKS) helps by feeding her information she passes on to Hurt. Of course she becomes conflicted about her feelings for ace reporter Brooks and equally strong attraction to the pretty-boy anchorman Hurt, who's having his own dalliance with a pretty staff member.You have to wait until twenty minutes before the film ends to find out which man she'll end up with. Brooks tells her that Hurt is the wrong one because he represents everything she's against. In this unpredictable comedy, there's no telling who Hunter (the neurotic heroine) will end up with.Fittingly, HOLLY HUNTER, WILLIAM HURT and ALBERT BROOKS were all nominated for Oscars (Brooks in supporting role), as was the film itself and director/writer James L. Brooks. All in all, seven well deserved Oscar nominations.The script doesn't opt for a conventional happy ending--and, in this case, that's the only flaw for the brilliant screenplay. I felt cheated and somewhat let down by the wistful conclusion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And now a word from our sponsors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Broadcast News" finds a spunky journalist, played by Holly Hunter, producing investigative news reports for a major news network. She's a motor-mouthed maverick, dazzlingly good at her job and with little time for romantic relationships. Enter William Hurt and Albert Brooks, two men who vie for her love.Brooks is an old-school journalist who adores Holly because she represents everything good about journalism. They both believe that the media exists to test the Gods with a hammer; to educate and fight for truth. Children of the sixties, they embody hippie values. They're defenders of the public good. Knights who fight valiantly with pen and camera. Hoo rah!William Hurt, in contrast, is a far more complex character. Initially awkward, clumsy and self-depreciating, he gradually reveals himself to be a sexy, slimy and manipulative high achiever, adept at climbing the corporate ladder. Unlike Holly and Brooks, he's symbolic of modern media values: media as spectacle, journalism as entertainment, news anchor as celebrity, truth as subject to editing board. You want to despise Hurt and his blip-time, junk food journalism, but can't quite manage it. He's playing the game by its own rules. Do we condemn him for lacking a moral backbone? Do we condemn the game? Why have characters like him evolved? This isn't Chayefsky's "Network", and so the film never bothers to answer or raise these questions. Content to keep things on the level of light comedy, it ends with Hurt being promoted to London Division and Brooks being booted to a tiny community network. Holly, having rejected both men, remains caught between them. The last bastion of media integrity, this spunky reporter remembers her roots, mourns the loss of Brooks and warns herself to be on the guard of future William Hurts.It's a cute ending, but compared to "Network" the film seems positively trite. Chayefsky's vision is one in which global media, despite its ubiquity, offers less meaningful information. He foresees a world in which globalisation has homogenized cultures, information has become subject to corporatisation and a handful of media monopolies control all international news. This is a world in which the truth is subject to shareholder meetings and economic interests. A world in which viewer ratings determine content and opinion polls dictate top stories. Perhaps this is why "Broadcast News", which longs for the glory days of journalism, ends on such a bittersweet note. It knows what the future holds. Made in 1987, its been living it for at least a decade.Today, in the digital age, things are even worse. Mergers and acquisitions have left a very small number of massive firms dominating the communication landscape. With this has come the hyper-commercialism of content, the barrier between the creative/editorial side and the commercial side having all but collapsed. Yes, today everyone might be able to start their own blog or website, but these are grass roots affairs. As the communication reach of the individual increases the size of the individual's world increases likewise. Voices must project both further and louder, battling, perhaps with futility, that deafening white noise, the incessant verbal static of the global community.8/10 ? A witty script, some funny moments and a brief cameo by Jack Nicholson elevate "Broadcast News" somewhat. Interestingly, unlike most films about the media, it never dips into satire, and instead plays things as a straight love triangle.Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Smart Romance, A Funny Comedy and A Sly Satire, in short: A Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Broadcast News {dir. James L. Brooks, 1987} ****/**** Although it lacks the emotional punch of Brooks's debut feature, (Terms of Endearment) Broadcast News is a superlative film, with exceptional performances from each of the three leads and a script that feels as genuine and well-researched as a hard-hitting news report. Let it be known, this is a character film first and foremost and a satire second. In my mind it succeeds on both levels on its own terms. The film's characters are given surprising depth and dimension , while the satire remains sly and never bitter. Comparisons to Network are unnecessary because the films have two completely separate goals and attitudes. While also a great film, Network is a cynical and weary work; in other words, its mad as hell and fed up with the state of television. Network's style of satire feels more extreme and guerrilla. In contrast, the characters populating the news rooms of Broadcast News love and live for their jobs (sometimes to the detriment of their love lives.) They derive pleasure from the stresses and satisfactions of news reporting, just as the audience derives pleasure from watching this sweet and romantically realistic masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Film of 1987</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not only do I think this was the best film of 1987, it's probably in my own amorphous list as one of the 10-20 best films I've ever seen. For whatever reason, I really connected with this movie, and it is one of the most personal films I had seen at that point in my life (I was 26). For better or worse, I strongly identified with the Holly Hunter character (and I'm a guy!). She plays an extremely bright, loyal and intense woman who couldn't figure out romantic relationships. There were so many things that she said in this movie that were things that I would say or have said to others in similar circumstances. And the ending of the movie I find to be so very, very sad.Obviously, this role was the big break for Holly Hunter. Clearly, I was not the only one to think so highly of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My brief review of the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although significantly overlong, the film's content stands up quite well for the most part, with an interesting and informative insight into television news broadcasting and great characters. James L. Brooks has created three bubbly, fascinating and very human characters, and it is interesting to follow them around and monitor the love triangle relationship that exists between them. The actress and actors selected to play these characters are superb choices, although William Hurt and Albert Brooks do more with their roles than Holly Hunter. The film is however not without its share of drawbacks, even if the overall picture still works well. It bridges on the edge of being conventional romantic comedy, and the maudlin music choices are no help. It is also a bit over-the-top at times, and in particular Joan Cusack overplays her part. The main problem though is the ending, which does not wrap up the tale in a very satisfying manner. With solid acting and excellent characters, the film can be enjoyed despite any possible imperfections for the most part, and some of the office and studio sequences are quite exciting and intense, in the spirit of news races against time. Nominated for the 1987 Best Picture Oscar, it is certainly one of the best films of the year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Aaron Altman (Albert Brooks) was picked-on as a South Boston kid and a smart hard-news reporter. Jane Craig (Holly Hunter) is an obsessive talented workaholic TV news producer. They both pine for real news. Tom Grunick (William Hurt) had trouble learning in school. He gets the job as the new anchor in the Washington bureau. Jane finds herself falling for Tom despite her views.The great thing in this movie is that all three people are appealing and the actors inject their characters with humanity. Brooks is fast talking neurotic hilarity. Hunter is so wound up that she's almost vibrating. Hurt is so likable that the audience doesn't root against him. The dialog is sharp. The story is insightful. There is great broad comedy as well like Joan Cusack's run. This is one of the best romantic comedies about broadcast news.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Broadcast News is a sterling example of the right script and cast coming together in perfect harmony. A romance blooms between a green anchor (William Hurt; this was a great period for the actor), coming up from Sports, and television broadcast news producer (Holly Hunter; she has hardly ever been better) while both are rising professionally in their young careers in a DC station. Journalist Albert Brooks (proving he can tackle drama as well as comedy; melding both exceptionally) is stuck in a rut at the station, wanting desperately to progress, both in terms of broadcasting the news (his writing and reporting aren't disputed, but his anchoring the news is) and a relationship with Hunter. The whole point, besides emphasis on integrity in the news and being authentic and real as a person, is the love triangle that splits Hunter in two directions. Hurt proves to be less as sincere/ethical as she hoped (this pointed out by Brooks, in regards to a piece on date rape, through the use of a camera to capture crocodile tears), while Brooks can be so brutally honest with her in how he feels that she is sometimes taken aback by his reactions/replies to her acknowledgment of feelings for Hurt. Excelling as a news anchor due to his ability to broadcast and interview while in front of the camera with relative ease, skill, and poise, Hurt's career is on the uptick while Brooks' time at the station seems to be drawing to a close (a disastrous anchor night where he sweats profusely could very well be the death knell); these developments further add melodrama and tension to their relationship with Hunter. The love triangle dynamic isn't hard to digest because the characters are equipped with organic dialogue and situations determined by day-to-day factors faced every day in network news broadcasting (particularly, the messy process of putting together news packages and stories and sudden unemployment/layoffs), and rough transitional phases that happen when people fall hard for each other, trying the best they can to confront these feelings, often resulting in hurt and disappointment. My favorite scene has Brooks and Hunter discussing her feelings for Hurt and Brooks' feelings for Hunter; he tells her to get out of his house, then calls her back afterward (it's saying something out of anger, realizing that response is real but misguided, trying to rectify it immediately instead of allowing this to walk out the door without proper resolution). Hurt's first big anchor behind the news desk (a Libyan incident) with Hunter guiding him through it, and lots of busy activity behind the scenes is a real doozy. Robert Prosky is wonderful as Hunter's mentor; when Hunter must replace him, and he is "retired", it is crushing to her because she is supposed to be happy with such a promotion yet the anguish of his departure leaves mixed emotions, to say the least. Jack Nicholson is the big-shot main anchor whose place Hurt will be groomed to eventually take. The station layoffs, with several employees packing up and moving on, is really tough to watch. Joan Cusack, as Hunter's harried aid, is a delight. If you enjoy smart romantic dramedies and a look at the inner-workings of a news station, give this one a spin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Mary Tyler Hunter Show.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you liked highly successful "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" on television, you'll love this movie. It's brought to you by the same people, many of the same personality traits peep through the new performers, the budget is bigger, and the ending is the same.Holly Hunter, as someone said, is cute as a button -- and she's petite and sexy too, a lot more so than Mary Tyler Moore, who was raised in a nunnery. Would Mary Tyler Moore try to seduce a handsome stranger and, when that fails, rip off her pantyhose and fling them away in frustration. No. No, Mary Tyler Moore would not do that, whereas Holly Hunter would and does.The males that figure in the story are both attracted to Holly Hunter for obvious reasons. William Hurt is handsome, pleasant, but a bit vacuous. Albert Brooks is plain, neurotic, and brainy. Brooks has a hilarious scene. The threat of mass firings hangs in the air and he wants to anchor the news for the first time in years. As the moment approaches he turns into a neural shambles, and as he proceeds his carefully prepared clothing becomes soaked through with sweat. "Is this normal?", he asks the crew, opening his jacket to show a shirt that suggests he just climbed out of a swimming pool.As in the TV show, the humor and the slight drama are based on interactional nuances. There's a brief but keenly perceived argument about whether a rebel should remove his boot if the TV crew prompt him to do so. There are a couple of cuss words -- this being a feature film and not a TV episode -- and Hurt cops a smooth feel of one of Hunter's appealing breasts, but there's nothing coarse about the humor, and the drama hints at disappointment, never at tragedy.It's a gentle story, but it's contrived too. It's impossible to believe that producer Holly Hunter, who has been in the business for years, will break off her budding relationship with William Hurt just because he faked a tear during an interview with a rape victim. Hell, any moron glued to the nightly news must assume that something like that goes on all the time.There are a few minor structural weaknesses. Near the beginning, when a tape is need at once for broadcast during the news, Joan Cusack grabs it and runs a long obstacle course to get it to the control room just in time for a staff member to whip it out of her hand and insert it into the slot so it plays immediately. Cusack is panting and almost collapses with relief but the audience hasn't been properly set up for the scene. It comes too early, before we have a chance to begin rooting for the team's success.That's carping though. It's an entertaining film. It ought to amuse everyone with its everyday familiarity and it should offend no one. That's entertainment, right? Just like the news.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>James L. Brooks 'Broadcast News' is a romantic-comedy, about three ambitious workaholics, who are set loose in a network TV newsroom where their professional &amp; lives, somehow, become, hopelessly cross-wired.Brooks has made an outstanding film in here. I felt so good, so lively while watching this 132-minute long feature. It's such a humane &amp; mature story, it talks about the emotions each person goes through some-where down in their lives. Brooks has made gems in 'Terms Of Endearment' &amp; 'As Good As It Gets', but 'Broadcast News' easily ranks as his finest &amp; most wonderful film to date.Performances in any James L. Brooks are nothing lesser than awe-inspiring. And in here, each and every performance packs a solid punch. William Hurt is impeccable. Has Hurt ever given a dull performance? Holly Hunter is so so wonderful. She lives her character so beautifully. Albert Brooks proves his caliber as an actor in here. He really rips it up! Robert Prosky is terrific! Joan Cusack &amp; Christian Clemenson are super. Jack Nicholson in a brief cameo, gets it right.On the whole, Do I need to say anything more? Do yourself a favor - watch this film, it's worth your time and well even your DVD money. Two Big Thumbs Up!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been over 20 years since I've seen this film. Like others on this site, I lament how 'forgotten' it is. I remember liking it a lot, but found it to be absolutely terrific. The writing and direction are first-rate, but I cannot remember seeing three interwoven performances as good as these. It's easy to minimize Hurt's work because his character is the least likable of the three. That would be a mistake. Hurt is wonderful here and leaves us wondering if maybe he's not as dim as he appears to be. Hunter and Brooks, on the other hand, just shine. This is career defining work for all of them. The ending (which I won't reveal here) is powerful in the least-clichéd way possible. The movie has aged very well. See it if you can - either again or for the first time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Film (Albert Brooks is Fantastic)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you have not seen this late 80s film about the the Washington Bureau of a Network News station than I highly recommend it. It is a sad commentary on the direction of news reporting in this country but tells the story with wit. The characters are well developed and Albert Brooks performance is fabulous. He delivers all his lines with entertaining understated comedy. I am not an Albert Brooks fan at all so this was a welcome surprise. I have a friend who works as a producer for a local news station and he advised that this is close to reality so kudos to the films writer and director for doing their research.Fun movie with a lot of insight into the World of Network News. It is not nearly as dark as another movie I also recommend in the same genre 'Network'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From producer/writer/Golden Globe nominated director James L. Brooks (Terms of Endearment, As Good as It Gets) this is a really good satirical comedy film showing behind the scenes in the life of a news reporter/anchor/journalist or producer might be like. Basically Jane Craig (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Holly Hunter) falls for new reporter Tom Grunick (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated William Hurt), but correspondent Aaron Altman (Oscar nominated Albert Brooks) also has strong feelings for her. The network prepares for big changes, and sparks will fly with all members of the studio. Also starring Jack Nicholson as anchor Bill Rorich, Moonraker's Lois Chiles as Jennifer Mack, Mrs. Doubtfire's Robert Prosky as Ernie Merriman, School of Rock's Joan Cusack as Blair Litton, Peter Hackes as Paul Moore, Christian Clemenson as Bobby, Robert Katims as Martin Klein, Ed Wheeler as George Wein and Stephen Mendillo as Gerald Grunick. The comedy is subtle but strong, the romance has its moments, and it is certainly a believable situation film. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen and Best Picture, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical and Best Screenplay - Motion Picture. It was number 64 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The television news business, half a sharp, friendly satire and the other half a deadly serious drama about thirty-somethings struggling to find love and meaning in their lives. A lopsided romantic triangle consisting of a spunky female news producer, a shallow anchorman, and a scruffy, amiable reporter runs hot and cold as each of the participants take turns one-upping each other. Despite good performances (including an unbilled Jack Nicholson as a network Big Fish) and a literate screenplay, the characters are truly too old to be acting like such lovestruck juveniles. Writer-director James L. Brooks proves to be a bit shallow himself, though he knows his way around a strong dramatic sequence and understands this milieu incredibly well. Unfortunately, the boy-girl stuff eventually cancels out the funny office in-jokes, leading to a flat, dispiriting conclusion wherein nobody gets what they want. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

The dumbing down of network news is even more of an issue now than it was in 1987. Remember, this was pre-cable! So satisfying to care about complex people attempting to achieve complex goals -- and it all moves along with lightning speed. Such a true to life depiction of friendships that teeter toward romance. See if you can spot John Cusack as the angry messenger! And do you recognize Peter Hackes from real life Broadcast News?

		<fullReview>I don't really know when it was that TV stations began preferring to have handsome men as their reporters - regardless of the mens' IQs - but it was clearly a problem by the time that "Broadcast News" came out, and the movie does a really good job looking at it. Portraying a love triangle between pretty boy air-head reporter Tom Grunick (William Hurt), intelligent but nervous reporter Aaron Altman (Albert Brooks) and producer Jane Craig (Holly Hunter), the movie pulls no punches. Probably the best line in the movie is when Tom says something like: "I don't really understand any of what I'm reporting." And in the era of FOX News and such things, a movie like this becomes even more important.All in all, definitely a movie that I recommend. Also starring Robert Prosky, Lois Chiles, Joan Cusack, and Jack Nicholson in a supporting role as the anchorman.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had the same problem with this as I had with - amongst others - "Terms of Endearment" &amp; The "Big Chill"...They all contain characters who are intelligent, which is a plus, but there's no WARMTH to them; it's all a massive game of one-upmanship concerning who can prove that they're more 'switched-on' than the rest... Intelligent, but self absorbed clueless schmucks, the lot of them... If these accurately represent the middle-classes in America, then I want nothing to do with them.Give me characters I hate, because at least then they're giving you back some kind of energy, even if it's a negative vibe... Here, the characters were dull because they were defined by their job, and how it made them see themselves, so I never wanted to spend any time with them. People are interesting when we get to see who they truly are - whether good or bad. This is not that type of film, because of the type of environment they're in, these folk are constantly posturing for other people instead of relaxing and being who they really are.It's an interesting commentary on the type of behaviour it takes to succeed, I suppose... I just didn't see why I should care when it was all fake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good satire and spin take on broadcast news and network life as it blends with life, love, and changes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally after many years watched this 1987 film "Broadcast News" and it was done and paced well as most James L. Brooks(as he directed) films are. It's a look and take on the world of news that of a network news wing and it's blends work with the life and times of the central characters involved. Holly Hunter is good as an eager headstrong and direct news producer who will work around the clock to get a news story on the news as she tries to get stories true to the times and make it a ratings hit! On the side William Hurt is proper and a little arrogant as the head news anchor who will have his life turned upside down. And Albert Brooks is humble and hard working as an up and coming want to be news star who's just a reporter it's like he's behind the scenes.Aside from seeing the behind the scenes and inner working of news and breaking stories in the room the film blends with the relationships and love life's of the central characters and it's nice to see the legendary Jack Nicholson with some cameo work as the top nightly news anchor and the attractive Lois Chiles as a sexy news reporter who has a one night stand with William Hurt's character. Thru it all this film is about life, work, and change as in the end all of the characters reach a wrap in their own life it's like a new start a new beginning. Overall pretty good film that keeps interest and it's chemistry between the central characters keeps the film at bay and the performances from all involved are real and heartfelt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Broadcast News provides a great view into the world of TV and the life of a journalist. The only thing that I didn't like is that sometimes the love triangle got in the way of that. Jane is this strong, smart woman and she almost gives up everything she believes in for a guy that lies to her. I didn't really like either of her options though. Tom seemed a little sketchy and Aaron was just kind of a jerk. The ending was strange, and I wasn't really expecting it. I think it was a good ending but it was a bit abrupt. Like they laid out this plot and this love triangle, break it to smithereens, then don't follow up? We meet Tom's new girl but we don't end up meeting Jane's new guy or Aaron's wife. There were a lot of little things in the movie that I liked a lot. How Jane always had a way to tell the taxi driver to go, how it had it's funny moments, but also sadder moments. It definitely wasn't what I was expecting, but I was pleasantly surprised.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For being in a love triangle, Aaron sure is a square.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie started strongly, but every scenes made me more and more frustrated with the characters. It's confusing as to whether the focus of the movie is the love triangle or Jane's career. Aaron has a lot of really funny one-liners, but that's about the only redeeming quality he has. He claims to be "fighting" for his relationship with Jane, but she's growing apart from him and he only seems to be pushing her farther away. They appear to have been in a relationship for a while, but they seem more like just coworkers than a couple. Jane is falling in love with Tom, but Tom seems to be confused by what Jane wants. Jane is dismissive of him one moment, and in love with him the next. Jane's willingness to throw away her relationship with Aaron and commit to a new relationship only further confuses the plot. The whole time, the audience feels like Jane will have to choose between the two. It doesn't seem like a fair fight. Aaron seems aggressive, sarcastic, unappreciative, rude, and uncaring. Tom seems to sweep Jane off her feet and show her a life away from caring about every little detail. The end of the movie was the most disappointing part. At the end of the movie, she doesn't choose either man, both men move on, and she alludes to having a different boyfriend. The characters all remain unchanged. I enjoyed the twists and turns of the story as it unfolded, and I really appreciated the look into the world of broadcasting. The stressful, high-stakes nature of journalism was shown clearly. It was interesting to see examples of stories going from ideas to the final cut. Overall, as frustrating as the characters were, they were very real. This is a movie I actually might watch again.</fullReview>

Though at first the characters seem to embody boring stereotypes (the insufferable know-it-all, the handsome guy who is unfortunately not very bright, and the control freak), you soon learn that there's a lot more to these characters than meets the eye. Throughout the movie you never quite knew how they would react to the twists and turns that come with working in a news station (or the ones that come with a complicated love triangle). "Broadcast News" is as entertaining and face paced as any newsroom can be just before a deadline.</fullReview>

The movie has a great cast besides Hurt and Hunter but it also includes Albert Brooks in a great supporting performance, and Jack Nicholson (who isn't credited for his role but he still has a bit part in the film. Not only Broadcast News is a well done picture it also takes you behind the scenes of how news shows are done by the crew (like for all news networks). Director James L. Brooks really knows how news shows are done from behind the scenes just like how Sidney Lumet did it with his 1976 classic Network. Broadcast News is just like Sidney Lumet's Network and one thing they have in common is that both of those films were well acted out. This was a great movie that people can watch over and over.A definite A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Broadcast News (1987) I haven't seen this movie in probably 10 years or so, but I still know it by heart.Brilliant movie by James L. Brooks. Fantastic writing, direction and acting. Holly Hunter and Albert Brooks are brilliant and well deserve their Oscar nomination. Joan Cusack is also fantastic in a role that is minor, but probably one of her best. I can't believe the movie wasn't nominated for direction. Very good editing, too.The movie revolves behind the scenes of a news broadcast team, but it's much more than that. It's about relationships, the unfairness of life and the way people made different decisions, many times against logic and influenced by other factors. Life is not fair and it doesn't always end with a happy ending like in the movies.The movie is extremely funny, but it handles serious issues. Some scenes are just brilliant work of writing and acting; there are too many to list here, so I'll just mention the confrontation between Brooks' character and Hunter's at his house, which is one of my favorites.Notice real-life composers Marc Shaiman and Glen Roven's cameo in a brilliant "news theme" scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The News And The People Who Sell It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Broadcast News is the story of the selling of news broadcasting and the people doing the selling both behind and in front of the camera. The talent it takes to be a good reporter isn't necessarily what people want in front of the camera as everyone discovers in this cast.Frankly they should have known already by 1987. When I was a lad I well remember the competition among the three networks when we did not have widespread cable stations with Walter Cronkite for CBS, Frank Reynolds for ABC, and the inimitable and alliterative team of Huntley and Brinkley for NBC. Just as the competition in the entertainment field remains fierce, each Network was looking for its share of the news audience as well. All of these anchors who became celebrities in their own right were the product of exhaustive searches by their employers for the right person for Mr.&amp;Mrs. America to feel comfortable with. Radio success did not guarantee television success. Gabriel Heatter was the most famous of radio newscaster did not score on television. And until he narrated The Untouchables, Walter Winchell who invented the phrase Mr.&amp;Mrs. America was a total flop on television.We demand of our anchors to be both calming and authoritative which the good looking William Hurt was able to project. His rival was news reporter Albert Brooks, a brilliant journalist but who was no good in front of the camera. They're not just rivals for a job, but also rivals for producer Holly Hunter.Interesting that a woman is not yet a news anchor in 1987, today one would be considered if not hired. Hunter's glass ceiling is behind the camera. She despises the trend toward entertainment in television, but she both has a thing for William Hurt and knows that Brooks blows it when he gets his big chance as an anchor. Brooks in the meantime has a big old crush on Hunter which makes a strained atmosphere at the work place.Hurt is introspective enough to know he's getting by on looks. He's a sports reporter when we first meet him and that's usually where people start. Some pretty important careers on television, radio, and the print media started with sports coverage. Hey, no one ever said Howard Cosell got by on his looks and charm.Broadcast News got nominated for Oscars in seven categories including Best Picture, Best Actor for William Hurt, Best Actress for Holly Hunter, and Best Supporting Actor for Albert Brooks among them. It did not however cop one statue at the award ceremony. It is an entertaining and introspective look at some lives and careers of those who bring us the events of the day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intelligent and well-acted satire and rom-com</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>TV News producer, Jane Craig (Hunter) meets Tom Grunick (Hurt), an up-and-coming news presenter, at a seminar, and their mutual attraction takes them back to her room. Romance, however, is cut short, when it emerges that Tom is, in his own words, "no good at what I'm being a success at", and Jane realises he personifies everything she hates about where TV news is going. The rub comes when Tom reveals he is about to join her news bureau in Washington.Jane and Tom's initial attraction is therefore given a second chance, but will Jane be able to put aside her professional opinion of the man she finds herself attracted to - and should she? Aaron Altman (Brooks) is Jane's highly intelligent reporter colleague and confidante. Despite his obvious talent, Aaron's career is stalling as he lacks the confidence and people skills - and the classic good looks - to be the success that his new, less qualified and less intelligent colleague - Tom - is becoming. He is also concerned that his good friend Jane maybe falling in love with Tom, despite her better judgement, as it becomes increasingly clear that Aaron has his own romantic feelings for her.This central romantic plot is set within the trials and tribulations of a TV news network office, where moral dilemmas and ethics are wrestled with quickly and where appearances and dramatic effect are becoming more prevalent and important.This is where most of the bite comes from with well-observed comment and scenes. One of many moments is a scene where Tom meets the Network's top anchorman, Bill Rorich (a cameo role for Jack Nicholson), for the first time, and the camera focuses on their handshake. In a film full of great lines and dialogue, long and short, you realise a lot about these two men's character from this one quick shot of two hands.The dialogue between characters is amongst the most intelligent and witty you are ever likely to find anywhere on film and in such abundance. Brooks gets the best portion of them, in line with his character, but even the briefest conversations that are incidental and perhaps over-heard by one or more of the characters as they move through a crowded room, should be listened to.Hunter is a tour-de-force in this role for which she was rightly (and not alone) nominated for an Oscar, and for which she probably would have got if it was for a role in a film that didn't mock part of what had become a closely related industry - and against a strong performance from another actress in a more traditional feel-good, rom-com.Brooks is also excellent as the constantly frustrated and occasionally too-smug-for-his-own-good, Aaron Altman.Hurt, whilst possessing the looks and providing the personality required of his character, does not always convince that he is quite as dim-witted the character says he is or is supposed to be. He displays a latent intelligence that enables him to make the most of his apparent limitations, which may be plausible, but I don't think Hurt quite pulls it off. Apart from when he tells us he "stinks" or "doesn't get it", Hurt comes across as a bit smarter than that. Otherwise it is an effective performance, in a role where his character is compromised by its intellectual limitations, but Brooks and Hunter slightly overshadow Hurt's performance. It is the only negative thing I can say about the whole film, and who is to say that anyone else would have done it better, or come off any better, when next to Hunter and Brooks and their performances in this movie.Support is ably provided by, amongst others, Robert Prosky, Lois Chiles and Joan Cusack, and there is also a bit-part role for Christian Clemenson of subsequent Boston Legal fame, and the briefest of bit-parts for Joan's brother, John Cusack, whose face you don't even see.James L Brooks has provided us with many great TV shows and movies, and this film should rank up there with the very best of them. It may not have won any Oscars, despite seven nominations, but it did win plenty of other awards, and turned Holly Hunter into a star.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was well put together. If one is to believe the behind-the-scenes stuff, how "readers" are updated and how everything is handled in the back room, it is very interesting. These are the best parts of the movie. Any movie that gives you insight into how something works is always of interest.For me, the movie dragged on in the "romance" and "comedy" areas. First, if you think you are going to get any laughs here, you'll be disappointed. The movie is not funny.As far as romance in concerned, although Holly Hunter does a great job with her character, who the heck would fall for such a self-absorbed weenie? "Jane" is not attractive, has no idea of other folks' feelings around her, and is simply career driven. She is a totally unpleasant character. Yet, Brooks and Hurt's characters can't seem to get enough of her. I especially thought her character nauseating when she admitted she was smarter than everyone else, and, at the conclusion of her first successfully produced show, there's a macro close up of her face turning to her co-workers and her drawling "Thankkkkk uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!" Yech. And Hurt and Brooks fawning all over her like she's God's gift gets really old really fast.The balance of the movie is an exercise in boredom. Scenes that go on and on after employees are laid off and packing up. Long scenes about jockeying for leftover positions. Heck, I've LIVED through those scenes, as did likely most readers here, why do I want to watch them for entertainment? If you have absolutely nothing to do, you might like watching this film.

Fortunately, they're few and far between.One-third social satire, one-third romantic comedy, one-third drama, with three flawed but endearing people at its core, it's smart and moving and almost impossibly funny. Holly Hunter in particular may never have been more fun to watch in a comedic role.

		<fullReview>Typically, I'm a comedy guy. I rented this at the video store under comedy, and thought "Albert Brooks! Awesome!" and rented it. It seemed like the romantic comedy, and I remembered I hated those, and had the full mindset of hating this movie.Boy, was I wrong.While this is a romantic comedy, it's acted by an amazing lead &amp; supporting cast (Brooks, Hunter, Cusack, and Nicholson), and everything works well within itself. The script sounds real and not forced, like this could be happening in the news station you're watching at night. It takes your emotions and makes you enjoy Hunter and Brooks and loathe Hurt, which makes the ending a bit unenjoyable and fruitless, but it shows how you don't need a happy ending to end a movie, you just need a truthful ending, which is what everyone got. Not everybody's life ends well, and it shows in Broadcast News. Maybe people don't like the ending because it's not your typical happy ending associated with romantic comedies... but it works, it's real, and it's genius. Broadcast News is a classic in it's time, and a fine romance movie up there with "Casablanca". Well, maybe not that high, but it's the only other romance I can think of that I like.Broadcast News: 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movie watchers often say great movies must have 3 memorablescenes to be considered truly great. Broadcast news doesn't havethree, it has twice that. This movie is extremely well written byJames Brooks. Holly Hunter and Albert Brooks have never beenbetter. I love this movie for many reasons. It is great because itmakes you laugh and it makes you cry. Albert Brooks has severalgreat lines and many unforgettable scenes: # 1(laughed) "I cansing and read, I am singing while I read," with Midnight Train toGeorgia playing in the background. # 2(laughed) Telling theWilliam Hurt character that "You really blew the lid off of nookie,"after watching Hurt's report on date-rape. #3 (Cried) When Aaron(A. Brooks) finally tells Jayne (Hunter) that he loves her and shecan't end up with Hurt's character because he representseverything about journalism Jayne finds dispicable. Finally, #4 (laughed) who can forget the scene where Aaronanchors the weekend news....hilarious. This movie should have won an Oscar! It has everything I love inmovies, great acting, intelligent script, and even a Jack Nicholsoncameo!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>News Flash: I Almost Fell Asleep While Watching It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I unfortunately had to watch this atrocity in my Journalism class, and I plan on never watching it again. I learned two things from this cinematic disaster: grabbing your lover's armpit with passion is uncomfortable for other people to watch and the ugly friend never gets the girl. Around 37% of the film contains either an awkward silence or a cringeworthy act of affection, such as Aaron kissing Jane on the shoulder and Tom groping Jane's chest in the middle of a public park. If you are forced against your will to witness this pathetic excuse of a movie, play a game that consists of blasting "Make Up Your Mind" by Deana Carter whenever Jane opens her mouth, because all you'll be missing is either a series of contradictory statements or one of her famous awkward silences. Jane's constant indecisiveness confirms that she is a disgrace to the female leads and heroines who confidently face our male-dominated society. Instead of coming off as a lovable goof, Jane comes off as emotionally unstable and psychotic. The ending was depressing and abrupt, which, in all honestly, didn't surprise me at all. The news aspect of the film was decent, but it could have been more informative. Overall, this movie was the cinematic equivalent to waiting in line at your local Target: nothing special.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brooks brilliantly combines comedy and drama.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Writer-director James L. Brooks is a filmmaker who is able to brilliantly combine comedy and drama with rich characters and unforgettable dialogue. Terms of Endearment and As Good As It Gets are his other two masterpieces (His 1994 I'll Do Anything is a good movie but a flawed one), but Broadcast News is his personal best. Brooks paints a savage, knowing, hilarious look at the television news industry and also what can happen to your personal life when your job consumes you. The performances are simply phenomenal. William Hurt gives depth to a dimbulb anchor, but Holly Hunter and Albert Brooks walk away with the movie. Hunter just dazzles with a fearless, emotionally intricate portrayal of a neurotic producer and Brooks is hilarious and poignant as the reporter who loves her. Brooks should also be credited for a realistic ending, a different and satisfying touch to a different and deeply satisfying movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predictable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having been in broadcasting for a few years during the era depicted in BROADCAST NEWS, I found the re-enactments of broadcast drama and production authentic and enjoyable. Beyond that, however, the movie is simply a mid-afternoon soap opera played out to a predictable conclusion. Like UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL, the broadcast / production scenes are authentic, and the rest is a girl-meets-boy (or boyS) melodrama that slowly unfolds into . . . nothing, really. To its credit, BROADCAST NEWS does manage to avoid the editorializing (about prisoner rights, etc.) that is found in UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL. The one flaw in BROADCAST NEWS is that Jane would have never chastised Tom for his "camera tricks" in the interview -- what he did was genuine; it was not unethical; and it was not even deliberately devious.I wouldn't say that the ending stinks, but it is flat and predictable. It is also abrupt. I think Brooks could have done better. Then again, the conclusion to TERMS OF ENDEARMENT (which I rank as perhaps the worst movie ever made) isn't anything surprising, either.William Hurt and his character are excellent; the other leads are drab and rather unlikeable. The supporting cast is great, however, and Jack Nicholson is absolutely outstanding in his small but crucial role. It's almost a shame Jack couldn't have a larger part.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will Never Ever Remember!???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this film at least 5 times but I never ever remember the end. This is because it is so forgettable. Why? It starts off well. The story is interesting and the three lead actors are superb, ...but Hunter's and Brooks' characters were very annoying. Makes a good soapy, full stop. Hunter is a neurotic woman with many many many hangups. Too many issues would signal halt at any pace to a guy but she's still being pursued by the two male actors. Brooks' character is the kind of smart-a** jerk-geek combo who we all can comprehend why he's usually beaten up in school. Rest assured, it's all self-inflicted. He's full of petty jealousy and lacking of any self respect. This is then topped with a high dosage of whiny self pity. The kind of person people loathe. Hurt is the overly nice guy who have resisted in putting Brooks through a wall. I still give it a 7/10 for acting but the 2 characters were so annoying that I never attempt to remember what the film was about. Hence, the vicious circle of re-viewing. Might be a plot of the director/script writer's to get me to watch it more than just once (which would have been ample).Having said that, I could remember some other films I have seen 20 years ago and could still see it over and over again and still enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a 80s movie about a TV news station. Maybe you expected some great investigation cases but here's it's not the subject : it's just about how competitive and seducing coworkers can do their job. I really like how this under pressure office can foster nice, close and genuine relationships between the team. However i don't understand why the movie is so dully written : characters don't talk clear and simple and after a time, it's really confusing ! The cast is great and Holly shows she can be a true manager. The faraway distant Nicholson is a funny add-on. At the end, even if the movie doesn't really delivers a hit, it's more entertaining than the dreadful « morning glory » that fails with everything the two movies share !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Broadcast This Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Broadcast News (1987): Dir: James L. Brooks / Cast: Holly Hunter, William Hurt, Albert Brooks, Joan Cusack, Jack Nicholson: Observant comedy that questions T.V. news as entertainment. It stars Holly Hunter as a news writer-producer of a Washington network who is always struggling to beat the deadlines and avoids outside interferences such as relationships. William Hurt is brought in as a sportscaster who lacks great education but because he looks good he is given the job. Hunter is not pleased with this but he is willing to learn. Albert Brooks plays one of the best reporters in the business who feels his spotlight fading because Hurt appears to be better in front of a camera than he is. He also loves Hunter but observes that Hurt is slowly gaining her favor. Beautifully written film about the news broadcasting world directed by James L. Brooks who previously made Terms of Endearment. All three leads are fantastic. Hunter the workaholic is caught in between professional and emotional feelings as limited Hurt progresses while skilled Brooks depreciates. It is a realistic view of the medium flawed only in that supporting roles could have been broader and more colorful. Jack Nicholson as a veteran anchor on the verge of retirement could have been broader. Terrific comedy about news and entertainment and the ability to tell the difference.

		<fullReview>We agreed that this movie had a lot of journalistic value. Jane, the main character, was very independent, which is inspiring not only to us but to others. She has an instinct for journalism and a deep respect for integrity within journalism. For example, when Tom pretended to cry during his date rape piece, Jane was offended and disgusted. As journalists today, we live in a world where the line between journalism and show business grows thinner with every story about the Kardashians. It was refreshing to see that a woman, just like us, not only cared about real news but cared about the people that the news is about, and her emphasis on honestly was inspiring. I'll definitely think about Jane and her strong convictions when I write my own stories. -Ellie &amp; Erin</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, I thought this movie was great. It was captivating and easy to keep up with. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to see the whole movie but the story still made sense. The love triangle between Tom, Aaron, and Jane was also quite interesting. Jane was in love with Tom but Aaron was in love with Jane. But the part that stood out most to me was the shoulder kiss. Jane came over to Aaron's home just for moral support and Aaron just had to go and made it awkward. A handshake or simple hug wasn't enough for Aaron, he just had to go and kiss her. But the real question is: Why the shoulder? What is significant about Jane's shoulder. I mean yes, she has nice shoulders but is it worth a kiss. If someone kissed my shoulder, I would be uncomfortable. Boyfriend or not, it is still weird. In addition, she was still in love with Tom. In conclusion, this movie gave the inside scoop on what journalism is really like and the places where you can kiss someone. I gave 7 stars because I think this movie deserves more recognition than it is getting.</fullReview>

Jane taught me that through hard work and perseverance, anything is possible. She worked hard her entire life to get to where she ended up at the end of the movie. Aaron taught me that sometimes even the things we want the most don't end up mattering in the end, because everything will turn out alright. And finally, Tom taught me that sometimes we all need a little help from other people. Although I personally wouldn't fake tears to get there, Tom ended up exactly where he wanted.

I thought it was strange that they all just met up at the end 7 years later and she wasn't with either of the two men. I thought the movie was funny and made me try to process all of the work a news station had to put into making one little clip.

		<fullReview>Very entertaining movie with some great journalism value! It keeps viewers interested with love interests and drama, while accurately representing what it is like to be a broadcast journalist by showing how much work goes into it and how stressful it is, but also shows how much the people doing it love it. It also brings attention to whether or not broadcast news should be purely news or a source of entertainment. This is a debate that journalists everywhere struggle with because if your news isn't entertaining, people most likely won't read it. On the other hand, if it is purely entertainment it might not be news. It also shows how important it is to have credibility as a reporter and for all of the news to be accurate and not tampered with (when Tom fakes the tear and Jane catches him in the end).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Broadcast News is an inside look on the busy lives of media broadcasters. This fast paced comedy shows what life is like working at a big television network. The romantic element between Jane Craig, Aaron Altman, and Tom Grunick adds drama to this comedy. Jain Craig is one of the best in the business. This hard working journalist always wants the best quality for her stories. One of her best friends, Aaron Altman, works alongside her at the studio. Although he is a good journalist, he is never promoted to be an anchorman because he does not have the appearance the audience likes. Unlike Aaron, pretty boy Tom Grunick is quickly promoted to be an anchorman because of his good looks but doesn't have the same passion as Aaron and Jane do for journalism. A funny story line, quality acting, and a fabulous 80s wardrobe make this movie a must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie did a fair job of entertaining me. The plot is decent and I like the insight into the world of journalism and the hectic workplace. The main characters are interesting, and I enjoyed following their emotional development throughout the film. They are complex, which is seen in how they deal with juggling love and work. I also appreciated small pieces of witty and clever comedy. In my opinion, though, the ending is what hurt the movie's overall value. The entire film follows a small "love triangle," and the viewer becomes attached to whichever side they may be rooting for. In the end, all of the three people involved have separate relationships. Well woohoo for them and all, but it leaves the audience with a feeling of dissatisfaction. The one thing I can advocate for this is that I think the movie did a nice job of being realistic. In the actual world couples don't always prevail all and live happily ever after. The movie demonstrates that sometimes things don't work out how you expect, but when watching a movie many people are hoping for entertainment rather than a buried philosophical life lesson.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quick summary of people and ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Besides being completely hilarious, the movie itself was kept in a realistic way. It is completely probable to have three people in a love triangle that work in the same place. And when a hard worker like Jane falls in love with a "pretty boy" like Tom, tough decisions need to be made. Work or love? And Aaron, God bless Aaron. He was passive aggressive for most of the movie; sure he was a "good guy," but he went about things in the wrong way. Tom, on the other hand, is way too passive and not ethical. He breaks journalistic rules to get the job done. Finally, Jane was just aggressive for about the entire movie. There was yelling and screaming, and when she didn't get her way, she blows up. It was probably for the best that none of them ended up together. Even though Jane and Tom were in love with each other, anyone can see that it was strained and that there were just too many arguments. And Aaron may have loved Jane, but she felt nothing in return besides platonic friendship. All in all, it was a cheesy, but happy ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although released in 1987, this movie still holds value for young journalists today. Mentioned by Tim Harrower in the college journalism textbook "Inside Reporting: A Practical Guide to the Craft of Journalism" as one of the Top Five Classic Journalism Movies, my students voted to watch it in class recently.After getting past the 1980s style and a quick removal of the scene that gave it an R rating in the late 80s, it was fun to watch teens of 2015 react and respond to the drama. They immediately wanted to form a Team Aaron and Team Tom - as they found Jane caught in her love triangle of sorts. Most students were interested in the behind-the-scenes workings of a broadcast newsroom and had questions about the contemporary newsroom. They had a hard time believing the friend-relationship and working-relationship that other reviewers have found so believable. Most found the ending to be quite "cheesy" but in discussion, the quest for news judgment and credible broadcast personalities is tangible even today. A equally important discussion with students was how to find a career that challenges but still completes you on all levels. The fact that Jane had 14 weeks of vacation built up was startling to a few students. Why would you not take a vacation you had offered to you by your boss? It could provoke an additional commentary on young people today about the value of a work ethic and the desire to devote yourself to cause that is bigger than your own love life.</fullReview>

In my opinion, the characters did not show relatable or realistic reactions to the conflict in their lives. Their anger and excitement especially seemed forced. I do not believe that the ending did a very good job of tying everything together. It seemed weak and rushed.

		<shortDescription>An American film by James L. Brooks about television especially television news when it used to make some sense !!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everybody knows that television is known as idiot box. Its reputation continues to decline largely due to its primary focus on puerile entertainment. It is only due to news related programs that to a certain extent television is considered to be an intelligent medium for the dissemination of information. American film 'Broadcast News' must be praised for the manner in which it honestly depicts the not so glamorous lives of TV anchors. In the past, television news was keenly followed by viewers all over the world. It is for this reason that director James L Brooks has been able to make a film which finds its echo on a global level. 'Broadcast News' is an intelligent film which takes into account some major events which created waves on international political scene circa 1987. Actors William Hurt, Holly Hunters and Albert Brooks play key roles as television news presenters in this film which also showed how a person's career choices are shaped by the childhood's experiences. Their performances indicate the fact that a clever man will always be able to charm a woman. A minor sub plot involving a delicate love affair remains in the background. It turns out to be very useful tool in measuring the depth of human emotions as people do not always remain same as circumstances force them to change. It is this film's key message which enables viewers to catch a glimpse of television's star personalities.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of These Love Triangles!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Broadcast News is a clever, witty, and often funny movie about the relationships of people within a job business, and this time we deal with the television news. This film is fast-paced and has some of the sharpest dialogs you'll see in an 80's film. The romantic triangle, the main focus of the film, doesn't seem forced as it comes to the viewer quite smoothly. It also gives the viewer a behind-the-scenes look on actually how the television news are produced, so that was pretty interesting to watch.James L. Brook's film is about this fast-talking producer who is big on ethics in television journalism. She falls in love with a big shot anchor who is charismatic but admittedly dumb. Her best friend, a brilliant reporter, reveals his love to Jane. In the end, are any of these two men good enough for Jane? The film has such fantastic acting. Holly Hunter gives a magnificent performance as Jane. It was funny to watch her daily emotional breakdowns. Albert Brooks gives a sharp performance and so does William Hurt as the two reporter rivals, Aaron and Tom. Also, Joan Cusack is very funny in one of her younger roles and finally, Jack Nicholson is excellent in his near "cameo." Overall, Broadcast News is an excellent film based on journalism and love. The movie is more of a romantic story, but there is also a theme regarding ethics and the changing landscape of news. The movie is very funny and the dialog is brilliant. I did not think highly of this film before watching it, but I should have known better as this is a James L. Brooks film. A fine, fast-paced comedy this film is. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I could not sink my teeth into this drama. It seemed the PC message trumped the entertainment quality. I like William Hurt in anything he does. Some of his movies are drab, while others are interesting. This particular movie was drab. Holly Hunter did an OK job, but the over-the-top, 'Bless Your Heart' southern accent is a bit too contrived. It actually got to the point where her voice was irritating to listen to. Come on, you would have thought a southern accent would have been easy for a girl spawned in Georgia. Albert Brooks was also good ? I guess. He is not an actor I knock down doors for, but he can act. I figure if I had any interest in the movie, I probably would have had interest in his character. Alas, I did not ? on either account. For me, the whole show was hum-drum. Apparently it has to be tough building a story around reporting the news. What seems timely and pertinent today either turns out to be old or boring news tomorrow?or maybe even an out and out lie. Of course these lies multiply astronomically during election years and are perpetrated by countless lapdog drones. So I sat through this personal torture, but am willing to grade this with some honesty. I will give this a 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not your usual romantic comedy moviegoer, but "Broadcast News" kept my attention more than most. The newsroom scenes were electrifying in their chaos, and I really liked the relationship between Holly Hunter and Albert Brooks. And the scene in which William Hurt schools Brooks on how to read the news was a highlight of the movie (you really wanted Albert to nail his shot at the big chair). And this movie's got one hell of an ensemble cast (with terrific bit parts for Joan Cusack and Jack Nicholson). Sometimes the movie was engrossing, but most of the time spent on Hunter and Hurt's hesitant dalliance tended to drag. Albert Brooks really was my favorite part of this movie (though Hunter was just as good), and I usually just waited for him to show up again. These are well-drawn characters, and the subject matter is adult, but I'm not sure when I'll ever give this a rewatch. 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>James L. Brooks wrote and directed this comedy drama that stars Holly Hunter as network news producer Jane Craig, who finds herself attracted to a new(and handsome) newscaster named Tom Grunick(played by William Hurt). Tom is, on one level, everything she hates about the growing trend in news television, a good-looking but phony and superficial dunce who isn't there on his talent. Albert Brooks plays fellow newscaster Aaron Altman, who has an unrequited crush on Jane, and resentment of Tom. Aaron feels he could be a news anchor, but his one and only chance at doing so does not go well... Jack Nicholson also stars in a small role as a retiring veteran news anchor that everyone looks up to.Funny and intelligent film is not as moving or memorable as Brook's previous "Terms Of Endearment", but still works as an insightful look at network news, and human relationships, which doesn't end in the traditional way, though is still believable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Feisty TV news producer Holly Hunter (as Jane Craig) desires dumb blond anchorman William Hurt (as Tom Grunick), but turns on non-telegenic reporter Albert Brooks (as Aaron Altman). Although it didn't win any of its seven "Academy Award" nominations, "Broadcast News" almost swept the entire winners circle from the "New York Film Critics" and was generally acknowledged as of the year's best. Many compared this to "Network" (1976), but writer/director James L. Brooks draws his characters less broadly, and satirizes the obvious. These aspects were better made on "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" (with Mr. Brooks contributing, obviously). Other than that, "Broadcast News" is, at its heart, an old-fashioned romantic comedy-drama, with Ms. Hunter's career woman characterization topping the love triangle.****** Broadcast News (12/16/87) James L.

		<shortDescription>Love and Network News Don't Mix</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The romantic comedy Broadcast News is directed by James L. Brooks and stars William Hurt, Albert Brooks, and Holly Hunter. The film takes place in a modern day Washington News Station.Jane Craig (Hunter) is a news producer for a network television and despises the new trend of news stories being about entertainment rather than actual news. At the news station there are two reporters, Tom Grunick (Hurt) and Aaron Altman (Brooks), and both are very attracted to Jane Craig. Tom Grunick is an extremely handsome man but is all about style and Aaron Altman is an average looking guy but is very intelligent and funny. Jane Craig much determine which one she wants to date while the network is having a twenty-four million dollar budget cut where many jobs will be lost. Who will Jane choose, the style, or the substance? The screenplay by James L. Brooks was full of laughs and kept you wondering who Jane was going to be with until the very end. The characterization in this film was fantastic, I felt for all three of the leads and understood exactly what they were going through. Everyone hated Tom Grunick for being a stylish, entertaining guy but they all knew he was nice at heart. Everyone liked Aaron Altman but never gave him anything he ever wanted because he just didn't have the looks for the part. And everyone loved Jane Craig because she was organized, but crazy in her organization. Everything about this film was realistic. The only problem I had with this film was the ending, I disliked it so much I took a point off its rating.James L. Brooks direction matched his writing in quality, making the film very entertaining and a fun watch. He succeeded in showing the stress of a network station's craziness during the filming of the news, and that is when all the best comedy came out. There was nothing too impressive shot wise with this film, even though Brooks knew how to get the audience attached to the characters through his shots as well, but that is hard to describe how he did that. Brooks got fantastic performances from all his leads, and that is the main reason this film is going to be remembered as one of the great comedies.All three leads of this film received acting nominations at the Academy Awards. William Hurt received his for Best Actor and he deserved the nomination for the not too smart news caster with the good looks. Yet while being not too smart he was extremely likable and a character that I wanted to be happy at the end of the film. Some of Hurt's facial expressions were just great when they were extreme close ups on him, they just made him seem so sentimental and real. Albert Brooks received his nomination for Best Actor in a Supporting Role, and he provided many laughs the whole way through. But also he was a very deep, well constructed character that I also wanted to end up being happy. For both of them to be happy though they needed to be with Jane, and that just couldn't happen. Holly Hunter gave the strongest performance in the film and was nominated for Best Actress. She was perfect in being a frantic woman who just wanted some peace and a boyfriend that can make her happy when she got home. Her best acting was in the newsroom when she is screaming at people to get things done. The supporting cast of the film all gave good performances, especially a young Joan Cusack.Overall I give this film a 7/10 because it is very entertaining and has a lot of funny moments in it. If the film had a better ending I would have given it an 8/10, but unfortunately it didn't. If you've never seen a good William Hurt or Holly Hunter film, this is one of the many to see. Both of them are fantastic and shine in this film. I recommend this also to anyone who likes romantic comedies, but not those corny stupid ones from today, this one is good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Genuine middle-class romance without a single layer of sap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brave are the filmmakers who go out and try to capture the plight of the middle class, aka relationship drama. James L. Brooks' "Broadcast News" is a romance twisted up with a career that's all about constantly proving yourself and rising to the top. In reality, it's just co-worker romance with the heated pressure of a field where selling yourself and journalism ethics don't always play nice. Brooks soundly portrays this corner of Americana despite the film's minimal conflict, which comes with trying to make a film about reality.Our lives aren't interesting enough to make great films, that's why we never tell entirely true stories. Even the "based on" kind are just that -- based on. "Broadcast News" is far from true, but it might as well be. There isn't a far-fetched concept in this entire movie. Brooks wants 30-something unmarried professionals looking for success and love, but because they're already 30-something looking for success and love, that's tougher than you think.Jane (Hunter) is a quick-tempered D.C. news producer who can't help but tell people what they should do, Aaron (Brooks) is the under-appreciated reporter and Jane's closest friend who can't go a minute without cracking a joke and Tom is the new anchor trying to prove he's not just likable, but actually good at his job.Peel back that layer and you have Jane, who has crying fits every 30 minutes because she doesn't know what she wants though it might be Tom, Aaron who is madly in love with Jane and Tom who is attracted to Jane but has trouble dealing with her critical attitude.The performances are all genuine, but of course much of that credit goes to the legendary Brooks. One could guess a lot of this film was drawn from either leftover or would-be ideas for "The Mary Tyler Moore Show."Being real and truthful to human essence, however, while laudable, is just not what makes a great film. Certain people are bound to appreciate the sincerity and complete avoidance of cheeseball romance, but others will wish it had the intensity of a more daring plot.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a love story set against the back drop of television news. The three main stars, William Hurt,Holly Hunter and Albert Brooks create a love triangle whilst working at the Washington bureau of a TV network.Tom Grunick(Hurt)is the handsome reporter who is being groomed to be a star.Jane (Hunter)is the producer who recognises that Tom lacks the intellectual gravitas to be a real journalist, but falls for him anyway.Aaron Altman(Brooks)is the man who shares her beliefs in journalistic standards is also the man who truly loves her.Holly Hunter was nominated for a Best Actress Academy Award ,but lost out to Cher(Moonstruck!).She was robbed! This is Hunter's film.Her character Jane is smart,ruthless and totally driven. She is also hilariously neurotic. Her performance is perfect.Just watch her face when she watches the tape of Tom's interview of a rape victim. The scales literally fall from her eyes.Wiliam Hurt's performance is less showy.He plays a man who is well aware that he is a himbo and a fraud,but is smart enough to know that his rise will be facilitated by people like Jane.He gives little hints of a man who is extremely calculating and is a complete narcissist.The film comments on celebrity, journalism,integrity and the commercial pressures on news in a medium that is focused on the bottom line. It predicted that news would be dumbed down, that standards would slowly be lowered due to commercial pressures.Think about this:this film was released before the end of the Cold War and before rise of reality TV.Yet, it predicted the dumbing down of the news.Paris Hilton's release from jail was treated like a major news story! To see how prophetic this film is,just watch your evening news and note the set, the graphics and the presenters.Tom Grunick and his clones are well and truly alive!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Holly's moment - SPOILER</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't actually seen a lot of movies with Holly Hunter, but seeing her in Broadcast News was a pleasant surprise. She is a hard-nosed journalist, Jane Craig, who has devoted all of her time to TV news show. Her colleague Aaron Altman has carried her torch for a long time without saying anything. The love triangle is completed by Tom Grunnick. He is the slightly aloof ex-sportscaster who is the new reporter. To Jane, he symbolizes everything she doesn't like about news reporting - turning it into edutainment, not serious business. Much to her surprise, Jane finds herself attracted to Tom.Holly Hunter is doing a great performance as the perky journalist. But I don't quite see what she finds so charming about her new colleague, Tom. It's something with them that prevents us from getting up close and personal with him. Almost as impressive is Albert Brooks, who gives his all in the role of a professional who gives more than 100 percent for his job but doesn't get quite as much in return. Actually, for a while I thought he was Steve Guttenberg from Police Academy (1984). He has a few funny lines and if this was a Meg Ryan-picture, they'd call it a romantic comedy.Running over two hours, a few scenes could have been edited or left out completely, eg. Jane's and Aaron's trip to Central America. Also, I'm a sucker for happy endings and had preferred a different ending than just a reunion between the three of them seven years later.</fullReview>

Any woman can relate to the story because it's a classic: you're in love with "Mr. Right" but he has no interest in you until some guy who seems completely wrong comes along and you fall head-over-heels in love. But of course, it's not that simplistic. The characters are real and all of the performances are perfect. The movie is hilarious as well, every scene skewers society. I'd recommend this film to anyone who loves a well-written screenplay of humor and melodrama. You can relate to every character and the plot moves in unexpected directions.

		<fullReview>I loved this movie the first time I saw it. It gives such detail of what executives involved in the news industry will do just to get a story on the air: notably Jane Craig rushing Kenny to finish editing the piece to get it off, and then Joan Cusack struggling to get it in, and William Hurt, who according to Jane commits an incredible breach of ethics, fakes his tears during his date rape interview, a flaw that is pointed out by Aaron. Another high point is when Tom uses Jane for his own benefits, and then turns around and sleeps with Jennifer. The script is brilliant, and the directing is almost as good. All three main actors were great in the portrayals of their characters, Especially Holly Hunter, and Albert Brooks, whom is the funniest in the film. William Hurt is also very good. This deserved at least three Oscars, best actress(holly hunter), best supporting actor (Albert Brooks), and best picture. I liked the last parts of the film where it shows them reuniting 7 years later.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A choice of style vs. substance and neither wins</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I LOVE this film.Holly Hunter is perfect as a woman wound so tight she schedules time to break down. She admits that she hates `knowing more than anyone else' on any subject, but she can't help herself. Her Jane Craig is like a ball of energy attracting or repelling others who come within range. She holds herself and everyone around her to a standard that is almost impossible to achieve and it is exhausting. She could never be an on-air personality. Jane has to be behind the scenes, controlling everything.It makes perfect sense that her best friend is the acerbic Aaron (Albert Brooks). He has everything going for him except charisma. And knowing that he is never going to go any further in his career because he isn't pretty enough has embittered him. Personally, I think he should have worked in print journalism where he could have been a star. (In 1987, when this movie was made, it was rare to see someone who didn't look like a department store dummy on the local news.)The third leg in this triangle is William Hurt's Tom. He has nothing going for him except charisma. Hurt does very well with a difficult acting challenge, namely playing someone who is just a little bit dim. He is always a step behind and he knows it. It even shows in his eyes. Yet for me his is the least compelling character because I don't think Hurt is gorgeous, I find his looks bland. So there is no reason for Jane and Jennifer (Lois Chiles) to be so interested in him.The ending works for me. There was no way for either romance to work. Tom will never understand Jane's professional ethics (where faking the news IS a serious offense) and that would have broken them up eventually. And she and Aaron are past the point where they could become romantically involved. But, despite spending seven years as the head of the Washington bureau of a major network, she has learned to loosen up a bit and even has a romantic relationship that is working.Jack Nicholson's part is really a cameo, a `thank you' to James L. Brooks who wrote and directed `Terms of Endearment' which won Nicholson his second Oscar.The choice of Tom vs. Aaron echoes the theme of this movie. It is style vs. substance and how, in today's society we have begun to mistake the former for the later. The theme is perfectly summed up in Aaron's `Tom is the devil' speech . . . `How about that. I buried the lead.'Score 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't like "As Good as it Gets" very much, but I am a big fan of William Hurt and Holly Hunter's work, so I decided to watch this movie. And the most surprising thing for me was the superb work of Albert Brooks. Here, in Spain, he's little-known, and only as a 2nd division version of Woody Allen in the West Coast. He played a great part, but Hunter and Hurt were good too, specially Hurt, in an relatively unusual role for him. Hunter played the role that reminds me a bit of her part in "Once Around" (Lasse Hallstrom, 1991).Finally, the rest of the cast is great, too. Robert Prosky, one of these familiar faces of the american cinema, the ex-bond girl Lois Chiles, pretty good placed on that role, I think, the always perfect Joan Cusack in her early years; and specially the brief appereance of Jack Nicholson. Maybe he doesn't have any good scene, but it's Jack Nicholson, anyway... The Best movie by James L.Brooks, great story (well resolved), and superb cast for one of the, surely, best movies of the 80's</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is *far* from lame! Evidently it didn't "click" for another reviewer, but I loved it in 1987 and I enjoyed it still when I caught it on cable tonight (December 2002). It's a movie that's about the delicate balance between intelligence, power, and sexual attraction, and that manages to gently skewer the news industry at the same time. The characters well-rounded, the writing is spot on, and as for the acting ... well, we have the superb actors Holly Hunter and William Hurt at the top of their game, and Albert Brooks was nominated for an Oscar for his portrayal of a TV reporter who wants to be an anchor. I firmly disagree with "soranno" of Las Vegas; these stars' talent was not at all wasted! (Joan Cusack, Robert Prosky and Jack Nicholson are also fun to watch.)As a woman what I found especially appealing (and so did many of my woman friends) about BROADCAST NEWS is that Holly Hunter's character is in a (hierarchical) position of power over both men, and therefore the familiar dynamic of the boss mentoring a new hire undergoes a sex change.The best newsroom dynamics since His Girl Friday!</fullReview>

With fast-paced, brilliantly written dialogue, combined with tremendous performances from an amazing cast, the film is perhaps one of the finest about television.

Hunter offers a colorful array of emotions, many in a single scene. The cliche-smashing film also offers memorable moments, specifically Joan Cusack's literal sprint to airtime, and Brooks' hilarious shot at anchoring the weekend news, only to be victim of an unpredictable sweat attack. Funny, surprising, uncompromising and fiercely intelligent, "Broadcast News" gives us a peek at a world that gives us the world...the news, and how at the core, beats a human heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a member of the broadcasting industry for nearly 25 years, I can attest that Broadcast News was an almost-perfect representation of "The Biz." The only flaw was that, in real life, characters like Tom Grunnick are even better looking, have bigger egos, are far more glib, are smoother readers, and in most cases, are more adept at hiding their shortcomings.Please understand, I am not suggesting that is true of all anchor people, but Aaron Altman's notion that "being out covering the stories is where the real action is" is also the facet of the business that requires the greatest talent. Wringing a cohesive story out of the chaos of the street requires much more than "reading the intros to the stories other people have covered."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When you control the news, you control information.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Broadcast News' is a good study in the extreme deficiencies of network news, going far beyond the simplicity of ideological bias. In fact, ideological bias arguments are easy when there's no real news coverage in the first place (recall Holly Hunter's character at the conference in the beginning angrily criticizing an indifferent crowd of career journalists for airing something about a dominoes competition while some foreign countries were involved in nuclear disarmament talks). This is a significant commentary about how broadcast news, desirous of profits, becomes unimportant infotainment. Though, it makes this point less violently and harshly than does the terrific 1976 movie, Network, which provides a good preface, as that was already the late 70s when the beast started to creep in to the networks and take over. Although, you could probably pass on the dramatized version via Broadcast News, and witness it in a more modern setting (late 90s/early 2000) with Michael Moore's 'Bowling for Columbine' and again in the follow-up, 'Farenheit 9/11.' All of these movies reveal how significantly dangerous the practice of commercialized news is, and how insignificant the smokescreen of ideological bias really is. Bottom line: when you control the news, you control information!This one seems to hit on many faults of broadcast news as a result of commercial ownership using just three main characters. The first is top news producer, Jane Craig (Holly Hunter), who seems somewhat neurotic, but noble, in her desire to hold the network on one path, in one direction--for real news, not infotainment (not too much anyways, since even she was guilty of this with the way she and the stageman puts the story together) and with real, important stories to tell. She is matched by her best friend and coworker, the hopeless dufus reporter Aaron Altman (Albert Brooks) who plays something like a Bill Murray type character from 'Groundhog Day,' though not as darkly cynical as Murray's character first was. He's witty and knows how things work. He's less idealistic as Craig, and probably less optimistic, since he is more effected by the trends in the network news arena than she is. That's because his career is threatened by a newcomer soon-to-be-star, Tom Grunnick (William Hurt). Grunnick epitomizes what networks want and Craig epitomizes what they should be. Grunnick comes wining to Craig about how he's not a very good reporter, and wants to know how to reform himself. He says, for example, sometimes he doesn't understand the news he reads. Basically, what it boils down to is that he has no real qualifications for being a reporter. But that doesn't stop the incredible love affair the networks have with him, as he soon rises to stardom on complete nothingness while Craig, reluctant to teach "remedial journalism" to him, tries to steer him in the right direction such as strict adherence to journalism ethics, for example. None of which Grunnick really takes to heart. He's a real loser character because basically all he wants is people's approval without every doing the right thing. He is the bain of real news, and the prize of broadcast news. And it is his character that dominates the system. That's what is so dangerous. Craig nor Altman seem like very sympathetic characters (Hunter is so nagging and Brooks is rather pathetically idiotic) but they are certainly not as despicable as Grunnick (Hurt). You might walk away from this movie with a different opinion of corporate news networks, as you should. It is not as much of a comedy as it is social commentary. Although, I should mention that there is a five minute sequence with Joan Cusak and a water fountain accident that will have you balling on the floor every time you watch it (what a terrific, underrated actress). Likewise, it is not really a romantic comedy, though it seems to start out that way once Grunnick approaches Craig. Probably to focus too much on this would be to lose sight of the whole damn thing (like 'The Year of Living Dangerously' does in some ways). And the ending is not the happy Hollywood version of events either, but probably what would likely happen to characters (and their convictions) like Craig, Altman, and Grunnick.American audiences oughta watch it!</fullReview>

Further, the stars' characters are three-dimensional -- and how often does that happen? For example the toweringly brilliant and neurotic Jane Craig, played by Holly Hunter, is one of the funniest ? and saddest ? characters on film. I watched `Broadcast News' again today and was simply blown away by its bittersweet character. After the Joan Cusak character learns that she has been fired, she hugs Jane and says, `You're my roll model ? except socially.' Highly, highly recommended. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

If like me you just want a man or woman telling you what's happening in the world, and not some clown school graduate telling you want he/she thinks with hyperactive hand movements and head bobbing, whilst they slip in a few 'scandals,' then this film is for you. Holly Hunter and Albert Brooks are fantastic as the purists who believe in the old- fashioned honest way of delivering the news, and William Hurt is just as good as the up- start who would rather look good on camera. The premise of this film alone is engaging and designed to initiate debate, but add to it two opposites, Hunter and Hurt, falling for each other, much to the disgust of Brooks, and you create the complexity that makes this film as engrossing as it is.Here's a rare film- it's just as, if not more, reflective of reality now than it was at the time it was made. Broadcast News is made with feeling and pulls no punches with its brutal honesty of the worsening situation in the media. A great cast, and great dialogue from James L. Brooks. "I say it here, it comes out there."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>spoiled stew from leftover "Mary Tyler Moore Show"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a big fan of James L Brooks and the many TV shows and movies he has created, I hated this movie. It is like he stuffed the "The Mary Tyler Moore show" into a simmering pot: the intimidating, annoying, OCD producer "Mary"(I really like Holly Hunter but hated her in this movie); "Murray" the sensitive, affectionate, humorous colleague who's trying to get promoted; an actually professional and charming tho still style over substance anchorman "Ted Baxter", and even a "Sue Ann" with a big closet. (More precisely, the last 3 seasons of MTM, when the show sort of turned into "The newsroom show" itself. ) A great deal of the plot resembles the TV show: "Murray" falls in love with "Mary", "Mary" gets a big promotion, and the dramatic ending too (not to spoil too much)! He added some this and that, spiced everything up, gave "Mary" a little more character, put in some more romance etc. After that, he puts on the "head" and "tail", and that's it.Let MTM aside and speaking the movie itself, the opening "childhood" scenes seems unnecessary and irrelevant, (Although the opening does do a great job at arising my interest in the movie, it's cute and sort of a joke on the people that work in news) none of the characters reflected any of the scenes later in the movie. The ending is corny and doesn't really add anything to the movie or whatever it is that it's trying to express. The rest, the plot, is complicated and confusing: At first I thought this was a movie about the "newsroom", the news staff family and the excitement of broadcasting news. Which makes sense because the name is "Broadcast News". And indicating from the opening scene, the three characters are identified by their professions, instead of "future girl in love" "future best friend of girl""future man the girl's in love with". Then, I thought this is a love story: he loves her, but she loves him, and he loves somebody else...then, I thought it's really about friendship: she's been in love with the wrong man the whole time, maybe she will go to the one who really loves her...I thought I'd found out in the end, but the ending doesn't explain or define anything.It's none and maybe all of them, and it doesn't do any of them well. There's no clear plot, just random events happening and emotions flying around. In all it's flavorful but hard to swallow.I wasn't inspired nor touched perhaps a little stimulated by the intensity of the news room, which I expected but not getting nearly enough. And comedy? Yes there were one-liners and a mild slapstick scene, but then I might as well just watch the MTM.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Time Passage Not Kind To This One</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I think of James Brooks, I think more of television work he has done and been associated with like The Simpsons, Taxi, Mary Tyler Moore, and others. Here is a case where he wrote and directed this film. After finally seeing it recently, I was surprised and a bit disappointed all at once.The surprise is in how fast the technology in this movie has been out dated. Other than the TelePrompTers which I understand are still in use, I doubt there are any typewriters currently being used in TV Journalism. I believe Video Tape might be going if not gone by now as the digital age has taken over.Some of the characters here come off a quite real. The weakness is in the writing of Holly Hunter's character which sets back equal rights for women years. The drive of her character as a career woman is great, but the undecided state of her personal life is not consistent. Holly Hunter is a brunette stuck in the role of a blonde who is only half there. This is the fault of the writing and not the actress. After Brooks involvement in MTM, Rhoda, and other stuff prior to this, I am surprised how he wrote this not real woman character. When a woman is career driven, it is rare that her personal life would be this big a mess.That does not make this whole movie totally trash, it just makes Jane Craig seem a bit strange. William Hurt's character Tom Grunick is surreal as he makes sense as a news anchor but early on makes little sense when Jane first meets Tom and wants to get to know him real fast (the only time Jane makes sense in this one) but he flat out turns her down like he does not know she has invited him, while the viewer is wondering if he is crazy.Later on in the film Tom Grunick does a story on date rape. I guess in a way maybe if he had scored on the Jane encounter that would be consistent, but in this early scene it is Jane who is practically begging for a consensual encounter and Tom having none of it.Albert Brooks (Aaron Altman) is solid in the role of off camera journalist who finally gets a shot at his dream anchor job one night only to fall short. He is also the other guy on Jane's yo yo personality disorder, the friend who never gets past that status.Jack Nicholson's role is very limited in this, though very effective. "Why don't you cut a couple of million from your big salary, Bill, so we do not have to lay all these people off?" In this case Nicholson does not answer, because he handles the truth that he can't do that because he is not the head of the whole corporation and would have to answer to the top people even if he wanted too.One thing that is all too real in this is the lack of ethics shown by the reporters. The film exposes to an extent how the news is manipulated for one view, theirs. Predictably, the date rape interview has simplistic manipulation and exploitation in it which I predicted in my head just watching the film before it was revealed to a surprised Jane. Why a smart career driven woman did not see it when I did watching the interview for the first time in the movie, just another bit of a flaw in the writing of Jane's character? This film has a strong cast, with mixed results. It could have been better if script writer Brooks had really consulted more with on air Journalists of the era, but the writing behind Jane (Hunter's) character is just a major flaw. When I saw a hard driving Jane after 7 more years still stuck in the same personal rut she was in at the beginning of the movie, the way she is presented just makes me feel like she is not at all real.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good News, Bad Plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this movie interesting, especially in its portrayal of news. It gave a good glimpse into the news making process. You come feel the rush and the panic that is sometimes and often felt during the making of news. It was interesting to see how many different roles play a part in the making of a news broadcast. There are many things that must happen before it gets to the news anchor, not to mention the process of actually giving the news live on television. I did enjoy this glimpse into the news making process, but I did not enjoy the plot of this movie. The characters were ridiculous and exaggerated. They were not believable. The love triangle, the dialogue, and the ending were ridiculous. I was very annoyed with the ending. It could not have ended worth. It gave a good glimpse of the news making process, but the plot was horrible. If you are watching this to just watch a movie, don't. It's not worth it. If you must watch it or are interested in the news making process, this is fine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>News Flash: I Almost Fell Asleep While Watching It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I unfortunately had to watch this atrocity in my Journalism class, and I plan on never watching it again. I learned two things from this cinematic disaster: grabbing your lover's armpit with passion is uncomfortable for other people to watch and the ugly friend never gets the girl. Around 37% of the film contains either an awkward silence or a cringeworthy act of affection, such as Aaron kissing Jane on the shoulder and Tom groping Jane's chest in the middle of a public park. If you are forced against your will to witness this pathetic excuse of a movie, play a game that consists of blasting "Make Up Your Mind" by Deana Carter whenever Jane opens her mouth, because all you'll be missing is either a series of contradictory statements or one of her famous awkward silences. Jane's constant indecisiveness confirms that she is a disgrace to the female leads and heroines who confidently face our male-dominated society. Instead of coming off as a lovable goof, Jane comes off as emotionally unstable and psychotic. The ending was depressing and abrupt, which, in all honestly, didn't surprise me at all. The news aspect of the film was decent, but it could have been more informative. Overall, this movie was the cinematic equivalent to waiting in line at your local Target: nothing special.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Characters are the Biggest Downfall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While Broadcast News was informational as far as journalistic value, the characters made it difficult to enjoy this. I loved how Jane acted a strong female lead in her work field, but found pretty much everything else she said annoying. I really liked Aaron at first, but his temper made him near unbearable towards the end. He practically threw a tantrum when Jane told him she was in love with Tom. And speaking of Tom, the fact that he never showed any kind of remorse for faking his emotion during the interview really made me dislike him as well. Despite this, Broadcast News was a good insight into the real world of journalism. It was a solid representation of what it's like to work in a newsroom with real deadlines and stress that this can bring to peoples' lives. It's a shame the three main characters were so unlikeable to draw away from this. Add in an unsatisfying ending, and it makes watching this movie very difficult.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Broadcast News" is a classic movie released in the late 1980's. Starring William Hurt, Albert Brooks, and Holly Hunter, this movie does a great job portraying life in the news industry. Throughout the movie, Hunter and Hurt meet and have chemistry. Brooks is a good friend of Hunter and eventually professes his love to her, only to be shut down. During an interview about date rape, Hurt sheds a tear, which Hunter is desperate to find out if it was real or fake. With mass firings at the news station, Hurt is relocated to London and Hunter is promoted. Brooks quits his job. Before Hurt leaves for London, he wants to go on vacation with Hunter. Brooks is upset with Hunter and tells her to check the tapes from the interview about date rape. Hunter views them and realizes that the tear was fake. This makes her very upset and she calls off the trip with Hurt. Hurt goes to London. Seven years passing, Hurt introduces his fiancé and Brooks has a wife and son. This wasn't the typical ending that many people had hoped for. In fact, it was kind of a let down. The relationships in the movie didn't have a purpose anymore because nothing added up in the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love triangle and broadcast journalism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie gives great insight into the high pressure job of broadcast journalism. It has great value as it evaluates the changes in broadcast journalism. Some of these changes are how broadcast journalism began to value appearance rather than qualification or knowledge in its anchors (Tom, for example). It shows the amount of work that goes in to every news broadcast, and seems to indicate a shift in what's important. This shift is from news to entertainment. Broadcast News is a cheesy romance, but still has value by giving a view into the realities of broadcast journalism. The idea for the movie is good, but could have been executed much better. The unrealistic love triangle could have been made more realistic. I appreciate the journalistic value, and believe that the movie can still be referenced and appreciated today. It seems that broadcast journalists are facing the same changes and problems as those in the movie were.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Evening news melodrama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Broadcast News" is one of several newsroom movies made over the years, the story involves a talented reporter and writer (Albert Brooks) who the network brass clearly doesn't have on the fast-track because of his abrasive personality and lack of good looks, a rising star producer (Holly Hunter) who is great at her job but lacks social skills in the extreme, and a pretty face with no confidence in his reporting skills (William Hurt) is rising meteorically on the basis of his presentation and simple luck.The news reporting elements of this movie are fantastic. They are engaging and fun to watch, and give the appearance of realism. The problem for me was that most of the movie was about a melodramatic love triangle between the three leads. It just didn't seem to work for me, each was a flawed person in an unlikeable way. I can see what they were going for but it just didn't come off as a compelling love triangle to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>like Hurt's character, handsome but superficial</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Star appeal is the principle attraction here, with Holly Hunter playing a slightly neurotic (it's a hazard of the profession) television network news producer who finds herself drawn to the facile charms of handsome but superficial anchorman William Hurt. Private and professional jealousy from veteran writer/reliable friend Albert Brooks leads to various complications, but what lifts the film above the usual romantic triangle is writer/director James L. Brooks' obvious affection for his characters, and the care that went into the network news background. The result is an undemanding but enjoyable comedy drama perhaps no less insubstantial than the television news broadcasts it tacitly criticizes, but nevertheless well written and paced, if at times inclined to tug the heartstrings a little too hard. Brooks certainly put his own heart (if not his imagination) into the film, and he knows precisely how to milk a formula for all its worth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Educational Movie, But Downbeat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoiler Alert I have never seen comments on a movie, that I disagree with more then the comments people made on this. One could learn from critical viewings of this movie. As an educational film, I rate it highly because it teaches "how to succeed"! We do not watch movies to learn; we generally watch for entertainment. As entertainment, I rate it low: the ending is downbeat and cerebral/intellectual. This conflict results in my eight star rating. The movie follows Jane Craig (Holly Hunter), a television news producer. The network executive introduces Tom Grunnick (William Hurt), to study for the on air news anchor position. Tom immediately charms people with humbleness. Another potential news anchor has been waiting for years for his on air opportunity, Aaron Altman (Albert Brooks). Altman knows all news stories, inside and out.The Network executive wants Grunnick on the air and Jane argues, saying Grunnick is not ready, he doesn't know the news. They do not listen to her. Forced to place Grunnick on the air, Jane contacts Altman to get information on the news story and relays Altman's comments through an earpiece to Grunnick while Grunnick speaks. We watch the sharp contrast between Altman's/Jane Craig's words and Grunnick's, as Grunnick skillfully rewords everything Altman and Jane Craig say in his ear, in order to make it understandable, likable and entertaining the audience. Altman gets a chance on air and the network execs require him to seek coaching from Grunnick, the new guy. This new (news ingnorant) guy coaching him? This is something Altman does not see justified, but agrees reluctantly. Grunnick coaches Altman and gets excited noting hundreds of Altman's shortcomings in appearance, audio and vocabulary. Altman never considered these things before, when he became an expert on the news itself. The complexity of understanding what Grunnick taught him, causes Altman to have a panicked sweating attack ("Flop Sweat") when he is on the air. Grunnick eventually becomes the top network anchor and Altman resigns prior to being fired. But Grunnick fails in his attempt for a romance with Jane Craig, because she finds out from Altman, that Grunnick sometimes fakes circumstances in order to make people like him. This turns her off of him. This sends the message that in relationships, we want people who are genuine and not trying to make us like them. This movie sends the message that getting people to like you is the most important skill in a job, but it is especially true in Broadcast News. There are many people commenting on how this is the dumbing down of TV News and how Grunnick represents a good looking, but dumb guy or all style, but no substance. The opposite is true, Grunnick possessed skills and very complex intellect, to get people to like him, including the presence of mind to know exactly how he appears and sounds, when he is on camera (He coaches Altman to Punch a word in every sentence). Grunnick's flaw that costs him the relationship with Jane Craig, is that he is too driven to be likable and will fake a situation. Many people are calling Altman very intelligent or brilliant. Altman played by Brookes is not as intelligent as Grunnick and the "Flop Sweat" scene shows that his mind could not handle the complexity that Grunnick handles when on the air. Altman is angered by this fact that he knew the news and Grunnick suceeded more by getting people to like him. There are also people commenting that these things are exclusive to the TV News industry. The concept that winning friends is the most important skill in a job, is obviously, not popular, but my experience indicates it is true in most jobs. As an education on how to succeed, this movie is fantastic, albeit unpopular. Educational, yes, but it does not have an uplifting ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>News you can use ..... maybe!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Or maybe not. Whatever anyone thinks of "Broadcast News," good or bad, almost all the credit for that "thinking" belongs to writer-producer-director James L. Brooks. As a screenwriter (of which he has long been one of the best), it is not easy to savage an entire business -- in this case, the "business" being television news -- but to do it with a smile, a wink, a knowing nod and a laugh practically every step of the way. To do all that takes real talent, something Mr. J. Brooks has in abundance.One user on this website, in his summary, asked the musical question -- "Did Walter Cronkite act like this?" Answerve: No! Of course not! And the reason for that is in Walter's -- uh, Mr. Cronkite's -- day, the only thing that mattered was bringing the news to the people. Same goes for John Chancellor and Chet and David and Douglas Edwards and Howard K. Smith. Sure, they had to pay lip-service attention to their ratings, if only to please their bosses. But all they REALLY cared about was THE NEWS ITSELF.Now, of course, all that has changed. For the last 25-30 years in the network news business, the only thing that has really mattered is ratings, ratings, ratings. The bottom line. How many bucks will our news division deliver for the network? Don't believe that?Let's consider "The Big Three": Tom Brokaw, Dan Rather and Peter Jennings (aka "Stanley Stunning"). All three have now been on the job at their respective anchor desks for the last 15-20 years (Peter actually got his first shot at the national anchor desk way back in the 1960s but was totally unprepared for the job). Of the three, Dan is the one with the greatest in-the-field training as a reporter. Personally, I think all three do terrific jobs as news anchors and are deserving of their positions. All of which has nothing to do with why all three are actually IN those jobs. All three are now in their 60's (Dan is pushing the big 7-0) and all three are still very good looking. And if you think they're still good looking now, imagine how good looking they were in their 40's, when all three were hired for (let's say, "put in") their current jobs. But do you honestly believe that any one of these three would have been "put in" had he looked like, let's say, Fred Gwynne ("Herman Munster"). Or like -- heaven forfend -- ME!!! Not only that, if Dan were retiring tomorrow, a younger (than he is today) Walter Cronkite would not be able to get his old job back. Why? Not pretty enough. And it would matter not a whit that he is, or once was, "the most trusted man in America." And this is what "Broadcast News" is all about. Tom Grunnick (William Hurt), the next pretty-boy-national-news-anchor-to-be who has trouble with a few minor things, such as thinking for himself, being able to write and knowing stuff. Jane Craig (Holly Hunter), the brilliant news producer with news business standards and ethics, all of which get thrown to the wind when even she falls for pretty-boy-Tom. And Aaron Altman (Albert Brooks, no relation to James L.), a top-notch newswriter and field reporter who has no hope for a national job because he "flop-sweats" behind the anchor desk. And many other such flawed characters whom you KNOW really do exist in the news divisions of the various networks."Network" blazed the trail. Eleven years later, "Broadcast News" carried the torch as a worthy successor. In the new millennium, what will be the next movie to savage the business of network "news you can use" ..... maybe. Or maybe not.</fullReview>

William Hurt gives depth to a dimbulb anchor, but Holly Hunter and Albert Brooks walk away with the movie.

Joan Cusack is an underrated actress while Jack Nicholson's cameo-like performance was impressive.

		<fullReview>I love this movie - and am amazed that it hasn't received unanimous accolades from others on this site - it's superb in so very many ways.1) It's one of the best movies - most wrenching, sad and true movies - about the difficulty of work, careers, ambition, who gets ahead, why, how difficult it is to find one's ambition thwarted, the sometime unfairness of promotion, disappointment and the guilt of undeserved success.2) It's an excellent romantic triangle drama - one sees so clearly the pull that two men have on Holly Hunter - so much so that see what happens to Lois Chiles when she gets in the way (a wonderfully understated thing in the movie that makes Hunter more real - and definitely less saintly)3) The characters are so wonderfully defined - you feel they are real so quickly. And it's done through so many small gestures - the screenplay is just fantastic - truly the kind of screenplay that should serve as a model for screenplays. Just one tiny thing - see what Holly Hunter does when she is kissed. There are so many small things that serve beautifully to show us who these people are.4) The story has great pace. (Forget the stuff some say below about it being slow - they're just wrong).5) The movie is adult. The issues are adult, the consequences of people's actions are real and lasting, there is both justice and injustice - and people will argue about which is which. This is (thank goodness) far from a simple-minded movie. 6) The direction is so consistently good - notice the way the camera shows William Hurt at the anchor desk or Albert Brooks at the same desk -notice the initial scenes of Hunter and Joan Cusack preparing the report, notice the way the camera moves around Hunter and Hurt at the dinner. It's fresh, lively, interesting - shows us much.7) The acting is just great - from everyone. Lois Chiles' embarrassment at her home, Hunter is just great - the portrayal of a very specific and real person, Joan Cusack wonderful, Persky dealing with Albert Brooks and at the end of the movie, Jack Nicholson as anchorman, Albert Brooks is so very sympathetic - the very bright William Hurt makes a very dumb person come completely alive - without ever overdoing it.This is the tops of drama screenwriting - there are some as fine - none better. If you've not seen it, and you're not in the mood for a grand romance, comedy or action movie, and want something that deals with real and adult issues, you're in for a treat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen this twice, 14 years apart, '89 and this month. Few things that stand out...*Hurt basically plays Matt Lauer, unf. there are wayyy more of that dim bulb type now than there were then. Very sad. Nice acting, esp. by a bright guy playing an empty suit.*Holly Hunter peaked w/ this and Piano in '93, really hasn't left the building, so to speak, but you don't see her much. She's great in this though you wonder how short-sighted her character could be, not to just up and grab Albert Brooks who is obv. right for her. Maybe they're too much alike?*Brooks was great. He is essentially Harry Smith, Bob Simon, etc. I agree that the ending was poopoo too-what gives? Couldn't think of Something?***1/2 outta ****, gotta love Joan Cusack's Big 80's hair there too-she did 'Working Girl' the next year, must have had the corner in the market or something..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie Albert Brooks ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think Ratstink has it right -- this movie is way underrated. And it's even more relevant than it was when it was made. The NY Times just had an editorial talking about one of the main conflicts of this movie, which was anchors being hired for their looks or public appeal and not because of their knowledge of the subject matter or journalistic skill. Brooks has made a bunch of other movies that were good, but none that were this good or that stand up as well after fifteen years and twice as many viewings.Plus, does anyone know anything about the Soundtrack album for this movie? I would really love to know who that French guy is that Albert Brooks is listening to in that scene when he's sitting at home watching Tom anchor the piece on Libya.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>William Hurt as Ronald Reagan?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't seen it for a while, but when this film came out, I understood it as a satire on Ronald Reagan rather than the news media. William Hurt plays a genial, likable man with engaging camera presence, excellent instincts, but no depth whatever. The intrepid staff reporters aren't jealous in the least. They are savvy enough to value his talent and are loyal to him in the extreme in making him look good. He is their creation and in their giddier moments, they believe in him; even love him. This movie makes more sense of the Reagan phenomenon, which still keeps his biographers scratching their heads, than any other explanation I've read. Does anyone agree?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant look at tv broadcasting; a continuation of NETWORK.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved NETWORK, I loved BROADCAST NEWS. This time, I think James L. Brooks does what NETWORK could not: focus in on a couple of issues without omitting anything in the process. Don't get me wrong, I have a deep admiration for Sidney Lumet's 1976 film, but Lumet tried to cover too much ground for a two-hour piece. Brooks is right on target. Holly Hunter, who is nothing short of phenomenal in the role of Jane, is different than Faye Dunaway in that she does still have a heart despite it being hampered by extremely tedious work habits. She just glows in this film that you hate to see her out of sorts or displeased. She has the charm of a '40's actress with a '80's grit, extremely likable but also hard-edged. William Hurt is great as always in the role of Tom Grudnick, an average Joe who just happens to look good on camera and can shed a tear at the drop of a hat. Albert Brooks, whom I admire greatly as a director as well as an actor, adds real flair to the role of Hunter's best friend, looking out for her best interests but being in love with her at the same time.The personal and the professional are sketched by James L. Brooks beautifully, separately and in collaboration. The performances are dead-on, and the dialogue is witty and serious all at the same time. I won't dare to speculate on any in-depth statements that Brooks effectively states here. Only he can provide that with ease and complexity. BROADCAST NEWS was one of the five best of 1987. Rating: Four stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Holly Hunter is magnificent in this movie. And that's the only positive thing that can be said about it. If you're going to make a film about relationships - which is basically what this is, concentrating as it does on the interaction between the three characters played by Hunter, Hurt and Brooks - then at least make the characters interesting, or even likable! This could have been a fascinating insight into TV, or news reporting, or the world at large. In fact, it is just a story about three people who work in an office and don't have much of a social life outside of that. Boring, dull, unpleasant characters who exploit people in order to make themselves rich &amp; famous. Who cares?!But despite my utter contempt for the film I was enthralled by Hunter. As a relative youngster here, diminutive, bright-eyed, yet very commanding - she gives one of the best performances I've seen from anyone. If you just concentrate on her, ignore everything that goes on around her, you will enjoy this film. But I can't help but be utterly astonished and bewildered by this film's success in terms of awards. I guess it's a case - as in the movie itself - of a bunch of over-paid, insular, superficial, drama queens patting each other on the back. Thank God things have moved on in recent years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>James L. Brooks Does "Network"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A smart and funny adult comedy about a network news station and the lives of those who make it run.William Hurt is the newly-hired golden boy who looks great on screen but doesn't have a lot going on upstairs. Albert Brooks is the sharp reporter who doesn't have the looks to make it as an anchor. And Holly Hunter, blowing everyone out of the water in an amazingly energetic performance, is the driven producer who serves as the object of affection for both men. She's a funnier and more Southern version of the character Faye Dunaway played in "Network".Like all of James L. Brooks' screenplays, this one feels like it would be just as at home as a T.V. movie than as a film, but since it's about T.V., the sitcom trappings aren't as jarring.Grade: A-</fullReview>

If James Brooks had only let Holly Hunter's character make a choice in what is essentially a romantic triangle he would certainly have copped a best screenplay (and maybe even a best picture) award. In this instance pandering to the public's wishes was the right thing to do.</fullReview>

Holly Hunter is not at all funny or interesting in this and neither is William Hurt. Albert Brooks is the only member of the cast that is in any way interesting.

		<shortDescription>James L. Brooks Wimped Out...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**Spoiler alert!**I feel like a hypocrite, because I love a lot of this movie (and own it) but also hate the last ten minutes every single time I've seen it. And just don't get those who fall to pieces over the character of Aaron, played by Albert Brooks, who's frankly one of the most unlikeable asses I've ever seen onscreen.Although the performances (lead and supporting) are all superb and worthy of all the praise they got, "Broadcast News" is one of those that sounds better -- and feels better -- than it is. In retrospect, it's one of those whose moments have come up often for me -- the young Jane's "obsessive" speech, Joan Cusack's dash with the videotape, Jane's disastrous public speaking event, etc.But in reality while the movie's witty and beautifully acted, I always secretly feel James L. Brooks let us viewers down. He is widely publicized as being unable to come up with an ending for his characters -- hence the hideous non-ending which embarrasses the Hunter character unnecessarily and adds further loose ends to a movie already full of them. Brooks should have held true to the spirit of the story -- which was obviously going to be an ending in which Jane chooses style over substance (Hurt) -- or substance over style (Albert Brooks).Although frankly, Brooks's character is such a petulant, insecure, acid-tongued and (worst of all) verbally abusive ass that I can't imagine any woman going for him. I loathed this character and never found him likeable in any way. Just MHO, but the guy never deserved Jane for a single moment. His behavior throughout the last half of the film is incredibly cruel, without the right to be so, as he has never been Jane's lover (and she has never treated him as one) -- just a friend to whom she's kind because she knows he has feelings for her. And an undeserving one at that.And then we have William Hurt, who fabulously plays the slightly dim -- yet very perceptive and lovable news anchor who catches Jane's eye. While written to be a laughingstock, Hurt manages to find the humanity in his character, making him attractive, willing to learn and improve, and honest (even when it comes to his own failings). So every time I've seen this, Jane's decision to punish Hurt comes across as false to me, and as having very little ethical merit. And of course -- any news producer worth her salt would've known ages before how that interview was filmed, so the final chapter's drama is poorly manufactured.And the ending (or non-ending) just flat sucks. It's an embarrassment to Jane's character and Hunter's lovely brave performance -- why is it that the heroine of the film in this footnote scene a few years later is the one person who hasn't seemed to have moved on? Yuck. Brooks wimped out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some Very Funny Moments, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yet another Hollywood send up of the television business. This focuses on the seedy news racket. Movie grows stale before its time mostly because Hurt and Hunter as leads are uncharismatic at best. Hunter in particular has zippo sex appeal, and this role really called for it, if we're to believe Hurt's romance with her. I'm just now realizing many of the leading actresses of this era were of a singularly inferior quality. Was there a sex appeal is bad epoch I somehow slept through? Think about it, todays leading ladies, Kidman, Moore, Theron, even Julia Roberts are all total hotties. You put Jennifer Aniston in this picture, and look out. Be that as it may be that, some of the segments in the film are very very good. Its got a big cast, and many of the supporting characters are given some great lines. You will definitely laugh, that's a promise. In the end though, I personally find the whole experience in one word, depressing. Brooks' unrequited love that embitters him into old age, success being awarded to the undeserving face man...Its all very true to life, but a little too true to life. A film can surely be sad, but a film should never leave an audience uselessly depressed. There is no societal self-examination, or provocative fantasy, as in this film's predecessor, Network. Instead this is a not so revealing hum-drum study of basic human failure. That's a cinematic no-no. Our lives for the most part are mundane, dreary excercises. That's why movies exist in the first place; to allow us temporary escape as they say, not to hammer home despair. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine movie showcasing talents of Hurt, Brooks, and Hunter.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the critic Ebert says, this movie does a very good job showing what it really is like in the broadcast news field. There are two different, but interwoven, stories going on here -- the big business of news reporting plus people trying to find real love. Although it didn't win any, it was nominated for 7 Oscars, including best actor for Hurt and Hunter, and best supporting actor for Brooks.William Hurt is Tom Grunick, a news anchor who gets by on his ruggedly handsome looks, his smooth delivery, and his ability to charm the audience through the lens of the TV camera. Not substantially different from news anchors in most large markets. Albert Brooks is Aaron Altman, a talented news man who is just the opposite, the camera and he do not get along very well. Rounding out the main characters is Holly Hunter who, as Jane Craig, is a talented news producer who gets attracted to both men. Her mission, if she decides to accept the impossible, is to choose sensitivity and honesty, or go for sex appeal.SPOILERS. The business part of the story is the need for cutbacks that for the most part means older employees will be dismissed, and replaced by younger, lower paid employees. Jane gets a big break with a promotion, but Aaron decides to quit "while I still have the ability to cry." Tom gets sent to London, a seasoning move for bigger things. Tom and Jane seem destined to remain together, he invites her to a week of vacation before his new assignment, but at the airport she tells him "No", all because she found out that an earlier interview contained fake tears that Tom had emoted after the interview was over, just like any actor would. He saw it as no big deal, but to her it was dishonest news and she could never get past that with him. The movie ends 7 years later, Aaron flies over from Portland with his young son to meet Jane, Tom has returned from London, Jane thinks she may have a new boyfriend. Little resolution, everyone continues to struggle with their lives, as we all do in the real world.</fullReview>

It's just some people struggling through life as news people. There is one scene however that I think is really good. It's the scene where the news music theme guys were showing their stuff to the Peter Hackes' character. For the most part of the movie Holly Hunter and Albert Brooks play two very smart talented people looking down on everybody. At the end of the movie their characters have not grown, they are still bitter and looking down on people. There is a scene where Paul Hackes tells Holly Hunter sarcastically more or less that "It must be nice to think that you know better than every one." That pretty much sums up her character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very well made and often quite moving, but the comedy can be awfully corny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very well made film from director James L. Brooks. William Hurt, Holly Hunter, and Albert Brooks play a group of reporters and producer at a big news network. William Hurt is the new big shot anchorperson who everybody just seems to love, even though he didn't go to college and isn't even very knowledgeable about the news he is reading. Holly Hunter is the producer that cannot stand to see him become so successful because she does not believe that a reporter should be respected and loved just because they "look good" but soon finds herself attracted to him anyway. Albert Brooks plays a highly intelligent and knowledgeable reporter that simply does not have the looks and charisma to become a successful anchorperson. Brooks gets extremely jealous of Hurt because he is so successful and Holly Hunter has romantic feelings for him, which he wishes she had for Brooks himself. This is basically the whole story, and an interesting one at that. The comedy which is supplied mostly by Brooks is often embarrassingly corny and even childish at times. There is one scene where he almost randomly starts singing along with some Spanish song on the radio which really was not needed in the film. Overall a fine film that works better as a drama/romance than a comedy. ***/****.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this during it's initial theatrical release and although it is certainly a good movie I can't see how it went on to be nominated for seven Academy Awards. Best Picture? Best Actor, William Hurt puts a lot into his acting and although his performance is kind of wooden so is the character he is playing. This was his third nomination in a row which included a win and he was at his peak so I can understand his nomination. Best Actress? Holly Hunter is too over the top and cartoonish for a serious nomination. Best Supporting Actor, Abert Brooks probably should have won but his role was too comedic to have been a serious contender. Screenplay, Brooks was a viable contender for his screenplay written directly for the screen. It additionally was nominated for Best Cinematography and Best Film Editing. Editing maybe but I don't see this as a masterpiece of cinematography. Broadcast News, despite it's seven nominations, would win no Oscars. This is a good movie a cynical and comedic and timely look at when "journalism" was becoming fluff, entertainment and sensationalism and worth a view. Look for Jack Nicholson in a cameo role as he briefly reunites with Brooks who directed his Academy Award winning performance in 1983's Terms of Endearment. I've seen it a couple times since it's release but I would give it a 7.5 out of a possible 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If only Holly Hunter hadn't been in this film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Compared to the viciousness of 'Network' which not only attacked television but also, quite justifiably, people in general, 'Broadcast News' is merely a mild satire on the standards of news coverage and our attitude and even disinterest toward current affairs. It can also be seen as a Rocky-like inspiration for those of us who feel that we are in a job that demands abilities that we can not provide as we may be able to thrive on our good looks and personality, if we have them.The film is about a handsome, likable news reporter, Tom Grunick (William Hurt) who unexpectedly enters the serious world of network news after humble beginnings covering sport for local television. Grunick has little talent but, nevertheless, gets to the top extremely quickly.It would seem that I have spoiled the film but as the movie spoils itself in its opening scenes, I don't think that makes an awful lot of difference. This is one of several flaws in an otherwise enjoyable film.The three central characters in the film of Grunick, Aaron Altman (Albert Brooks) and Jane Craig (Holly Hunter) are introduced at the start as children and already their personal traits are firmly established. The fatal mistake is that the opening tells the audience the destiny of each character. It does this in an attempt to make a witticism about talent counting for little and style triumphing over substance. However, this is unnecessary as this point is made continually throughout the whole film and it therefore detracts from much of the drama and supposed uncertainty about each of their careers particularly in the latter half of the story.The other flaws have one thing in common, Holly Hunter.She completely ruined this film for me.When she makes her first appearance, speed-walking into work, I knew her role would irritate, I just had no idea how much. It could be said that this is down to an irritating character being performed very well.It isn't.Her mannerisms really are irritating, her acting is irritating and, most of all, her voice is like listening to someone running their fingernails down a blackboard.Although you hear her voice in 'The Piano' it is somehow fitting that for that particular film, she scooped the best actress awards at the Oscars, the BAFTAs and the Cannes Film Festival playing a mute.There are two very poor scenes, one with Grunick and Craig in a hotel room on the night they first meet that has no narrative flow. Incidentally, it is impossible to believe that the shallow Tom Grunick's feelings for her could ever extend beyond respect for being good at her job.The other scene takes place on Grunick's first day when we are given an example of what he has let himself in for (even though we KNOW he's going straight to the top). The team is frantically trying to complete a piece in time for the evening news and we are treated to Joan Cusack screaming with anxiety, sounding as if she is going into labour and Hunter being as irritating as ever.The audience is also subjected to some pretty feeble attempts at manipulation. How on earth can Tom Grunick be handed the position of emergency anchorman when we have examples of how clever Aaron Altman is where he not only sings in fluent French but he can also sing whilst reading 'The Fall of Mussolini'? However, these are ONLY a few poor moments in a good film that would have been much better if the aforementioned scenes had been changed and if an actress such as Frances McDormand had played Hunter's role.The film also fails to make us believe that Holly Hunter is attractive. When her character sees Altman, just as she is ready to go to a correspondent's dinner, Altman says 'you look like this porcelain thing, you look beautiful'. In actual fact, she looks like a six year old girl who, when alone in the house, has raided her parents' wardrobe and dressed up like 'mommy'.There is one possibility, though. Maybe we were being invited to laugh at how ridiculous she looked and director James L Brooks was being far more subtle and cunning in his criticism of Holly Hunter than I am. If this is the case, then this film is one of the shining beacons of the 80's and I take back everything I have said. Leaving Holly Hunter to one side (which is probably the best place for her), the terrific William Hurt merely has to look good in order to succeed, just like the character he is playing. 'Broadcast News' was made during the most successful stage of his career ('Children of a Lesser God', 'The Accidental Tourist' and the wonderful 'Kiss of the Spiderwoman') and this is by far his least demanding role of that period.So the acting plaudits for this film must go to Albert Brooks as the wise-cracking, talented but doomed Aaron Altman. Although his is the supporting role of the three, he has the most difficult part. He is excellent, maybe not Oscar-worthy, but certainly more deserving than Sean Connery who won the award for playing an Irishman with a Scottish accent.Final tip for maximum enjoyment of this film: you should buy a copy of the screenplay before seeing the movie and press mute every time Ms Hunter opens her mouth</fullReview>
