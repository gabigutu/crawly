		<shortDescription>Finally a GOOD HORROR FILM. Good film period.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally, a horror film about adults. Adults with complex issues and children that act like children and not hyper precocious sex models. The reason to see this film isn't to find out the over advertised " Esther's secret" of the film (a MAJOR misstep in marketing. Too many people now enter the film trying to figure out the "secret" before they normally would have been surprised), but rather to see a well-acted (extremely well acted by Vera F.)slow-building suspense story with excellent direction and cinematography. John Ottman's score also serves the film well, without becoming overpowering in signaling this is a "creepy" film. The actress who plays Esther shows a skill in performance that makes one think we may actually have another Jodie Foster to keep an eye on. This film works because we LIKE the characters (Rob Zombie please take note!) and fear for them and their survival. Dark Castle's best film, and it gives one hope that the horror/suspense genre still can be presented with intelligence and depth. Hollywood take note: we don't want a xerox of this film, but we do want more films that share this films strenghts: good script, likable real characters, excellent acting and nice, tension building direction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well Made, Well Acted, Surprisingly Great Horror-Thriller!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Orphan REALLY surprised me. I expected some stupid pg-13 movie that somehow got an R rating. That was not the case. Let me tell you, Orphan is very disturbing at parts, and pretty gruesome. The movie overall is excellent, has some great acting, an amazing script, and excellent execution. The movie really has a lot of suspense and the twist is pulled off very well and packs a big punch to the viewer.The best thing the film has is the script. What Esther does to the family is brilliant. The movie also has several sub-plots that work very well in the movie and add some complexity to the whole thing. The sub-plots never feel like too much, because they are very subtly put in there.Overall, if you are tired of bad horror films, and want to see a very intelligent and well made film, i would suggest this. Or if you just want to see a great movie see this! I was very surprised at how excellent this movie turned out, and everyone else will be too! Seriously, if you want great, check it out! 9.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dark, edgy, twisted, effective, clever, intense, and blackly comic - one of the best "evil child" films I've seen. It's brilliantly cast - Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard are top-notch as usual, but what really stood out where the natural performances director Jaume Collet- Serra was able to get from the child actors. Usually child actors are painful to watch, but 12- year-old Isabelle Fuhrman gives a terrifying, chilling performance that is worthy of praise. Aryana Engineer in her screen debut as the deaf little sister Max is adorable and almost steals the show in every scene. The stylish cinematography, editing, and sound are fantastic as well. I saw Orphan at a packed advance screening and the audience had a blast. Collet-Serra knows how to pull the strings and engage the audience, as they were screaming and laughing at all the right moments. There are plenty of fun and playful tension-relieving scenes, and several cathartic moments when the audience erupted into cheers. When the credits rolled the audience even applauded. The second showing I went to was just as receptive - the audience went nuts. They were collectively screaming, cheering, yelling at the screen, cringing, applauding, and enthusiastically welcoming the comic relief. One guy commented afterwards: "I never get scared by movies but that was the scariest movie I've ever seen." Audience participation for both screenings I went to were very high. The film improves upon second viewing, with the knowledge of the twist. I was able to focus more on details and clues, and the anticipation of my favorite scenes made for a much more rewarding experience. It's even more chilling and cathartic the second time around.It's far from perfect though - there are way too many predictable jump/false scares, with the soundtrack blaring to try to startle the viewer. The last part of the movie becomes a slasher flick replete with clichés and a one-liner. There is a talky scene where Esther reveals herself to her adoptive mother that is totally unneeded, as well as a crucial line regarding Danny, the older son, which really should've been cut. It's also a bit long at 2 hours - for an exploitative "B" movie this is unusual, although time is devoted to character development. Esther is multi-dimensional and even sympathetic at times - I would love to see a prequel based on her character.Orphan is definitely not for kids - aside from the "anti-adoption" angle, there is plenty of dangerous imitable behavior. The violence committed by and toward children is shocking, realistic, and brutal. This is a ballsy film that throws kids into horrific ordeals.It may be a "B" movie, but it's a damn good one that knows its audience. The basic idea is nothing new (except for the unexpected twist), but you knew that from the trailer and synopsis. If you were still interested or if you're a horror fan that is able to look past some clichés and logical jumps in exchange for horrific chills, you'll have a fun time. The phenomenal child performances alone are enough to recommend Orphan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellet Horror Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have not seen a decent horror film in a long time, but this one is definitely worth the money. Be sure to use the restrooms before the start of the movie, as it is very riveting and suspenseful. Except for one sex scene between the husband and wife, this film can be viewed by mature children accompanied by an adult. It is very well written, and well-balanced. Personally I found this film very entertaining, suspenseful, and the plot cleverly written. Without getting into too much detail and ruining it for everyone else, this movie is in a category in which the story could become true in the future. Isabel Furhman did a great job starring as an orphan adopted by a couple who was looking to fill a void in the family due to an earlier tragedy. Her ability to manipulate her siblings as well as her adoptive father, thoroughly frustrates the mother. As the movie progresses, her manipulative abilities become more apparent and deadly. This is a must-see movie and I said money well spent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One word - Impressive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every once in a while a film seems destined to slip under the radar either by poor promotion or a trailer that makes the viewer go "meh". Orphan is one of those flicks that, while benefiting from a decent studio push, simply didn't impart any compelling reason to check it out based on the trailer, which is too bad because this is actually one tight little thriller.Directed by Spain's Jaume Collet-Serra (House of Wax), it tells the story of Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman), a 9-year old Russian orphan who is adopted by Kate and John Coleman (Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard) , a decision motivated in part by the stillborn birth of their third child.An oddball from the start, Esther at first charms the Colemans with her personality, artistic flair, and independence, however it's apparent that there's more going on with Esther than meets the eye. She quickly forms a bond with Max (Aryana Engineer), the couple's deaf daughter, by learning sign language, but is resented by their son Daniel (Jimmy Bennett) who views her with contempt. All of which forms a basis for familial tension, further compounded by the skeletons of Kate's history of alcoholism and John's past infidelity.Telling a surprisingly layered story that strays into uncomfortable territory given how it deals with children in peril, the shiniest gem in this entertaining nugget is that of Isabelle Fuhrman, upon whose performance the movie succeeds or fails. While acting is uniformly top notch throughout, Fuhrman spectacularly establishes herself as one of the most remarkable young talents currently working in cinema, and that's a statement not to be taken lightly. This 12-year-old, who had only one prior film credit on her resume, simply blazes her way across the screen in a performance that ranges from sweet to seductive to psychotic. This is her movie and she makes the most of it, and if she doesn't mature into one of Hollywood's premier stars, I'll be most surprised.Orphan won't win any awards (despite Fuhrman's impressive performance) and might well get passed over by many based on the trailer, all of which is too bad because this is one stray that movie audiences would do well to adopt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Esther is one bad Mother F!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We've seen Orphan many times before (The Bad Seed, The Good Son and, of course, The Omen), yet, somehow, Jaume Collet Serra manages to squeeze something fresh out of an old tale.There's plenty of shocks and also some laughs and Esther's "secret" is, surprisingly, original.Orphan doesn't hold a candle to the aforementioned films, but its better than the more recent ones like Joshua (which, coincidentally, Vera Farmiga also starred in, as well as having the same role (mother)).Don't let the trailer fool you into thinking this is just another "evil kid" movie. Its really much more than that. This is definitely one of the better horror films to come along these days.My audience loved it, and so did I.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply A Good Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had been reading a lot about this film. Internet rumors made "Orphan" sound depraved. Advocacy groups protested that the film is offensive to adoption. "Orphan" is neither depraved nor offensive if you watch it as a thriller.The plot development and character development are on the same level as most Hitchcock films. Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard are excellent as the parents. The three child actors also do a good job. Expert direction by Jaume Collet-Serra and first-rate production values also make this film worth seeing."Orphan" is not a film where you can take your children. However, it is a decent film if you approach it as a thriller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyone expecting a horror film will most likely give this a 5 star rating or below. All others will be thoroughly entertained. Orphan is an INTENSE drama... full of surprises and a bit of suspense.. would have been more suspenseful for me if I had not gathered story details beforehand. Even knowing the score, I give it high marks as its execution is brilliant. The acting is flawless on all parts and I would not at all be surprised if this one picked up an award or three. Finally! Some character development! Finally! A story! Even with the darker bits of the script omitted from the film, this was a good thrill-ride. Think DRAMA and you will be pleased. There's something wrong with Esther... Haha, an understatement to say the least. Great tagline!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Orphan, the name says very little for what you get to see in the movie. I watched great horrors/thrillers, this movie with mild brutality and refreshingly thrill creates a great impression on audience pulses. Esther, especially, acted terrific in portraying psychotic behavior and the screenplay was just perfect to make it a picture perfect.Be it, the twists introduced in the plot in the later half of the movie or the realistic resemblance of the whole plot, the movie is worth your buck on the big screen. Though the movie was 2hr long, it was a clever move by the director to inject some meaningful comedy into the movie so as to maintain the attention of the audience. An interesting point to note is that audience laughed quite a bit for almost 60% of the movie and then were shocked as the plot took twists and turns. This combination of humor along with shock is what makes this movie a brilliant thriller.All in all the movie was successful in grabbing my attention, believing in such offbeat concepts and lastly giving the worth of my money. Hope you all go watch this terrific movie and feel the heat inside the Air-Conditioned Theaters. My rating for this movie 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overall very indulging, and well done thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Orphan" was a movie that truly did surprised me. I mean I came into this movie honestly not having any idea which direction it would take me, I mean sure it looked good, but then again the 30 second previews made it seem a bit mediocre. When the movie went off I was very pleased by what I had seen. The things I love most about Orphan is how they present and introduce these characters so well. The minute I saw the main couple I couldn't help but take a liking to them, and Esther who very easily steals the show, is incredibly likable. As a matter of fact the thing I do love a lot about the film is how they take their time in the story, I loved how for the first half or so you see Esther adapting to her new surroundings, and I became extremely indulged into this. I also think they balanced out the character of Esther well. I mean this performance, and character, could have easily been portrayed as this over-the-top, annoying, non-intimidating, and non-believable character, but not once do you ever feel that. Also it is very entertaining, and you're hooked from the moment you see this little girl Esther. It was also clever at times, to where you feel a sense of danger as far as the story goes because it's literally like anything can happen. Even if does begin to make you mad for whatever reason, you still can't help but keep watching and wondering. At times it may feel predictable, but they've already presented these characters so well, that you can't but feel that maybe you haven't predicted it. I will say I wished "Orphan" HAD paced itself a little better, I mean they don't immediately jump into the story, but when they do it feels rushed and as if they fear the audience won't care about the characters, when it's not true. Also towards the end the characters start to lose liking, so much so that I couldn't help but look at these characters(in particular the mom and dad) and say "Who are you, and why are you being such an unlikable stereotype!" As a result of the characters acting stupid and stereotypical at this point in the film it just became predictable to an extent where you knew what was going to happen. Last you know I don't know how I felt about the twist, it was done well enough to where it would fit the storyline, but I feel it defeats the shocking, brutal, and thrilling nature of the film. Anyways, overall "Orphan" is one of the better thrillers you'll probably see this year, and even if you're not too big on these kind of films, I still recommend "Orphan"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scary movie yes, but the suspension of belief was not possible. This couple would never have been allowed to adopt a child and were actually lucky still to have their own kids. Mum was a recovering alcoholic who had been guilty of neglect on a previous occasion and had lost a baby of her own just months before?? Father was so dim that it was painful to watch him. He was also an admitted adulterer. The shrink spun nothing but clichés and had already made up her mind about her own patient, er, I think not. She was clearly not a child psychiatrist either.But the father, just how dim can you be. Lots of accidents, not to mention a frigging murder, going on around the new arrival and yet he still did not twig anything was wrong. Even when the kid tried to seduce him he did not catch on that something might be not quite right about this child. And what is this about faces swimming in and out of focus after a couple of glasses of wine? Puhleeze.Nope, the scare factor was there, but the movie itself was totally illogical and irrational.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm about two thirds of the way through watching this film, and I must say it's really annoying me how the director constantly relies on the technique of using scary music and odd camera angles to build false tension. Then, just when you think something really scary is going to happen, it turns out to be a false alarm.There's a word for this cinematic technique, I forget what it is. Regardless, it's a cheap substitute for using actual story elements to build real tension, and this movie has used up all of my good will by relying on it every couple of minutes.I'm going to watch the rest right now, and something really spectacular will need to happen in order for me to feel good about having watched.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cliché</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So there are two good things about this film and I will start with them. First, it creates a good atmosphere and causes the viewer emotions of sympathy for the "good guys" and fear and anger for the "bad guy". Second, it contains a clever twist that could not be foreseen, although some guesses will come close. Then, there's the bad things. This film is full of every cliché in the book. Every character you have ever seen in a similar film in the past is present. The one person who suspects the truth but whose skeletons in the closet make them non-credible. The person who is completely ignorant to the truth and thinks the other is crazy. The one who knows the truth but is swayed into not telling anything. And the one who decides to expose the truth and pays for it. And the villain who is evil for the sake of being evil and does evil things because they are so very evil. If one removes the sentiment of deja-vu that this film casts on its viewers, what is left is a film that maintains a certain degree of interest but has nothing to offer that has not been done before and better. Granted, the acting is credible, the cinematography is good and the ending is satisfying. However, there are just so many clichés in this film that half-way through, any experienced viewer of the genre will have figured the rest of the film out, with the exception of the one clever twist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't stand "horror" flicks where all kinds of really suspenseful and horrible manipulations happen because all the characters are either too stupid to catch on or too chicken to do anything about it.The whole "deftly manipulative sociopath" formula only works when the surrounding characters are of a believable intelligence and psychological depth. Here, nuh-uh. Check out the "dad" in particular. This moron is supposedly a successful architect. Right.But a smart supporting cast wouldn't have worked here, because guess what? The villain ain't too bright either.Most times I sit down with a flick like this, I can be a good sport about it and get entertainment value from the giggles and forehead slaps. But this one takes itself too seriously for that, AND has the gall to go on for two hours. So it was just an irritating waste of time. I'm kicking myself for sticking it to the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this film really wanting to love it. And I can honestly say that certain aspects of it I DID love. First the good: The basic premise is interesting. Captivating, actually. And the "twist" ending certainly comes as a surprise, thanks in large part to an absolutely stunning performance by the titular child actress. She pulls of a VERY creepy blend of smothered maturity with a sort of innocence.Most of the acting is more than passable, particularly on the part of the other children in the film.Where the problems come in is with motivation and plot depth. The writers felt the need to include a "troubled relationship" as the basis for this particular family unit. However, they went overboard and in the end created a completely dysfunctional relationship between the parents.Where this creates a serious problem is with the supposed adoption. This couple should, and would, have been refused as potential candidates for adoption. The previously lost child, the alcoholism issues in the past, and infidelity, were all serious stumbling blocks to this end.The writers also felt the need to write the father character as a total jerk... hey, let's not mince words. What happens in the end, well, I almost felt it was well-deserved.Another problem with the characterizations is that these two adults were so obviously NOT ideal parent material. How many parents could look their child in the eyes and say "are you sure that no one did anything bad to you?" and NOT recognize the look of sheer terror in that child's face?There are people who WILL be very queasy and uncomfortable towards the end of this film. There is definitely material there that makes you question the sexualization of children in our society.So a 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Orphan" is sometimes regarded as a horror film, but in my view it is an example of that sub-genre of the thriller which I have come to regard as the "?? from Hell" movie, a type of film which enjoyed great popularity in the late eighties and early nineties following the success of "Fatal Attraction". The basic premise of such films is that the life of the protagonist is turned upside-down by the arrival of a stranger who initially seems friendly but who quickly turns out to be dangerous, generally a murderer or psychopath. In most films this stranger is an adult, but this film brings us the adopted-child-from-Hell. The expression "from Hell", incidentally, is not to be taken literally; "Orphan" might start out like an unacknowledged remake of "The Omen", but the child's evil is explained by a plot twist which has nothing to do with Satan or the supernatural.Like a number of recent American films, this one was actually shot in Canada, presumably for financial reasons, but owing to the average American cinema-goer's lack of interest in anything that happens north of the forty-ninth parallel the film-makers were forced to pretend, through the use of Connecticut licence plates, that the action is taking place in New England. After their third child is stillborn, John and Kate Coleman, adopt Esther a 9-year-old Russian girl, from the local orphanage. Unfortunately for them, Esther turns out to be a badly behaved little girl, one whose bad behaviour goes far beyond the normal bounds of childish mischief. By the time the film is over, she will have killed several people and attempted to kill several others. The film has been criticised for a lack of realism, and it certainly seems strange that John and Kate are permitted to adopt a child in the first place, given their obviously unsuitable background. Kate is recovering from alcoholism, and we learn that she was at fault in an incident when her own daughter, Maxine, nearly drowned in the garden pond. It also seems strange how slow John is to accept that there is anything wrong with the behaviour of his adopted daughter; Kate grows suspicious at a much earlier stage. I was interested by the suggestion of another reviewer that John's reluctance could be explained by the fact that he is, at a subconscious level at least, sexually attracted to Esther, but idea this was, for obvious reasons, something the film-makers were unable to pursue. The idea that an otherwise respectable husband and father might harbour latent paedophile tendencies is something audiences would find extremely disturbing. The final twist (I won't say what it is) has also struck many as implausible, but at least it is a twist which, if one can accept it, helps to make sense of what has gone before. Too many films these days, especially thrillers, end in a surprise twist which makes everything which has preceded it seem like nonsense.The film does have its good points. The 12-year-old Isabelle Fuhrman is excellent as Esther, in some ways wise beyond her years yet also strange, emotionless and creepy. Incidentally, most of the best villains in "?.. from Hell" movies are female, such as Glenn Close in "Fatal Attraction", Rebecca de Mornay in "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" or Jennifer Jason Leigh in "Single White Female". There are films of this type with male villains, ("Pacific Heights", "Bad Influence", "Domestic Disturbance") but they tend to be less memorable. Another good performance comes from another child-actress, eight-year-old Aryana Engineer as the deaf-mute Maxine; both girls, in fact, stand out more than any of the adults.The film is also suitably atmospheric, being shot against a snowbound winter landscape, even if it does make it seem as though winter in Connecticut lasts all year. (At least it makes a change from all those films, "Housesitter" and The Cider House Rules" being recent examples, which suggest that the New England climate consists of twelve months of permanent autumn). My own criticism of the film would be of some of the social attitudes revealed in it. The Cold War may be over, but there is still a tendency in America, and to some extent in Britain and Western Europe as well, to regard Eastern Europe with suspicion. Anywhere east of the former Iron Curtain is regarded as a strange, mysterious land whose inhabitants pose some vague threat to the West, whether by stealing our jobs, dragging us into their internecine tribal quarrels or by exporting their criminal elements to us. The film taps into these fears; it is significant that the menacing Esther claims to be Russian and is actually from Estonia, a part of the map which, as far as most Westerners are concerned, might still have "here be dragons" marked on it. The film also taps into some of our anxieties about adoption, specifically middle-class fears that adopted children, especially if originally from working-class stock, are likely to be contaminated by "bad blood", or inherited criminal propensities. Even if they do not actually suffer from any such genetic taint, there is always a fear that such children will never be able to bond with their adopted parents in the same way as they would with their biological parents. Overall "Orphan" is a reasonably well-made film, a tense and gripping, if occasionally implausible, thriller, with a couple of good acting performances. The prejudices it reveals, however, are worrying. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Orphan (2009)The GoodThe confident performance by Isabelle Fuhrman as Ester. It must be added her accent is faultless. The convincing performance of Aryana Engineer as the deaf daughter.The direction of the child actors by Jaume Collet-Serra.The BadThe contrived plot. The dependence on cliché. The foolishness of the adult characters. The slide into genre formula and finally the unsatisfying twist.The Cop-OutThe idea of a child trying to steal away an adult male from his wife is an interesting one. "The Hand That Rocks The Cradle" (1992) could well have been an influence on this movie but the role reversal from a psycho nanny to an adopted child has resulted in scaring the filmmakers away from exploring more 'controversial' issues.In fact the 'child' does successfully evict the wife from the marital bed and the Father is a willingly accomplice. Here is the moment were the film could have elevated itself into something more challenging for the audience but consciously failed to do so.Could the Fathers sexual desire for his adopted daughter have been a reason why he supports her almost unconditionally against his own wife? The question is posed but left unexplored. If the Father had in fact had sexual relations with his new daughter, he would have been easier to manipulate and the 'twist' would have in some ways excused his 'transgression'.Sex is still a Hollywood taboo and especially under-aged sex. Stanley Kubrick tried to explore this subject back in 1962 with "Lolita" but he was ahead of his time and the film suffered from imposed restrictions and censorship. While murder and torture have continued to become more and more graphic, the exploration of sexual drives, as a narrative force, have remained largely untapped. The last movie to show sex as part of the narrative arch was David Cronenberg's "A History Of Violence" from 2005. Judging from the response to that movie, it was only the explicit sexual acts and not the graphic violence that upset the 'American' audience. It feels that the core premise of "Orphan", that a sexually predatory child tries to usurp the role of wife by any means necessary, was exorcised because of "political correctness". The father could not be seen to desire his new daughter or act upon that desire yet his actions compound some guilt.With "Orphan", the slasher/psycho formula limits the exploration of more profound themes and the 'twist' is an apology for the child's murderous behaviour. If the filmmakers never wanted to explore the theme of sex between an adult and a minor then why make it a contributing factor to the resulting bloody violence?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>why did I waste my time??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why did I watch this movie?? Almost every single movie that has this type of premise is the exact same movie no matter what age or gender the antagonist is. The "bad guy" is hurting or killing animals and people at the beginning and then there is always the person who knows that something is wrong who can't ever seem to get anyone to believe them.This movie, unfortunately, followed the EXACT same formula and except for the "twist" at the end this was completely unoriginal and just a paint by numbers movie. The only thing I liked about it was that Peter Sarsgaard got what he deserved after treating his wife like a dog and completely distrusting her to the point that I wanted to jump into the screen and smack the mess out of him...also he apparently cheated on Kate so he had no right to be that much of a jerk to her.Also, as a therapist I can only say that Kate's therapist in the movie was completely unethical and should have her license revoked by the way she acted. No true therapist who has had any real training (and she was, in fact, a doctor!) would treat their client as she treated Kate. All in all the movie was not terrible but I've seen it a thousand times. I just can't stand when so many people are hurt by someone or something that plays the innocent card and has everyone who has not been hurt believe in their innocence.Apparently in "movie world" people are a lot less intelligent than in the real world. I only saw this movie because I was told that it was original and worth seeing by a respected critic and I have to say that that was some bad advice that has made me learn not to trust this person when it comes to his advice for movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>dude seriously, i cannot believe you guys all liked this movie. I just saw it like 2 minutes ago and it was probably the worst thing i've seen all year. And i saw transformers 2 this year... so thats saying a lot. For one, there was probably more unbelievable things in this movie than any other movie i've ever seen. Peter sarsgaard was the biggest ... idiot EVER in this film. I've never wanted to castrate someone more in my life. The kids were both idiots, even the deaf one... if someone threatens my balls with an exacto knife, im tellin someone about it. They covered NOTHING about the adoption, all the sudden the kid is in the house. Later on in the movie they start doing background checks, you think they would do that before they ACTUALLY ADOPT THE CHILD!!! Honestly, one of the worst films i've seen all year. I don't care if this contains spoilers because im doing everyone a favor that reads this that hasn't seen the film. The diologue is unbelievable and terribly written. You don't like any of the characters, and actually, you hate them all. No part of this story makes any sense, and the twist at the end is surprising, yet ridiculous.AND WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH THE ORPHAN ALL THE SUDDEN WANTING TO SLEEP WITH PETER SARSGAARD!!! AND THEN HIM ENTERTAINING THE THOUGHT OF ACTUALLY HAVING A DISCUSSION ABOUT WHY HE Shouldn't. COMPLETELY RIDICULOUS.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's Something Wrong with this Movie..(Feel like I've seen it all before)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**** SPOILERS!!*****I was advised to watch this movie a it was apparently "amazing and bloody terrifying" According to a friend of mine. Well,I love terrifying, and it's been ages since I've seen any decent horror movies appear on the big screen- so I jumped at the chance to watch this one.OK,this movie actually wasn't THAT bad. Having said that however, I personally didn't find it too amazing either.The first two things that came to mind with this film were:1.The very last line is clearly stolen from the Ring 2 and the situation in which it appears is also way too similar(In fact,the whole evil girl with questionable history thing has been done in an all too similar fashion enough times by now..)2.It is in fact almost an almost identical story line to "The good son" with the attempted husband stealing,wife bumping off antics of "The Hand That Rocks The Cradle" and the token creepy screwed up girl with no apparent history and zany mother from "Ring"/"The Ring"or,"Ju-on"/"The Grudge" series.I decided that maybe it was a bit harsh to overly judge the movie purely based on these facts,so I decided to forget that I had seen this all before and look at it for it's own merit and individuality. But it still sadly left me cold in the end. The characters seemed to stumble their way through the entire movie, switching personalities ever five minutes to suit the scene. Hints such as the "cheating" husband seem to have a point but then prove red herrings,dropped from the plot line as soon as they are mentioned leaving several unanswered questions that would have been usefully wrapped up by the end if not before.There comes a revelation that the mother is apparently a recovering /recovered alcoholic, but the scene where she has it out with the therapist seems a bit too harshly played from the husband's point of view.He goes from being this exceptionally loving husband, having had a few niggles with his wife-to suddenly pulling an emotional 360 and completely turning on her...Which brings me to my next point,The father then allows himself to get totally steaming while Left in the care of his two other children and almost seduced by Esther who is suddenly wearing a flirty grown up outfit and shed loads of makeup.I also cannot get how on earth these parents could not see what this girl actually was doing wrong. They clearly huge signs and the distress being cause to their children but still ignored it and allowed them to be left alone with her.The mother, who does actually start to suspect Esther is, shall we say, "not right" from near enough the word go, still fumbles along blindly watching it all unfold up to a point. Let's look at this closer: 1.They didn't even think to fully wait for her history before adopting her. (not to mention an alcoholic who had been in jail for neglect being allowed to adopt anyway so easily..?)2.Esther was extremely violent and dangerous,had been in a mental institute,where staff were fully aware of her "Secret". She then killed her adopted families and yet she somehow(not mentioned) got out and managed to get into an orphanage with no other known history and be re adopted. And finally-yes,it's the"dramatic" twist.I Kind of guessed just from basic reviews saying it would be an obvious one,and confirmed it within less than 15 minutes into the movie itself to be honest! And going back to the whole over looking thing- She was examined by a DOCTOR. Who did not expect she was not a 9 year old child?? She looks anything but 9 without all her get-up on! There were some redeeming qualities however-such as great acting by Isabelle Fuhrman who plays Esther,quite a challenging role for someone so young and she pulls of the accent very well too.There are also some jumpy and slightly unnerving bits ( I won't spoil any more!) all of which left me quite on edge. The paintings were quite creepy and cleverly done too.But overall I was fairly disappointed by the whole affair, it could have been played out so much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Generic, by-the-numbers suspenser</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In motion pictures, it's a widespread belief that children are the embodiment of pure evil. Perhaps not all kids are the spawn of Satan, but horror filmmakers realise that evil disguised behind the eyes of a seemingly innocent child is an effective way of amplifying the scare factor. Into this genre now steps 2009's Orphan. Instead of being an overly effective suspense piece, however, this is a predominantly boring, meandering film which suffers from repetition and poor scripting. If the creepy kid horror genre is in need of resuscitation, this subpar affair will not provide it.The plot, in a nutshell, concerns Kate (Farmiga) and John (Sarsgaard). They're married with two kids, but Kate's recent miscarriage has put a strain on their relationship that's already burdened by John's infidelity and Kate's battle with alcoholic tendencies. Seeking to introduce a new child into their family, the couple decide to adopt. During a visit to the local orphanage, John connects with a strange yet astonishingly intelligent 9-year-old Russian girl named Esther (Fuhrman). As you may or may not have guessed, Esther is no ordinary child, and seems to have been specially ordered from the Eastern European School of Creepy Kids. She distinguishes herself from those around her not only because she's mature beyond her years, but because she also appears trapped in a 19th Century time-warp with her fondness for Victorian doll dresses and ribbons. For her introductory scenes, Esther of course appears beguiling and innocent. Once she's adopted by John and Kate, the film then sets out to defy our preconceptions of how eerie and horrifying this little girl can be. And good heavens, is she creepy.If it means anything - and in dealing with the consistently awful creepy kid subgenre, it likely does - Orphan is not the worst of its kind. It's atmospheric enough and contains a number of generally unsettling sequences, not to mention there's a solid attempt to delve into the characters' lives so that they comes across as more than blood-spurting automatons. Yet, in spite of these strengths, the film remains a ridiculous, by-the-numbers horror show. Spanish director Jaume Collet- Serra poorly orchestrates so many clichéd "boo!" moments designed to make the audience jump (such as mirror reveals), on top of faux scares in which a viewer believes they're about to jump but - surprise! - nothing's there. The repetition is irritating and laughable. These moments are hardly effective, too, since the music, with its rising disharmonies and sudden crashes, suggests there's a "scare" on the way. Orphan is also predictable from a narrative standpoint. It's easy to guess Esther's next move well before she makes it. And for the climax, the filmmakers call upon the most embarrassing genre convention imaginable: giving superhuman abilities to a weak character. At least the final showdown is relatively entertaining. Highly predictable, yet still satisfying nonetheless.In addition to all this, the characters tend to act in whatever way serves the plot best. For example, it makes no sense for Kate and John to adopt Esther when she's clearly out of synch with the rest of the family. Furthermore, Kate is sometimes a raging alcoholic, but at other times an overly caring mother. Infidelity issues are raised in the first half, but they hardly surface again. At times, John is a trusting, loving husband and father, but at other times he's both ignorant and disloyal. Not to mention these characters are so stupid. What parents never see their child undress? What parents allow their child to skip dental appointments, and basically live in solitude in a mansion-like home? Why would no-one question Esther's ribbon accessories or her anti- social behaviour? Furthermore, John sets a new standard for Horror Movie Dumbass - he's bizarrely enamoured with this Russian girl (even when she rats him out for flirting with their neighbour!) and ignores his wife's desperate warnings. All of this is coupled with a major violation of Roger Ebert's main tenets for an unsuccessful narrative: if the main plot-point could be easily resolved - in this case, a mandatory medical examination should've been conducted by a state-run child protective services agency prior to approving the adoption - everything falls apart.Credit where credit is due - in the acting department, things aren't too shabby at all. Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard share solid chemistry which makes their relationship believable. Isabelle Fuhrman is a terrific find: she's cute and charming, which makes her behaviour far more unsettling. The convincing Russian accent adds to her unnerving presence as well. For a horror movie of this type to boast such terrific performances is nothing short of a miracle. Yet, if one sets aside the solid acting, the interesting final plot twist, a few effective set- pieces and the fact it still works on a pretty basic level, Orphan remains a generic, cliché-ridden suspense film that strains credulity to breaking break. If you're in the midst of a strained marriage and are considering adopting a Soviet child, you may find this to be a terrific horror outing. As for everyone else...nah, it ain't worth the effort to get through these two distinctly mediocre hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A chilling tale with a memorable performance by the kid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An American couple in their 30s, who can't get over the tragedy of losing their third child, go ahead &amp; adopt a nine-year old Russian girl, Esther to make up for the void in their lives. In all outward appearances, Esther is a silent, well behaved, responsible, kind &amp; sweet &amp; pretty much the kind of child you would like to have in your life.This is one of the very best 'evil child' films I have seen. Isabelle Fuhrman, who plays Esther, is brilliant with her malevolent characterization as is Aryana Engineer who plays the part of Maxiene. Kate and John Coleman (Oscar nominee Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard) have given a high calibre performance here. Daniel (Jimmy Bennet) plays their son.Let me be clear, I thought this was going to be a ghost horror film. I never saw that coming. It was a complete shock to me. I haven't been that scared or shocked in quite a while, so this film completely delivers in all aspects. The layers of the story is peeled one by one as the story unfolds by director Jaume Collet-Serra. Although everybody's performances were very good, none stands out long after you have watched this, except Isabelle Fuhrman. This girl delivers a powerhouse performance that will have you scared for quite a while. The other actors only feel like props in front of this girl's brilliance. Aryana who plays the deaf child, Maxiene is also brilliant. The anti-adoption feeling this movie gives you after you have watched it is the only drawback, &amp; it shows it delivers where it wanted to..:) Of course, without all the drama, it wouldn't have impacted this much, so don't watch this expecting a bloodfest. This is a thriller which delivers horror.Watch it, you definitely won't regret it. This is truly a gift to the horror genre.9/10 -Girish, 20</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chilling Tale of Obsession</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was an unexpected surprise, a tale of suspense and horror, built around one of the most malevolent villains to come out of cinema in the last 75 years. For a moment, I kept thinking that if the bad guy here went up against the demon of "The Exorcist" or good old Jason or Freddy, those guys wouldn't stand a chance against this villain. Evil apparently lurks in the most unexpected places, and it is behind one interesting facade here.As the story unfolds, we discover that Esther is full of surprises and that there is very little she is not willing to do to prove a point or protect herself. As those actions become more intense and we cringe as we wait for the next deathly action to take place, we also marvel at the complexity of the story, for this is no ordinary horror thriller. It builds upon the demons that have been haunting a family for the last few years.Beautifully photographed and scored, and directed with strong confidence, the film never stops surprising you and doesn't let you go until the very last minute. The most impressive factor is the acting of all the principals involved, for this is not a movie that relies solely in special effects, a loud soundtrack, or quick cuts to create an oppressive atmosphere where evil thrives.It is somewhat original, hypnotic, and perfectly able to show the various degrees and faces of violence and hatred, throw in a twist of psychosis and one of the scariest characters since Hannibal Lectoer, and we almost wish there was a sequel in the works. A classic is born.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best straight horror film in quite a while</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was younger, I was a scaredy-cat when it came to a great many movies. I saw Peter Jackson's The Frighteners at a young age which left me with a solid week worth of sleepless nights, I was terrified of the evil vines in Jumanji and I even had a fear of serial snipers after watching Dirty Harry. However as I grew, I became braver and less haunted even by horror films until I finally became numb to almost everything. Certainly the odd scene of a fright flick would give me a start and perhaps even a bad dream, but few films have been able to recapture the restless nights of my youth. Until I saw Orphan.While perhaps not as great a compliment as it once was with Hollywood's iron grip on the horror industry, Orphan is the downright creepiest and most frightening pure horror film in a many, many years. The Orphanage (similar name a coincidence, I assure you) from last year gave me some haunted evenings but is more of a dramatic thriller. Countless films have capitalized on the evil child angle as a platform for the scares, in fact with the now even more relatively awful The Unborn coming out this very year. But those who have crafted such a film intelligently and to a genuinely disturbing end are sparse and in between. In the case of Orphan a much of this success is due to young Isabelle Furhman, who gives an incredibly intense and disturbingly authentic portrayal as Esther, the Russian orphan. Complimenting that role are four other outstanding performances by Aryana Engineer and Jimmy Bennett as Esther's now sister and brother, and Vera Farmiga and Peter Starsgaard as the adopting parents. If there have been better performances in a horror film I haven't been privy.Finally recovering after the devastating loss of their unborn child, Kate and John Coleman (Farmiga and Starsgaard) feel it is time to welcome some new life into their home and settle on the different but charming and incredible gifted 10 year old Esther. Things could not be better for this broken family, Esther bonds immediately with young Max who is a mute, and fits wonderfully in with her two loving parents. But then, strange occurrences begin to arise, and Esther always seems to be there and soon Kate begins to think, as the movie's tagline of the film implies, there's something wrong with her.In almost every horror film ever made, we have a central protagonist who is scoffed at by everyone and their mother at their wild claims of a killer, an alien, strange occurrences etc. In Orphan it is Kate who is the sole voice of desperation, but what makes this film work besides the wonderful acting job by Farmiga is the back-story of loss and her former alcoholism which sheds doubts on her suspicions. This coupled with Esther's seemingly endless cunning and manipulation of Kate's children makes for a frustratingly disturbing series of events. Director Juan Collet-Serra, who helmed 2005's House of Wax, chooses to keep the gore restrained, tension high and focus on some equally tragic human elements about a broken marriage and what broke it apart. Collet-Serra holds no punches, and is unafraid to go all the way into truly disturbing territory and includes many elements of the anti-Hollywood horror film and is fairly light on the clichés. The final twist is shocking (if you say you knew it you're lying) and brilliantly explains all the former questions the audience demands. Be warned, just because Orphan is not as bloody as some makes it no less disturbing and I applaud its ability to give me an uneasy sleep and a shot of much needed nostalgia.Read all my reviews at www.simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too slow for its own good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vera and John Coleman (Vera Farminga and Peter Sarsgaard) adopt a 9 year old girl named Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman). They already have two other kids--a younger girl named Max (Aryana Engineer) and an older boy named Daniel (Jimmy Bennett). We slowly (TOO slowly) discover that there's something wrong with Esther and it leads to horror and murder.**DEFINITE PLOT SPOILERS** Well-done but just too long (123 minutes). This idea has been done before ("The Bad Seed", "The Good Son") so this movie seems to drag everything out. It's also uncomfortable to watch with children always being threatened or (possibly) killed. In one particularly idiotic oversight one kid's fate is left hanging in the air at the end of the movie! I should mention that it's not a blood and guts horror film (except for one VERY bloody stabbing) but, at the end, it turns into a boring, by the numbers stalking where the killer keeps coming back again and again and again. Also the explanation about Esther at the end doesn't really make much sense but it IS original. On the plus side the acting is good especially by Farmiga and Fuhrman. Only Sarsgaard disappoints but that's because the script makes his character seem like a total idiot! There's also a GREAT moment where Farmiga slaps Fuhrman down (my audience broke out in applause). So--it has its moments but is very disturbing to watch at times and just drags on. I give it a 6.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As good as I thought it would be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has been advertised to death and in this case there is truth in advertising. It is a good, first class thriller with genuine scares that also proves Hollywood scriptwriters can come up with a unique twist and they surely do in this film, if it weren't for the IMDb message board it would have been a shock to me but I learned what it was months before the film was released. I was also surprised that this movie isn't as graphically violent as a lot of the others that I have seen this year. This shows that the filmmakers knew what they were doing in creating a real thriller instead of a cheap slasher. I also wanted to mention that I am tired of people harping on the fact that this film deals with an adopted child. I didn't find that theme offensive at all. Its only a movie people. Leave your social conscience at the front door of the theater and just have a good time. The killer-kiddie theme has been played before in The Bad Seed (a classic) and The Good Son (not so good). Unlike MacAuley Culkin, Isabelle Fuhrman really can act. She is a true acting prodigy for one so young and I think she has a promising future. She really does a good job at playing a Jekyll-Hyde part. When we first meet Esther she seems so charming and intelligent you wish all kids were like that. That makes her true evil nature all the more chilling. They point out in the film that sociopathic killers can seem very charming on the surface. Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard (I didn't make up these names) also do a fine job as the unsuspecting parents. Kate and John have both undergone the tragedy of losing a baby (Kate has a horrible nightmare about it in the opening that really will shock you) These two decent people decide to adopt but boy do they make the wrong choice. The noted character actress CCH Pounder plays the nun in charge of the orphanage who arranges for Esther's adoption. She is best known for her role on The Shield. I just feel sorry for the "Pounding" the poor sister takes in the end. It is at this point in my review that I wanted to take my hat off to Farmiga who by far does the best acting job in the film, this very fine young actress really makes you feel this woman's goodness, her grief, her personal demons and her fear that there is something wrong with Esther. The character I have a problem with is Sarsgaard's. I know that in these killer kid films the adults have to be oblivious, but he is as dumb as two rocks in a bucket! All the evidence is right in front of him but he just doesn't listen. SPOILER ALERTS MAJOR SPOILER ALERTS you've been warned watch out! Don't read any further if you want to see the film. I read an early script adaptation someone sent me and they did make changes in the ending and I thought they were for the better. First of all, Daniel (Jimmy Bennett) lives! Let me repeat Daniel lives, I want to assure all of you of that the way Charles Dickens assured A Christmas Carol readers that Tiny Tim lived. Jimmy Bennett does a good job of playing the middle child who immediately senses Esther isn't what she seems. I felt so bad in that scene where Esther held a box cutter to his...ahem and made him wet his pants. Also the twist about Esther is really original it may be the most original plot twist this year. She is really a murderous 32 year old with a dwarfism disorder who only looks like a child. I feel bad for Kate that she loses John but at least her two kids are still alive. Also the final showdown between Kate and Esther in the house and at the frozen lake is terrific, suspenseful and chilling. Its like Alfred Hitchcock could have directed it. If your going to see one thriller make it Orphan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Orphan' is about as dark and disturbing as any other movie about a couple who adopted a seemingly polite child.Esther may seem like a smart 9-year old who behaves well and has a great talent at painting.Like any other movie about a child who seems polite, there's always something wrong with the child.It just goes to show that there IS something wrong with Esther.Do you want to know all of the bad things that she did in the movie? She kills a nun by bashing her in the head with a hammer over and over.She lights a tree house on fire while there is a boy on top of it screaming for help.She smothers a child to death with a pillow.She even seduces her father.On a scale of 1 to 10 of how crazy Esther is, she scores a positive 11.I have never seen a movie as dark or disturbing as 'Orphan'. It is an excellent horror movie, but some of the scenes were so gruesome that I'd figure that I would have nightmares for a week.What really made the movie good was it's twists and turns.There are so many of them, that this movie seems like an older version of other thrillers like 'The Hand That Rocks The Cradle' and 'The Omen'.If you're going to see this movie, you better have a strong stomach, because this movie is just plain crazy, in a good way.Take my word for it and whatever you do, never let your children see this movie.I'm 13 years old so I should know if this movie is too grizzly and shocking for kids.You are in for 123 minutes that will have you shaking once the movie is over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Kid Ain't Kidding.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kids are scary to begin with. Little adults with big heads who pretend they don't know what we're saying. They're like clowns: some people find them fun; most know they're evil.So in ORPHAN, when an upscale couple with two children adopt a 9-year-old orphan with scary theme music, familial bliss is not in the flow chart.Vera Farmiga stars as mother Kate, whose checkered history of alcoholism and a miscarriage - big baggage right there! - is exploited by cherubic orphan child, Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman) when she is adopted by the family.With a strange Russian accent and outdated clothes, Esther also terrorizes the couple's son Daniel (Jimmy Bennett) and threatens their little deaf daughter, Max, into becoming her accomplice. Aryana Engineer plays Max in a priceless performance; deaf in real life, conveying intense, complex emotions on her face without words, and cutie cute cute). Husband John (Peter Sarsgaard), seemingly Xanaxed to the gills, never notices a thing.12-year-old Isabelle Fuhrman, mature beyond her years, gives a studied, sinister, Kevin-Spacey-like performance as Esther, making Kate look crazy in all the old formulaic ways: releases the handbrake when little Max is in the car alone, making it look like Kate is irresponsible, cutting Kate's roses around the shrine of her miscarried child, causing Kate to attack her in front of witnesses and - most disturbingly - breaking her own arm in a vice and accusing Kate of doing it.Then things get REALLY psycho. Killing nuns and burning down treehouses and breaking a rival kid's legs... it still doesn't wake Peter Sarsgaard, although he does find enough wankergy to plonk voluptuous Vera - only to get busted by Esther - twice.After she gives Esther merely a few rudimentary lessons, piano tutor Kate walks in on Esther playing Tchaikovsky. "You told me you couldn't play!" Esther replies: "No, I thought you would like to teach me. It must be frustrating for a person who likes music as much as you to have a son who is uninterested and a daughter who is deaf." Unintentionally hilarious because it has been established the son is a Guitar Hero freak, which means - contrary to popular belief - you are uninterested in music.Directed by Spanish Jaume Collet-Serra (whose dubious claim to fame is directing Paris Hilton in HOUSE OF WAX, 2005), the niggling problem with ORPHAN is that only during the neat climactic twist is Esther's motivation revealed - throughout the movie, we watch her perform incredibly dastardly deeds (which includes murder) and wonder what drives her, as she is being treated like a princess. Then again, kids be evil an' all dat...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little too long, but very creepy!...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't know much about this film before seeing it, but the write-up did intrigue me slightly so I thought I'd give it a go. It's a little too long for my liking, but quite well made if a little cliché in places. I guess I should have done a little more research, but then again I have uncovered the odd 'gem' this way in the past. But I digress; let's have a look at what Orphan is all about.Kate and John Coleman have just lost their baby, a daughter they were going to call Jessica. She was dead at birth. Needing something to fill the void, they decide to adopt. By the way, they already have two children, a boy, Daniel, and a girl, Max, who is partially deaf and uses sign language to communicate. The family are comfortably off and live in a big house in the countryside. Visiting an orphanage, John meets a nine year old girl called Esther. She is originally from Russia and is delightful. He convinces Kate that she's the one and they bring her home a few weeks later. Unfortunately Esther is not what she seems and the Coleman's are in for a very bumpy ride as she sets about her plan for them. I'm not going to say any more on the plot, I believe that should be enough to intrigue you.Although it was very well made I did have a bit of a problem sympathising with the Coleman's. It seems they have everything going for them in terms of lifestyle, job, financial security etc., but somehow that isn't enough for them. It's not as if their characters come over as particularly nurturing either, Kate a recovering alcoholic and John has been known to have a roving eye in the past. But if you can get past all that there's a pretty creepy story behind it all.Decent performances all round, particularly from; Vera Farmiga as Kate, Peter Sarsgaard as John and especially from Isabelle Fuhrman as Esther, she was particularly creepy. Also worth a mention were; CCH Pounder as Sister Abigail, Jimmy Bennett as Daniel and Aryana Engineer as Max.Putting aside my incomprehension of the reasons for the Coleman's wanting to adopt, I did find the film quite disturbing. Esther particularly so, the way she manipulates situations and how she's always listening in is quite unnerving. As I said at the beginning, it is a little cliché in places and it is way too long but over all quite a sinister tale (glad I watched it in daylight!). Finally a mention for the guys who do the opening and closing credits, very cleverly done IMO, nice work. I guess over all it's recommended, but only just.My Score: 6.1/10</fullReview>

Now I really loved Esther and I really clapped in the theater when she dumped the bratty girl down the slide. The fluorescent paint is a good touch. Now people should realize the movie has a whole sexual climax and the movie's theme is about Esther trying to find her sexuality. We find that out on the twist when we realize she was a 35 year old girl with dwarfism and she wanted to find her sexual manners around men who think she is a girl. And I was really disturbed when the men found the fluorescent paintings in the walls with she and him having sex and all of them are dead except for them. The only reason I gave it an 8 was because of the 2 hours with 3 minutes length and had an unnecessary long character development which almost had me sleeping in the movie theater but then I got woken up by the intensity that followed the the boringness.</fullReview>

We know there is something odd about the freckle faced Russian cutie pie who the Coleman family adopt and take home as an addition to their family, but we are left questioning exactly what that is till the very end of the film when something quite unexpected is revealed to us. As a viewer of suspense films that depict supernatural elements at work, most viewers might be tricked into thinking that there is something ghostly or spectral about Esther, or that she is just a psychotic child, or a vampire, or a mutant of some kind. But the truth is something much more interesting and unique, and consequently possible, however remotely this might be (owing to the existence of such rare cases). For the first three quarters of the film you are treated to the adorably psychotic inclinations of a child who we know very little about, other than that she is picked up at an orphanage by a couple, the wife having suffered a recent Miscarriage. As Esther shows her increasingly dark tendencies you cannot help but fall in love with her even more, paradoxically. She is able to dance the fine line between murderous little psychopath and adorable, gentle and lovable little raggedy anne doll that you just want to hug hug hug (checking for sharp objects first of course) and give all your love to. There is a sort of controversial romance scene toward the end of the film which has left a few viewers feeling uncomfortable, but once you ascertain the truth about the child the reason for the scene falls into place. Besides, the medium of film is an art form that should portray any and all possibilities in life. It is the job of the filmmaker to leave audiences shocked, questioning judgments and even feeling slightly off put, if the occasion should call for it. This film definitely has a unique enough premise to be memorable to this viewer. And I plan to revisit it again in the company of family and friends</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought that this would be one more piece to be added to the whole collection of poorly-made horror movies, but it proved me wrong. What to say of the movie? Just that it's fascinating. The way which David Johnson planned the plot is worth applauding. It grips you all through, by either scariness or surprise. It's also worth mentioning the secrecy built over Esther backgrounds, which is finally revealed in the end. It's so well constructed and performed that you get hooked throughout the whole movie without even noticing that it's a strategy put into use by the director. Now the dignified work delivered by the cast. It's so opposite to the far-fetched acting of other movies. Actually, I wasn't expecting much from the actors, since there were no renowned names listed, but they lived up to my expectations. Isabelle, who was only 12 when the movie was shot, was one of the biggest findings in my opinion; she just managed to play very convincingly an arduous and demanding role of a mentally-disordered girl. So, if you are already done with horror movies based on a thin plot and that don't go deep into the inner feelings of human beings, try Orphan, I assure you are going to like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Totally Unbelievable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Contains big spoilers*Where to start.Psychological horrors rely on believable characters. Peter Sarsgaard on the other hand was one of the most unbelievable characters from a film I've seen in a long time. It wasn't his fault but his character was a moron, pure and simple. After everything that had happened around Esther, and there was an awful lot, he still sided with her over his other children and wife. For somebody who was an architect how he could not put two and two together is beyond me, and for all his stupidity deserved to die. For those that liked The Orphan I really don't know how one could look past this, he was that unbelievably.Their two children baffled me as well. Perhaps they were scared, but after everything that they knew and saw at least one of them would have mentioned something, but The Orphan would have fallen at the first hurdle had they done so.The seduction scene. Esther turned out to be a 30-something in the film however Isabelle Fuhrman wasn't. I'm not a prude by any stretch of the imagination but I thought this scene was totally unnecessary and the film could have ended up in exactly the same place without the additional plot that she murders her foster families once the father spurns her sexual advances. Credit should be given to Vera Farmiga, I thought she did put in quite a good performance and was one of the very few positives that came from the film.To it's credit the twist in the film was one of the more clever twists I've seen for a while although once it was revealed the rest of the film was very predictable, but it certainly wasn't the worst ending I've seen.The stupidity of the father was bad enough but the whole adoption process was by far the worst part of this film. I don't know much about how it works but I'm pretty sure they would carry out backgrounds checks on a child before a family adopts her rather than after. The Sister only seemed to make a few phone calls to find out that there has been a lot of violence surrounding Esther, and only a little more research from the mother uncovered that she escaped from a mental institution in Estonia. For a film that needs to be believable it makes a total mockery of itself.Another issue I had with Orphan was it's pacing. At times it seemed to really drag out and I on occasions found myself having to resist giving up watching it, but on the grand scheme of things this didn't change my opinion of the film that greatly.I've been very critical of Orphan but the framework for a good film is there. A lot could have been done with the story but it felt like they had the initial idea and the twist planned out and just made up the rest as they went along to get from A to B. Totally unbelievable characters and too many large holes in the plot ruin Orphan in which there could have been a good film hiding.It's not all bad but it's definitely not good. 3/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A different kind of horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't like horror films, but "Orphan" was different. It was written well enough to be able to hold my sense of disbelief and keep me suspensed.In this horror film we actually have characters. Kate (Vera Farmiga) and John (Peter Sarsgaard) have two kids, Daniel and Max, and they all have back-stories that are significant to the film, and they each struggle with who they are and how to grow as individuals and as a family. Then they adopt Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman). All we know is that there's something wrong with Esther.Esther greatly disrupts the family's life - with a lot of violence and psychosis. Don't forget this is a horror film. Although that is easy to forget because the plot is driven by characters - perhaps a first for this genre? The characters are integral to a story that was so well researched that it's actually legit. That fact probably makes it even scarier.Even if you don't watch horror films, you could start with "Orphan".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Orphan An Effective Thriller With Some Flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Orphan is an effective thriller with some flaws from director Jaume Collet-Serra whose admirable in making this film about a couple who recently lost their baby adopt Esther an innocent 9 year old girl harboring a dangerous secret. Vera Farminga and Peter Sarsgaard are good as the married couple. Farminga shows all the emotions as Kate Coleman still traumatized over the death of her newborn baby who starts to investigate into Esther's past when strange things start to happen. Sarsgaard is decent as her husband John but I found him to be a bit too gullible when he's falling for Esther's manipulations taking her side over his wife's. Sarsgaard still turns in a good performance though despite not being given much to do. Isabelle Fuhrman is frighteningly effective as Esther the seemingly angelic child who will do anything to get what she wants even manipulate the people around her and murder. Fuhrman keeps you on edge as the villain wondering what she is willing to do next to protect her secret. Well done. The rest of the cast are okay but none of them stand out besides Fuhrman. The film did a nice job of developing most of the characters and the violence committed by Esther was well executed. I thought the pacing was a little slow and there some predictable moments. But other then that Orphan is still a decent thriller which I'm sure will please almost any die hard fan of the genre. The twist near the end I didn't really see coming and it helped to explain why Esther would go to the extremes in order to protect her secret from getting out. Overall this film could've been better but it certainly wasn't the worst I've seen. Orphan has character development, drama, and some suspense which always helps elevate the movie. Plus the exceptional performances by Vera Farminga and especially Isabelle Fuhrman make it worth watching at least once.</fullReview>

If not for the plot full of stupidity the movie would be perfect, but all those mistakes were killing me all the movie, and half of the movie was spoiled by thoughts like: "do they seriously think anyone could fall for that?". Still the acting is almost perfect and i believe it was the best acting i could ever see especially Max. Ant one more rock in the garden... Ending is very similar to most horror movies or action movies of the 90's and it would be way better to give people something new.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a generous 7/10 IMDb threshold for watching movies I expect to enjoy myself when I watch one, but yet again deceived by the over-fed-fat-5-year-old-kid generosity this film has received from reviewers I feel compelled to write this review. About 30 minutes into the film, about the time when the sweet little Russian orphan girl is introduced to her new home a car-crash-like-memory-whiplash wounds my fragile mind and it hits me that this movie bears a striking resemblance to a movie I'd watched several weeks ago ? case 39! Except, that this movie turned out to be a demented killer kid/"adult" (yes... BIG QUOTATION MARKS - "adult") version of the devil's sprog story ? reeeeeaaaaallll original Alex Mace (writer (fool)).Most of the time I was bored and stared out of my window at the dark field I live next to hoping I'd see some real monsters out there and rest of the time I spent predicting the script. It seems writers these days all go to McDonalds and get their movie ideas off the backs of happy meals. I think I'm still being generous giving this movie a "3". The adorable little daughter (Aryana Engineer) and a very well played part by Isabelle Fuhrman are definitely the only salient features. The frustrated crazy woman act is as dead as the knights templars (or are they?) and the little girl manipulating dopey-old-I-give-a-crap daddy act is as dry as a sun dried humerus in the Sahara desert (that's the arm bone that's connected to the shoulder bone - for all you Americans (don't forget to sing along)).Finally, as you may know I have a thing against medical inaccuracies in movies and I can see it now, my poor friends the endocrinologists tearing their ?7 haircuts out at the obscene drooling melaena spewing from the mouth of the "doctor" in the movie regarding Esther (I'll let you find out for yourself). Another word of advice Alex, try AT LEAST reading Wikipedia before you write (by the way melaena is...oh I can't be bothered look it up yourself) Overall, a pretty boring movie, a waste of 2 hours or however long it was, but if you want to watch a medically unrealistic, anti-Russian/pro-BS-American "ideals" propaganda movie, promoting child deviance and anti-social behaviour be my guest ? because you're all going to hell!

Her name is Esther and while on the outside, she's a very sweet child but what they don't know however, is that deep down there's something about her that doesn't feel right.The acting is believable, the dialog feels natural and the twist is something you wouldn't expect and it's not ridiculous.Overall, it's a very cool Horror film that deserves to be seen.

		<fullReview>Finally, a movie that is good enough to see over and over!! This was an exceptional movie and the girl that played Ester is bound for greatness if she performs this well at such a young age. This is also a very original story line. I thought it would be the typical "unloved child tries to win all the love" movie, but it well surpassed that. The opening scene in the movie was convincingly acted. I felt real emotional pain for the mother. Of course, this movie is about a family that adopts a child named Ester. She seemingly wants all of the attention, but goes about getting it in ways that leave someone else looking like they, not her, have done something wrong in this. When the mom feels like something could be wrong, she tries to trace Ester's biology back to Russia so she can find out more about where Ester originated and the influences she had before she came to America. One of the children in the story, Max, is a deaf child. Max is an adorable little girl. Ester uses Max and the fact that she is deaf to her advantage. You don't see the end of the movie coming. It is a huge plot twist. I would call this movie a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A highly derivative, weak thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Orphan", 2009, is a largely uninspired, highly derivative, pseudo-art film attempt at a thriller that tries hard to be chilling. The only thing that makes it worthwhile to view, is the performance of newcomer Isabelle Furham as Esther, the adopted child of unknown origin, from Russia. Director Jaume Collet Sera is not able to maintain any convincing drama or tension, due to a weak, ineffective screenplay, by David Johnson, which contains several convenient plot points. I would have given this film a rating of "5", if it weren't for Isabelle Furham's slightly chilling performance, portrayed with a mix of sweetness, charm and coldness.The revelation at the end of the film helps explain the main character and the story, but arrives too late to rescue the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Starts out good, but gets progressively worse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie had a lot of potential, but ultimately did not live up to my expectations. The cinematography was excellent, and the director did a wonderful job arranging the lighting, house, etc to give it just the right feel. Also, the start of the movie was very promising and good. It developed slowly and dramatically, and was based on actual suspense and not just cheap thrills. All of this changed, however, somewhere in between Esther throwing the girl from the slide and burning the tree house down. It's hard to pinpoint a definite time that the shift occurs, but rather it happens gradually in this time frame. By the time the tree house burns down, a lot of the suspense is missing and there are more cheap thrills and nonsense. By the time of the hospital scene (which I will discuss in a bit) all the way to the end, the movie gets increasingly ridiculous, over the top and cheap. By that point, all of the suspense is killed and the movie turns into a typical cheap horror film.The hospital scene completely annoyed me. Both of my parents and two of my grandparents have worked in hospitals, so I've been in and out of them my whole life, and even the cheapest, rinky-dink hospitals have so many doors with key-coded locks that there is no way in hell that Esther could have gotten from the waiting room area into the son's room, especially if he were in an intensive care unit like he was. Also, the pulse metre on his finger would have begun beeping and flat-lining the minute she took it off of his finger. But she's somehow able to take it off of his finger, smother him to death and then put it back on his finger before the machine starts flat-lining. Also, his blood pressure reading was so patently fake that it made me want to choke somebody. The hospital scene in general makes me want to punch a poodle in the face just to spite the filmmakers.The one thing keeping me from giving this a lower rating is the fact that the beginning was so strong. Had it lacked such a strong beginning before eventually fizzling out, I probably would have given this a much lower rating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Bad Seed remade for the not-so-bright</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bad Seed movies have to walk a thin line in order to work their magic. They have to derive their suspense from the creeping evil of its antagonist. Obviousness turns them into any other slasher killer, but far more ludicrous due to their stature.In "Orphan," suspense doesn't creep, it slashes, slices, dices, and mutilates with lightning speed, giving little regard to character development and following cribbed story lines that anyone who has seen a handful of movies will see telegraphed like a beacon.The writing is beyond slovenly --- the protagonists (Farmiga and Saarsgard --- Farmiga reprising the role of the hysterical bad seed mom from "Joshua," to ill effect here; Saarsgard looking bored out of his mind) are such boneheads that they have sex in the kitchen with their kids in the house, leave firearms lying around in under-secured locations, and drive 90 miles an hour down icy roads while chatting on their cell phones.The titular orphan isn't much more believable. She should be wearing a ghost face or Mike Myers mask or a goalie mask --- it would suit her character far better. Psychos this psycho just aren't scary without a little more style in their stalk.Oh, but there is that BIG SECRET!!! WOW! Actually folks, it's not a secret, it's what writers do when they've written themselves into a corner or don't want to look like too blatant a plagiarizer: they invent some dumb-a** totally implausible explanation at the last minute.This big-budget Warner production has fix-up job plastered all over it, like it was some foreign garage-sale production they bought for cheap and tried to doll up like an underage hooker --- but only someone who hadn't seen a horror picture before (or was under 13 --- more than likely the target audience) could keep their attention during this one.If you want to have a few questions in your head to keep your brain functioning, try "Joshua" --- it's realistic, creepy, and doesn't outline every plot point for you in black-light ink 40 feet high. Oohhh, that black light...CREEPY!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler Alert!!! Most of the horror movies in the 2000's were very lame, not scary, and just weren't interesting. Finally, the orphan comes and gives me a little bit more faith into the newer generation of horror films. Sadly though this is one of the only good films worth mentioning in 2009. This film focused more on developing a great storyline and have lots of character development than showing gore. It did have only a couple scenes of gore but nothing that really excessive. I mean surely if someone dies in a slasher film there has to be at least a little bit of blood. Otherwise we'd have a boring film like When a Stranger Calls. Anyway, I really enjoyed this film and thought it was all in all pretty well done. I decided to give it an 8 out of 10. I honestly can't remember one other good movie that came out that year.

		<fullReview>A truly hysterical (in both senses) horror thriller that starts off as a pretty routine "evil child" movie, until a third act twist sends the film into truly ridiculous overdrive. You have to give the writer some credit for having the audacity to write such a twist, it's pure trash cinema gold! Holding this increasingly distasteful, bloody film together is an excellent performance by Farmiga, and to a lesser extent Sarsgaard, the dynamic between them helped by a surprisingly detailed and nuanced back story and relationship. The score and sound effects are distractingly excessive, and could've used a lesson in 'less is more', and let's not even get started on the clichéd finale or the blatant xenophobia. But amidst the hysteria are genuinely creepy touches, the best being Esther's personality disorder being mirrored in her artwork, all sweet and innocent on the surface but with a shocking, twisted adult hatred simmering underneath.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*SPOILERS!* my whole review contains spoilers so don't read if you haven't seen it yet.The movie starts out like your typical dark psychological thriller, including the painfully cheap scare tactics of a squeaky medicine cabinet that isn't scary. I just hate when directors think it's a good idea to do that, because it's such a cop-out cliché from real fear.The bird kill was actually extremely well done. I went step-by-step on the DVD and it just looks so real. Bravo.The biggest fault for me is the unbelievability. Scene after scene of evil little girl actions and everyone is just sooo oblivious it gets very frustrating- Especially the dad, get a clue! Whom, also, is obviously gay. I read up on it and it seems he's married to Maggie Gyllenhaal with a child but still, that doesn't mean he's hetero and his speech and movement are real giveaways. I am certainly not saying that there is a problem with being gay, but the character calls for a straight family man and so in that way I felt it was distracting since most of time his homosexuality just seems so incredibly obvious. Anyway, after the nun from the orphanage is killed, that should have been a dead giveaway that OK, something is NOT RIGHT. but still the evil continues and obliviousness ensues. As for her death, the CG blood was a little distracting and there could have been more fury, so overall not too exciting. The grandma, a bitchy woman who only appears in a couple scenes, also really could have benefited from a creative death scene.When the mom finds dad in a puddle of his own blood, (nice stabbing death) she seems very underwhelmed. Your loving husband has just been murdered and you only sit by his side for a moment to grieve and then take off never to return. That's just unnatural. She showed more emotion in all of her other dramatic scenes and this was the most dramatic of all! The real saving grace in this movie is Isabelle Fuhrman who plays Esther. I don't think they could have gotten anyone better. Perfect casting. She is so manipulative and believably evil. The twist at the end is original and very clever and it WORKS! After seeing her brush off her make-up and change her clothes, you really believe she is a 33-year old psycho dwarf! She really makes the movie worth watching.The ending was a disappointment. Mom delivers that cliché one-liner, which actually may have worked if it wasn't pronounced as loudly and with such dramatic pause. That just made it so cheesy. And this is followed by a CG neck break which just makes me groan in disappointment. Why is that even needed? It would have been much better to have the mom kick her real hard in the face and have her neck slam backwards and watch her bloody face slowly submerge into the water below.The movie isn't bad, but it really could have benefited from a trim of 30 minutes and a few re-writes. 2 hours isn't needed, an hour and a half would have sufficed just fine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's something wrong with Orphan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, as the movie's tagline states, there most certainly is something wrong with Esther. Unfortunately there's something wrong with the movie too. It's a movie which starts out with some real promise but as the story plods along that early promise never really pays itself off. The movie checks in at a clearly excessive 123 minutes, the story simply can't sustain itself over that length of time. Oftentimes the movie has a very formulaic feel to it, there's the sense we've seen this all done before. And we've probably seen it done a lot better. By the time we finally get to the shocking conclusion we just may not be that interested anymore. And the big shock really doesn't work either if you actually spend a moment thinking about it. The whole movie is based on a foundation which is not particularly plausible. Suspended disbelief works to a point I guess but honestly this movie asks us to believe things which quite simply could not happen.The best thing this movie has to offer is the performance of the young actress playing our deeply troubled Esther. Isabelle Fuhrman turns in a wildly impressive, appropriately sinister and almost impossibly mature performance. This is a young actress who almost certainly has great things in her future. Unfortunately much of what surrounds her doesn't work. It's a story about an evil little child who is clearly not what she initially appears to be. What is she exactly? Well that's the revelation we save for the big shock at the end. But this movie spends way too much time getting to its big finish. And again the big revelation really does not stand up to even the most cursory of examinations. But it's just a cheap little horror film so maybe if we don't think about it too much...nah, the movie still doesn't work. Even if you ignore the story's ultimate implausibility the movie still has too many other flaws. It's way too long. There are entirely too many of those standard horror movie false scares and not enough real ones. One of the key characters, Esther's adopted father, comes off as being quite a dunce. Horror movies rely on tension, this movie's tension fizzles out long before the movie finally slogs to an end. By the time the movie's halfway done you're just looking for it to be over. Full marks to young Isabelle Fuhrman for creating a creepy, memorable character. But one good character does not necessarily make a good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fierce, Bold, and shameless view into the psyche of fragmented motherhood.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To start, the film "Orphan" was promoted to be a modern day schlock film about a murderous child who wrecks havoc on a loving home which adopts her. This method of audience attraction could not be further from the truth. "Orphan" is an intense drama, about how fragmented minds of both children and adults can hinder the relationships between the children of a family, broken or otherwise, and the parental units with which the family is overseen. The film's premise follows a the Coleman family, a broken, unconventional family who have recently befallen a slight tragedy. Specifically the mother, Kate, who has just suffered a miscarriage. From here, we learn that, in addition to other complications to John, her husband, and she herself, that their marriage is on the rocks, about to slip. They figure adopting a child to make up for the still born one of their own, will mend things. So they adopt Esther, a kind, intellectual, but reclusive young girl from the St. Martins school for girls. This does in fact, mend their marriage, because of all things, their youngest child, Maxine, who is deaf, has particularly taken to Esther. Soon though, events start to take place, inconsistencies, and 'accidents' that all seem to be connected with Esther's arrival. This sets the story, but so much more takes place within the film, that will most obviously be missed by many 'thrill seeking' audience members. First of all, there is a complexity of character development and layers of character issues with both John and Kate, who were both played out wonderfully and very authentically by Peter Saarsgard and Vera Farmiga. The problems the characters are faced with, matched with the problems they've overcome, reaches the viewer with no holds barred realism. So too, do you get the feelings from the actress playing the deaf child. Sign language is incorporated into the film, and stylistically, the direction has many of her scenes in complete silence, helping us live in her world for just a few moments at a time. One of the real gems to this film is Isabelle Furhmen, who is regards nothing but what she is supposed to do as Esther. She is impressive, and focused, with a memorable accent and almost perfect acting for someone at her age. She will go far if she continues to grow and take in all that she can. CCH Pounder pops in for a welcome cameo. The story itself is frankly far fetched, but the actors and director Jaume Collet Serra, who is humbly making his way up the ladder in the industry, and it's not hard to see why, make this stylish and entertaining trash something to think about. The direction is a BIG contribution to the films virtues. The camera work, the direction of the scenes and the actors, and overall execution of the story and the way it's structured give the film more cinematic validity than it originally has any right to. There are physical camera moves than entice and suspend the viewer, there are jumps and build ups in the conversations that lead the viewer on, and then usually there will be a revelations that doesn't try to scare, just creeps up your skin. John Ottman provides a less than memorable score. He is usually on top of the game, providing a score that is better than the films themselves, but this time, the direction has clearly eclipsed him. But it by no means stops there. The best part of the film (direction, really) is the bold and shameless way it approaches how the events in the film are portrayed. Serra is not afraid to go where other filmmakers are sensitive. He places to the two children, one innocent, the other not so innocent, in the scariest of situations, for both children and parents alike, and takes risks with their lives. The situations on screen are in your face and intense, but don't linger on for too long, eliciting an uncomfortable and at times, horrifying feel that makes the viewer want to forget they ever saw this. These depictions include but are not limited to, children locked in a tree house on fire, children killing adults, children psychologically playing off the naiveté of other children, etc. It's definitely not for younger audiences. In fact, it's a film that some adults should see. A commentary on the affect parenting has on children, and how subtle but real the ignorance of a parent can be. It's an adult film on many levels actually, giving the story lines to the parents most of all, and giving the scary material as a secondary tactic. The film is a daring exercise in presenting the subtle consequences of ignorance in the American Family. Likewise, the film can also be taken as a look into a world where youth and innocence is taken for granted, and all ages are affected thusly. Either way you look at it, the film presents a world where the boundaries of age and maturity are broken and the lines that are usually drawn between are blurred. Our characters at one point or another can each be blamed, or sympathized with. And for that, the film has done half of what it should: Reflect while being entertaining. The other half, is what no brained audiences have seen the film for, a gory attempt to cash in on the idea that adults are stupid and children should disrespect their parents. People who are going to see this film for either this reason, or to be scared, will most certainly not get their dollars worth. All in all, "Orphan" has brought back the R-rated horror film, and with it, an intellect to the adult scary movie, and it will only really be successful if other filmmakers recognize it for what it is, and continue to take this new method on.-TP</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful Orphan!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just had the displeasure of watching one of the crappiest "horror" films of last year and can only say how relieved I am that I didn't pay to see "Orphan" (2009) in a movie theatre. Yes I know that sounds a little extreme but this movie has got me so annoyed with it's laziness, bad plotting and lame acting. When these dumb Hollywood Horrors are costing millions of dollars to produce and market there should be no excuses for making a film that is so inept."Orphan" tells the story of a smug rich American couple who decide to buy themselves a new child to replace the daughter they lost in an accident. Oops, sorry! I meant adopt a child! Of course, being blessed with the intelligence of a couple of dead fish, said couple decide to adopt the creepiest, scariest freak-child this side of Wednesday Adams and hope that she fits in with their other two (relatively normal) kids. They also choose to avoid all warning signs that this 9 year old girl is some kind of a disturbed psychopath. The warning signs include the head nun at the convent they adopted this Russian girl from coming round and telling them point blank that she is worried there is something very wrong with the girl (Esther). And that her previous adopted family died in a house fire caused by an unknown arsonist. And that people constantly die or get injured whenever Esther is around. And so on. If this isn't enough to warn you that maybe you should reconsider leaving your children alone with this Devil Child, then I don't know what is!Of course, all this is one of the many reasons why this ridiculous movie quite simply does not work. The gaps in logic are so extreme "Orphan" makes the plotting in "Eastenders" seem realistic. The characters do not behave in the manner of real people. Right from the start, how can the scriptwriters expect us to believe that a mentally unstable alcoholic (the mother) would be allowed to even consider adopting a third child?? It just doesn't make sense. Add to this, the appalling acting from Isabelle Fuhrman with her ever changing accent and the most hilarious plot twist this side of "Tootsie" and you gotta admit, this orphan should have been aborted before it was even born.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tame 'horror' that plods along horribly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This had just come out at my DVD store and it was under the horror section including a 'chilling alternate ending' so I figured it would be a decent watch to give me and the missus a few goosebumps late at night. How wrong we were. I couldn't find any horror in Orphan and very little thriller either for those labeling it a horror/thriller. The beginning of the film didn't set out much at all, instead using overacting to show how Kate had a drinking problem or John cheated on her. Obviously a family that doesn't talk through issues the way they went onto complete tangents when confronted by an empty wine bottle or a 'friend' showing off her cleavage, instead trying to bring their family together by adopting another child while ignoring their son. I must agree with other reviews I've read saying that this family really wouldn't be put forward to adopt a child, let alone just walk into an orphanage, talk for 5 minutes to Esther and decide they want her. As for the orphanage and Sister Abigail, surely it's her duty to properly investigate any child that comes to her orphanage before letting her being adopted by a family rather than rushing in halfway through the film saying 'there's something wrong with the child, I just chose to ignore it much like John is doing'. The twist could be seen a mile off for those paying attention, although how we saw it after being blinded by a father disregarding his entire family as he looks after Esther and hangs on her every word, believing her over his wife who he should've tried harder to reconcile with, or his son who he made no attempts to bond with over the course of the film, I don't know. Granted, being labeled a horror film, I was expecting the twist to be supernatural in some way, and so the truth that she's just 33 and has a form of dwarfism was tame beyond belief. The Estonian people who knew who she was but let her wander off to America and somehow lose track of them is also ridiculous. As for the alternate ending that was supposed to be 'chilling', it went past before I even knew it and made little to no sense and leaving far too much to the viewer to decide what happens next. The sooner dvds stop promoting a 'chilling ending' that is lacking in impact or chills the better.All in all, another 'psychological' film if it can be called that, that suffers from overacting and unbelievable situations. The house looked nice though</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What the crap!?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very bad movie. It's yet another version of "The Bad Seed" or even "The Omen" where some child with amazing intelligence and deviance is a psychopath which of course nobody is willing to believe except the mother. There was nothing original about this movie other than one very brilliant twist which I of course will not spoil for you. In fact, the only reason this movie is worth watching is for the twist towards the end or really, character revelation. Otherwise if you've watched one of the predecessor versions of this story, there's no good reason to forces yourself through this one other than the twist. So many clichés such as outsiders who of course undermine the mother while having absolutely no first hand knowledge of what living with the child is like. The nun behind the adoption finding out some startling information only to be snubbed out before she can dig even more dirt and save the family from devastation. The husband unwilling to believe the woman he has fathered children with, been through thick and thin together for countless years and of course siding with the new addition to the family. Oh and THE biggest cliché of all, they meet with the girl for 5 minutes and adopt her the same day. No trial period, no paper work to slow down the process. It's as though they bought her off the black market or from BestBuy for that matter. Everyone involved in the making of this film owes me an apology for wasting my valuable time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had watched it some time ago, but did not actually remember what happened (comes with age!). I re-watched it recently and it was as fun as I could remember from the first time. It drives you to start yelling at the TV at some scenes! Not a really really happy ending, suspense, agony, all the ingredients for a good thriller. What I especially appreciated was the fact that there's always evidence of something supernatural in the atmosphere, despite the final explanation of the entire thing... The kid was amazing in acting as was the rest of the crew, although the father, as an actor in general, is not my favorite. He was too indifferent for my taste, from all aspects. He acted fine and everything, but I just think that this was not his kind of role. Wrong face for the part... The small girl was awesome as well as the boy! I think this is one of the thrillers that define the genre. You sit at the edge of your seat waiting what will come next! Nice! Really nice!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has to be one of the best "horror/thrillers" I have ever seen! (And I have watched them all) The acting is beyond amazing! It has genuine scares in the child's behaviour! Pretty much nothing scares me but this film had me on the edge of my seat the whole way though! My favorite moments in the film are the ones when the music builds up and you expect a "scare" and nothing happens! That makes the "jump out your seat" moments even better and more unexpected!! The only film I have seen in recent years to top this was the conjuring. And that movie is phenomenal!! This film is worth everyone watching if you are a horror fan or not! The whole premise is breathtakingly new! I don't know how anyone could not love this film! I adore it and won't stop watching it no matter how many times I jump at the same scenes lol.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>FILM POSTER: 'There's something wrong with Esther'.There certainly is. This seemingly lovable 9 year old Russian girl who's just been adopted by your atypical suburban family squashes a pigeon with a rock, pushes a girl off a jungle gym breaking her ankle in the process and spies on her new parents making LURVE. And that's just for starters. Wait till she finds the hammer and gun. And whatever you do, DON'T let her near the matches...Orphan is a compulsively tense, nerve wracking horror with a remarkable performance by Isabelle Fuhrman as the little sociopath herself, and superb atmosphere due in no small part to the surrounding snowy conditions which sum up the bleak, depressing tone of the material. Here, we have a marriage on the brink, a rebellious pre-teen son, a daughter made a deaf-mute due to a fall through the ice and a baby just lost because of a miscarriage. Adopting a child was meant to save this family... It doesn't QUITE work as planned.One for those long winter evenings... When your children are out of the room. Not because they'll get especially frightened (ARE YOU KIDDING ME? THIS GENERATION?!) but while it's on, you might glance over at them and get some unfounded ideas about their 'true' nature... 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gripping till the climax!! One of the best horror movies since The omen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Orphan is the biggest relief for horror fans after a very long time. Period!!Note: I'm not going to reveal any suspense here.The movie does not contain much gore or violence or cheap horror which most of the horror movies do (sadly!)This movie I rented after seeing an ad on HBO ( I don't want movies in HBO as they cut a lot) . I don't remember this ever being released in India. Coming to the movie. The movie scares you building atmospheric tension like many successful first class movies like The omen(1976.. not 2006 ) , The exorcist, Yaavarum nalam (13B ).The casting is excellent! Especially Isabelle Fuhrman (just 10) , Vera Farmiga and Aryana Engineer ( who played the hearing impaired kid).The movie storyline is revealed much in the trailer; "Family adopts a girl and something is wrong about her".The story of how each person gets suspicion about Esther, is given more detail and in a tensed way. The ways of finding more truth about Esther is done slow and makes us gripped to the story.The twists are few but will surely blow your mind!!The sceneries are perfect. The cold weather and snow covered locations add more chill to the movie.I can't write any more as they will just reveal much about the movie. So just stop thinking and watch this amazing movie.For best experience: Dark your room. Rent a blu-ray. Use a LED TV. and best if you use a home theater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Orphan is a superb suspenseful horror film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A husband and wife who recently lost their baby adopt a 9-year-old girl who is not nearly as innocent as she claims to be. Kate and John Coleman are rebuilding their troubled marriage. Kate had a drinking problem, but is in therapy and is doing well. She has been sober for one year. The couple decide to adopt a child. When they meet the nine-year-old Russian girl, Esther, at the St. Marina Orphanage, they immediately fall in love with the well-educated orphan. Their young son, Daniel, is hostile to his new sister; but their deaf daughter, little Max, is enchanted with her - at first. Eventually, Kate begins to feel that Esther is manipulative and possibly even psychologically disturbed. John refuses to listen to his wife's misgivings, and the wounds in their marriage reopen. Kate calls Sister Abigail at the orphanage, and the nun informs her that Esther has a troubled and mysterious history. Kate delves further into Esther's past and discovers she is not all she pretends to be. Roger Ebert wrote that: "You want a good horror film about a child from hell, you got one." The film received a lot of negative reviews but I thought those reviews were unfair as I found it an extremely scary and suspenseful film; really it had everything you could want from a horror film in the context of entertainment. It really proves that you don't need to listen to the critic's reviews when deciding to see a film as they get it wrong from time to time. If you want to see a suspenseful and scary horror film then I suggest you see this and you will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Orphan" is one of the most watched thriller of 2009, with huge popularity here in Brazil. Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard play a couple that adopts a child, but once the time passes, weird things begin to happen. Many stated "Case 39" was a copy of this, but even thought the films have some similarity, in the end they're pretty different. The story is involving and at times stressing, given that this adopted girl does every evil thing she wants and nobody is able to even notice it. Most of the scenes are plausible, apart from the psychiatrist's; this 'professional' talks to the girl in some sessions, and she's NEVER able to notice that the kid is totally nuts and a serial killer. Some people stated "ooh but the kid is crazy and smart, she fooled the psychiatrist"; come on guys, that's EXACTLY what psychiatrists are for, they're paid to find out if the patient has any disorder! Also, I found extremely funny when this "professional" began praising Esther's qualities and slaughter the mother's behavior. I have to congratulate the make-up team for such difference they made between the Esther the kid and Esther the 33 year old woman; I blindly thought they were two different actresses. All in all, "Orphan" isn't an excellent thriller but is a very good one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth watching for Isabelle Fuhrman alone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though I knew the twist before I saw this film, I was shocked at Isabelle Furhrman's brilliant performance. Vacillating between sweet and psychotic from one scene to the next, you can read what's going on in her head just by looking at her face; there are actors five times her age who still haven't mastered this skill. I nominate Esther as one of the greatest movie villains of all time, and here's to hoping that Isabelle Furhrman has a very long and rewarding acting career.Despite Furhman's jaw-dropping performance, the rest of the film is surprisingly odd. The characters don't react the way you expect them to. The film would have been much more powerful and fun if Esther had concentrated on slowly driving Kate crazy, while at the same time being incredibly sweet to her. The film blew it when Esther suddenly became very cold towards Kate and started lecturing her about her other kids or her past drinking problem. Esther could easily have convinced Kate that she was going insane, driving her away from the family and leaving her to seduce John, but she stupidly left some loose ends. If you're going to the trouble of creating a super-intelligent character, why create one that makes so many mistakes along the way? I understand that Esther is insane, the film makes it pretty clear, but she must want something that she is continually unable to get, and the film doesn't answer this question. Instead we're left with a cookie-cutter Hollywood ending where the villain is thought to be dead and comes back for another attack, not once but three times...this is standard in films these days I guess.Despite the above flaws, this film is tremendously entertaining, and there isn't a flat spot in the entire movie as you wonder what Esther is going to do next. I see in the other reviews that people are drawing a comparison to The Bad Seed, which I find quite cloying and melodramatic for long, unbearable stretches of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is difficult to define it. A good script, a brilliant Isabelle Fuehrman, a new story, a very special thriller, a special way to say a well know tall. And, more that, subtle science to drive the viewer in a dark labyrinth. Spectacular in details and art to use ordinary pieces, the film has slices of social crisis and family problems, self definition and daily illusions. So, the secret is more that an explanation for incidents or key of secrets. The evil is not fruit of scary gestures or devil games. And the grains of another movies has different essence. The masks are faces and the final happy-end only new brick for deep tension. It is not a geometrical figure. This is price for definition of fragile world and its lost soul. It is not really a thriller. But a analysis of relationship and image of another. A drama about trust and roots of desire.</fullReview>

Even a twist that has been advertised quite a lot (as I read here), isn't really completely helping (actually it serves more than an excuse, than anything else and therefor was more disappointing than anything to me personally and you might feel the same way).I couldn't decide whether to give it 6 or 7 points in my rating, but decided, that through all the things (quite a few clichés are being used, but in doing so, they make sure to use them properly), this is above average. You might not see it that way and might feel cheated by the ending (the alternate ending on the DVD is really bad though, so it's a good thing they used the one, that is in the film now). The actors do their best, that is for sure. And it looks really nice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay......(leaves room).....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay? So let me get this right? Isabelle Fuhrman just made her acting debut in a psychological slash thriller film by playing a naughty little child? I am very impressed by her acting and performance but her accent was what got me the most. Isabelle Fuhrman is born in America while her Russian accent is just amazing. I have not seen anybody do any better than that, except Russians, and it just makes her a little bit more scary. Who wants a little Russian girl that has an appetite for killing in their room (I meant it as a comment so please don't take offense!). The films beginning starts out as a bit of a cliché and the films moods is mysterious in a bad way. The film is also slow at the beginning and that led me to saying, "What the f*ck is this?" but I very much regret saying that a little bit later as I got ONE of the scariest shocks in my 12 year old life. The film is like the Omen and The Exorcist blended together in a blender that never stops but just goes faster and faster. This film is NO masterpiece because it's setting didn't work for a LOT of people. The exciting or the scary scenes are something that have been copied from other movies but just have a little bit of original elements in it. The film is scary and the twist at the end is very surprising and unexpected. Without the twist at the end, the movie would have been utter crap but the director has a smart brain and thanks to him this movie turned out to be good. The cover for Orphan can make you just look at it for a second and then walk on but they don't what they are missing out on. Vera Farmiga is a very complex character who has lost a baby that she has not even met. She is scarred by that and wants to adopt another child. Unluckily she picks the devils worshiper out of the bunch and that leads her life out of control. Her acting is exceptional. Jimmy Bennett also gave a good performance as he played the good little brother who finds out about his devil-like new sister. WTF! Everyone should dare to watch this and come out alive, most would, and the rest of them are... are....are chickens.Kate and John Coleman are rebuilding their troubled marriage. Kate had a drinking problem, but is in therapy and is doing well. She has been sober for one year. The couple decides to adopt a child. When they meet the nine-year-old Russian girl, Esther, at the St. Marina Orphanage, they immediately fall in love with the well-educated orphan. Their young son, Daniel, is hostile to his new sister; but their deaf-mute daughter, little Max, is enchanted with her - at first. Eventually, Kate begins to feel that Esther is manipulative and possibly even psychologically disturbed. John refuses to listen to his wife's misgivings, and the wounds in their marriage reopen. Kate calls Sister Abigail at the orphanage, and the nun informs her that Esther has a troubled and mysterious history. Kate delves further into Esther's past and discovers she is not at all who she pretends to be.My favorite scenes in the movie have to be when the mother finds out that her newly adopted daughter is a actually a multiple personality disorder someone who is actually 33 years old but her hormones make her look like a nine year old kid. Esther is a very good character but could not match the little kid in Omen but she does give a good scare. My other favorite part has to be when she breaks her arm on purpose because it just shows that she will do anything to stay on top. The end fight scene between her and Esther is scary but we all know that it's "Goodbye, Esther!". The film worked for me but it did have its downers. 7/10 - Pretty good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jaume Collet-Serra's 'Orphan' may tell a familiar story where a child is portrayed as the antagonist but this one is still fun to which mostly because of the camera-work, the atmosphere and the acting. Collet-Serra does manage to create a tense atmosphere in the wooden residence. The hand-held camera is well used. However, the background score is intrusive at times. The snowy Canadian location is refreshing and cleverly relevant to the story. The story builds up steadily and most of the twists are handled well. Vera Farmiga is terrific as a healing mother whose world is shaken again by a new visitor. Peter Sarsgaard does his best with a formulaic role. Isabelle Fuhrman is adequate. Ariana Engineer is quite amazing. She gives one of the most impressive performances. CCH Pounder is wasted. Some of the notable sequences include the ones where Kate talks to Esther about the flowers that grew from her daughter's ashes, the scenes with Max and when Kate is tempted to drink. 'Orphan' is overall an entertaining thriller even though it is a little formulaic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My opinion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Honestly, after watching the movie, I was a bit confused. I didn't understand if Daniel survived, and I wanted to see Kate's life with Easter gone, and without John. The plot was nice, something different, but not that realistic, I mean, Kate was able to carry her daughter even after shot in the leg, swimming in a frozen lake. How can someone carry a child while walking on snow, wet, lightly dressed and bruised. Another thing I didn't understand is how Esther escaped from that mental hospital, and how she got in the orphan . How come Kate never asked her to take her "ribbons" off? If I was her mother, I would. Well, guess it's just a movie, and I actually liked Esther, my favorite character from the movie. One tip for the director, be careful with the details and maintain the real from realistic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing and impressively acted.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review contain 1 minor spoiler to this film, it has nothing to do with the ending though, it's just something that happens. In Orphan, a 30 something couple lose their baby through a miscarriage. They both are in grief, so they decide to adopt a child from an Orphanage. The come across a rather charming Russian girl named Esther. The couple are very drawn towards this girl, everything about her seems perfect, they decide to adopt her. The mother slowly starts to realize that she isn't as perfect as she thought, but no one else realizes. And now we have Orphan. As you can tell, the films not exactly the most original piece the horror genre has ever seen, but it is however very well written, which is certainly refreshing considering recent horror films of the past few years. The good writing comes with the character of Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman), she is very menacing and some of the things she does are really shocking, you really feel that she is evil. The character of Kate is also well written, I always felt very sympathetic towards her throughout the events of the film. Things like this are what make Orphan stick out amongst the crowd of horror films, you're usually not sympathetic towards the main character, or intimidated by the villain, but Orphan hit's the nail on the head in this aspect. Orphan also sticks out very much in another aspect, the acting. It's refreshing enough to see an average performance in a horror film, so you could imagine how happy I was with the way above average performances in Orphan. Isabelle Fuhrman is just terrifying as Esther. Her real stick out scene is when she purposely breaks her hand, it was completely believable. In my opinion her performance as Esther completely overshadows Linda Blair as Regan in The Exorcist. She was only about 11 or 12 when the film was being shot and she completely pulls off this grim, complex and harrowing character. Vera Farmiga, who I always liked as an actress, also completely pulls off her character. The film is also nicely directed which was sort of surprising I suppose. The cinematography was very nice looking too, this in turn gives the film a very stylish look, which kind of suited the tone. The script is solid mostly, but does have some bad moments at times.I don't really have any big problems with Orphan other than it's sometimes over the top moments. I highly recommend it too any horror fan looking for a good creepy movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I came into this movie thinking it was going to be pretty lame. I was not blown away or anything but it was actullay pretty good. With solid performances by the cast and a pretty interesting story with some twists and turns.This movie is about a young couple who want to adopt a child. They go to the orphanage and they come across a young foreign girl about 10 years old. She seems very smart and well spoken so they decide to adopt her. She works out great at first but she starts to act stranger and stranger.This movie is pretty decent. I mean its worth a watch is just not anything special. It does not make your heart race as much as it should probably.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film Orphan has to be one of the best films that I have even seen because it is so unique compared to other thriller films I've seen.Once again Isabelle Fuhrman proved that she is a unbelievable actor and the films moral was nothing will even stop Esther and that is proved in real life to. Arayanna Engineer and Jimmy Bennett must of had guts to take on Esther let alone giving up their life's to protect each other and their family. Overall the film was of an exceptional high quality and the plot was really detailed. Also a congratulations to all the cast and crew for making this amazing film.Well Done!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rented this movie from blockbuster a few months ago, and I enjoyed it a lot. This movie has a lot of chills, thrills, scares and suspense from beginning to end. However,'when I first heard of it,'I thought it was just going to be some cheesy horror film about a child from hell. But after I saw the movie, I had a sudden change of heart.This movie is a bout a couple who lose a child through stillbirth and go through strains in their marriage. Then they adopt a nine year old Russian girls who is very bright for her age. After they adopt her, everything seems to be hunky dory, but then bad things start happening around the little girl. Then the girls adoptive mother tries to find out more about her, but nobody believes her claims.If you want a scary child from hell movie, you got one. It is worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Isabelle Fuhrman is great as orphan Esther</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After suffering a miscarriage Kate and her husband John decide to adopt nine-year old Esther to complete their family. At first it seems that she is doing everything she can to become part of the family; even learning sign language so she can talk to her new sister Max. The only person who doesn't get along with her is brother, Daniel; although it appears that he is the one being unreasonable not her. Things start to go wrong when Esther is bullied at school because of her old fashioned dress sense and soon after one of her tormentors is injured in what Esther claims was just an accident. It soon becomes clear that Esther isn't the innocent she first appeared when she actually kills somebody then blackmails Max into keeping quiet. Kate starts to suspect Esther is a malevolent presence in the house but her husband can't see it and the children are too frightened to say what they know; this leads people to believe that Kate is the one who is losing her sanity. She continues to investigate Esther's origins but by the time she learns the shocking truth it may be too late to save her family.This was a good enough shocker although I think it would have been better if it hadn't been made clear how bad Esther was so early on so the viewer would have to decide whether she was bad or whether Kate was indeed going insane. Twelve-year old Isabelle Fuhrman did a fantastic job as Esther making her believable as she switched from friendly to malicious in the blink of an eye. The film wasn't too scary although it did contain a few decent jump scenes; the most shocking scene wasn't one where anybody was in danger but when Esther makes herself up and tries to seduce her adoptive father. This scene was handled well managing to be quite disturbing without even coming close to being offensive as could have easily been the case. The finale was rather cliché but for the most part it was a fairly taut chiller. There was a good surprise revelation near the end but I won't spoil it here; I'll just say that I didn't see it coming!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A big ship... but such a long gang-plank...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is reminiscent of Carpenter's original "Halloween" - i.e., it's all in the last reel. Then again, that film was highly successful, so maybe this one was too (it took $76M - but its production cost is a mystery). However, before spending two hours of your life on it, consider the following...We are asked to care about a cloying couple and their obnoxious kids. The apparent central character is the woman - a recovering alcoholic with an obsession for HAVING kids. She already has two - and when a third is still-born, she decides to adopt. Her dopey husband concurs.Enter Esther - a nine-year-old Estonian girl, played by then-twelve-year-old Isabelle Fuhrman (who is the best thing IN this piece). Being "different", she is bullied at school and soon bumps heads with her new, adoptive brother - who is so objectionable, you can't WAIT for him to get his.And in due course, he does - along with everyone else, in this predictable "evil child" shocker. The problem is, you don't much CARE (unless, like this writer, you only continued to watch to SEE same).Thus, when the "big twist" DOES come, you are so bored, it barely registers. Which is a shame, because said twist is a really ORIGINAL one. However, despite ticking the spoiler box, this reviewer is not about to reveal it - as it is really the ONLY reason for watching this drivel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good acting, bad directing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie could have been so much better. The ingredients were there -- certainly when it comes to the acting. The actors fleshed out their parts well and made us care about their characters. Isabelle Fuhrman was brilliant conveying intelligent, but naive child then progressing to the manipulative sociopath to the monster at the end.The problem was the directing and the choices made in camera-work and background music. From the very first scene it was clear that the director opted for the sledgehammer-subtle approach. Even the most innocuous scenes were laden with creepy fade-ins, ominous camera angles and GOTCHA music. I was getting sick of the "shock" of opening a refrigerator or looking in the medicine cabinet.We KNOW it's a horror movie, we don't need to be beaten over the head with it! Couldn't the presentation been more natural instead? Apparently those who produced this film didn't think the audience could handle that kind of subtlety. When something bad was actually happening, we were too desensitized by fake shock moments that came in between.And the pat horror-movie climax in which the monster is thought vanquished but repeatedly coming back to life was as trite as it was unnecessary.What a waste of talent. Kudos to Isabelle Fuhrman for her performance; it should give her the flexibility to opt for better scripts and directors for her next project.</fullReview>

That is only because i liked this charming little girl isabelle fuhrman who played esther. i didn't like the way her role was portrayed and got wasted in the middle when she was carrying the movie so very well. i was with esther (isabelle) all the time watching her do her job amazingly well when the movie was going from bad to worse with their mindless horror and slasher movie routines. Vera farmiga also had some scenes of good acting but was totally over powered by esther. Isabelle fuhrmans( acted when she was only 10 or 11 ) charm, exuberance and acting saves this movie from being a classic disaster. and some little thoughts for those Hollywood big wigs out there. please spare us from these kind of sleazy cheesy horror packages. you may be having an audience of your own.but they are also bound to get bored someday. next time try to make a horror movie with some aesthetic appeal which i expected from this movie but in vain. this kind of money spinning formulaic Hollywood nonsense are not going to work all the time.they are going to catch you someday.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overall, this movie was okay and did hold our interest for the most part.The plot was however very predictable with the usual dumb moves on the part of the hapless victims. I kept saying to myself "Yeah, buddy, don't listen to the women you've been married to for ten plus years and had children with. Take the side of the obviously weird kid who just came into your lives". And don't say to yourself "Gee, I wonder why our new little girl goes nuts when someone wants to touch her neck ribbon or mentions going to the dentist ?". There were so many illogical story devices used in this film. But, if you like stories about dumb adults and killers who take advantage of their total stupidity this should please you. IMHO, 'The Good Son' was a much better example of this type of film.'Orphan' was at least watchable and did have it's moments now and then. Sadly, I was hoping for something much better based on the comments I'd seen here. The film is way over-rated. There is nothing new in it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding horror film!!!....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched the horror film Orphan last night, and i found it to be a outstanding film. I thought that the acting was excellent particularly the actress that played Esther. The story is about a couple called Kate and John Coleman who are trying to rebuild their marriage after going through a troubled relationship, because Kate has had drinking problems she is under therapy with Dr. Browning and has not drunk for one year. They have a daughter called Maxine who is deaf. Kate is still having nightmares of their stillborn baby Jessica. They decide to adopt a child They meet a nine year-old Russian girl Esther at the St. Marina Orphanage,they immediately fall in love with her. Max the youngest daughter becomes close to Esther, but her brother Daniel does not make his new stepsister very welcome. Soon Kate feels that Esther is being manipulative towards her and has some disturbance and she thinks it could be hormone or borderline personality disorder John refuses to listen to his wife. And soon their marriage begins to break down. Kate calls Sister Abigail in the orphanage and the sister tells Kate that Esther had been involved in many troubles in the past. When Sister Abigail visits Kate, Esther kills her with a hammer Kate decides to go further into Esthers past, she contacts the Saarne Institute, a mental hospital in Estonia, and discovers that the girl is not who she makes out to be. I Found this to be an excellent horror film and one of the best that i have seen for a few years, and one that i would very much recommend to people. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Murderous adopted daughters are scary, the fractured psyche of a mother is scarier.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to like this more and parts of it I did, those parts that seem to have by accident escaped from a different more intelligent sort of movie, one that doesn't fill its inspirational gaps with contrivance and the usual clichés we've seen in a thousand similar movies, but the movie constantly urged me to treat it worse than it may have deserved by sucking out almost any trace of psychological ambiguity from the get go and filling those gaps with the same old slasherish hijinks. By the end the movie can no longer support itself. It needs the jolt of two twists to keep it from going into cardiac arrest.And then it does just that, by going off in the ice to have a prolonged knife fight whose outcome is rendered irrelevant by the same plot point it's called to replace. For Kate to be killed by her adopted daughter is a much lighter fate than to be estranged by her own family, locked up in a rehab clinic, knowing Esther lives under the same roof with her children. It's Kate's predicament the most intriguing thing in the movie for me. When her son goes into cardiac arrest and she comes out of the hospital room and slaps Esther in the face, forcing the nurses to subdue her while her husband leads Esther to safety, there's a fundamental break in communication there that I find the most horrifying. What if Esther was completely innocent and she projected her own guilt to her? Of course we know she's not, because the movie has painted Esther the "VILLAIN!!" from the get go for the benefit of an audience that shouldn't be challenged by modern horror films exactly because "hey, it's only a horror film". So everything is very literal here which immediately makes for a lesser movie.And there lies Orphan's failure: it never allows for that frightening glimpse into a psyche fractured by trauma to gestate and mature. Because it never breaks free from literal horror to peer behind the veil. Like its cheap jump scares, Orphan's shock twists last only for a second. Plot must be pushed on after that. "So, she didn't come from an orphanage at all, what's next?". Orphan then falters not because it presents the frightening trauma of losing a child (even an unborn one) and then relegates it in the background and constantly tip-toes around it but because it fails to realize what's the scariest thing here. In the end Kate saves her daughter and all is well. But what if the loss of her unborn child broke something in her that can't be made right again? The director ought to have taken a very good look at Nicholas Roeg's Don't Look Now before he made this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The evil ESTHER</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ORPHAN is a horror thriller about a little girl that is adopted by a family which suffered a recent trauma about losing a child. The family already has two kids, but the parents decide to adopt one more child probably trying to overpass that trauma. They choose a 9 years old girl which was born in Russia but speaks English very well as she's living in the USA for some years. At first the child is very kind and quickly calls their attention, but when she goes living to their home, some problems start appearing? This film is not quite original because this kind of argument has been done for many times, but it has an unexpected twist near the end. At least it was unexpected for me in spite of not liking it too much! In fact I didn't appreciate that twist but I must say it was unusual in this kind of plot. I don't know if it's absolutely original though.About the production I think it is average for a horror flick. I must say I didn't find it particularly scary in spite of recognize it has two or three nice horror scenes.I appreciated the main character, ESTHER, played by the young actress Isabelle Fuhrman, because I think it's very rich and was very well created for a plot like that, but I also think it could have been a bit more explored? It's not a great horror thriller but it's not bad either, I score it 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Coleman family have had problems (Mom's alcoholism, the near death of deaf daughter Max, stillbirth of baby Jessica) and, as a move to overcome these family wounds, they adopt Russian orphan Esther. She's very bright and intelligent, but there's something about her, as Mom Kate gradually comes to realise. Dad John can't see it, though.You're never quite certain what genre this film occupies, but it doesn't matter. It gets most of the clichés - jarring music, people suddenly appearing in mirrors, sudden loud noises etc. - out of the way early on and, for the last half or more, it's simply nerve-shreddingly tense and quite brutal on the audience. I wouldn't want to say more - this is not a film to give away too much to others about.The cast is excellent, but the three main youngsters are awesome - stunningly good.If you like movies which put you through the ringer, then this is one for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**SPOILERS** After her newborn child-who was to be named Jeniffer-died during a failed delivery at the hospital the mother Kate Coleman, Vera Farmia, went into a deep depression and started to hit the bottle.It's now two years later and both Kate an her husband John, Peter Sarsgaard, adopt nine year-old Esther, Isabelle Fuhrman, from a local Catholic orphanage in the hope she'll replaced Jenniffer; The daughter that they never had the chance of knowing. As things were to turn out this was to become a big big mistake on the part of the unsuspecting Colemans! Esther was not what she at first seemed to be but it would take a number of horrific incidents for the Coleman's to finally realize it! But by them it may well have been to late for them and their two young children the deft and mute Maxine, Aryana Engineer, and Danny, Jimmy Bennett, as well as anyone else who just happened to get in Esther's way! Including the Sister Superior of the orphanage that Esther came from Sister Abigal,CCH Pounder.Even though the film is compared to "The Omem" and "the Bad Seed" it's really a one of a kind horror flick where you don't realize-like in the previous two child horror films-what's behind sweet little Esther's horrid actions! That's until the shocking secret of her past is reviled, from far off Estonia no less, to the audience as well as Kate that comes to light in the last ten or so minutes left in the movie!***SPOILER ALERT*** There's something very strange about Esther and you notice it almost as soon as you, and the Coleman's, meet her at the orphanage! She's pretty smart even, when she wants to be, adoring but there's something very unnerving about her in how unusually mature, both in knowledge and emotion, she is for nine year-old girl. That something is what Esther has been keeping under raps, or better yet ribbons, all throughout the movie! It's a little something that she took with her out for her home in Estonia, not Russia like she has people think, that will reveal the true nature of her character as well as mental state!Extremely disturbing movie that has as it's villain, little Esther, one of the most cold blooded and manipulative psycho killers in motion picture history! It's not that Esther is at first a sweet and innocent-looking child. It's that she's just too perfect in both committing and covering up the horrors that she perpetrates in the film! Like she's had from previous experience in doing these same horrible acts before!It's Kate who starts to put the missing pieces of the puzzle together in just who Esther really is and how she's been so successful in covering up her past! A cover-up that even fooled Esther's, or the Coleman family, psychiatrist Dr Browning, Margo Mantindale. It's later when Esther tries to silence Kate, by having her declared insane or murdered, that even her very naive husband John finally realizes just what he's up against! Something or someone that he, and almost every one else in the film, had been completely fooled by! But with John now totally out of it, by Esther getting him drunk, and coming face to face with this unspeakable horror he is in no condition to fight it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Adopting the Spawn of Satan . . . Very Good Chiller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You cannot say a lot about "Orphan" without spoiling the ending.This "Bad Seed" melodrama about a cute little girl who qualifies as a couple's worst nightmare lives up to its R-rating with murder either by knife or pillow. Of course, the language is profane and offensive more than a couple of times.Spanish-born American film director Jaume Collet-Serra makes up for his uninspired 2005 remake of "House of Wax" with "Orphan," an articulate mystery thriller with a shrewdly written screenplay by newcomer David Johnson based on an Alex Mace story. Nothing that Collet-Serra and his scenarists do can prepare you for the last quarter-hour revelation that not only spins "Orphan" on its head but will also spin your head on its axis. Indeed, "Orphan" opens like a formulaic chiller about the mistakes that come with adopting children, especially if the adolescent is the spawn of Satan.A young, upscale married couple that should have been content with a boy and a hearing impaired daughter decide to compensate for the tragic death of their third child (he died stillborn) and adopt a needy child. The wife just wants to spread the love that she had for their third child. They adopt a 9-year old Russian girl and the rest of their life becomes a nightmare. "Orphan" relies on anti-Eastern European prejudices. The idea that an American couple might adopt a Russian child sounds rather liberal, but she winds up being an albatross around their necks.Peter Sargaard and Vera Farmiga make a convincing couple who have seen the downside of life while Isabela Furhman of "Hounddog" is chilling as the villainess. Collet-Serra does an excellent job of building up the suspense and tension after the couple adopts the girl and brings her home. The filmmakers slip in bits and pieces that make sense only after you've seen the film. The ending, again, is a shocker!</fullReview>

The movie's script is written in a slow burn style. I was thinking Orphan is another by the numbers psycho child horror film. However the slow start and the predictable plot is calibrated into the story by the plot twist and makes for a great story. Wow, I did not see the plot twist coming. I was blind sided. The movie follows the school of Hitchcock. Orphan is the best movie so far this summer. I would give Orphan a eight or nine out of ten. Go see Orpahan in the movie theater.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Adopting a child is often a chance for most parents to fulfill their lost dreams of having children. Of course, this supposes their chosen child will fill the empty void left vacant by their unfulfilled searches. However, not all adopted children turn out to be what the parents sought in the first place. That is the synopsis of this film. The movie is called " The Orphan " and is more of a nightmare than a dream come true. The story is of a grieving set of parents who decide to adopt Easter (Isabelle Fuhrman) whom they believe is the 'perfect' daughter. Both the parents began by giving their adopted child all they loving and home environment they have. This works out splendidly for a short while until strange and bizarre events began taking place. Under normal circumstances they would easily be explained, until they begin to form a pattern, That is when Kate (Vera Farmiga) the wife and mother, begins to suspect her adopted daughter is not as innocent as she pretends to be. Despite his daughter's faults, the husband (Peter Sarsgaard) believes it's his wife who is developing a vivid and vindictive attitude towards the child. It's not until Sister Abigail (CCH Pounder) informs them their adopted child may not be all she claims to be. The movie is careful to release its restrained suspense until the unfolding drama begins to pour out in torrents, when suddenly everything explodes with dark excitement and runs rampant. Good suspenseful scenes allow the movie to create a frightening deluge for anyone seeking a worthwhile movie. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pretty competent horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Horror is my favorite movie genre and, maybe because of that, I use to see its movies with a bit of indulgence, excusing the repetition of structures, subjects or stories if they feel natural on the plot.But even with that positive predisposition, I usually dislike the horror sub-genus of "evil kid", because I generally find the movies to be poor and repetitive (however, of course there are some exceptions).The cause of the evilness can be psychological, paranormal or genetic; the villain can be a boy or a girl; and the adults will live cheated by the apparent innocence from the kid, until it is too late.My point is that, for every movie which adds creativity and ingenuity to this sub-genus, there are dozens of predictable and clichéd rehashes which try to scandalize us with the evil acts from a boy or girl.Fortunately, Orphan is one of those movies which add something new and creative to the formula, at the same time it has a good rhythm, some genuinely creepy scenes and an excellent twist in the end.Peter Sarsgaard's performance on this movie is a bit bland, but the rest of the main cast makes a very good work.Vera Farmiga shows energy, conviction and credibility.The same can be said about Isabella Fuhrman, who brings a detailed performance as the evil Esther.I also liked the audacity from director Jaume Collet-Serra (who made a huge improvement after the tedious remake of House of Wax, his previous horror film) pretty much, because he is not afraid of showing graphic and disturbing scenes, at the difference of so many insipid Hollywood filmmakers who work on the horror genre.I think the best element from this movie is its twist in the end, which is absolutely ingenious, unexpected and does not feel forced at all.Besides Sarsgaard's performance, another fail I found on this movie was that 3 or 4 elements feel recycled from other movies, and they take a bit of credibility to the generally very solid screenplay.In spite of those fails, I liked Orphan pretty much and I took a very nice surprise with it.It may not be an excellent movie, but it perfectly fulfills its intention of bringing a very entertaining time which produces a few creeps.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great new horror movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Horror has been real stale for a long time now, with only foreign movies like (REC) and the borderline-horror Let the Right One In bringing anything worthwhile to the table. But what about America, the country that spawned the most popular icons of the genre? It's mostly been wallowing in silly remakes of shitty Japanese movies or bad PG 13 ghost stories - and let's not even mention SAW and Hostel - since the last half of the 90s. It's time for a real turn-around movie to bring America back to the forefront. The Descent was good, and those horror comedies like Planet Terror and SLiTHER were nice distractions, but we need a really good, kickass return to why horror is good in the first place. With that said...Orphan. I mean, good god. Where did this even come from? It's the most terrifying, depraved, downright evil movie I've seen out of a mainstream US theater in years! This movie is ballsy, not afraid at all to take risks or make you feel completely hopeless. I had no idea what was going to happen next at any turn in this movie; everything was shot in the dark and masterfully suspenseful. And yeah, of course the kid is evil, but she's built up in a way that makes you like her and feel sorry for her at first - something that even a good movie like Omen didn't do. I was honestly completely surprised at a lot of the things this movie did, from the twisted opening sequence to the final bloody chase through the snow. This movie is brutal and does not hold back, and I like that a lot about it. It doesn't even try to sugar coat the children from harm - I'm obviously not going to say I like this about it, but that's what makes it so goddamn SCARY, and that is why it rules. Where other movies would come off as silly doing some of the stuff here, and while some of it is a bit "been there done that," it's all just executed so well that I can't say no. Oh, and there are even a few comedic moments scattered throughout, adding an unexpected element of humor to the darkly chimeric mix here. They aren't too prevalent, but they're definitely noticeable. It doesn't lighten the mood, it just makes the movie more real. That's what any humor in a movie like this should do. Yeah, there are a few dull moments, and a few kind of generic scares, but those are in the minority. This movie is just supremely good, definitely the best horror movie I've seen out of the US this decade. Highly recommended to those of you who can't turn down a good headtrip every now and then.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hands down the best thriller I've seen this year.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen a few thrillers over the years of visiting the theater but none of them really captured my interest or gripped me like wet rope. When I first saw the trailers for this, I thought "I am so gonna see this" so I came into this with high expectations. And you know what? This film not only met them but exceeded them tremendously. Most thrillers jump straight into the film with no build up; here it makes a huge impression by letting us get to know the characters and their inner struggles nicely sprinkled with interesting back stories that gives the film added gravity. I suppose some are impatient to the slow build up but I had no problem at all of the film going from a slow start and it really pays off. No thriller has ever kept me on the edge of my seat like this one. It's intelligently directed and written with best performances; the real standout being of course Isabel Furhman, who gives one hell of a villainous role that rivals that of Kathy Bates's character in "Misery". One of the best parts of the film is the visual cues during certain scenes that are clearly a reflection of the dark inner psyche of a truly tormented "young" soul. I'm not gonna spoil any plot details in this review but I will say that you should definitely see "Orphan" because it's one of the best psychological thrillers of the year.10 stars all the way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Satisfying and Surprisingly Disturbing "Child Killer" Thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Orphan" focuses on Kate (Vera Farmiga), a former Yale piano instructor and recovering alcoholic, and her husband, John (Peter Sarsgaard). They have two children: pre-teenaged Daniel and four-year-old Maxine, "Max", who is almost entirely deaf. After Kate has a stillborn, it leaves the couple unhappy, and they decide on adoption, which leads them to a prim and well-mannered 9 year old Russian girl named Esther. She seems like the perfect child; she's well versed, a talented painter, and favors old-fashioned dresses and hair ribbons to jeans and t-shirts. They decide that she is the one. Unfortunately, for Kate and John, they made a very big mistake, because Esther is not what she appears to be at all. Her deceptive nature and manipulatory tactics are seen by Kate very soon after she comes to live with them, but nobody else seems to notice - and a series of "accidents" and misfortunes seem to follow Esther wherever she goes, which increase in violence and put everyone in danger.Based on advertisements, "Orphan" may appear to be a run-of-the-mill "evil kid" flick that we've seen time and time again. But don't be led to think that, or you will miss out on what is quite likely the best horror film of the year thus far. The film is directed by Jaume Collett-Sera, who was behind 2005's "House of Wax" (which, while many people did not seem to like it, I thought it was a fairly good horror movie), and it's a stylish one at that - much more mature than "House of Wax", though, in both themes and direction, and with a more mature cast as well. The camera-work is sleek and effective, and the film is very visually attractive, with its stark wintry New England setting (which is so wonderfully appropriate for this type of film if I may say so myself) and impressive house constructions.As for the disturbing nature of the film which I mention in my summary line, I was surprised at how irked I was by some of the scenes in this film. I think it mostly was because they were such awful, horrific things that involved such young children, but it was bothersome nonetheless. Esther's manipulation of the Coleman children is also interesting and puts them in a handful of awful situations. The murder scenes and graphic details are presented realistically as well, which, when combined with young kids, make for some very disturbing viewing material, probably even more so for parents. Besides this, the "scary" factor of the film is somewhere in the middle. There's some cheap jump scares and a couple of 'gotcha!' moments, which won't be too effective for seasoned horror fans. However, the film makes up for this in suspense, which is wound tight as the film progresses from its rather leisurely opening act. In terms of acting, it is, in a word, impressive. Vera Farmiga is our leading lady, who acts as a sort of guide throughout the film, with whom we are able to empathize with, and she plays it well. Her husband, played by Peter Sarsgaard, is disbelieving of Esther's rotten other side, and while his role is typical, he performs well. Now, on to the children - both actors who portray the Coleman kids show talent (especially the youngest daughter, who is playing a deaf-mute child).And at the center of the show, there is Isabelle Fuhrman as our villain - little orphan Esther. While all the acting in the film is impressive, Fuhrman's is the most so, probably because this is her first feature film, and she, at 12 years old, was able to tackle such a complex and mature role and play it perfectly. Her character is a two-faced little devil, as we know from the start- manipulative, intelligent, and has a whole dress pocket full of tricks. Part of you wants to hug her because of her sweet smile, prim disposition, and cute Russian accent - and the other part of you wants to kick her in the face because you know that underneath it all she's actually a sociopathic murderess. She's a frustrating character to say the least, and a creepy one at that. Farmiga has a few moments with her that provide the audience with some well-deserved catharsis, including a swift slap in the face in a hospital scene that knocks Esther to the floor and produces cheers from the audience. It's all good fun.Now, as for the twist - well, I won't reveal it here, because that wouldn't be fair to anyone. It's a very clever one, and while I found its revelation to be a little underwhelming, it is still great nonetheless. Once it is revealed, there are pieces of the film that come together and little moments that will suddenly make complete sense - so, in that vein, the writing here is well-laced and very fluid. I don't think I've seen a twist quite like this before in all my years of watching horror films, so I was happy with it. The film ends on the ultimate cathartic note, and it closes appropriately with a shot of the wintry Connecticut forest.In closing, "Orphan" is a classy and solid film. It takes the evil child premise that audiences have seen before and tweaks the ending with a twist that is so clever it hurts. On top of that, there is visually appealing scenery and cinematography, a continuous thread of suspense peppered with some very disturbing material, impressive acting (especially from the children), some laughs, and a handful of lofty moments that will have the crowd giddy with satisfaction. Horror fans and general audiences will receive a little bit of everything in "Orphan", so it makes from an all-around good time at the movies. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's something wrong with Esther.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The tragic loss of their unborn child has devastated Kate and John, taking a toll on both their marriage and Kate's fragile psyche as she is plagued by nightmares and haunted by demons from her past. Struggling to regain some semblance of normalcy in their lives, the couple decides to adopt another child. At the local orphanage, both John and Kate find themselves strangely drawn to a young girl named Esther. Almost as soon as they welcome Esther into their home, however, an alarming series of events begins to unfold, leading Kate to believe that there's something wrong with Esther?this seemingly angelic little girl is not what she appears to be.I just literally came back from a screening of ORPHAN and forgive me, I'm still soaking in what was in the film. Wow. This was a messed up movie. Really, some of the things in here are just flat out wrong and the fact that the filmmakers had the gumption to do what they did, from the twist to the taboos, I applaud them. ORPHAN has what usually most horror movies have, from the music cue waiting to have people jump out of their seats to the character who is clueless from what's going on. I believe the movie is self aware of itself and other horror films and uses that to its advantage to have fun with the clichés. However, what sets this apart from other films is that it pushed the boundaries. After the movie ends, you can't help but have an uncomfortable feeling lingering as you drive home.But I won't say anymore about what boundaries the film pushed, because that ruins the fun. The film has a running time of barely over two hours, which is longer than most films these days, let alone horror films. Fortunately, this isn't a bad thing because the first half of the film was like a great character study. There is more character development in the first ten minutes of this film compared to all of most other horror movies. I was taken off guard. I appreciated that, making most of the characters people who you would root for.Surprisingly, there is a lot of dark humor. I laughed out loud more than I thought I would and I'm sure the audience I was with was surprised too. When the film started, the audience was quiet, because they weren't sure how the film will play out. By the end, everyone seemed to have the time of their lives. I know I did. With its shares of dark humor, the film also produces some tense and unsettling scenes. This is mostly due to Jaume Collet-Serra, who directed the remake of HOUSE OF WAX, one of my favorite slashers. He sets everything up nicely, while using sound to make the audience uncomfortable. Be on the look out for him in the future. He has a big career in front of him. I know it.The film has its strong performances...and I mean from everyone. Even the kids have strong performances, which is saying a lot. I didn't feel annoyed by them. A film like this must be carried well by the evil kid herself, and she absolutely rises to the task. Isabelle Fuhrman does such a fantastic job playing the evil Esther. After saying that, it still feels like an understatement. Remember Damien? You know, the Devil's child? Well, he seems like a nice kid now. The film is also supported by two great leads, played by Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard. Farmiga plays well as the sympathetic mother that nobody but herself believes while Sarsgaard feels like a clueless father and a great one at that.The film also has a great score composed by John Ottman, along with some nice production values, which give the film a slick look. Overall, if you want to see an evil kid causing havoc, here's the movie. The film mixes the dark humor and tense scenes really well. There's also a twist in the movie towards the end which sets itself apart from other evil kid movies. The twist is not improbable at all, which is a great thing. The film is pure entertainment from beginning to end and it works because of the fantastic Isabelle Fuhrman. I can't praise her enough. Finally, all I have to say is this: Esther is just an evil little kid. Pity, because she's such a great well-mannered artist who can play Tchaikovsky flawlessly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best horror film in the last 5 years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Orphan is the best horror film I have seen in years, perhaps since The Ring and Mothman Prophecies. It has a perfect blend of chills, scares, excellent direction, wonderful performances and a brilliant villain. I was nervous, anxious and angry all at different times in the film. Some might say that it is a little silly because all you would need is someone to blow the whistle on this little girl, but the screenplay is smart enough to give reasons why that just didn't happen.Isabelle Fuhrman plays Esther, and something just isn't quite right with her. Her looks, her obsession with her new father and her precocious behaviour just don't add up. Then you have Vera Fermiga, of The Departed fame. She is simply magnificent in this film and if the academy ever took horror films seriously, she would be a shoe in for a nomination for best actress this year. She and Fuhrman carry the film. She is strong, vulnerable and tough as nails in here. She gets to play the thankless role of someone who is looked at as a pariah of sorts due to her sordid past and when the trouble starts, no one believes her.Orphan will have you on the edge of your seat and covering your eyes literally. Juame Collet-Sara, who's only real credit is the excellent 2005 film House of Wax, has a keen eye for detail and he reminds me of Spielberg in here in some ways. I really hope his work is recognized and he gets more work. This was produced by Joel Silver and Leonardo DiCaprio.This is one of the best films of the year so far.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One word: Awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you enjoy watching Law and Order:SUV or Criminal Minds or Hostel and you have been diagnosed as not a threat to those around you then you might enjoy "Orphan." A horribly made movie that isn't about the sexualization of children...but really is about that more than anything else. You can excuse it any way you want with any plot twists you want, but that is what this film is really about. I feel bad for all of the children for having to participate in this and I feel ashamed of Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard for involving themselves and eventually involving me because I watched it because they were in it. Little kids participating in murder and wanted to participate in sex, no matter what excuse you give, is sick exploitative $#!t.Oh and it also was not scary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Amazing and riveting horror experience that still manages to throw a real twist into the mix</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Orphan looked good. Predictable probably but good. My expectations were decent but who knew the film would blow them away. This is probably the best horror film I have seen in a very long time, this year probably. The story is mature and intelligent and so incredibly suspenseful that you will never tear your eyes away. The gore is not used gratuitously but the death scenes are nonetheless terrifying and the performance in the film are outstanding lead by a little girl that under different circumstances deserves an Academy Award in my opinion. Orphan actually turns in a rather unique story with some obvious familiar tones but every film does that, some better than others. The movie will give you a throwback to The Good Son with Macaulay Culkin, Children of The Corn and so forth but the greatness of the performances outweighs any and all familiarity. We may have some great future talent in new writers Alex Mace and David Johnson. Horror might be easy to write but to truly create an experience that will haunt, terrify and horrify, especially nowadays that requires a certain amount of talent.That talent probably owes a huge amount to the twelve year old little girl I mentioned earlier. Isabelle Fuhrman is literally mind blowing as the mentally deranged, secretive Esther. Her dark brooding eyes go from compassionate to killer in seconds and she makes it so believable and you will literally fear this strange little girl. She has probably created one of the most memorable horror killers in movie history and might not even know it. This little girl has a promising career ahead of her because her performance will chill you to the bone. A particularly disturbing scene has her melting down in a bathroom stall and it will send chills through your body. Vera Farmiga gives a powerful performance as the grieving mother who is recovering from the loss of her baby. She is also the one to slowly realize Esther's issues. Farmiga is terrific and a great scream queen but in a far more intelligent way along the lines of Jamie Lee Curtis and that is a great comparison to be made. Peter Sarsgaard is excellent as the perfect macho male, sexy, the perfect father, understanding, hard working but oblivious to Esther. His chemistry with Farmiga is excellent and their scenes together are perfect. Young Jimmy Bennett and lovely little Aryana Engineer (who as in the movie is deaf in real life) play the other children in the family. Both of them give excellent performances and play opposite Fuhrman expertly. As good as she is these two hold their own and manage to really stand out.This cast works so well together with a script that is brilliantly written. This is one of those rare gems that everything just falls into place and blows your mind. Director Jaume Collet-Serra obviously has a talent for horror story telling. Despite being critically and box office panned the House of Wax remake was a great teen horror flick and he seems to have a passion for horror and make us want more. Right away, as an enormous horror fan, the sheer ideas and potential for an Orphan series started to branch in my mind. While it is likely that none of them would ever see the full greatness of the original it would be just incredible to watch. Horror fans pay attention because this might be one of the greatest films of the year and absolutely one of my favorite horror films as of right now. Go see it NOW!! The incredible ending will blow your mind, you will absolutely, unequivocally NEVER see it coming. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some good, some bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a horror film fan of long standing, but there haven't been many good ones of late. So I went to see "Orphan" with a rather jaded feeling of trepidation.The film partly succeeded in providing a pleasant surprise. It had some genuinely scary moments, I didn't see the solution coming until we were presented with it, and Isabelle Fuhrman's performance was a masterpiece of creepy menace.The real problem is with the adults. There is a desperate lack of originality or even plausibility in their characters. John (Peter Sarsgaard) as the father displays a touching, but utterly moronic, faith in his adopted daughter, to the extent of believing and trusting her rather than his other children or his wife (Kate, played by Vera Farmiga). Kate starts off the same, but at least sees the light eventually. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for her therapist, Doctor Browning (Margo Martindale), an "expert" who is taken in right from the start and whose only skill is in mouthing the most cretinous platitudes and clichés; if the decision rested with me, this doctor would be struck off.The action, however, is well staged, taking place mostly in an ultra-modern house and a tree house, both providing plenty of corners where villains can lurk and high places where innocents can be trapped or from which they can be pushed?A mixed bag then ? flawed, but worth seeing.Rating: 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally, an excellent mainstream horror...and its actually original!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the trailer for this I did not think much of it, it just looked like an average slasher with a little girl as the villain. But I was totally wrong, this is a horror, yes, but it is more of a drama/horror than straight horror. Not only does it go for two hours (very rare for a horror film, especially mainstream), but it has a great cast who portray characters with some depth who we actually care about...well, most of them anyway. The story itself is very simple, Kate (Vera Farmiga) and John Coleman (Peter Sarsgaard) have two children, but lost their third child during pregnancy. Therefore, they decide to adopt, and while at the orphanage stumble across a nine year old girl on her own, Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman). Both Kate and John bond with her instantly, and three weeks later she is part of the family. However, it does not take long before Esther's dark side shows, and the only person who sees this is the mother, but who would suspect innocent Esther of foul play? This is the set-up for a suspenseful, dark, disturbing horror film that packs an excellent twist and some truly frightening scenes. There is an excellent scene in a playground, in which Esther stalks a bully through a maze, and a very tense final ten minutes which I shan't reveal! However, these scenes feature some cheap false scares accompanied by a loud sound. These are very tired, and for most horror fans are not the least bit effective. It is a shame they are relied on throughout this movie, because director Jaume Collet-Serra (who directed the 2005 slasher remake of House of Wax) builds up tension very well, but spoils with scares which are hokey and outdated.That was really my only problem with the film, nothing else bothered me at all. If I were to nitpick, Sarsgaard's John Coleman was written to be a little to naive I think, because it was fairly obvious that Esther was troubled. This is not Sarsgaard's fault, he does a great job, this was the writer's one and only fault.The acting was outstanding, Farmiga is excellent as the mother. She basically carries the movie, and plays a strong female character who is easy to sympathise with. It is revealed she drunk after the death of her baby which led to an unfortunate accident. Not only does this lead almost everyone else to think ill of her, but leaves her to unravel Esther's past by herself. Fuhrman is simply amazing as Esther, playing a two-sided character so well at such a young age is kind of scary. Going from sweet little angel to scary-as-shite murderess is her specialty, and I can see her in many horror movies to come.Many people say Orphan loses momentum towards the end and turns into a derivative slasher, but I could not disagree more. I think the end is perfect, with the twist being revealed with perfect timing to allow for a heart-racing finale. It ended perfectly, and even better, in a way which does not indicate sequel (I hate sequel-friendly endings very much).Although it is not a perfect movie, it is a damn entertaining one, and for a horror movie, is surprisingly intelligent. It does go for awhile, but no scenes drag on, they all have a purpose in developing character and heightening the tension until the very end.4/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best horror movie I have seen in a while.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2009 hasn't been a bad year for scary movies. Well, I have only seen 2 of them this year. Drag me to hell was fantastic, but Orphan starring Peter Sarsgaard and Vera Farminga is the best. It is actually an unpredictable scary film, and you really don't get that that often. Farminga and Sarsgaard star as The Colemans, a couple living in a snowy area with two other kids. The wife has a drinking problem and so they adopt a child. Named Esther(Played very well by Issabelle Furrman). Esther is a Russian orphan who's parents perished is a fire. They think Esther is unique, because she can paint very good pictures(you later find out they aren't that perfect) and apparently can play the piano.For the first half hour or so that she is living there, you are on her side. Because everyone makes fun of her. But later on, after you get to know her, you don't want her to kill these people. The movie gets kind of creepy in the last half hour or so. Because Esther hits on the adoptive father(Peter Sarsgaard). Orphan is by far the most clever horror film of the year. The twist in the end is actually believable. The twist in the end of the movie is very genius. There are a ton of good performances, but the best one goes to Vera Farminga as the mother.She is very convincing and I am on her side. I better get back to the plot. The Colemans aren't very suspicious until many horrible things start to happen. A girl is pushed off a slide. A nun pushes up daisies, and other things happen. The mother is very suspicious about all this because when all of this stuff happens Esther just happens to be there.I have only seen two scary movies this year. Orphan is without a doubt the most clever. Because you can't see the plot twists coming, even in a snowstorm. I'm sorry that was a very dumb joke. I hate to say this but Orphan is one of the best movies of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Orphan: Psycho-drama and horror for family fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was one of the best surprises in recent years. As horror stories go, I usually expect "more of the same". When seeing posters and trailers, I thought pretty much "more of the same". But I am glad to report, this was not "more of the same".The story was extremely well written with twists and turns that easily kept my attention. I'll admit there were some pretty slow moments that made me think it had peaked out early, but I was wrong. Stay with the movie as it squeezes out the last of your disbelief. Just don't believe everything you see and your reward will be the unforeseeable twist. Even if you think they can't be serious, the explanation is justified and real.I liked how the movie was done, almost seeming like "Damien" may have had a sister (btw, she was one "twisted sister"). At first feeling like a Brady Bunch movie gone bad, it soon became more like a docu-drama for discouraging adoption. While this movie could easily become competition for Psycho, Friday the 13th and The Omen I felt this movie was a lot smarter. I never expected the big twist. I certainly appreciated the explanation. Without the explanation, this would have been a major disappointment. Is it realistic? - I don't know. I only know I went in doubtful and came out a believer.Again I loved the writing, the camera work, the twists, the suspenseful events. And even minor disappointments fit in extremely well. I have to say, I didn't like the final moments but you will have to just take that and do with it what you will.While all the actors did very well, I think Isabelle Fuhrman had the biggest challenge and she pulled it off extremely well. She has "disturbing" down perfectly. 8 of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It begins with a horrifying and bloody nightmare from which Vera Farmiga awakes shaken. We don't know it's a nightmare until there is a cut to her sitting up, panting and sweaty. How's that for an imaginative scene?It ends with one of those excruciating scenes in which a slasher -- in this case the adopted and demonic daughter of Farmiga and husband Pete Sarsgaard chases everyone around the darkened house with a bloody knife, murdering her way through the gloom. Every movement of the knife seems to be accompanied by the snick of sharp metal against metal -- even when the knife is only being waved through the air. Even when it's brandished UNDER WATER.Good-bye Sarsgaard, overcome by a pubescent young girl. And it's almost good-bye for Farmiga and her younger daughter as they are chased through the snowy woods by the knife-wielding juvenile maniac.The adopted kid is one of those slashers who are very difficult to kill, a veritable Rasputin. You can stomp her, you can kick her face in, you can shoot her. She falls down, apparently lifeless, but just as the sweet music begins to play, she comes back to life more animated, more thoroughly evil, than before. You can pull her underwater too. Doesn't matter. Nothing matters.In her last scene, the adopted demon drowns the way it has become fashionable to drown -- the way Robin Williams drowns in "Insomnia," and George Clooney in "The Perfect Storm", and Leonard DeCaprio in "Titanic." Each drifts slowly down into the murk, looking upward, sometimes smiling. There is no longer any other way to die underwater. A struggle would be unseemly.You want a laugh? Johnson and Mace, the "writers", whose names I believe are actually the nom de plume of some deranged computer, have Farmiga in a hospital bed. She receives a call on her cell phone, informing her that the adopted nine-year-old daughter is really a thirty-three year old homicidal maniac and that her husband and child are in immediate danger. What would you, the viewer, do? You'd rush to the nurse's station, have the caller repeat the information, and dial the police pronto. Not this heroine. As always happens in these movies, she tells no one, stumbles out to her car, and speeds over the snow, ice-slick roads to her distant home -- alone.This is derivative garbage, mostly from "The Omen" but borrowing from any source that promises the additional thrill that will suck another unwary customer into the theater. It's only ambition is to deliver money-making thrills. If you're into arousal jags, this one should do the job.The pity is that both Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard are fine actors of considerable talent and range. Farmiga, in particular, has the kind of quirky face and sexy figure that seems made for the camera. Her features are plastic, as if some sculptor had begin molding a beautiful visage and then was called away before he was quite finished. And Sarsgaard can play good or bad. He has the kind of bland cleanliness that can go either way. But seeing him lying on his back on the floor, with that maniacal kid sitting on his chest, stabbing him repeatedly while he watches curiously -- well, it was all too much.How can anyone attach his or her name to an abomination like this?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Devolves into Mass Manipulation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers, spoilers, spoilers.First of all lets get the acting out of the way. Its superb. From all.And that ends the positivity of this review.This film had so much potential and it uses only about half of it. The rest is stuff we've seen before, like the use of a mirror to shock us and the person using it. The fake out: The music rises and we expect someone with an axe around the corner and wham! no one there. In fact this was way overused.Some neat surprises. Some neat twists. And that I fear is where the movie takes a dump. No one from this point on acts realistically. The deaf youngest daughter when we first meet her is hand signing like crazy. She can talk your eyes out. Then when we need her to "speak"...nothing.The husband doesn't believe for a second that his family is in danger and when all the evidence piles up, he doesn't blame the crazy girl, no..its all the wife's fault. And then when you think the husband can't be more deceived he takes the murderous girl home with him and his daughter. Course, he pays the price for that.And of course, to add to the frenetic pace that eventually overwhelms the film, the camera man gets the serious shakes and we are never allowed to fully see the girl/woman in full or completely.The movie had nothing but potential, but like many others like it treads very familiar ground, and when trying to turn down a path few have tried, it makes the victims act in ways that seem ridiculous.And finally, the director still saw the need to have a smoking scene. Oh, how shamelessly the tobacco companies make deposits into the pockets of producers and directors. And how sad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's Halloween, a night that I have, traditionally for the past 20 years, set aside to watch the latest scary flick. This year's selection was Jaume Collet-Serra's film 'Orphan'. All those cute little tikes were outside dressed like Princesses at the 4-H children's' beauty contest, their parents tailing them like hawks, with cigarettes hanging out of their mouths; the perfect setting to scare the pants off me as this brilliant psychological thriller unfolded before my ever widening eyeballs. Esther, oh, Esther Esther Esther... I can't possibly reveal anything that happens in this film. This is one of the most spectacular screenplays I've watched in ages, written by David Leslie Johnson based on a story by Alex Mace. This should be a prime contender for best screenplay in 2010. It is gripping from start to finish. It begins quietly with the beguiling Esther being adopted by an upscale couple who've had their share of tribulations with children. These are average, successful Americans we're talking about here, bringing this hair-raising story very close to home for millions of viewers who have the guts to see it. Little moments of seemingly insignificant tension and release take place but build cumulatively until, at about 80 minutes into watching it, I had to put the thing on pause so I could blink and walk around the house to see if the doors were locked against those dreadful trick-or-treating beasts and that the back light was on for the night, something I never bother with, normally.Make no mistake, this is one bloody, ruthless film and Esther is one scary little bitch. She's cute as a spooky cat, until she begins her little tricks. I began to dread what was coming when about 40 minutes into the film Esther says f**k in such a way as to cause my hair to stand on end. We hear kids say that word all the time, trying to show off and sound tough. Not Esther. She just says it and it is like a nuclear blast to the senses.The ending, the one used in the final cut, is harrowing, following a climactic twist in the story that is truly shocking.The actors are excellent. Peter Sarsgaard is his usual laid-back persona and a bit one dimensional, but it suits this smug, rather weak character whose mother, Gramma, on the evidence of her personality here, is a classic monstre sacré, adding speculative dimensions to the highly charged sexual undertone of the entire film. If Vera Farmiga doesn't win best actress for her role as his wife there is no justice or fairness in Hollywood. She is magnificent as the adoptive mother. And she is a fine pianist as well.Her two natural children, Max, her deaf little girl, and Daniel her pre-teen son, are played with a naturalism and surety that can't be taught in any method acting class. The young actors are Aryana Enginner and Jimmy Bennett. But even more astounding is the performance by Isabelle Fuhrman as the eponymous 'heroine' Esther. To describe the range of her performance would cause me to include a spoiler, or at least a too close to the bone hint that might ruin this film for those who haven't seen it yet.She, too, would be a close contender to Vera Farmiga as best actress in 2010. A great great cast! The music is minimalist but perfect for this tense story. The cinematography is wholly naturalistic, the most high-tech aspect of the film being the use of black lites in Esther's bedroom. There is none of the over-used CGI or any of those tiresome tricks that are so prevalent in the junk coming out of Hollywood these days. 'Orphan' is a straight-ahead horror flick like 'Night of the Living Dead' only it has no fantasy elements in it at all. And like all great horror flicks the viewer has sympathy for the tragedy of the 'monster'. And Esther's life is a tragedy in spite of everything.I expect the Academy of Motion Sickness Pictures will ignore this masterpiece because it probably didn't make enough money, but I predict the DVD will sell millions as the years pass and the perfection of this classic film is recognized by more and more people.'Orphan' is definitely for adults only. There is no nudity and the 'bad' words are not really offensive in any vulgar or pornographic sense, and the bloody bits are not sickening or over-abundant, but it's far too intense for pre-teens. I keep calling 'Orphan' a horror but it isn't. It's a very disturbing and complex psychological thriller. Hitchcock would probably have been proud to have made this film. It's almost as good as 'Psycho'. I don't think 'Orphan' is a 'B' movie at all. If it is then so is all of Hitchock's output.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should be called 'Idiot'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This flick should be called 'Idiot' as it is about a clueless idiot who can't understand anything explained to him in detail by his wife, and signaled by the daughter and son. Throughout half of the movie you'll be swearing at the idiot and wondering how long it will take him to figure out simplest events. The idiot then dies without figuring anything out. An orphan is just an accessory to show how clueless the idiot is.If you removed the idiot and put a smart character in his place this movie could be quite good. Too bad this didn't happen.My review is cynical, but the movie was not much better at insulting my intelligence by pretending that someone could be so ignorant. Such low level of writing puts this movie in the lowest class of cheesy low budget flicks. It is a waste of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An incredibly horrible movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a complete joke of a movie that was a predictable, unrealistic train wreck that got worst as the movie went on.OK, you have an emotionally unstable mother who has a hard time getting over a miscarriage. So this is the main reason why she and her pathetic husband (I'll get to him in a minute) go for adoption. The father is a weak, easily manipulated, nonchalant idiot who thinks everything wrong that's happening around Esther is some kind of coincidence. Everything he does is predictable. He deserved to die and I'm glad Esther killed him. For the children, you have a weak boy who must have taken after his father. The boy doesn't have the audacity to attempt to tell the mother or the father that Esther is a crazy lunatic that put a blade to his neck. Then you have the deaf daughter who is equally as useless as her brother in not telling the parents that the adopted kid is crazy. OK, you can say that the kids were scared of Esther. Fair point, but still not realistic. Overall, a pretty pathetic movie that kept getting worse and less realistic as the movie went on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very enjoyable contemporary American-made horror film delivers the goods and then some!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a very entertaining, enjoyable and well-made horror film. In saying that, there WERE three distinct flaws that came to mind: One, I'm not sure a marriage THAT troubled would be allowed to adopt a child; two, I don't see how ANYONE as intelligent as that pair are proposed to be would ever adopt anyone without having the necessary background information; and three, being a parent myself, there's no way on God's green earth that I would have continued the social experiment of the orphan's adoption the very first moment that something bizarre happened, or that things went awry.Keeping my aforementioned small problems with the film's plot problems in mind, I still greatly enjoyed the film and it was highly enjoyable throughout. I particularly enjoyed the troubled artwork of the orphan in question (shown in neon, only when ultraviolet light was presented).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Orphan' is certainly one of my favourite horror movies. I love a good unexpected twist and this film has one of the best. I certainly didn't see it coming and it makes for an enthralling ending packed full of tension and drama. 'Orphan' keeps you guessing until the very end and does a great job at keeping the viewer intrigued.There are some disturbing scenes in this movie, not so much scary but certainly creepy. It is very suspenseful, especially after the twist is revealed and the film really starts to get exciting and intense. The acting and script are both excellent and make the storyline believable.This is an extremely creepy horror film with a brilliant twist. The plot is compelling and the movie as a whole is put together very well. It will keep you guessing until the very end. 'Orphan' is a great horror film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A really good Child Horror film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the beginning of the movie,when the mother goes to labor, bleeding and people around her ignoring her cries. Add to that, the doctors telling her that she had a miscarriage! I found that scene more scarier and sadder. Although, I have to admit when Ester killed the father and her step - brother, that was also sad and frightening!This movie will probably put you off having a child or even adopting one for a while! I know this is only a fictional but at the same time, it just gives you a feeling that someone is gonna come after you when there wouldn't be! It really resembles "The Omen" quite a lot, though it's a girl this time who might as well be the Devils daughter haha!Even though Isabelle Fuhrman is meant to look scary and horrifying, she was so beautiful as the child killer! I really liked how she used the Russian accent and her style of clothes, she looked fashionably stunning! I can't believe she's 18 now and this movie was out 7 years ago! I feel so old seriously!Anyways it's a really good horror film in a modern way and I liked how the storyline was different. If I made a change to this film, I would have it one hour instead of two. I think the story told us enough of Ester and her tricks!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite movie (possible spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had been anticipating seeing this movie in theaters months before it came out. When I finally saw it, I was shocked, though my anticipation was not wasted. This movie is creepy, bloody, and mind blowing right from the very beginning. There is hardly a scene without suspense. I think the idea of the film itself is an interesting take, which is why I found this movie to be really unpredictable. Isabelle Fuhrman's character (Esther) really adds all the creepiness and mysteriousness to the movie. She is a seemingly innocent and sweet little girl, but evidently hides a dark and twisted secret. The secret is what I think makes the entire movie. It's a HUGE plot twist that ultimately drives the entire movie, more so before it is revealed rather than after. From the time you meet Esther, she has you wondering, What's the deal w/ this girl? The cinematography is excellent and the dialogue, while slow at times, does keep the movie enticing. A must watch for fans of the horror genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Wonderfully Acted and Well Done Thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most important thing to know when going into this movie is expect a thriller, and not a horror movie. I remember when I first saw this marketed, it seemed to be the latter, but a horror fan will likely be very disappointed. Indeed it feels like studio executives were determined that it must be that way, as the only real "horror" in the film consists of a handful shoehorned jump scares. That, and a lackluster (but sufficient) ending are all that really keeps this film from making the top 250.The acting is incredible, particularly that of Isabelle Fuhrman. She's only 18 at the time of this review, but I hope to see her in many future films because she has true talent.All of the characters are unique, and have real issues they deal with. The opening rivaled Up in terms of how touching and sad it was.If you're looking for a great edge of your seat thriller, don't pass this one up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is about an endocrine (hormone) disorder many people are unfamiliar with</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Orphan" tells the story of the Coleman family-father Jon (Peter Sarsgaard), mother Kate (Vera Farmiga) and their 2 children, Daniel aka Danny (Jimmy Bennett) who is a preteen and small deaf daughter, Maxine aka Max (Aryana Engineer). Not all is well in the Coleman household, though. Kate had a devastating miscarriage of 3rd child/2nd daughter, Jessica. The baby's remains are planted inside a bunch of white roses in the family greenhouse. This loss, coupled with Kate's alcoholism and Max's near drowning in the backyard lake have devastated this family. Jon and Kate are seeing a therapist Alice (Margo Martindale) to help them with the loss and heal their family. Jon and Kate want to adopt a child because both of them want to move on with their lives and share their love with a child. Both of them go to St. Mariana's Home for Girls to find a new daughter. Immediately, Jon and Kate are charmed by a 9-year-old Estonian orphan named Esther. Jon found Esther in the classroom painting a picture of a sad mother lion who could't find her cubs. Esther painted the cubs in the picture and the lioness was happy at last. Sister Abigail (CCH Pounder) says Esther's previous family had died in a house fire. She says Esther is a well-mannered, highly intelligent girl who wears conservative dresses and ribbons around her neck and wrists. The only time Esther gives the nuns trouble is when they try to remove these ribbons. Isabelle Fuhrman as Esther is wonderful! One minute she is sweet and charming, the next minute she is an evil little thing with designs on Jon, her adopted father. Kate begins to see her adopted daughter as a menace and so does Danny. Max and Jon think Esther is wonderful until the girl shows them her dark side. It doesn't help that Kate found pictures of Esther's previous families in the Bible Esther carries around and an inscription inside the cover for the Saarne Institute. Kate does some investigating and discovers the Saarne Institute is a mental hospital. She sends them a photo of Esther via the computer. While the family is in the hospital with Danny after Esther nearly killed him in a tree house fire, Dr. Varva the director of the institute calls Kate. The news he has for her is totally unexpected-Esther is not a 9-year-old girl. She is a thirty-three year old mental patient named Leena Klemmer. Leena suffers from a hormone disorder called hypopituitarism. In other words, her pituitary gland doesn't produce the needed growth hormone and she is stuck inside a child's body. Leena as Esther seduces Jon and he spurns her. Esther runs to her and cries. She removes her child's dentures, makeup, and breast binding to reveal the woman she really is."Orphan" is a wonderfully suspenseful movie with an evil, but at the same time tragic villainess. Esther can't help that she was born with an endocrine disorder that won't let her achieve the height and endowments of a grown woman. In a way, the viewer feels sorry for people who suffer from endocrine disorders because it is not their fault that they have these disorders. All of the actors in the movie are excellent with special mention paid to Isabelle Fuhrman as Esther/Leena. It is not easy a child actor under the age of 11 to play a little girl and a woman at the same time and Isabelle pulls it off wonderfully!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good idea, somehow similar to "Omen"; disturbing child, terrible accidents happens in her surroundings as she terrorize her new family. What is really disappointing is the reaction of the family itself, generally the mother who realizes quite soon that her adopted daughter is diabolic and overly smart but she still leaves her out of her sight (the son in the hospital, are you kidding me???) or the son talking to his younger deaf sister using both gesture and voice while being overheard by the evil sister??? They showed clearly before that the family communicated with the deaf little girl in total silence (when not in presence of other) and now, when you need to keep it quite you... some parts frustrated me so much I could barely sit, I guess I cared about the characters a lot so good acting. I like to be amused, scared even disgusted by movies but this one left just with bitter feelings. I guess is a love or hate movie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story seems typical at first, but the twist gives this movie something original. Using a typical idea with a twist might be a good way to play it safe with the audience, though.The use of colours was excellent, but otherwise the cinematography was just decent. Also the music was pretty typical.Esther's character had a lot of potential, but it was wasted because in the end there was basically no mystery. Also in the end her motives etcetera felt kind of cheap.This was very thrilling, even though I knew the plot already. I think I just had a different point of view on things compared to when you watch this movie for the first time without knowing. Even though I knew almost everything there was to know, I felt really thrilled during the movie, I was on the edge of my seat.So in the end, typical story with original details. Very intense movie, very thrilling, but there's no way this would be my favourite movie from this genre. I feel like something is missing from the story, like a little spice. But definitely worth seeing.</fullReview>

Besides the opening scene, nothing is scary - even that one is not...just bit too bloody!Must say that the twist with Russian 'hospital' and the discovery of who is the patient is really great!

		<shortDescription>A solid, visually appealing mystery film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following the events after a couple with two children adopts an orphan this film tells how their lives spiral out of control. Remarkable is especially the imagery; each set seems to be carefully crafted, especially concerning the (exceptionally well-acted and fascinating) character of Esther; the colours and costumes subliminally underline her staggeringly dark and cold personality succeeding at conveying her emotions or rather the lack of them. Set in a cold wintery environment her classy, dark coloured garments contrasting with her fair skin framed with her black hair create an eerie feeling whenever she appears resulting in conflicting emotions due to her apparently impeccable behaviour. Besides succeeding at scaring the viewer occasionally its jumps scenes are fairly predictable, which in my opinion is positive for I generally am not a fan of the horror/mystery genre. What I also deem positive it refraining from the supernatural and unnecessarily gory and disturbing images, which makes it suitable for a larger audience (not for kids though).Despite being of this genre which is notorious for weak plots, it maintains suspense and mystery for a long time and the outcome is hardly predictable. Moreover it is not superficial, on the contrary, it discusses the sensitive issue of growing up causing contradicting longings for childish na?veté in a romanticised world of childhood disrupted by the advent new responsibilities and expectations. My interpretation is that Esther desperately seeks to maintain her childish world, reinforced by her appearance and on the other hand craves validation, perverse power over other beings expressed through her tendency towards manipulative behaviour, lack of empathy and sobering violence and the sexuality which she is denied due to her appearance. This situation rips her mentally apart, beautifully represented by her paintings; quaint at first sight, once the UV-light is on revealing hideous acts of violence and a cry for sexuality. Tormented, failing to seduce her new father and alienate him from his wife, she wreaks havoc among the family while maintaining an innocent image to present to the world. A truly gripping and dark film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful thriller with an outstanding Performance from the Cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OrphanKate and John have two children and are a happy family but their wish for having another child goes wrong. Because the third child, named Jessica is dying before it is born. When time pass Kate realizes she still wants a third child but she wants to adopt it. When Kate and John decide to do that they meet Esther a 9-year old girl from Russia and she is an orphan. When they first meet her there seems to be an connection between Esther and Kate and John and they decide to adopt her. But what happens in coming weeks they could never expect. When they discover that Esther totally someone else that she claims to be things are going terribly wrong.It is not very often, that you see young actors or actresses on a very young age with very much acting skills. Isabelle Fuhrman is one of those young actresses who can. In this film she delivers an outstanding performance of a girl who is not who she claims to be. She is actually playing two roles. One role is an innocent girl who has lost so much and everything seems to be against her, so she is in the beginning very likable. But the other role is the murderer she actually is. Then there is the fact that she is no 9-year old girl at all but a mid 30- year old women. And delivering a performance like this is outstanding. The film includes good character development and the issues all the characters have are represented very good on screen. I think this film is such a wonderful thriller and it actually tells me that you should never trust someone to easy. But the problem I had with the film was the ending. Because what happened with Kate and John's son Daniel ? has he made it or did he die ? What happened to Kate after the accident, because of John's death ? these answers were never answered and I think they should have ended with this, now it was a more open ending and it gives the audience the idea that it is not over yet. I give this film the following rating because of the strong script, and the wonderful acting.7/10.</fullReview>

Let's go to say that this Spanish director, Jaume Collet-Serra, has been taken any single detail, like a big issue. The result is clearly a movie where the cheap blood and frights are not part of the "horror", the horror comes from the plot. This little orphan girl will stick you into the sofa from the start to finish. Her target will be to take control of her new family life, anyone interferes will have to face her. The best of this movie is the fact you will never guess what is going to happened. If you like good and elegant horror movies, this is one of them.</fullReview>

Vera Farmiga was amazing and believable . the little girl was also original . cinematography did justice to the story and added more mystery and suspense which in-return made the cast look valid and relevant . i recommend this film to anyone who is after original thrillers ,juicy stories ,and acting that will haunt you for weeks .just give it a chance and you will see . thanks for reading this .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw trailers for this movie I thought "Great! Orphans have it bad enough without another film like this showing up." I was all ready to condemn this movie and its leftover plot-devices.And leftover as the plot may be (let's face it, movies about evil orphans are kind of overdone) I was genuinely surprised. Not with the movie itself, but with young actress Isabelle Furhman. Just twelve years-old in this film, Furhman's acting towers over her supporting cast. In every aspect of the movie she is completely believable. I would have adopted her! I pitied her as her classmates made fun of her. Even though I had just seen her kill a nun I was sympathizing with the father of the story, wanting so bad for her to be innocent. And yes, even at the end I wondered if maybe they had actually cast a 30-something woman with a weird hormone disorder. I absolutely fell in love with this little actress. And I would love to see more of her.I could take or leave the movie. But if you take the movie, don't leave without Isabelle Furhman.</fullReview>

To be fair I was not disappointed.The gore is effective where used, yes there's not bucket loads but what we do see is pretty brutal and it's clear that Ester is no stranger to drawing blood. Without ruining the plot ill stop there, I will say that the ending definitely caught me off guard. Even as it was happening I was pretty shocked. Yes the haters will say it's ridiculous and not feasible but I like it. Call it Marmite if you will! I thought the acting was solid, no cheesy one liners or cringe worthy script in sight!

It really is an excellent movie. But it would have been much less than it was without the actresses who played Max and Esther. I loved Max's character from the beginning of the movie. She is adorable and talented as an actress. But *spoiler*, the transformation of Esther's character is incredible. Of course I checked IMDb as soon as I finished watching the movie and I just can't believe that the actress who plays Esther was born in 1997. Wow.

		<fullReview>It took me three years to finally spend some time with ORPHAN, which at least on the surface looked like another demon child/Bad Seed knockoff. I stumbled across it in the library a week ago, bit, and was more than pleasantly surprised. ORPHAN rates as one of the better offerings I've seen in the thriller/horror genre in quite some time, and it has a wicked little twist that keeps its viewer guessing. It's a bit of a slow starter, but give this one time. It has a very fine cast, Vera Farmiga holds the lead down beautifully as the recovering alcoholic Kate and Peter Saarsgaard is also very good as her husband John, who fills the boyfriend/husband without a clue (tradition in classic horror) quite ably. Best of all is Isabelle Fuhrman as the monstrous Esther. This is a very fine piece of work and I don't want to give anything away. Trust me when I say this is very satisfying time spent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally, an American movie that's worth bragging about.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to pay to see Orphan but when I finally found time to see it, it was already pulled from theaters or was playing in theaters that were too far away from me. I just had a feeling this would be a good movie and it was. And it would have been worth paying for too. I liked every single thing about it except for the climax. It was way too 80's horror movie style, gotta have a one-liner to end things type deal. I didn't like it. It didn't fit the suspense of the rest of the movie. The title character was totally out of character in that final scene. I was disappointed with it.The movie poster, tag line, dialogue, acting, plot, exposition, cinematography, camera angles...all of it is good. This movie is a really good effort by the practically newbie writers and director. Their future can only shine brighter. People compare this to Mikey, The Good Son, and other killer kid movies. This stands alone in visual and script quality. Isabelle Fuhrman totally owns her role. I don't know how she can possibly top this movie because as far as I'm concerned, she'll forever be known as the Orphan chick. But she's young and I expect good things from her if she chooses the right roles. Even the makeup in this movie is good. Changing from innocent girl to seductress to psychopath ain't easy to pull off, plot or otherwise. But this movie pulls it off. The acting and attention to detail with the makeup and scenery helps a lot. Well done.If you can, see this movie. It's a gem. Does it have sequel potential? Possibly. I give it 8 out of 10 stars. It's not perfect but for what it is, it's an impressive effort minus the original ending. Did I mention that the original ending totally sucks? Oh, I didn't? Now you know that it does. But enjoy the rest of it.The alternate ending should have been the theatrical cut. It makes tons more sense and is much better overall for closure regardless of it being left open for a sequel that will probably never happen since Isabelle Fuhrman is only getting older. Either way, the movie is definitely worth watching, especially with the deleted scenes if you can catch this with the alternate ending on Blu-ray. Very enjoyable movie. I'd watch it again. It's that good. Scrap the theatrical cut, go for the alternate ending and watch it with the deleted scenes already cut into the movie. I can't stress that enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Bit Annoying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall I think that people have been too positive with the reception of this film. There are some very strong aspects to it: Above all else in the extremely convincing performance from Isabelle Fuhrman. It was a truly superb performance and her role was also helped by her initial character development. In the first half an hour of the film there are elements of sympathy that the viewer has for her and for a moment I was considering the possibility (and hoping) that she was going to be perhaps more of a Carrie than a Damien Omen horror figure. However it was perhaps a little bit disappointing how abruptly they made it clear that she was purely evil and did not make her a more multi-faceted killer. For instance I would have preferred if it was a little more unclear throughout the whole movie whether or not she did want to kill every member of the entire family but it was already apparent that she did about a third of the way into the film.But my biggest problem with the film is actually in the character (and performance by Peter Sarsgaard) of John. It got extremely unrealistic how he doubted the convictions of Kate to such a degree given the overwhelming evidence that this girl was behind all the extremely odd things going on. While it was kind of refreshing to see a pathetic male instead of female in the film, this really got blown out of proportion. On top of everything else, when he finds Esther's pictures of everyone in their family being painted as if they were dead his reaction is to spend about 5 minutes looking through all of them and subsequently trying to fix the fuse box before even going to get his daughter out of the house. I understand this is a classic horror tactic but I think it was executed very badly in this film especially when we are led to believe the couple is intelligent - she lectured at Yale, and he is an architect. An honourable mention should also go to his decision to drink a bottle of wine (which somehow makes him so drunk that he hallucinates) on the same night where Esther has been implicated in the burning down of his son's tree house, his son going to hospital and then mysteriously going into cardiac arrest at the exact same time Esther leaves the waiting room in the hospital.If you are going to do the whole unrealistic horror thing, then do it well and make it clear that you intend on doing it not that it is just some kind of flaw in the storyline. Nevertheless despite my misgivings, I would still recommend this film purely on the basis of the character of Esther and 'her secret' which was quite an interesting one. Just be prepared when you watch it to see the most pathetic male character in a horror movie you have ever seen. Feminists Galore!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty much in tune with the general IMDb rating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***mild spoilers***A close 8 this one is...It's not the world's most innovative concept, the adopted, evil child manipulates a superficially healthy family by surfacing their past sins and playing them intelligently. The exposition in this movie is a tad too long for my taste but it's bearable since the metamorphosis of the lovely new sister to the evil monster is nicely portrayed. But that's about if for the criticism really.Apart from all the nay-sayers on the net ranting about how the characters are totally unbelievable (while well played): I assure you; They're not. Most of the appeal of this movie - at least for me - came from the credibility of the main characters. The mother, laden with guilt and unsure about her worth but strongly connected to her youngest daughter and thus quickly realizing something is just "not right" after the first weeks with the new kid. The father, oblivious to the influence the "orphan" has on their kids but unwilling to believe his wife which seems to be having a really bad alcoholism relapse (this part is especially credible). And the children, scared to death by the "orphan" who threatens them with the death of siblings and parents (also extremely authentic knowing how domestically abused children cover their parents' crimes, often for years. In particular how the "orphan" made friends with the youngest daughter to be in a better position to blackmail as much her as her mother.). The final twist is also very well chosen and really gives you the creeps one more time and refreshingly devoid of any supernatural deus ex machina to explain how the girl got so twisted. So yea, it's the credibility that makes this movie really shine. No demons, almost no paper-cut "hero characters": The psychological coherence is king in this movie, very good... (This comes BTW from someone with experience on clinical psychiatry)I want to emphasize again though: Do not under any circumstances let your children watch this movie. I mean it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Conclusive Twist - Untwisted Before I Got Comfortable In My Chair</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly I don't mean to shun any other good viewer who saw this film to the end and were left dumbstruck. The unspoken twist is a great element directors use to immerse the viewer, and it works most of the time, but when it comes to certain themes (a la murderous knife-wielding youngsters), there are not many plausible hooks available to keep those who are guessing still guessing to the end. While this was indeed an original idea, I am one (and undoubtedly not the only one) who saw through the ruse before the first 20 minutes. When it was finally revealed I threw my arms up, decried "Holy ****, I knew it" and slouched back into my couch in disappointment.Otherwise, despite the unneeded and constant use of false alarms and blatant unadaptive stupidity (I'm looking at you, Daddy) I am not one to rag on this film. The deviousness out of our brilliantly-talented Esther is ingenuitive enough to keep her innocence at bay, and with the mounting personal troubles of our protagonists making it all the more easier (at times, too easy) to manipulate, made for an entertaining and somewhat bloody hour.I did notice plot holes (e.g. Esther's implausible travels around the world) and areas that should have been elaborated further. These are included into my final rating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhat overrated but worth watching.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going into this movie I had heard a lot about it from various people. Having actually watched it myself, I feel a little slighted. While it is a decent movie it's not the best I've ever seen and it certainly isn't particularly frightening. So many people had made this out to be the thriller of all thrillers I guess I expected far more then the movie could ever have provided.It does manage to create a good atmosphere, it's well acted, well scripted and very well shot. What it lacks is any real culmination to the build up. It's one of those...it's coming...it's coming...oh. I'm sure you've seen the type of movie I'm referring to and if you haven't, check this one out because it's as good an initiation into the anti-climactic thriller as any. I'm not saying it's a bad movie, the ending is actually decent and everything is explained well but without the "make you jump" moments, it seems like the movie just misses it's mark.I'll say one thing though and I say this without hesitation. Isabelle Fuhrman is a wonderful actress and is completely captivating. I never doubted for one second that she was Esther. I'd love to see more from her in the future, particularly in this genre because she has fantastic potential.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't be put off by its' rather trashy trailer. Despite some hackneyed narrative devices and implausible plot holes, "Orphan" is a well made and genuinely creepy film.This movie gives the impression that director Collet-Serra and his team were attempting to create something of real value - and for the most part, they pulled it off. Watch out for some great performances - the step-mother (Vera Farmiga) is complex and believable, while Isabelle Fuhrman in the title role maintains a compelling menace throughout. Checkout the superbly detailed credit sequences and numerous intelligent nods to the Great Gothic Genre. Overlook the patchy script and story inconsistencies. And, in fact, don't watch the trailer at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unholy melding of "The Bad Seed" and "Fatal Attraction"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The darker more evil side to the seemingly cute, innocent side of children is hardly an innovative conceit in horror movies and thrillers. Like puppets and clowns the more macabre of these has been explored in Hollywood features and no doubt within renowned pieces of literature for decades. And even on the contemporary side the more malicious side of children has lamentably become all the more closer to reality than we would care to admit. Films going as far back as the 1960 big screen adaptation of the psychological thriller "The Bad Seed" with 1976 "The Omen" and more on mass with "The Children of the Corn".Where last years "Orphan" fits in to this bracket is a bit more complex given the films jaw-dropping denouement although it neatly exploits the more grim, lurid side behind the seemingly angelic, innocuous veneer. The film tells the story of Kate and John Coleman (Vera Faramiga and Peter Sarsgaard) who are attempting to build their family life back together (Kate more so) after the death of their unborn child who Kate was carrying. With their two existing offspring, Daniel and Max(Jimmy Bennett and Aryana Engineer)who are their more immediate priority to take in to consideration they strive to push on and put the tragic event behind them. In a bold yet well meaning step to fill the void left by the death of their unborn baby the couple choose to adopt a child. At their nearest Orphanage where they visit they come across nine-year old Estonian orphan, Esther a beguiling and sweet little girl who they instantly fall in love with. It's not long before with John and Kate's minds made up Esther has a brand new home and family. But the ostensibly charming young lady finds fitting in and adapting to her new surroundings difficult. She is teased at her new school to the point where he adoptive brother Daniel spurns her although she forms a bond with the death and mute Max. But with the kids and at school and Daniel turning against Esther her more manipulative, vindictive and violent nature creep gradually to the fore. She assumes a serpentine hold on her pseudo-sister who is forced in to aiding and abetting her commit the most horrendous of acts and the relative serenity is thrown in to nightmarish chaos and she begins to play off John and Kate off against one another. Only when the devil child's new found mother begins to delve in to the girls past does the full horror of Esthers dark past gradually begin to come to light.A haunting and some what innovative film given it's chilling and sublime twist ending. "Orphan" takes the unnerving, unease that can be equated with children and neatly exploits it. Although not an entirely original premise and with it's script undoubtedly lumbered with the inevitable, trite clichés that are associated with movies of this ilk. It's material is never the less adeptly handled by Spanish director Juame Collet-Serra who previously helm-ed the less satisfying, horror remake "House of Wax" in 2005. It's unsettling twist provokes a sense of paranoia and makes us question out own potential obtuse preconceptions of both identity and arguably even sexuality which makes one uncomfortable scenario as it edges towards it's climax all the more shocking yet feasible within the context of the final starling revelation. Although It might be fair comment as a sidenote that John in the movie doesn't completely come off entirely well. He is is arguably a little too obtuse and moronic when he fails to begin to put two and two together and ultimately little sympathy can be found for him when the truth of events become ever more apparent. Though perhaps that's what the film-makers were striving towards.But still, an unholy melding of "The Bad Seed" and "Fatal Attraction", "Orphan" boasts an awe inspiring performance from young Thespian Isabelle Fuhrman who was in fact about two or three years older than her precocious title antagonist. She impressively leads a cast of relative unknowns who more than exemplify that a movie doesn't need to have an a-list cast of Brad Pitts or Angelina Jolies to create a sound, solid two-hour Hollywood picture. She is beautifully understated and for goes the oh so burdensome trap of slipping in to gruesome caricature. Never overdoing the smiles and the angelic god natured facade which might have metamorphosed in to a miniature reject from "The Stepford Wives". As her adoptive parents Vera Faramiga and Peter Sarsgaard give solid performances, bringing the eclectic range of emotive acting for their respective roles which eventually make them excellent foils for one another when events within the movies storyline requires their protagonists to clash. As the two Coleman siblings Jimmy Bennett and Aryana Engineer demonstrate an an uncanny ability for emotive dramatic acting beyond their years and never dip in to becoming irritating as can occasionally be the case with child actors in roles. They are more than merely the obligatory cutesy tykes. Veteran supporting actress CCH Pounder, arguably the most recognisable face amongst the cast also offer stirring support as the saintly nun who works within the orphanage where Esther is adopted from.Not entirely the most innovative of films brought to celluloid although it's unsettling climax and resolution are one of the most singular brought to the screen. "Orphan" although far from reaching the dizzying heights of being declared a masterpiece of the genre is never the less a chilling picture that will no doubt may alter your perception as to how you might view those unknown children you come across in day to day life. With that thought in mind you'll never want to be left in the same room with an obnoxious child ever again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Girl Behaving Badly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just a couple of weeks before I saw this film an American couple was in the news because they sent their adopted child back to Russia on a plane citing, in a note, psychological problems with the kid. That kid probably had nothing on the adopted child in this film. "Orphans" trades on the fear that, when you adopt a child from a former Soviet Bloc country you really don't know what you're getting. Unfair, yes, but a juicy premise for a thriller.Vera Farmiga effectively portrays the gradual, growing hysteria of her character, Kate, who has lost her third child in a miscarriage and decides to do a very fine and noble thing - give the love she would have given to her baby to an adopted child instead. Imagine her hurt and anger as she gradually discovers that this charmingly eccentric kid, Esther, has completely and savagely betrayed her. Esther is remarkably intelligent and intuitive, and "freaky" in more ways than one. She knows how to disrupt the family, manipulating Kate's husband, John, and using fear tactics to keep Kate's two birth children under her thumb. The household becomes an arena of suspicion, fear and dread. It's the old "fox in the chicken coop" story.The twist, believe me, is a zinger! If you're anything like me and get so caught up in the story that you dismiss the clues you won't see it coming. The twist not only ramps up the creepiness and danger, but also creates an alarming new dimension which the film-makers could have explored with more zeal and created a more gratifying movie monster - but didn't. Essentially, we've seen this movie before, the stepfather / nanny / roommate, etc. from hell, with a paint-by-numbers plot and a big go-for-broke fight at the end. For what it is it's okay, but it plays it safe and doesn't take us to those dark places where a film-maker like, say, Neil Jordan would have (see "In Dreams").</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*very mild spoiler*A nice film, but it could have been better without the constraints of the genre.It's a horror thriller, a genre film, and it works well as a genre film. It is not an original or surprising film, but well done, well acted, and enjoyable for its whole two hours.In this kind of genre, people have to die violently, that's a rule. I don't blame the writer, producer or director for sticking to that rule. Let's not forget they must sell a product. And still, I regret the way that "Orphan" turned out.For me, the best part of the film is the section between Esther's first appearance and the first murder. For example, there is a scene when Esther comes down the stairs one morning wearing one of her old-fashioned dresses. Mother: "You don't wanna wear that to school, Esther. I gave you some jeans" Esther: "But you said it was OK to be different" Mother of course has to give in, as she actually did say that when she first met Esther (And of course, in the next scene Esther's dress does cause problems at school...) This kind of scenes, about everyday situations I can relate to, I find so much more exciting than waiting for the umpteenth time for the mad killer to enter the frame and stab the victim.For once, try to imagine a film where Esther is an adopted child who is different, mysterious, difficult, even nasty... but NOT a murderer. Father likes her, but Mother thinks she is more than she can handle. How would that story end? That would have been totally unpredictable and thrilling. I would have liked to see Isabelle Fuhrmann's great performance in such a film...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All-round great thriller/horror but a bit derivative</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You've probably seen at least a couple of "evil children" movies before so this one won't offer you much that is new or unique. With a running time of two hours, it also could have been a little shorter but the pacing and suspense will keep you engaged. What places this well-above the standard thriller is the acting, character development and the unusual ending. I'll be honest, I wanted to scream like a little girl (no pun intended) when I realised the twisted secret. The movie opens with a nightmarish scene, which (in hindsight) seemed a little out of place. This isn't a "horror" film, it's more of a psychological thriller with a lot of great drama and humour thrown in. The latter seems unintentional at times but adds a layer of complexity to the film because it makes the horrific scenes more disturbing, and complements the maniacal orphan character perfectly. The storyline is pretty straightforward. A woman (Kate Coleman) loses a child due to a miscarriage and, after years of guilt and torment, she and her husband (John) decide to adopt a girl. The orphan, Esther, is a shy but intelligent Russian girl with a real talent for painting but a mysterious past. There's also a sinister undercurrent to Kate's idyllic home-life as we soon learn that she was an alcoholic and this may have been the cause of her miscarriage. Her husband, John, is no saint either as we find out that he was unfaithful to her. Her daughter had always wanted a sister and immediately latches onto Esther but her son is apprehensive about the new girl. She dresses funny and seems cold and methodical. The last half hour of this movie really ratchets up the tension and the scene where John is lying on the sofa after getting drunk on wine, still makes me uneasy. I think guys will be more unnerved by this scene than girls. Just thinking of it again... Oh God, it's so creepy. There is no other word for it. Creepy. Watch it on a Friday night with friends and you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On a scale of one to Casablanca, this film is a "The Others" (2001)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On a sleepless night, I found myself drawn to the TV for company. On the table sat my brother's copy of 'Orphan' which he had just gotten for Christmas. I looked down at the DVD and knew it was about to be watched. I am a horror film lover and I will contend that there is no better time to watch a horror movie than at around 1am, alone, in the dark. And so I sat down with Jaume Collet-Serra's "Orphan."The set up has been done before, many times ? "The Omen" (1976), "Child's Play 2," (1990) "The Good Son" (1993), to name a few antecedents ? a struggling family decides the best thing for it would be to adopt a child with a troubled past. Lo and behold, the child not only has a troubled past but turns out to be just plain trouble.There can be no doubt: "Orphan" is a dark film. Thankfully, it is not overly clustered with action and horror like so many contemporary counterparts. Instead it lets the horror rise and rise until the final, genuinely creepy climax. Of course there are the typical fake outs to juice up the audience for the real scares - a woman opens a mirrored medicine cabinet. When she closes it, someone is standing behind her (gasp!). And then there's Esther, the creepy orphan of the title who holds the real horror of the film in the palm of her hand.As you can likely infer from what I've already written, the plot doesn't need too much elaboration. Vera Farmiga plays Kate Coleman, a recovered alcoholic who has recently suffered a miscarriage. Kate and her husband John (Peter Sarsgaard) decide it would be best to adopt a child. Now, I'm pretty young and have no children, but it seems to me that adopting a child in the wake of a miscarriage might be predicated on faulty logic ? a hasty cure for the mourning heart.Well, despite my reservations, Kate and John adopt Esther, a young orphan from Russia. Esther is an instant hit with the family, befriending Kate's younger and partially deaf daughter Max and her older son Daniel. Esther even seems to have an Oedipal (or Electrapal?Electric?) love for her father. Cute enough.But as can be imagined, things start to go awry. A girl has a conspicuous fall from a playground. A car's emergency break is mysteriously released. A nun is found bludgeoned to death?Kate is the only one who can fit these pieces together. She is the only one who sees the common thread between all these tragic incidents is Esther. But no one believes her of course, because how could a child do such a thing?Children in the movies are much like dogs. They can be cute and funny as easily as they can be vicious and creepy. Esther, played by newcomer Isabelle Fuhrman, is a powerhouse of a creeper. She delivers on scary material that would be tough for any child actor to make believable. At 3am when the film ended, I couldn't help but wonder how they made this film with such strict child-actor laws in place. This movie actually creeped me out. Rating:On a scale of one to Casablanca, this film is a "The Others" (2001)Rationalization:In these, the waning days of M. Night Shymalan, it is very hard to come across a twist ending where you don't feel used and didn't see it coming from eight miles away. Nowadays we often come into a horror movie expecting there will be a game changing twist tagged on at the very end. In a case like Shymalan's "The Village" (2004), which I loved for the first half, the twist made me want to puke and then write a heated letter to someone who would listen. But with a movie like "The Others," and now "Orphan," the twist is organic, makes sense, and adds a brand new dimension of scariness to the rest of the film. At the end of "The Village" I felt like I need to take a sponge bath to scrub off Shymalan's twist and egomania. Not so at the end of "Orphan."(Also, if you're watching this on DVD and can check out the alternative ending, do so. The part of me that despises closure loved the alternative ending)http://iamdatabasefilmjournal.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...that tells you when you see a trailer for a film like this, stay away - lol. I guess we did just that as we viewed it on DVD last night. Had I sprung for theater tickets for this film, I would have got my money's worth.As other reviewers have indicated, this film's plot device has been used before, Carrie, The Omen etc. Here is a fresh take on the "evil child" story. The whole "Esther has a secret" advertising was forgotten by your humble correspondent weeks ago, so I wasn't trying to figure out anything. It is obvious from Fuhrman's first appearance that there is indeed "something about Esther". Her delicate Slavic accent betrays her ominous presence and there is surely something decidedly "mature for her her age" about her, as sister Abigail puts it.The deaf younger sister is played just as well by the talented Engineer, the fear in her expression coupled with the love she wants to feel with her "sister" is unmistakable. I hope she has a long career because she should be something to watch.Furhmans performance is exquisite. Her acting is very subtle and very believable, every time she looks up from what she's doing you think boy, I wouldn't want that kid in my house. There's a hunger and a rage in her eyes that's just wonderful. One of the best such performances I've seen, and this young lady's future should be just as bright as Engineer's if not more so.The other actors are really incidental here. The anger shown by the son towards Esther is about as emotional as he gets; I thought the other parts were wooden and trite.Which brings me to the ending, and that whole we-think-she/he's-dead-but-they-jump-back-to-life thing ....its old, and the ending is 10 minutes longer than needed. The denouement was quick but abrupt, and not followed through, degrading into a chase scene type deal, replete with such tired devices as Esther popping out of the ice (after being submerged in freezing water for 2 minutes) and dragging the mother down....*yawn*.Other than that, I highly recommend this movie. Get it on DVD and you'll enjoy it. Not for kids, but adults will enjoy following the story which is VERY well written! Cinematography is so good you don't even notice it, no stupid camera tricks to distract you. The director correctly figured that Fuhrman's presence was quite enough to capture the audiences attention, and I give that girl 10 out of 10 for her part.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw the first scene (the hospital), I automatically started to think that it was something like "Unborn", stupid and meaningless. The first 20 minutes were boring, because I still didn't know what kind of film I was dealing with, but after the first murder, I got interested and decided to watch it to the end.The story is simply shocking and may even cause you to be more cautious when dealing with little kids! Maybe they're not kids at all! I cannot say this film was a masterpiece. If you're going to watch it, it's mainly because of the story. It's a novel one. The film is very simple and the events take place in winter, so it might make you feel a bit sleepy. There are no gruesome scenes or even blood. The film lasts two hours and it makes it even more boring.If you are interested in watching a seemingly little kid commit murder, you're going to love this film. There are no plot holes. The dialogues are OK, although the way the husband ignores his wife's warnings will start to get on your nerves.This film is not suitable for children at all and it contains mature content.If you wants to see a film with a coherent plot that makes sense, this is a good choice. If you want to see blood and gruesome kills, save your money.</fullReview>

Rarely is a movie slated to be released in July the beneficiary of such publicity and fanfare.Universal Pictures and Imagine Entertainment will likely be pleased with the opening weekend returns if the preceding publicity translates to box office performance.Unfortunately, the word of mouth that is likely to spread subsequent to opening weekend will not be as favorable as the hype will have you believe?and that's not necessarily a failure on the part of the movie, but more a function of misdirected marketing by the producing companies involved.By now all of us have had the opportunity to see the movie trailer for An Orphan, one that is very specific in its depiction of what to expect from this remake.Despite what the movie trailer suggests, An Orphan is NOT a scary, "horror" movie. It has some flurries of creepy hyperactivity, but the OTHER 2 hours of non-horror make a stronger argument for characterization as anything BUT an "horror" movie. In fact, the movie has less horror overall than any movie with "Orphan" in its title should be allowed to have.The horror and non-horror are reasonable expectations too. Evil Child, Murders, Tantrums, Smotherings With Pillows and the depiction of sterility all line the trailer of a movie with "Orphan"in the title. One would think that's an invitation for classic, horrifying "Orphan" cinema.But trust Mo'Kelly?this is NOT an horror movie and in many ways completely divorced from the "horror" genre. If you attend this movie expecting something akin to The Ring, One Missed Call, or any of the cookie-cutter urban horrors, you'll be thoroughly disappointed.But it's not necessarily your fault?or the movie's for that matter. You're being misled.This cinematic story of tragic loss of their unborn child that has devastated Kate and John, taking a toll on both their marriage and Kate's fragile psyche as she is plagued by nightmares and haunted by demons from her past. Kate is portrayed in this film as exceptionally reasoned, measured and intellectually resourceful in a way that is more powerful than anything seen in so-called "NON-horror" movies.The movie Orphan is true in that sense to its introspective protagonist. It is more descriptive of the internal conflict between Kates' Christian/family values upbringing and her desire to live the American Dream. Accordingly, Collet-Serra spends over 2.5 hours in his attempt to give his viewers a glimpse more into the "non-horror" as opposed to "horror" portion of the "mediocrity" equation.Unfortunately, the trailer suggests the exact opposite?and that could (and likely will be) disastrous.Specifically, the storyline is loosely based on an alarming series of events that begins to unfold.For those who know their Asian Remake cinema history, the movie The orphange (2004) was a thinly veiled reference to the criminal exploits of another seemingly angelic little girl and Collet-Serra contemporary; Simón.An Orphan parallels to The Orphange are inescapable given their shared elements in a historical and cinematic sense. When moviegoers finally sit down for An Orphan, they've most likely seen The Orphange. Although The Orphange is set in a period earlier than An Orphan; since it borrows its storyline from the Spanish Civil War of the 40s, there will be elements in An Orphan that will reek eerily familiar if not seem "copied" from The Orphange. Without a thorough understanding of the historical contexts of both movies, An Orphan will in many ways be wrongly construed as a "copy" of The Orphange. In actuality, An Orphan is more accurate and honest in its depiction of Non-horror than its wholly fictitious counterpart of yesteryear.But back to the Oscar hype? Academy Award winners Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard do well in their respective roles, yet given the fact that both have a slew of films with truly stellar performances in which to compare An Orphan; it makes you wonder where the buzz originates.Peter Sarsgaard's portrayal of John Coleman is not as engaging as his Walter Delacroix, not as incredible as his Reuben "Hurricane" Carter or even as evil as the corrupt Elrod Sykes in Dans la brume électrique. We know when we see the "best" of Peter Sarsgaard and it is readily identifiable.This is simply not it...through no fault of his own. He's an actor who's made a career of "cerebral characters." A "cerebral Non-horror" simply does not provide the platform for Sarsgaard to show the range and depth we already know he's capable of displaying. "John Coleman" is a "Sarsgaard," we're all intimately familiar with and thus less than "Oscar-worthy." Sarsgaard has raised the bar far higher in other performances and this fact can't be ignored in any truthful commentary about his latest effort.As for Vera Farmiga, copy and paste the previous paragraph and substitute Vera's information accordingly. After seeing Vera Farmiga at her best in The Manchurian Candidate and The Butterfly Dance, it's a bit disingenuous to argue that her portrayal of Kate Coleman is worthy of comparison or similar acclaim. Again, it's not dismissing Vera Farmiga's contribution, but this role simply did not require any heavy lifting?heavy lifting we know Farmiga's capable of handling.In the end, An Orphan does not measure up to the hype. The blame should go more to the Universal Pictures marketing department and less to director Jaume Collet-Serra. People turning out will presumably expect to see lots of non-horror surrounding the life of a newly adopted orphan. Instead, they will find they've spent their money on a biopic of an introspective family man with flashes of the aforementioned.An Orphan is neither a great movie nor a bad one. It's just "a movie." Combine this with a misdirected marketing campaign and you have the classic recipe for movie-buyer-remorse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very underrated movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do not really understand why so many people hate this movie. I loved it. Before I start praising it, I have to go into the bad points first. First of all, the movie is very clichéd, constantly relying on cheap false scares which turn out to be nothing. Also, there was the cliché character who just doesn't believe anything the main character says even though it's true, etc. Also, the final 10 minutes of the movie were VERY reminiscent of The hand that rocks the cradle. Villain tries to seduce man, goes on murdering rampage when she gets rejected, fights with main character who kills her, etc. However, apart from those issues, this film is pretty good. The best thing about this movie is Isabelle Fuhrman's performance as Esther. I would recommend this movie just for her performance alone. She manages to be convincingly sinister and manages to act sweet and innocent very well. It's almost as if she becomes the character. Also, while this might not be the horror movie I was expected, it was a proper thriller movie with some great scenes and very good writing. The final twist was also very cleverly written and very surprising, even if it was kind of coincidental that she had both a serious medical condition and she was mentally ill at the same time. I know this movie has its flaws, but do I recommend it? Yes. It's not great, but it is a very interesting and well written story for the most part and I really enjoyed it. I give this movie 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was expecting a typical 'satan's child' movie, but this was not it! The movie starts out quite similar to 'The Omen: Awakening', but as you watch it, you realize that this isn't about anything supernatural...The twist at the end is just... genius! LOL. I would of never guessed!I was really impressed with the acting, too.The movie is griping and the pacing is just right.There was only one cringeworthy scene in the movie (the pond scene towards the end); the rest of the movie is surprisingly realistic.Some people have mentioned that the movie is 'disturbing'. I didn't find it disturbing, and there are hardly any horror scenes. It's a great thriller, though - well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror film, born again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(sorry about the approximate language, I'm nor American nor English)Remember how in the 70's horror movies were all about tearing down consensus and social values? Well this one does it quite well. I don't have children yet, but most of my friends and family have. Don't watch this if you have kids. I've seen a lot of twisted and sick films (eg:irreversible, centipede, Serbian film, etc...none of which I recommend unless you feel like having your soul and spirit f**ked with, but then again you have to be curious about everything about life), but I found this one unrelentless. It's pretty long too, so get ready for anything. It's not gory or anything but it's psychologically very violent and harassing, it destroys family values in a way that anything I've ever seen so far never did. As a horror film (and it is a horror film), it hits the spot. Very well made, the actors, cinematography and production are top notch, which makes it all the more unsettling. Even the storyline is uncommonly well written, especially if you are used to clichéd and poorly spewed bullcrap the last ten years of horror flicks have fed us up with. I'll try not to spoil anything, but it's about this cute little orphan that finds a new family. Sounds like Hollywood feelgood crap, but it's all the opposite. Hence, once again, a brilliant horror film. There are quite a few aspects I didn't feel comfortable with, so this is why I feel it's a great horror movie. It's not made to make you feel comfortable. HERE BE SPOILERS------------ 1/ As with The Exorcist, it's pretty weird watching a film were a child does everything he's not meant to do. I felt sorry for the kid (Esther) that went through all of this, and I hope she didn't really understand the cruelty and sheer evil she had to portray. This movie deals with such cruel and merciless concepts that it's bound to leave a youngster scarred for life (if she got it, and I'm afraid she has). 2/ I can't help but feel the director has some serious issues with women, and his relationship with them. I found it was profoundly misogynistic.But he (the director, sorry can't remember his name) manages to get away with it by having a very strong female counterpart (allthough not the best actor in the film, but close). That was smart, otherwise he would have had his head caved in by bloodthirsty femen (BTW, I'm a dude). This bugged me throuhout the film and apart from a few moments were "suspension of disbelief" tended to fade away (but the plot is smart enough so that by the end twist, it kinda makes sense), I found it was one of the best horror film I've seen in years. Maybe in decades.Brilliant, smart, filled with meanings about human (female?) perversity, it's definitely a must see for all you f*?ked-up horror fans fans out there that were wondering if the genre hadn't died 15 years ago.I didn't expect much of it at first, and in this way it was very efficient. Without the gender bashing issue, this would have got a 7 by my book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'There's something wrong with Esther...' But there's hardly anything wrong with this great movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movie Review: Orphan (2009)As the tag line says, something's defiantly wrong with Esther alright. When Kate and John Coleman decided to adopt sweet, adorable Esther, who seems like a perfect angel child, they soon realize something's very different about her when everything starts going wrong...deadly wrong! *WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS!!* I personally thought this movie was fantastic! In fact, it's actually one of my favorite horror/thriller movies. The plot, characters, and amazing actors are what defiantly made this movie superb in my opinion. Although yes, it does over do it with those cliché scares and the movie could've been shortened just a little bit, but besides that, it's amazing. Isabelle Furhman, who was actually 10 years old when this movie was made, did an outstanding job as Esther. Even if you didn't like this movie, you will love her performance as the creepy orphan girl. But wait, is Esther really just a little girl? Or is she something more?.... By far, the best part of this movie is the interesting twist; which makes the whole movie stand out among the rest. Warning! Do NOT read any further if you do not know Esther's "secret"! When the twist of the movie came up, my jaw dropped. Like, whoa, she's really freakin 33 years old! Holy crap! I totally didn't see that coming! So, I applaud the writer and director of this movie for such a unique twist! I also enjoyed how they portrayed this part of the film with Esther crying at her dresser mirror while she slowly but surely reveals herself as Kate and the doctor are talking on the phone. It was just, perfect in my opinion and it just gets better from there! Now, on to the things I didn't like about the movie: Like I mentioned before, they could've done without those cliché scares, and I really think the movie was way too long, which made some parts of the movie boring and uninteresting. But, once you get to the good stuff and start to see Esther's true colors, then you forget all about the lagging moments. Also, the father was kinda annoying. I mean, I know you have to have some characters be oblivious, but John was just plain stupid for the most part. Although, I wouldn't blame the actor for this, cause he did a really good job. I just blame the writers. But, if you're one of those horror fans that like unique plots or if you're just starting out in the horror genre, this movie's for you! It's not too scary, but it's not corny either. Overall, I give Orphan an 8.5 out of 10. You won't be disappointed in this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A unique psychological thriller with a surprising twist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is centered on the Coleman family, John, Kate, and their two children: Danny and Max. Esther John, played by Peter Sarsgaard, and Kate, played by the lovely Isabelle Fuhrman, are trying to rekindle their love for each other after the loss of their unborn child and Kate's drinking problem. They decide to adopt a child, Esther, played by Isabelle Fuhrman. Kate starts to suspect that they may not know all there is to know about Esther and eventually fears her other children Danny, played by Jimmy Bennett and Max, their deaf daughter, played by Aryana Engineer may be in danger.When Kate's fears become reality and this innocent little girl turns into a psychopathic killer, will it be too late for Kate to save her family?Kate and John travel to the St. Marina Orphanage to find a daughter to adopt. Immediately John is fascinated by the singing of a 9-year old Russian girl named Esther, played by Isabelle Fuhrman. She is a very artistic, well-educated, and polite child and the Coleman's decide she will be a perfect addition to their family.Just as John and Kate seem to be happy again and you see Esther start to try and push them back apart. Kate starts suspecting that Esther adores John but doesn't quite like her. A meeting is had by John and Kate and Sister Abigail, played by the talented CCH Pounder, from the orphanage. As they are having the meeting the camera angle is from a watching view because Esther is eavesdropping on this meeting. She decides to stop Sister Abigail from digging into her past by manipulating Max into helping her stop Sister Abigail from sabotaging her place in the Coleman family. This is one of many times when Max could have told on Esther and avoided a lot of what Esther accomplished but Max is fearful for her family's life.The death of Sister Abigail strengthens Kate's suspicions of Esther and she starts doing her own research on who exactly Esther is. Her suspicions turn into reality when Danny is hospitalized after he falls from his burning tree house. Kate just knows Esther had something to do with it. There is a huge scene at the hospital which leaves Kate sedated with any overnight stay at the hospital. Now Esther has John all to herself.At the house we see Esther trying to seduce John, which is a very creepy, disturbing part of the film. After John turns her down she is devastated and destroys her room. At the very same moment at the hospital Kate receives a phone call from a doctor at the Samme Institute who informs her that Esther is really a 33 year patient who escaped the hospital last year. What a twist to the movie! I did not see that coming. It still didn't make the scene where Esther tries to Seduce John any less creepy but understandable.As suspected after Kate has proof her family is in danger she rushes out of the hospital to save her family! By this time John also realizes that Esther is not whom he thought she was. The lights are cut in the house as Kate is racing home to warn her family. The editors used parallel cuts to show the action of Kate racing home and John trying to figure out why the lights are out. Come on John why didn't you listen to your wife this whole time instead of a creepy child you barley knew? It wasn't hard to predict we would see his demise. Kate crashes into the house and immediately finds John stabbed to death on the floor. From this point on we see the film in high suspense as Kate is trying to stop Esther! She does and she saves Max. I liked that I FINALLY didn't have to scream at the TV for Kate Grab the gun out of Esther's hand but my excitement was short lived when she didn't make sure she was dead! So of course by the time the police get there Esther is already gone, trying to finish what she started. How fitting the movie ends on the pond that nearly killed Max and that in the end Esther was the one who drowned.The film is fast-paced from the beginning. We get a lot of back story in the first few minutes of the film. I think the right amount of editing was done to avoid being extra long. The transitions in the film add to the suspense of the film. I think the use of the subjective point of view heightened the realization of certain scenes related to Max since she is deaf. When her hearing aids come out all sound is distorted and the closed caption comes up on the screen. All in all film was decent but a little long. I think the movie got further and further away from reality after each thing Esther got away with and nobody was the wiser. But I did think the writers had a good twist to this story when they revealed the true identity of Esther. I also think the makeup in this movie was perfect. In the beginning of the movie we see Esther as the 9 year old she is pretending to be but after all comes out she has transformed into a believable 33 year old with a dwarfism disease. Her skin is no long pale white but a natural tanned skin tone. Big kudos to the makeup team for making Esther's character as convincingly as possible. The ending of this movie mad it for me! From the twist of Esther's age, to John dying, and then the way Esther died.I give this movie a C+</fullReview>

But as I have admired Vera Farmiga's appearance and performance, I thought that the result could not be awful or numb either. To my surprise, the movie was great: thrilling, logically motivated, smoothly running with many unexpected scenes.Apart from Farmiga as the mother Kate Coleman, the other great role is performed Isabelle Fuhrman as Esther - an awkward and gifted girl adopted by the Colemans - who triggers the sequence of varied events in and around the family. I was also astonished that the plot has connections with my motherland Estonia, and the Estonian language is spoken and read - quite a rare thing in Hollywood movies.After seeing the movie, I was wondering how many viewers keen on adoption changed their mind afterward or at least had second thoughts...</fullReview>

The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat from the moment they walk into the orphanage until she falls in the lake.

		<fullReview>Orphan - Catch It (A) I joined the Orphan band wagon really late since I already knew the ending twist thanks to my brother. So, finally after 3years I decided to watch it. Surprisingly even I knew the end twist, it was very effective and I almost forgot about knowing the end and starting enjoy the incredible performances of Vera Farmiga &amp; Isabelle Fuhrman. Orphan is an example that if you get good actresses to do horror/thriller movie they'll bring something of their own which you rarely experience in regular horror/thriller movies. Vera Farmiga as grieving mother gave an incredible performance. Her breakdown moments are worth watching. New young Isabelle Fuhrman is truly a remarkable as how she pulled such a difficult demented role. The Peter Sarsgaard did a fine job along with the kids. In the end, Orphan is a great movie, giving something new to this genre. The direction, smart writing, real Winter Locations &amp; superb performances make it a memorable experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's easy to write off horror films. In fact, it often seems like many of the professionals who script, direct, and produce horror films have already done so. Many potentially good scary movies have been ruined by the very conventions of the genre: cheesy monsters, stereotypical characters, derivative plots, New Age mythology masquerading as religion, and monstrous levels of gore do not a quality production make. I think the filmmakers behind most bad horror films?which would be most recent ones?know perfectly well that what they're making is schlock, but as long as there's a paying audience, why should they change the formula?Fortunately, the filmmakers behind Orphan actually cared enough about their movie to invest some time and effort in it before turning it loose on the cinema public, and the payoff is one of the best thrillers of the past ten to fifteen years. Director Jaume Collett-Serra has taken a familiar genre plot?the wicked child who turns its home into a purgatory?and reworked it into a multi-faceted nightmare that consistently surpasses every expectation.Screenwriter David Johnson deserves much of the credit for creating a clever, spellbinding script that features strong, believable characters that are far more than victims just waiting for the axe to fall. The main protagonist, Kate Coleman, is a recovering alcoholic haunted by the stillbirth of her last child, Jessica. Kate, played with conviction by the excellent Vera Farmiga, is an extremely likable heroine that we desperately want to see achieve victory over her many inner demons. She loves her husband, John (Peter Sarsgaard), but there are problems in their relationship that are hard to overcome, and if it is clear that the two care deeply about one another it is just as plain that both have wounded one another many times before and that the scars from those wounds are always itching just beneath the surface. It is one of the most honest and believable portrayals of marriage any movie has given us in the last couple of years. But whatever their problems, both Kate and John have a lot of love to go around?not only for one another, but for their two surviving children: Daniel (Jimmy Bennett) and little Max (Aryana Engineer). But the death of their previous child has left a void in their hearts, one they hope to fill via adoption.Enter little Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman), a charming (if somewhat precocious) nine-year-old who establishes an instant connection with Kate and John. Esther bonds quickly with the couple, and soon all the paperwork is signed and the young orphan goes home to a new life with the Coleman's. Max finally has the big sister she's been praying for? Anyone who has seen the trailer or heard Orphan's tagline already knows "There's something wrong with Esther", but even so the magnitude of the horror ahead is shocking. It would be a crime to say anything more about the plot, but suffice it to say that Orphan is a consistently surprising, genuinely scary movie that puts most of its recent genre competition to shame. Thanks to careful story construction, realistic characters that are easy to identify with, and fine performances from every major cast member, Orphan proves that it is after all possible to still make a good horror movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember when a couple people were up in arms about Dakota Fanning's Emily character being portrayed as the psycho killer in the movie Hide and Seek was a big deal about how the movie's plot device was bold enough in a drama sense and that the twist wasn't released until the very very end that it was almost like using her in a dirty way.The Uninvited/Tale of Two Sisters...I could post more.This one is the most bold.Now I'm not gonna go on about Isabelle's performance and how outstanding it was and I kinda got the feeling that her character's secret was more than just being a psycho killer kid.Download the 1080 blu ray or rent it, put it on a 40" or larger screen with good sound and enjoy the ride. You'll be mesmorized, shocked by the slipper slope they get into with some of their themes in the movie and overall just entertained by the movie.9 points cause the father character was a bit shady and for some reason the mother annoyed me at times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So a couple adopts a young girl and she turns out to be a psycho. I am not about to delve into the plot, but I will highlight my thoughts on this film.I'll start with the good. Above all, this film works because it is different. In probably the most predictable and lackluster genres these days, Orphan definitely stands out, purely because it is different. Now that is not to say that it doesn't have clichés, as it is full of them. But the idea of having the killer being part of your family is something new that I really appreciated. Next, I thought the performance by Isabelle Fuhrman, who plays the killer orphan, Esther, to be fantastic. I was taken aback by how she nailed everything from the believability right down to the accent. I also loved Aryana Engineer, who plays the sister, Max. Now this may be because she is just so adorable, but I'm fine with it either way.Now, for the bad. The twist. The over-hyped ridiculously outrageous twist. Was it original? Yes. Did I like it? No. Twist endings for me almost always make or break the film. Thankfully, however bad the twist was, it did not break this film. But come on. I am not going to give the twist away, but let's just say it made no sense at all. I feel that twist endings should be used for films that can be watched and understood differently on multiple viewings. For example, Fight Club, the Sixth Sense, and Shutter Island would be some films with twist endings that really work. After knowing the twist ending in Orphan, it makes the film seem really stupid. Alright, besides the twist, the dialog was poor and unrealistic in quite a few scenes. The jump scare scenes were pretty bad as well, especially considering half of them were fake jump scenes.So the film was far from perfect, but I still enjoyed it for some reason. Hopefully this will be the start of some good new horror scripts coming out soon. Probably not, but we can always hope.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A husband and wife who recently lost their baby adopt a 9-year-old girl who is not nearly as innocent as she claims to be.Aside from some very, very minor complaints on the script, this film is practically flawless -- constantly suspenseful, creepy and well-acted throughout. The kids (especially the girls) were incredible, and should both have bright futures ahead of them if they stay in the business.As I said, the film is suspenseful ,and it is this tense nature that delivers. While there are some releases, the tension more or less builds throughout... and as the mother/wife becomes more and more alienated, we feel her frustration. The film is strong because while it has some traditional horror elements (bloody murder), it also has a very strong mental undercurrent.Roger Ebert says, "You want a good horror film about a child from hell, you got one." And that is exactly right. I went into this film expecting some sort of "Omen" ripoff. Not at all. Besides the fact they both have evil children, there is no similarity. Maybe closer to "The Good Son". But of the three, this one is hands-down the creepiest and best picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a waste of time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seems like I am in the mood for yet another wondrous night of chills, thrills and scares. All is set, and all I have to do now is allow the movie to unveil its goriest plot all over and scare the heaven out of me..Score! The introductory scene at the hospital just turned my stomach inside out as the bloody infant was removed from the mothers' womb! Jessica who was not blessed to see the light of the world passed on inside her mothers' womb weeks before delivery. Kate Coleman (Vera Farmiga) since the loss of Jessica feels a void in her soul and needs for it to be filled. John(Peter Sarsgaard) and Kate along with their kids Daniel(Jimmy Bennett) and the little princess Max(Aryana Engineer) are quite a normal family up until Kate and John bring home Esther (Isabella Fuhrman) from an orphanage. Esther who is introduced as a Russian girl has been put in the orphanage since the tragic accidental fire that took the lives of her foster parents. An exceptionally polite and intelligent girl, she deeply appreciates the fact that she finally has a family and that she is being loved by John and Kate alike. In the most dignified of terms I will try to explain what I feel for what takes place next. "You do not drop your excrement where you eat". I am sure you all have heard a more familiarized version to it. Well this is exactly what 9 year old Esther tries to do. Ungrateful as she turns out to be, she seems to suddenly have come out with an agenda of her own, this by the way is exactly how the movie has been intended to unfold. Isabella Fuhrman; where did they discover her from? This brilliant young star that is very fresh to the widescreen has just a handful of appearances on TV shows to her name. A wondrous discovery she is to Hollywood. She stands out like a drunk driver at the Grand Prix, and just is scary as hell. I have never been to hell but I am quite sure it's full of little Esthers! Whoever has signed her up or whoever is her agent at this point of time has sure made some wise calls with the young actress, if she is diverse in her talent and is not limited to just this role in the ORPHAN , she may become one of the greats of tomorrow.Absolutely a phenomenon of a movie, yet another innovative approach, of course there are similarities with the plot of a psychotic killer on a blood thirsty spree, however a different adaptation altogether when considering the murder factor.THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT A WASTE TIME! Title: OrphanDirected by: Jaume Collet-SerraStarring: Vera Farmiga, Peter Sarsgaard, Jimmy Bennett, Aryana Engineer and Isabelle FuhrmanRated: Rated R for disturbing violent content, some sexuality and language Rating: 07/10123 Minutes</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy thriller that misses almost as frequently as it hits</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Orphan takes a well-worn horror premise ? wealthy young family's new child turns out evil ? and attempts to breathe new life into it by taking it in a novel direction. It works, for the most part, and the result is quite creepy and effective. It's full of hits and misses, but thankfully there's a few more of the hits, and it moves along at a good pace. The child actors for the most part are superb, and Vera Farmiga gives an assured performance as the paranoid mum who's alone in knowing something's not right (think Rosemary with a Macbook). Peter Saarsgard is less memorable as her naive ? no, stupid ? hubby, an unsympathetic hypocrite who goes out of his way to see the good in everyone except his wife. Oddly, the film attempts to present him as someone to root for, which is one area in which it fails. Another bizarre aspect is the way the director tries to build tension. Lots of genre-standard close-ups here, and claustrophobic over-the-shoulder shots. Yet even when nothing is happening, there's constant attempts to make us jump. Designed perhaps to create a constant feeling of unease, but the effect is closer to the boy who cried wolf; after enough false alarms, we simply stop caring. That said, there's enough nifty camera-work in the genuinely tense moments to pull it back. One memorable scene takes a frantic stalk-and-slash approach inside a kids' play area to great effect. There's also a very good backstory involving the characters which is skilfully uncovered as the plot progresses, with no need for overt explanations or obvious devices. Such a film lives or dies on its ending, though, and this one's sure to divide viewers ? but it deserves credit for trying something new in a genre that's in danger of becoming stale. 3/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice little thriller with a good twist.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From that 70's horror classic that started it all (The Omen), right up until 2009's "Case 39", the 'evil kid' plot line has been steadily evolving into a whole new genre. As such, we have seen several times before, how a cute and apparently sweet child manipulates and brutally murders all that stands in the way of a pre-conceived, albeit evil plan. Having just watched "Case 39" recently, I was expecting the same experience here. Boy, was I wrong! Unlike the aforementioned films, what works here is the strength of stellar acting combined with a plot that escalates into a crescendo of suspense. David Leslie Johnson's script starts with a horrific prologue where the lovely and very talented Vera Farmiga is heavily pregnant, as Kate Coleman. In the presence of her husband John (Peter Sarsgaard), their third pregnancy ends in a bloody mess, quite literally. Although a vital segment of the plot, I must say the prologue has a very B movie feel to it, made worse with soft focus camera work, confusing the viewer into believing this to be Kate's nightmare. But apparently it did happen, and almost a year later, Kate is still suffering the loss of what would have been their third child. In filling an ever increasing void, Kate and John decide to adopt Esther, a 9 year old Russian orphan with remarkable charm and intellect for her age. As Esther settles into her new home, her bond with Kate's deaf-mute daughter is instantaneous, while her step-brother is less cordial and is the first to sense her ominous personality. Before long, Esther turns out to be an odd-ball in school, even as Kate discovers at an alarming rate, that adopting her may have been a bad decision. On the other hand, John disagrees, causing a rift between the couple and opening old wounds. Just as the situation starts to boil over, Kate uncovers Esther's deep dark secret and must do all she can to protect the lives of her family.After slipping under the radar, past his directional debut remaking "House of Wax" (2005, featuring Paris Hilton), Jaume Collet-Serra re-emerges here darker and stronger in only his third film and second attempt at the horror/thriller genre. From a directional standpoint, Collet-Serra delivers a neatly done package, complete with tight acting, solid build up of suspense through great pacing, and a perfectly timed twist most viewers won't see coming. His pacing of the plot allows enough time for considerable character development. Essentially, this is what draws us into the lives of Kate and John and their little family, up until they adopt Esther. After this point, the pace increases with a lot of focus (or obscurity) into the mystery behind Esther and her motives. Not but until the end, when the twist emerges, are we left guessing Esther's true motives and origins: evil incarnate or just a child deprived of affection. Either or neither, the answer is astounding, and Johnson's concept is fresh, despite our temptation to compare Esther with Macaulay Culkin's sinister Henry Evans, in "The Good Son". Collet-Serra also dares to go where other directors tread lightly, especially since the very nature of this film is taboo when considering the storm it has stirred amongst parents with adopted children. Then there is the controversy of what a child actor can and cannot do or say in front of a camera. Again, this is what differentiates "Orphan" from similar films, because the direction here is bold, structured and clever, and pushes all boundaries. Of all the positives I can think of, the list topper will definitely have to be the exceptional performances from Farmiga and little known Isabelle Fuhrman as the antagonist. I will let you be the judge when I say that Fuhrman steals the show from the moment you see her and carries that uncanny charisma all through to the end. Step aside Dakota Fanning; make way for Isabelle Fuhrman as a force to reckon with. Aside from these two, Sarsgaard puts in his usual sleepy-eyed performance but is shadowed by Aryana Engineer as the couple's deaf-mute daughter; good input from another child actor.All said and done, the near perfect script is not without some blaring clichés and unnecessary tributes. As with most recent thrillers, you can expect some jumpy moments, predictable one-liners and that chilly atmosphere snowy cinematography gives to horror thrillers. Co-produced by Leonardo DiCaprio, look out for a scene here in tribute to his final scene in "Titanic". Farmiga's one-liner in the last scene is also reminiscent of Harrison Ford 'kicking' Gary Oldman off his airplane in "Air Force One". While most viewers may find this movie original enough to be conceptually shocking, there will those who may find it a tad bit contrived. Even so, this is a movie about children, and for the most part, acted out by children. But given the MPAA rating of R, this one is strictly adults only.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!This is a brilliant film, if you like movies like 'The Ring' or 'Mirrors' then you will like this. When you realise that Esther is a murderer and is trying to kill the family, you want to go and kill Esther and warn the family. The twist is great at the end and I was not expecting it at all. Some scenes can be disturbing, such as the one where Esther pushes a girl of a climbing frame at school, when she pushes Max into a road in front of a car, when she kills a Nun with a hammer, when she points a gun at Max's head, when she breaks her own arm, when she burns a tree house down with Daniel in, when she kills Daniel with a pillow whilst he's in hospital, and when Kate kicks her head and breaks her neck. There is also a sex scene in the kitchen.I really enjoyed this movie, not too scary, but scary enough to disturb me and creep me out. Would definitely recommend it, I would not recommend that people under 13 should watch this movie though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well made, Good acting, unpredictable, disturbing, but the ending was terrible.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think Orphan was one of those rare horror films which are actually unpredictable and scary. Most horror films these day consist of gore, high tension and are very predictable. This wasn't. It had a very strong opening which was disturbing and immediately set the context for the main theme throughout the film.It was consistently scary and although it was tense throughout, it wasn't so high tension that it was emotionally draining to watch; it kept you interested all the way through. The acting was great from whoever plays Ester and the others were good too. There were a number of alarming/horrific incidents which were each unpredictable and disturbing in various ways, starting with the brutal killing of a pigeon and progressing to murder and self-inflicted injuries for the sake of treachery. These were integrated with the normal, friendly yet superficial air beautifully. They were also not mindless gore, but mindful gore. They aided the story and were not mundane or boring as some horror films are today, (Eg. Texas Chainsaw Massacre.) I think the reason they were so successful was because not only were they disturbing in the gory sense, but they were cruel and brutal, and an intimidating mentality for a child to have to say the least. The one thing that tipped the scale for me was the ending. Orphan had consistently been realistic and very well made, until the end where it is revealed that Ester is in fact in her 30s and is about to kill John (Father/Husband). This turn in events is ridiculous. Ester was cruel and downright scary throughout the film, and this was enhanced by the fact that she is a child. The ending just shows that they couldn't think of a clever way to end the story, so they made up something stupid. Yes, it was unpredictable, but it was unrealistic, which did not correspond with the rest of the film. And although it would have also been a slight anti-climax, I feel that the mother should have killed Ester and been taken in as either crazy or arrested. It would have been more predictable, but much more pull-off-able, and far less ridiculous. The ending makes me fairly angry, because Orphan was a very good film before it was ruined by this. Nonetheless I would recommended watching it, but preparing for a disappointment at the end. It's not worth ignoring a generally good film simply because the ending is bad. Go watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Isabel Furhman is Amazing in this Role!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Orphan 7/14/2010"Orphan" has to be at the top of the list when it comes to evil kid movies. It's a rare studio made (Warner Brothers) horror movie that is not a remake or a neutered PG-13 attempt. With quality first rate actors like Vera Farmiga, Peter Sarsgaard and the unforgettable Isabella Furhman as Esther, it brings this movie to higher level. It has one of those big twist endings that you will probably either really love or really hate. I'm on the really love side as I though it is what made this movie completely crazy and enjoyable.John and Kate are a pretty well to-do couple that live with their two kids in a house that John designed. Their daughter Max is hearing impaired, while Daniel is your typical older brother. When Kate has a miscarriage they decide to adopt. The fact that Esther comes from an orphanage and does such nasty things aroused a bit of controversy, but with the ending those claims really don't hold water. Esther came from Russia to live with her first American family, but tragedy struck as the house burnt down, killing everyone except her. She speaks in a very believable accent and dresses in a peculiar way which gets her teased at school. Like a lot of girls Esther is a master manipulator who likes to play people against each other and will do anything to get what she wants. The movie also seems to really explore the social dynamics of kids. How they socialize at school, home, and at the park. The acting of the three kids is nothing short of remarkable. Aryana Engineer, who plays Max, was 7-8 years old when filming and is actually hearing impaired. I personally think there is nothing better than to see little kids swearing, as they sprinkle in a few f-bombs here and there. It just gives the story a bit of uneasy edginess that lets the audience know that the filmmakers are not afraid to go there. The violence is also quite raw and brutal. Esther successfully turns John and Kate against each other, when Kate keeps blaming her for a string of "accidents". John refuses to believe her and that is one of the movies short comings, as it drags on to ridiculous lengths. I won't give away the ending but I'll say again that I though the ending was a fun and surprising jolt that really makes this movie memorable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chilling to the Bone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What if the child you adopted was trying to kill you, or your family? That's quite a big thing. This film brings that fear to life. When seemingly innocent Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman) is adopted by Kate (Farmiga) and John (Sarsgaard), things start to go wrong with the family. Kate doesn't buy into Esther's innocence, but everyone else turns on Kate when Esther dupes and silences the people around her.I've seen Vera Farmiga in numerous films before, specifically, The Departed and Running Scared. I'm not a huge fan of hers, but she was quite astounding in this as Kate. I've seen Peter Sarsgaard in a few films as well and was mesmerized by his performance in Shattered Glass and he definitely stands out to me now. I'd never seen Isabelle Fuhrman before either. I'm not going to give away the ending or anything, but I was surprised by Isabelle's portrayal.As it comes to the story, it's rather frightening, as is Esther's character. I kept feeling a lot of empathy towards Max (the daughter of Kate and John) and Daniel (the son). Max continuously gets duped into helping Esther do horrible things and keeps witnessing the evil that surrounds her. It really chills you to your bone and shivers your spine.I really felt for all the characters, regardless of not having children, and really grew to disdain Esther. I predicted her intentions early on, but in no way guessed correctly who she really was. It's a really suspenseful film and one that takes children to a whole new level of maturity (and I'm not just talking about Esther's actions in the film).I think what really stands out is the realism of the film and how far the writers pushed the boundaries. It goes over the top sometimes, but I think it's still realistic as far as how Esther is able to get away with things and solidify herself against Kate. I'm glad I was able to predict John's character at the end but was wrong about some things in the film. I like to be surprised once in awhile with some films. This one caught me off guard a few times. It was really great.Because of the sexuality, language, violence and mature themes of the film I cannot recommend this to anyone under 18. Even if you're a mature 16-year old, I'd advise you to ask your parents to watch it with you. It's quite enjoyable if you're mature enough. I only had a dislike for the Hollywood ending. Otherwise, you'll enjoy the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is by no means groundbreaking, needless to say. But if you go to the movies to be entertained more than enlightened, who cares if it's unoriginal, formulaic, and predictable? "Clifford", "Problem Child" 1 &amp; 2, "Joshua" , "The Omen" (both versions), and "The Bad Seed", are also about bad children (the first two are comedies). This one stars a girl, which may explain why I liked it a lot. I guess girls take evil a bit more seriously than boys. The more evil a character is, the better. And the more they say and/or do, the better. The movie accomplishes just enough and tells just enough story, that the movie doesn't feel long or short.***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In the "Wicked" Tradition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If nothing else the disparate viewer reactions to "The Orphan" make for interesting reading on these comment pages. My advice for potential viewers is to disregard the most extreme love-hate stuff; the film is neither as good nor as bad as a lot of people are saying.It is basically a slightly more bent and graphic version of Julia Stiles' 1998 film "Wicked". Both films revolve around ruthless jockeying for household supremacy; both have an erotic subtext that people seem to be afraid to discuss, and both push the envelope of the "Bad Seed" (1956) genre-reflecting the more extreme attitudes of current fans of the psychological horror genre."Orphan" has a much bigger budget than the earlier films which is quite skillfully utilized in useful areas like production design and cinematography. It is very creative in these areas and Esther (the latest "demon seed" nicely overplayed by Isabelle Fuhrman) gets a nice dimensionality from the regular showcasing of her art. The painting of the burning orphanage is especially well done and extremely effective; being as creepy as any visual image I have ever seen.I would certainly recommend the film to fans of "Wicked" (and vice versa) and to even causal fans of the horror genre. I think it is too extreme for crossover fans, who would be wise to avoid the film or at least to be prepared to bail at some point because it gets increasingly twisted as it progresses. Unless you are willing to suspend disbelief during a number of plot developments you won't enjoy the viewing. It is a bit like "May" (2002) in this regard, where a lot of viewers enjoy the premise and the set-up but lose interest when the characters get too extreme or too stupid for audience identification.It is a long film (slightly over two hours), which would not be a problem if they had focused more on solving the mystery of Esther's background. Because the film offers viewers minimal cerebral exercises like this, their attention wonders to plot holes and the film begins to get a bit tedious.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.

		<fullReview>She calls herself Esther. She wears ribbons round her wrists. And she gives the whole concept of adoption a bad name. (No way is this film a sly dig at a certain pop star.) Overshadowed by some ludicrous controversy, and undermined by a cheesy ad campaign ? "You'll never guess her secret"? Let's define 'never' in the age of Google, shall we? ? the real reveal is how much fun this psycho-thriller actually is.Like its subject, Orphan's a precocious brat of a movie, boasting smart subtexts and performances that have no right being as good as they are, including a genuinely disquieting turn from Isabelle Fuhrman. Little girls, of course, are absolutely terrifying. That's why Kubrick used not one but two of them in The Shining.Only trouble is, like all little show-offs, it eventually starts playing up, pratting about, and ultimately outstays its welcome. Enough now. Mummy wants a nap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw this movie, adopting can be scary, or even dangerous. Here you have a couple in Conneticut who were trying to have a third child into their family. The results: A Stillborn. The parents grieve their loss, and they move on. They try to adopt, and they did. They go to the Orpahnage for little girls and they come across Esther. This girl claims to be from Russia, and is very smart for her age. She is very artistic for her age as well. But she is hiding a secret that doesn't come out until she has settled into the Colemans. She befriends their deaf daughter Max, freaks out her big brother, and the rest of the schoolmates began to taunt her. One girl gets her ankle broken, the brother nearly loses his life to Esther. Esther is a really BAD GIRL! More and more secrets are coming out: she is psychotic, manipulative, and deceiving. Esther is not even 9, she's a 33 year-old, with a violent streak, and a disorder which gives her that youthful appearance. That is really scary! This movie is a cross between "The Omen" and "The Crush", and the cast and characters are played out very well. A real keeper! 4 out of 5 stars!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Turns Out To Be Surprisingly Exciting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is certainly not a good commercial to promote the adoption of older children! I know that for that very reason it sparked a bit of negative comment from the "adoption community" for exploiting that angle. Having said that - as a member of that community, I can't see any reason that this particular subject matter should be declared off limits to Hollywood. The only issue for me as someone who watched this is whether or not it's a good movie. In fact, it is. It's well constructed, and moves the viewer logically but unpredictably toward a very violent and climactic ending, with a twist that was completely unforeseen. By the last 20 minutes or so, this actually had me on the edge of my seat.As the adoptive parents, Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard were effective - Farmiga moreso, I thought. Sarsgaard's character came across as a bit of a dunce, quite frankly, and I wasn't especially sympathetic toward him. That's not Sarsgaard's fault, of course. He played the character that was written. It's just that Farmiga as the embattled mom Kate was the one who garners the sympathy and concern of the viewer, and I wondered throughout how she was going to avoid taking the blame for everything that was happening. In the end, though, the performance that stands out is neither of those. It's young Isabelle Fuhrman as Esther, the adoptee who ends up destroying the family. Fuhrman was absolutely brilliant - especially considering her age and lack of experience.Fuhrman's performance aside, what I appreciated was the way director Jaume Collet-Serra kept building the suspense. Just when you think you know what's going on, there's another twist. At first, my expectation was that this was going to be some sort of supernatural "spawn of the devil" sort of film, and had very low expectations. Then it seemed to settle in as being little more than a story about a child raised in a Russian orphanage with all the assorted problems that can create. Then it seemed to become a psychological thriller, as Esther starts to seem less like a well-adjusted child and more like a truly insane and depraved child. Then there's the final twist that I won't reveal but that truly did shock me. After that revelation, though, the movie does become extremely violent - although given what we learn about Esther's background, the violence is to be expected. Overall, this is excellent. A movie that keeps me on my toes with twists and turns and leaves me on the edge of my seat has done something very right!</fullReview>

Watch it again and see who is in AA and who isn't - and who saves the day and who almost gets her grand-kid killed. And the therapist.... what an indictment of the typical American reaction to problem drinking. Send her to rehab even though she didn't drink and was right about Esther.

		<fullReview>Orphan reminded me of another title with a similar premise and name: The Orphanage. And just like The Orphanage, Orphan is a psychological thriller/drama.The good news: amazing acting (especially from the lead girl that plays Esther), great scene direction, good character development and a good and suspenseful story setup.The bad news: all i said about character development and story goes to hell in the final act, which completely ruins what was built story-wise, until that point. And what ruins it is not the twist - the twist is actually well thought. What ruins everything comes after the twist: somehow, the script writers decided to use every cliché in the history of movies. The father's stupidity and lack of logical thinking is abashing, but "the icing on the cake" is how everything that happens in the 3rd act seems to be so forced, up until the very end.I made a short list of things to do when you're in mortal danger: - if your adopted kid (that your wife also suspects might be a murderer) is hitting on you, just tell her to go to bed, as it's the most sensible thing to do in the given situation... - if you, as a mother, are convinced that your adopted kid is a murderer and wants to kill your natural kids, under no circumstance act calm and logically, in order to keep her under surveillance until everything is cleared; you must act irrational so that you'll get sedated/separated from everyone, complicating things even further - after you've managed to knock the murderer down, don't immobilize him/her. Just turn your back and walk away, leaving him/her there to regain consciousness (so that he/she might attack you later) - and finally, my favorite: after you KO'ed the murderer and left him there to regain consciousness and you hear the police coming, it is imperative that you go into a forest where the police cannot find you and where it is very easy for the murderer to kill you without any trouble from the police - OK, one more: when you kill a disturbed criminal, you must use a cool line. Otherwise, he probably won't die.Final thoughts: Orphan is not a bad movie; but it could've been a lot better. A clichéd script (with a very stupid final act) drags it down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pleasantly Surprised</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm happy to say that I was pleasantly surprised how good the film was. Full of frights and WTF moments as well as a striking twist.The story is pretty simple. A family, mourning over the recent loss of a baby soon delve into the adoption process, resulting in the discovery of a young girl Esther. Esther coming into a new social network soon makes friends and enemies. Right from the start we sense that not all is right with her.As the film progresses we witness the manipulative ways of Esther, A 9- year-old girl with chronic homicidal urges, interesting Russian accent and funky dress sense makes her the perfect central character in this film.The tag-lines of the film "There's something wrong with Esther" and "You'll never Guess Her Secret" despite at first appearing to reveal key points in the plot never seemed to ruin it. The film builds up to the twist, a shocker that left me satisfied. My overall verdict: 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too disturbing for me to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is about a young charming girl who got adopted by a family of four. However, the girl turns out to be a lot less charming than she looks."Orphan" is not quite a horror story, but a disturbing story. I felt so disturbed after watching 70 minutes that I could not watch it anymore. The plot may be simple, but the delivery of it is definitely hauntingly effective. It leaves me unsettled and deeply disturbed. I also feel unhappy as the story may put people off adoption, hence robbing innocent and needy children's chance of having a loving family. In short, I wish I could undo watching even just the 70 minutes I watched, because it disturbed me too much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will be honest, I did not have high expectations for this movie. For one thing, I was concerned over how thrilling it could be let alone be able to show any originality within the plot.At the start of the movie, it does feel that way. It isn't all eye popping or creepy at all, and even felt really tame. However, once you reach little more than half-way into the movie it completely changes - the twist was really original, and phenomenal! Towards the end of the movie I was definitely at the edge of my seat, because for once you actually don't know who will by the next murdered victim of Esther. In a lot of previous movies, the obvious characters tend to survive or die. But not this! The actress who plays Esther was absolutely amazing and talented. Overall, take a chance with this movie - it really is something, especially during the last half. The plot twist is no doubt the highlight.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think it is a little hard to decide how to vote for this movie. If it was a "normal" movie (I think no-horror), it will be 6 points from me. But ... But this is real horror. This is real drama about normal peoples problems, normal things which can (with a little dope of fantasy) really happen. Movies like this are not common at all, today we may see every of those super-expensive ghost stories with full 3D and I do not know what everything... This movie, movies like that, is real fresh breeze for horror movies.But, why I did not vote for 10/10. I may vote, but only, if that movie starts 5 minutes later after start and ends 10 minutes before starts. I think that were the worst parts of movie.Bad things, which I did not like: Too fairy beginning -- after which I thought there was another 3/10 horror movie Illogicalities -- Stupid pathos at one of very last scenesGood things I liked! Great Vera Farmiga, great Isabele ... (I don't remember name, just Esther) ;) Great story -- Story is going straight forward and it is not boringPersonally, I do not know, why they must put there that end scenes. It was totally horrible ending, I think best ending was to be after "glashouse" and that is everything. I very like scenes, when you're awaiting some shock, but it ... is no coming ;) You do not need to make shock-scenes, when audience will be shocked inside :-) Bravo, very great, mister director! ;)Overall -- I think this is movie, which you may see, even if you do not like horrors. Because it is not just common horror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pleasantly disturbing surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit it, I was a bit skeptical about Orphan, as it had written "formulaic evil-kid movie" all over it.Instead I have to eat my words, and give credit when credit is due. And lots of it actually.The plot is standard enough: a couple decide to adopt a child after the tragic death of their unborn kid. They go for an older kid, and choose Esther, a charming-yet-odd girl.Esther comes into the movie like many other "devilish kids" we've seen before: gentle and condescending, but already with a little bit of darkness showing through. Things start to get worse (for the family, but better for the audience) when Ester "settles down" at her new place. The interesting conflict with her new Mom is well-played and makes us really uncomfortable when it appears clear (to us at least) that the little girl is playing dirty. Everything is well-executed, and most important, well acted.The swerve is really good (not 100% new, but still head and shoulders better than most of what we had to sit through recently) and caught me off-guard.The finale, however, is a bit of a letdown, as it goes back to Final Struggle 101. We can't always win...All in all, Orphan is very enjoyable, and Esther (the character and the young actress) is a joy to watch: adorable, creepy or downright scary with no drop in her performance. Also, the rest of the cast worked pretty well, kids included (actually Aryana Engineer, the little sister Max, is very impressive too).As said, the plot is solid, with some peaks, and even the lows are much more than okay in the big picture.Esther gave me the creeps and made me highly uncomfortable, something that very few characters (or movies) had managed to do in recent times. And all that without needing a truckload of fake blood and bowels.Someone in Hollywood should take notes.P.S. If Isabelle Fuhrman doesn't fall victim of the usual "Trobled Teenage Star" syndrome, we might have found a top-flight actress for the future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Make sure you adopt the right girl before its all said and done.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Isabelle Fuhrman plays Esther in this horrific movie about a girl who is adopted after Vera Farmiga (Kate Coleman) and Peter Sarsgaard (John Coleman) lose a daughter. Also her daughter almost drowns after an alcohol incident by the ice. They finally decide that adopting another daughter would be a good idea, but what they didn't know about Esther is she as not as innocent as she looks. Esther starts off by pushing a girl off the playground jungle gym then escalades into more worse things than that including using a hammer and then making sure Max (Aryana Engineer) would not tell anyone about what happened. After that it gets more out of hand and she causes Kate and Peter to fight. This movie kind of reminded me of the Uninvited in some ways and you might think so too that is if you have seen the Uninvited. The thing i liked most about this movie is it was a mystery how Esther kept coning everyone and how she would play so innocent and not get blamed for anything. This is sure to be a favorite for some people who love horror movies. Just hope you enjoy it as i did. See my Reviews on getthenew.com, thanks ahb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow but decent thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well I got what I expected out of this film, except the twist near the end. The film has a very slow start with more of the jump scares than it actually building tension. The story went about what I expected besides it being more of a thriller and didn't really go in the horror direction. Besides it being pretty slow a lot of people seem to be satisfied cause of the big twist near the end of the film, I will admit I didn't see that one coming and it was original, also shocking. But I found it to be a bit stupid and lame, if you see the movie you will understand what I am talking about cause it leads to a lot of plot holes that don't make any sense and ruins her character which was actually quite intriguing at first. Besides Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman) who did a remarkable job playing a menacing character, Max (Aryana Engineer) was the most adorable child character I have ever seen in a movie and stood out a lot. I was expecting this film to be better cause I had a pretty decent expectation for it, despite it being sort of a cliché thriller and using a child antagonist to spice things up a bit it was a darkly humorous and pretty disturbing movie that is worth a look. The main thing that irritated me was Daniel Coleman played by Jimmy Bennett, it was like the writers weren't sure to kill him off or not the kid is literally like Kenny from "South Park".7.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Old concept, but not bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a decent rendition of the evil-child subgenre of horror. The writers of this script smoked some pretty decent stuff coming up with scenarios for this movie. Some pretty unrealistic situations here, even with the explanation of why Esther is the way she is (I won't say why cuz it'd totally give up the story).All the main characters, except for the mom, were dumb, little chickenshits. The dad was the biggest twit of them all. The two biological children should've died just for being such pansies. I kind of wish they spent a little more time developing dad's character. I see he's a pansy but why? How did he get so attached to Esther? This movie conjured a lot of emotion from me and I think that's what makes a good movie. I can't complain about the acting because I think it was actually very good, especially considering 50% of the main characters are kids. In real life, I'd want these people to die so as to rid our gene pool of stupidity but I guess Hollywood has a thing against killing children in movies.If you have a couple of hours to kill, this is worth downloading off a torrent or getting it at the Red Box. Aww hell, why not...buy the DVD!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Horror Movie I've Seen in a Long Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Orphan' is a great horror movie! It is made all the more effective in the fact that the characters are three dimensional and complex. This is one of the few recent movies where I was more interested in the characters than the action on screen.It would have been easy to have had the evil orphan, Esther, move into the perfect family and disrupt their harmony, but the family in this film has such dysfunction that the destruction caused by her is more dramatic. The horror of the situation is made all the more palpable because you care about the family members, especially the mother, who has lost a great deal of reliability as a result of her alcoholism. This also makes the scenes where she can't get anyone to believe her about Esther's true nature more authentic as opposed to being a plot device.The movie also has a plot twist that would seem implausible, but, because the film-makers have kept you sold on the reality of the situation, you buy it. In light of what I call the 'Sixth Sense' phenomenon, I usually roll my eyes when a film does a plot twist that changes the entire context of the story. This time, however, it's like a kick in the gut! The final 20 minutes of this movie are so intense that audience I saw it with got very vocal in response to what they were seeing on the screen. In addition to that, Esther is such a malevolent force of nature that the entire audience clapped when she finally got her comeuppance. My advice: see this movie with someone you can grab onto during the many moments of suspense!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterpiece of Black Horror Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film opens with a nightmarish and very disturbing scene where mother is reliving the tragedy of the baby she lost. Everything is blurred and sinister looking. This scene ends and the real story begins. I have to say that opening a movie with a dream/nightmare sequence is a highly innovative and refreshing idea. We usually have to wait so damn long, for character development, for story arks, blah blah blah. But this movie truly delivers the goods right from the get go. The couple have a son but have lost their second child. They decide to adopt. There is this real cute Russian girl painting upstairs and the husband is charmed into adopting. Creepy things start to go wrong throughout the movie between the little girl and her mother. The girl very nearly drives her adoptive mother to psychosis. It is too late by the end however. The film has some great comic touches. The son sharing Perfect 10 sneakily out of a secret stash up in his tree house. There is a scene near the end which is such a deadly comic device that the whole theatre were squirming in a majestic evil ecstasy. To give away the end however would be cruel. The movie is very twisted and I mean VERY twisted. There is a kind of cunning humour running through its cinematic veins such as when she warns her step brother not to tell 'or I'll cut your pee-pee off before you know what it's for!!!! Wonderfully bizarre, bizarrely erotic and mad as f**k</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A mother (Vera Farmiga) in a dying labor pain looks up when doctors say her child has died. Doctors and the mother look at the blood-soaked baby in shock when it starts crying. Above all that, the husband shows up with a camcorder. Now that is one bone-chilling creation from a twisted writer, or in this case a pair of writers (David Johnson and Alex Mace). Not sure if that was a necessary introduction for this cleverly written violent opera (Orphan) but honestly it is not the time to judge yet. Not for the sake of saving writers and director's (Jaume Collet-Serra) plea for freedom of expression but for the explanation in the end.It is tough to find a decent thriller. If you agree the last three best thrillers were James Wan's Saw (2004) and Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense (1999) and Unbreakable (2000). Orphan, a tale of a couple who adopt a girl from an orphanage only to get thrown into a world of mis-deeds, mis-fortunes and mis-takes, could be added as the fourth cleverly twisted thriller of the past two decades. For that not only the writer and director but the shining star of this film Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman) should be appreciated with a round of applause. It is not just the idea that is the primary force behind the success but the screenplay fits well to the dark ambiance. The argument of the violence justification perhaps will render itself un-necessary. The writing is hypnotic and shocking. The director does not fail to justice the screenplay. The false impression of ghostly possession of the protagonist leading to a conclusion is very 'Hitchcockian'. In fact the director makes a homage to the famous stop-light-confrontation of the leading lady by her boss in Psycho (1960), if stretched further to Butch-Marcellus confrontation in Pulp Fiction (1994). Another memorable scene is when camera sits next to sleeping Max (Aryana Engineer) in the dark room and the lightning flash from the window shows her adopted sister Esther standing next to her bed. Director accomplishes a horrifying tone to this thriller throughout. Watch for the modification of the studio logos in the beginning of the film.Isabelle Fuhrman hovers over the film with a winning smile. This 12 yr old actor has a great potential and will help her in her upcoming career. Alongside Aryana Engineer and Jimmy Bennett as siblings have shined as well. Especially Aryana. Wonder how director executed the chilling scenes without affecting all the child stars. Maybe Mr. Kubrick attended the filming in spirit and gave suggestions from The Shining (1980). Finally the parents, play the roles of a believer and a non-believer in each other's theories. Posing as opposing thought invokers for the audience. This is also the writers' achievement.In a nutshell, if you haven't been scared intelligently then Orphan is waiting for you. Just sit back and bite your nails because you may not find time to chew on the popcorn.</fullReview>

This movie is not a horror flick as THE COLLECTER or THE PERFECT GETAWAY, in my opinion its a updated and slightly better version of THE GOOD SON. Esther is great as the main character, you grow to really like her then really hate her all within the 2 hours of movie run time. There were no plot holes at all and all the characters help the movie move along. Of course the "TWIST" many say they knew and saw it coming well there were a few hints as the cutting of the steak, the piano, the history she knew of Romania and a few other hints to the major twist but it wasn't easily put out there for you to guess.

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Orphan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Orphan belongs to the "demonic-kid" genre of horror films, and recent antagonists such as Damien from the Omen remake, and Joshua, just cannot hold a candle to what Esther the Orphan here can do. Perhaps the more frightening aspects that this film dished out, is how they're sans supernatural elements, and contained pretty much what someone can accomplish with just a cunning mind, and a merciless heart.Then again, full credit goes to Isabelle Fuhrman who plays Esther. She has enough creepiness in her when she glints at you with that unsmiling face, or can do an about turn when she requires some sympathy points. Fuhrman is THE reason to watch the film as she fleshes out her role with wicked perfection, the kid from hell with an angelic face. Being an ace manipulator, the horror that she dished out is on all levels, from the emotional, psychological and right down to causing physical distress as well, I cannot think of a more multi-faceted evil character that's intelligent to know how to play the cards right at every step of the way. I suppose Esther could become Fuhrman's calling card, just like how The Professional became Natalie Portman's, and would probably garner as much attention this point on.But that's not to say that the rest of the cast didn't do their part in this Alex Mace story, directed by Spaniard Jaume Collet-Serra. Peter Sarsgaard (one of my favourite contemporary character actors) and Vera Farmiga (who spent time in the other genre film Joshua) play John and Kate Coleman, a couple who lost a child, and are looking to adopting another to add to their family of Daniel (Jimmy Bennett) and Max (Aryana Engineer, extremely cute as a button, and hearing impaired in real life). So in comes a mysterious 9 year old girl Esther (Fuhrman) into their lives, and while all may seem to be fine and dandy with Esther needing time to settle into her new household, their lives soon turn upside down, with acts of violence committed against children and adults alike, some of which will shock because of the unflinching camera-work.Collet-Serra directed this with as much shrewdness as Esther too in a way, able to manipulate the audience along the journey. You'll be hard pressed not to cheer at appropriate times, or feel exasperated when characters refuse to heed warning signs and listen. You'll be pretty much engaged while watching the film, and kudos to the director for keeping the narrative tight and stylishly executed with wondrous cinematography set in a snow filled landscape.However, he relied too much on the soundtrack to give the audience a heightened sense of alert and expectation that something would appear behind an open door, or a mirror, or just around the corner, which 99% of the time turned out to be nothing but red herrings. While it may be novel for a start, it soon wears on for far too longer than welcomed, and you'll soon find this trick being too tiresome that it could well be omitted from the film as it serves no purpose than to set your heartbeat racing.Despite that, Orphan is a top notch thriller despite its B-grade type genre that would put you at the edge of your seat as it builds a crescendo to the finale. It's been some time since I've had a positive experience with the genre, and Orphan firmly sets itself out as an instant classic, with a memorable villain. Definitely highly recommended, and probable to make it to my shortlist of the top this year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Look at the snow orphan?snorphan? ? Orphan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Surprise, surprise, Orphan actually isn't that bad. Who would have thought something that appeared to be a bad rehash of The Omen could truly entertain? I guess the ability to acquire the services of a couple on the cusp of A-list status actors in Peter Sarsgaard and Vera Farmiga should have raised an eyebrow, but honestly I still had many reservations. In fact, I knew the "twist" before sitting down in the theatre?something that I believe enhanced my enjoyment rather than lessened it. Perhaps this knowledge made the proceedings appear more comical than they should have been and maybe took away from some of the horror aspects, however, it also invested me in the tale to see how the revelation would be discovered. The acting is impressive across the board and the visuals are enjoyable for the most part. I loved the opening sequence bridging reality and dream, as well as the utilization of black light, (hokily alluded to with the opening WB icon), but the fake scares?and there are many?started to anger me a bit.This is not the type of horror I enjoy normally; I tend to gravitate more towards the fantastical or supernatural. That said, though, I understand the gimmicks used and the techniques relied upon. Director Jaume Collet-Serra appeared to want to subvert some preconceptions by giving us multiple instances of slow tracking shots towards a blind spot with music swelling louder and louder only to reveal ? nothing. I see what he was attempting?trying to get the audience off guard?but all it ended up doing was making me numb to the moments that actually delivered. Rather than be affected from the "jump scares" I was more entertained by the brutal violence utilized. Not many films of this ilk are R-rated these days, so when you do get one, it is somewhat a breath of fresh air. There are some definite pedophilic elements at play, very strong language, (used often to comical effect), and the desire to make what few deaths there are as memorable as possible. I mean, come on, if you have a hammer and a body prone and ready for a whack, why not make sure the deed gets done by smashing away a few extra times? I really bought into the beginning due to the fantastic work on the part of Farmiga. The devastation wrought on her face after a stillbirth is unavoidable. Here is a mother of two that had so much love for her unborn child, she crawled into a shell of depression at the loss, needing an outlet for the pain and bottled up emotions never able to be showered on the child. Her detachment from the family, especially her husband, is evident, as is the pure joy at finding young Esther in the orphanage, thinking that her love could finally be released. Farmiga embodies the role so completely that, if I remember correctly, she instinctively signs "thank you", (her daughter is deaf), when leaving the orphanage. The moment has no need for it as her hearing impaired child is at home, but it is definitely something that character would do unconsciously. She is also very good opposite Sarsgaard and his inability to stand by her when the truth about Esther begins to show through. At times it seems he is phoning the performance in, but ultimately he does a good job; maybe he is just overshadowed by his counterpart.Rounding out the acting are two brilliant turns from the youngsters. Aryana Engineer plays Max with professionalism and realism. Deaf in real life, she is amazingly able to portray the fear and anxiety that comes with knowing what her new sister is capable of. Unable to tell anyone, both due to her handicap and the threats on her and the family's lives, she must lie and say everything is okay. But her subtle cowering in fright at the sight of Esther in her door is quite palpable. Speaking of Esther, you can't deny the performance of twelve-year-old Isabelle Fuhrman. The most recent example of what parents are willing to allow their children to do for money, (Sacha Baron Cohen's Brüno would be proud), she is effectively creepy and dangerous in her lack of a moral compass and instinctual need to survive. More robotic and calculated at the start, it is the final act, where her true identity is revealed, that shines. The malice and rage buried beneath an angelic façade is finally out in the open; a master manipulator and seductress, Fuhrman will turn some heads and hopefully have a career before her without being typecast in the genre.Orphan begs to memory the slasher flicks of the 90s like Child's Play rather than the psychological terrors I relate to more. I won't let that deter me from recommending the film to those out for some blood because the talent involved cannot be denied. The script can be very generic at times, yet glimmers of surprise come through every once in awhile. With a "twist" that may not be too well hidden, the carnage doesn't stay only with disposable roles like one would expect in a movie such as this. I'll just say that the stars aren't safe from knife work, nor a glimpse at their mortality. In the end, though, it is still nothing more than a good night out for some bloody fun. But, then, when did that become a bad thing?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Orphan is a horror thriller about a couple who decide to adopt a kid after having a miscarriage, so they decide to adopt Esther, a wonderful, talented and gifted child. After some bad things start to happen they eventually realize that there is probably something wrong with Esther. Telling you what's wrong with Esther would be a spoiler but I have to say it was the best twist I've seen all year and if anyone says that they saw it coming then they're lying. There's no way anyone saw that coming. Yes, the plot is extremely over the top and cliché for a horror film but I happen to think that the cheese factor really helps to keep this movie entertaining.I'm now going to talk about the performances in Orphan. The movie stars Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard who really are two of the best actors in Hollywood today. For this type of horror movie, you really wouldn't expect such respected actors. However, they really seem to be very into their roles, which is terrific and they were never over the top. It's even produced by Leonardo Di Caprio, so maybe it isn't just going to be a mindless horror film with terrible acting and it really didn't. Esther was played by 12 year old Isabelle Fuhrman. It certainly helps that she isn't a big name child actress, so that she is more believable and terrifying as Esther. Her Russian accent really adds to her creepiness. The things that she did in this movie were insane and hopefully she will be able to become a classic horror villain.Even though I enjoyed the movie, there were some parts that I laughing at the silliness of it. This is not a perfect movie and it has some major flaws. First of all, almost everything about this movie was extremely cliché and not entirely original. The plot of an evil child and bad seed was been done many times before and it's been done a lot better, such as in The Omen. There's a few scenes in the movie where a woman opens the mirror and no one's there, but when she closes the mirror someone appears and it's supposed to scare us. That cliché has been overdone to the max, to the point that it's not scary anymore. They did the same thing with a refrigerator and even used music. It was a very anti-climatic scare. The movie wasn't that realistic either. I don't actually think that they would have kept Esther for such a long time after all the bad things that kept happening. You have to just go with the movie, even if it's in a realistic world. Not everything is going to make sense and if you keep that mentality then you can enjoy the entertainment. The twist, however, was probably the most original thing about the movie as unrealistic as it may be. I actually knew about the twist before I saw the movie because I didn't think I was going to see it. I definitely regret that, but it didn't ruin the experience at all. If you can, don't find out the twist before you see the movie because you'll have a better time.Orphan is a very effective and delightfully dark horror movie that you should definitely try to see and it's just an easy way to escape from reality and be entertained for 2 hours. I'm going to give this an 8/10. You should see this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poison Ivy Meets Sleepaway Camp Meets The Good Son</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has to be noted that since Dark Castle began producing movies, the majority if not being a remake, has been judged purely on the basis of how flashy the visuals have been, two movie that spring to mind have been 'House Of Wax &amp; The Reaping.With this latest slice of Dark Castle horror, we find ourselves in what seems like unfamiliar territory, a movie which is neither a re-imagining or contain any sort of visual trickery, I say this, as I noted that Joel Silver was still at the helm as the main producer, and we all know that he likes his movies to appear on screen as big as like themselves.The story surrounding the family unit whilst not overly original does contain certain key elements that give the scenario some grounding, a distant husband, a wife/mother still coming to terms with the loss of her unborn baby, whilst still trying to remain resolute for her two already existing children, one of whom, a little girl who is deaf.The scene between the mother and daughter, when mother uses sign language to tell the story about the little girl ascending to heaven was quite touching.Of course this being a horror movie, the movie needs to gather apace, so luckily it didn't drag, so we the audience already know that the couple wish to add to their family by adopting another child to bring some form of harmony to the fold.At this point, the story structure takes shape, and we meet Esther, prim and proper and a dab hand with a paint brush, she can also carry a tune, albeit an old fashioned one, which when you see her initial appearance you can just imagine the way she carries herself both in terms of how she walks and talks.Of course such appearance can always be deceptive, and true to form, little Esther begins to carefully construct her ungodly plan for perfect family togetherness.As ever when I watch any horror movie, I always seem to find certain associations with other horror movies, in this case, the notion of a little girl being adopted made me think of The Good Son, remember when Macauley Culkin first let rip with the F Bomb? As for my Poison Ivy notion, I am not a fan of spoilers, but the scene where Esther dresses to impress and possibly seduce her adoptive father, whilst very uncomfortable to watch, it made me think of the Drew Barrymore original.As for The Sleepaway Camp Murders, remember the ending to that? Now that was a real jaw dropper too, So placing all those threads together, was the movie any good? Like I said before, the denouement was the biggest kicker, but it must noted that the acting by young Isabelle Fuhrman was quite something, she managed to convey all the elements of a femme fatale, from sweet innocence to sheer stark terror.With all the multiplexes currently showing the latest blockbusters, if you find yourself in the mood for a little late night chilling session, go check this one out.My rating is 7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those of you that like thrillers like "Single White Female," "Fatal Attraction," or "Audition," this is another shocker in the same vein. Although "Orphan" has some genuine thrills and scares, it made me feel a little unclean at times.When "Orphan" begins, we meet the Colemans: Kate (Vera Farmiga) and John (Peter Saargard), and their children Daniel (Jimmy Bennett) and Max (Arayana Engineer). After the stillborn death of their third child, Kate and John decide to adopt one. At the orphanage, they become enchanted with a little girl named Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman). At first, she appears the child from heaven: she immediately bonds with Max, and learning sign language to communicate with her (Max is deaf). But strange things start happening around Esther...This is what "The Good Son" could have been, had it been better written and acted. Yet, even though it rectifies the main fault I had with that movie (nothing the psychotic Macauley Culkin character did was really evil enough), that comes at a price. Children (specifically Esther) act violently in this film, and at times it crosses the line between suspense-building and unsettling. While I'll agree that having a child commit this crimes gives the film an extra punch, some (though not all) of the scenes left me feeling dirty and violated.Still, all in all, this is an impressive thriller. The most important part of a thriller is a good villain, and Esther is truly frightening. At age 12, Isabelle Fuhrman has quite the capability to scare the living hell out of anyone. She's right up there with Jennifer Jason Leigh and Eihi Shiina, or more applicably, Jacob Kogan from "Joshua," which coincidentally also starred Vera Farmiga. The other cast members acquit themselves well too. Vera Farmiga is in top-form as Kate, though she's been here before (in fact, she plays almost the exact same character as she did in "Joshua"). Peter Saarsgard, a talented actor from the independent film circuit, plays a type, but he does solid work. However, the script calls for him to be dumber than is realistically plausible, and Saarsgard can't make us believe that his character is really that oblivious. The child actors are great as well. Jimmy Bennett is solid in an unspectacular part of Daniel. He's not really excited to have a new sister, and his friends make fun of him for how Esther acts. But Arayana Engineer is perfect as Max. She's adorable, and although very young, Engineer draws our sympathy like a magnet. We never stop rooting for her.Apart from the amorality of some of the scenes, not everything that director Jaume Collet-Serra does works. He attempts to create scares where they have no place, and the failures of these elicited laughs from the audience. Speaking of laughs, there is a bit of humor in the film, and that works. However, one of the scenes is so over-the-top that it's unintentionally hilarious.I recommend it, if you've got a thick skin for this sort of thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a truly terrific film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the poster for this and was intrigued. I decided to watch and was pleasantly impressed. The gloomy, dark settings and the fact the family house was practically in the middle of nowhere gave the sense this was definitely a film to send shivers down your spine.And send it did. There were scenes where I couldn't watch; I hid behind my cushion because the little girl was that, well, scary. The fact she seemed so angelic but evidently wasn't was unsettling, what with her dark hair in pigtails and deep, disturbing stare.CCH Pounder was pretty good as the sister, Vera (not sure her surname) was definitely good as the wife, and I'll refer to him as a younger Kiefer Sutherland (let's face it, he was a bit of a spitting image) was also good as the disbelieving husband. I adored the lil deaf girl, who was too terrified to say or do anything, in case of getting hurt by who she thought was a delight as an older sister.I wont give anything away, but you have to watch this movie. If only for the shocking twist.Brilliantly acted, really worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best 'naughty little kid' movie I've seen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's something unnatural and haunting when we see children in film (or in any context) that abandon the ideal of innocence and virtue we're used to seeing in Disney movies. Still, we're compelled to watch as the children on screen defy our perception as they grab that kitchen knife or the sickle in the cornfield. I admit, it's a paradox that I'm always eager to experience. I've seen and enjoyed The Bad Seed, The Good Son, Pet Cemetery, Children of the Corn, and even the low-budget varieties like Milo and the recent Whisper.Orphan took an all-too-familiar concept and gave us something unique. I dare say that Esther will quickly earn her spot in the elite group of super-villains that have risen to legendary status. Yes, Esther is still haunting me the morning after, and that's extremely tough to do to me. I think the most terrifying element of this character is how angelic she appears. There are parts of the film where you actually don't want to believe she's evil. You start to have compassion for her troubled life as an orphan. Oh, Daddy Warbucks, how lucky you are to have a girl like Annie.The films greatest achievement is the character development. While most movies in this sub-genre move from kill to kill like checking off a grocery list, forgetting to allow us to connect to the cast, Orphan lets us inside the Coleman household, as we discover their most intimate histories and struggles. You understand and identify with every motive of each character. As the film presses on, the person you cheered for, you start to despise. And just when you start to despise them, you realize they still don't deserve what Esther has planned for them, and you begin to cheer for them all over again.The tension in the film almost never lets up. There are times we get to stretch for a moment, only to resume the position at the edge of the seat. As a chronic nail-biter, I was left with nothing but stubs by the end credits. As we long for just dessert to be served, the film steamrolls on, as evil continues to prevail. It's a torture that almost made me want to sneak into Aliens in the Attic playing on the other side of the wall. And after all the shouting at the screen, we realize we knew exactly what we were getting into. Well, not EXACTLY. Esther's secret hits us like a Shyamalan ending (pre-The Happening), and we soon fear the worst.Given the suspense, the character development, the great cinematography and transparent score, this is an excellent thriller. And it is definitely my favorite 'Kid Killer' movie, with the Omen at a close second. The only reason it's not a perfect '10' to me is because the plot, while done in a unique, refreshing way, is still a familiar one. Some scenes are more like carbon-copies of its predecessors than original thoughts. I also would've liked another five minutes of closure before the credits, but I'm still satisfied with the ending. This movie definitely made my wife and I think twice about taking home cute freckle-faced orphans. Hurry and see it in the theaters!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very well done under the radar genre flick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have some respect for Director Jaume Collet-Serra. He directed HOUSE OF WAX which turned into a Warner Bros attempt to cash in on Paris Hilton's 15 seconds. The movie could have easily been a train wreck of an epic magnitude, but instead turned out to be a respectable genre piece and I think should be considered pretty well when taken as such.THE ORPHAN Good movie. It is what I thought it would be, but that is mostly because of the positive buzz I've been hearing form from genre fans. (The filmmakers and studio must be psyched about this. Usually word of mouth kills horror movies.) The cast was excellent. One is likely to hear much ado about aged 12 Isabelle Fuhrman. Fuhrman was dead on creepy and had an honest but subtly consistent Russian accent that would put many Hollywood mainstays to shame. It appears that she is going to be in a remake of CHILDREN OF THE CORN, so we could be witnessing the birth of a new scream queen - or scream creep. It's a shame to type cast so early, but she was that good.This movie was very much Vera Farmiga's (The Wife) as well. She's a veteran actor that's seen some screen time in THE DEPARTED and a bunch of smaller movies and TV roles. I have to admit that I don't remember her from THE DEPARTED, but she did enough in ORPHAN to warrant a revisiting of some of her work. At aged 36, Farmiga is real world attractive and brings a convincing knack for nuanced method acting to the film. Her emotionally unstable and self doubting character is a sale right from the start and that wonderful vividness plays with kinetic appeal when joined by Fuhrman.The plot of the movie is not dissimilar from others in this sub-genre. What ORPHAN brings to the mix is well paced tension and some neat visuals by way of camera work and concept (the black light images were wonderfully malevolent). The seemingly single-shot playground sequence was inspired even though you probably know what's going to happen. The film seemed a little long and The Husband (Peter Sarsgaard) a trifling bit generic. However the climax is enough to make one forget that the film is pushing an hour fifty when it starts; and Sarsgaard pulls off several good scenes in the climax for a mini redemption.As a genre film, I would have to admit ORPHAN is a startling surprise from a movie that was not even in orbit around my radar. Even better, I would have to call it a pretty good movie all around. The movie has some re-baked ideas, but the recipe is different enough to keep it interesting and tasty!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a great movie, top to bottom. The acting is superb all around, especially Esther! For such a young girl she really sells the whole evil orphan thing just as well as the sweet innocent girl she pretends to be. The movie grabs your attention right from the start and keeps it for the entire length of the film.It's not, however, like "Omen" or other evil-child movies. It's not really even a horror movie as there's not a lot of genuine scares in it but it does keep a delicious high-tension vibe and a ton of fake outs. If you're expecting a jump-out-of-your-seat hack and slash horror movie, this isn't it but if you're looking for a drama that will raise your heart rate and make you bite your nails you won't be disappointed!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>enjoyed this movie. the orphan was a twisted demented thrill ride that made no apologize for it's content. a cross between child's play and single white female. i was hoping they would make a Charles lee ray prequel movie, and i think this movie was a taste of what i been asking for. i think the writers/producers of this film should consider making a sequel/prequel of this film documenting the parents of Esther, her birth, her upbringing etc. her story is far more to interesting to just have one film. besides they made 6 saw movies, need i say more. i would pay a million rubles to see this movie made. awesome, awesome, awesome. sucks that this movie didn't do well at the box office. just goes to show that the public isn't ready for an original idea.

		<shortDescription>An under-appreciated film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the previews for Orphan, I immediately decided I would not be seeing it. However, my mother asked me to see a movie with her recently and we don't spend much quality time together lately, so I agreed. Orphan has received some mixed reviews but I was very impressed. Some would think this is just another "disturbed child" movie, and they'd be wrong.Three things stood out most for me. First, the acting in this film is excellent. The main cast gave superb performances, especially Jimmy Bennett, Aryana Engineer and Isabelle Fuhrman. These children played their parts with perfection and have very promising acting careers ahead of them.Second, I've noticed that most horror/suspense films employ a tired formula. Characters tend to be very naive and lacking in common sense. But director Jaume Collet-Serra seems to have taken a more realistic approach, allowing the characters to be intelligent and resourceful without losing their vulnerability to the plights of the story.Lastly, this film is not what you would expect. (POSSIBLE SPOILER?) Orphan starts out as just another "troubled child" movie, but contains a shocking and incredible plot twist that certainly deviates from the norm.To sum up, this is not a film you should write off at first glance. I guarantee it will surprise and entertain you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two Hours' Worth of Scared</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Always looking for the next wave of "how will you scare me?," "Orphan" came through, seven stars worth. Not the typical indie I'd expect to see Peter Sarsgaard or Vera Farmiga engage in, their performances helped hold up the never-ending downward spiral and some of the cheaper chills of the film. I kept flashing back to Farmiga's "Joshua" flick from 2007?similar in that it's a kid-gone bad movie, but Orphan takes the cake.The film's twist fairly well pays off the orphan's (Esther) uncanny, KGB-like foresight and handling of the matters at hand, and the other two child actors perform admirably.I kept waiting for things to get better, for an intervention by SOMEONE who would believe Farmiga's Kate, but things just got...worse and worse. And the final confrontation(s) followed horror's standard, "fool me twice"...A great view for horror/thriller fans, and all done without a supernatural back story. I'll watch it again on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That is one twisted "kid"!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Excellent! This is way better than I had expected it to be. We always get a story about some crazy person that wants to kill an unsuspecting family but this one takes the cake. Try to imagine "The Good Son" (sans Macaulay Culkin) with the ferocity of "The Omen" and a little pinch of "The Crush". Catching the pattern here? There is no supernatural crap going on, which is what I expected at first. Esther is just plain psycho in all sense of the word. But I'll get to that in a second.I gave it an 8 because it was original in what becomes a big plot twist, while the action and story was well laid out. Its fast paced where it needs to be and dramatic in that same respect. Although the characters were all wonderful and the actors are great, the dad is a bit naive. That's not completely unreal, but it does get annoying that he trusts Esther over his own wife. I mean seriously.Isabelle Fuhrman is a stupendous actress in The Orphan. While the character Esther is smart, funny, overwhelmingly talented and a little obnoxious, its only a testament to Fuhrman's skills. For such a young star to pull off such a intense role is mind boggling. This is not a Disney channel kid... no... and hopefully, she's going to go far!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Serious script questions aside, The Orphan is a good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Orphan is a movie that uses an old theme. A scary kid who no one believes is evil is in fact the greatest threat to everyone around her. The idea has been used countless times and isn't too original. However, unlike those other movies, this one does stand out for the right reasons. A surprise hit of the summer, The Orphan is worth watching.John Coleman (Peter Sarsgaard) and his wife Kate (Vera Farmiga) are upscale residents who discover that their life is missing something. The miscarriage that Kate suffered earlier has left a hole that needs to be filled despite the fact they already have two children and wealth. Ignoring their own marriage problems that circle around Kate's alcoholism and John's past affairs, the two still want to continue the marriage. Deciding that a new child would replace the one they lost, and perhaps bring them closer together, they decide to adopt.Never explaining why they choose an older child to adopt, John and Cole reach out to a Sister Abigail (CCH Pounder) whose orphanage is home to older girls. There, they meet Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman) who appears to be a polite and intelligent child. Not only does she paint she can tell stories, sing, and more importantly, act as a young girl who desperately needs a home. If there was ever a stereotype orphan, Esther is it and John and Kate can't help but want her in their lives. She is everything that a parent would want and they quickly accept her into their family.Esther soon reveals a darker side though to her new brother Daniel (Jimmy Bennett) and hearing impaired sister Max (Aryana Engineer). Games take a dark turn and Esther shows a vicious side after killing a wounded bird. She then reveals an even darker nature after she forces Max to help her murder Sister Abigail after she attempted to check up on her. From there Esther descends further into the realms of madness and Daniel and Max both find themselves held hostage in their own home.Kate herself begins to notice that something is wrong. Instead of being the innocent girl they adopted, Esther becomes distant, cold, and eventually hostile. Kate is then convinced that Esther is hiding something despite John's refusal to accept such an idea. The family is slowly torn apart as Esther attempts to destroy everyone in her new family which leaves only Kate willing to stand up to her. The act of desecrating the flowers that honored Kate's lost child shows Esther's willingness to challenge her new mother. John's refusal to accept Kate's belief, however, only alienates her from her him. Kate is eventually forced into rehab after striking Esther after she accuses her of trying to murder Daniel. She finds that she soon has to face Esther if her family is to survive. When it is too late Kate, Daniel, and Max survive but at a cost that should never have been paid in the first place.The Orphan is a movie that excels in the use of suspense and plot development. However, the use of over exposed ideas such as "scary" music and sound effects, at times limit the effect of the horror. The serious problems exist around the plot holes that eventually develop. It seems hard to believe that a Esther, who was in fact a dwarf who spent time in a mental institute and was 33 years old, could pass herself off forever as a child. And why wouldn't John and Kate spent more time looking into her past? The adoption process itself seems unrealistic as if one could simply pick up a child in a matter of weeks without really understanding who the child is. And if Esther did belong to a mental institute, how could it be that she was so easily adopted first in her own country and then across the world? Ignoring the plot holes, The Orphan is still a movie that draws you in. Isabelle Fuhrman is an actress we will watch in the future. Her portrayal of a murderous adult whose delusions lead to the deaths of those around her stands out in a character who will be remembered. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Esther wants to be different but they play it safe instead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like "Joshua" in estrogen, "Orphan" not only shares its similarity with George Ratliff's thriller via featuring a precociously villainous juvenile, but also because it stars Vera Farmiga as a mother at the receiving end of her child's diabolical manipulations. Jaume Collet-Serra crafts a mildly diverting hybrid of "The Omen" and "Swimfan" though the proneness of David Leslie Johnson's script to adhere to cheap horror conventions undercuts whatever interesting psychological thriller about a gradually imploding family that stirs underneath.Played with vicious adequacy by Isabelle Fuhrman, Esther is blissfully welcomed into the Coleman household in a snowy middle-of-nowhere house. Kate (Farmiga), a former alcoholic still reeling from the death of their unborn third child, and John (Peter Sarsgaard), a husband with loyalty issues regarding his wife, nevertheless wholeheartedly accepts Esther as part of their family. Their adopted daughter is gleefully cordial, paints cheery images, eager to learn the piano, and -- for a nine-year old Russian who has just spent a year in the US -- speaks very good English. The mantra "too good to be true," however is slowly evidenced, as the titular daughter starts to react violently to school bullies and casually drops the F-bomb as if it were a customary lexicon for people her age.Embodied by John's imperious refusal to see something is wrong with the things around him to the point of being laughable, "Orphan" ultimately plays on overly familiar genre tunes that rely too much on foreseeable shock moments and questionable logic of its characters to deliver most of its scares. Collet-Serra, despite the obvious lack of faith that the material would provide the spooks without resorting so much to shock tactics, at least capably maintains an ominous aura that accompanies his villain's innocence largely through Fuhrman's calm, faux-Manichaean scowls and Oedipus cajolery, and Farmiga's gameness to provide her character with more depth than what it's actually called for. Yet despite being ultimately entertaining and having a potential to be more intelligent, it frustratingly pursues a well-trodden path with such earnestness. "There's nothing wrong with being different," remarks Esther early on. Strange, though, that "Orphan" doesn't share the same belief.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing, On the edge of your seat film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I went into the Orphan thinking I just paid a good $7 to see a film like, The Ring or One Missed Call. However to my surprise Orphan kept me guessing until the very end! Not only is this film extremely disturbing, it also hits all the necessary horror film quotas. The cast is phenomenal. Isabelle Fuhrman who plays Ester is amazing. She puts on a great show, and really lives in the characters feelings and emotions. You honestly fall in love with her character within minutes, but know there is something terribly wrong with this little girl. Both Kate and John (the parents) are in short, perfect. Not only do they drive the best cars, and live in the nicest house but they have big enough hearts to adopt after losing a child in the womb. Im not going to lie, I was extremely disturbed and grossed out with Kates dream which showed her racing to the hospital with baby Jessica in her stomach, and as she is being wheeled down the hall a pool of blood is pouring on the floor behind her. Then the images and the graphic detail of Jessica being literally ripped out, and the doctor handing her a bloody baby was one of the most disturbing thing I've seen shown in a movie in a REALLY long time. You have to feel bad for Kate, not only did she lose a child at full term, but her daughter Max is deaf. I felt a lot of remorse for both Kate and John while I began watching this movie, especially with the white roses. (Nothing to do with the film, but the characters names, Kate and John, ironic because there is a famous couple Jon and Kate Gosslin who are very well known and very successful)The movie was very well written and the secret behind Ester was GREAT! I was extremely pleased when I walked out of the theater, and am glad I didn't waste my $7 on another lousy horror flick.</fullReview>

The Hand That Rocks The Cradle (1992) Because it too has a female lead character who is 2 sided and lives with a family who she plans to destroy.

Hide &amp; Seek (2005) Because of a seemingly sweet little girl who starts acting funny, and a recently deceased relative. (The girl's mother in H&amp;S, and the stillborn in Orphan.) Also because it is revealed that De Nero has split personality disorder. So did Fanning in the last scene.These movies should be added to the recommendations section soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Orphan" is filled with adopted terror!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alright, the Summary title was a joke, if you have a problem with it, too bad. I went to see "Orphan" on the Saturday after it came out. The crowd was actually big, and they seemed to enjoy the movie as much as I did. Esther, played by Isabelle Fuhram did an amazing job playing Esther. She was dark, sinister, and evil! What more could you ask for in a child terror/horror movie? Vera Farmiga playing the mother, Kate, she was very convincing and her acting was on-spot excellent! She was so sympathetic, and me, along with the whole theater, when she slaps Esther, everyone clapped and/or cheered! The little girl Max, (don't know her name at the moment, sorry) was a very convincing actress and this was her first film! She was great! Every time she would even shake her head or give a reaction, everyone would "Awwww" because she was so adorable. Now, the twist was something I already knew before seeing this movie, which was a bummer, unfortunately. However, it did not ruin the movie at all for me because it kept me interested and kept me in suspense. Now, a few words about the people who are boycotting this movie: I understand that the movie sort of gives of a feeling that orphan's are evil little children, but this is a MOVIE! Stop whining. If you don't like it, it's not like you have to see it. This movie is still in theaters and will stay there! They are not going to stop production of this movie just because some people disagree with the concept. It's entertainment. Get over yourselves and complain about your own lives.I give Orphan an 8.5/10 Awesome film.One of the best of 2009.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well done movie...ending???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very satisfying movie, but it took way too long to get the story started...I love how the character development took place, and all the characters were well placed, and well acted, but something about the movie wasn't quite right, only because we have seen this genre before...I will not give away the ending but it was too neatly tied up for my taste...up to that? A well done movie with an absolute evil Esther doing things that are very unnerving, and you want to knock her around for awhile. There are a couple of holes that didn't get filled, but overall I would say go see it...It was a very entertaining movie, with some no named actors(not for long) and a good twist/plot. Also good to see CCH after the Shield!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Seed meets Play Misty for Me....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I shouldn't, I often like to read critic reviews before I go see a movie. The critics either went way low or higher than expected on their ratings, but they all seemed to describe themes throughout the movie that didn't seem to jive with what I saw. The two most common being that this film was unintentionally funny(dark humor) and that the "twist" was disappointing. First, I'm a huge fan of the Cohen Brothers and Tarentino, and I didn't see any "dark comedy" in this film. Second, I would not say the ending was truly a "twist" in the Sixth Sense type of way. Granted, from the outset, we all know something is "wrong with Esther"!! I more say the films ending is a "revalation" than a "twist".The movie centers on a couple (Farmiga and Sarsgard) who are struggling with the aftermath of a stillborn child. They decide to adopt an Orphan (fuhrman) and things go downhill from there. Farmiga is always solid and is no different here. She is believable as a recovering alcoholic, struggling with guilt that goes way beyond the death of her unborn baby. She has an exceptionally touching scene in which she uses sign language to read her partially deaf daughter Max(Aryana Engineer) a bedtime story. Sarsgard is sufficient as the overly naive father. And then there is Esther, portrayed quite powerfully by Isabelle Fuhrman. I have not seen her in anything else but this girl has got some BIG talent. The interactions she has with her "new" family are creepy and very convincing!! This is a well made horror/thriller that should not be compared to The Omen or The Excorcist, those movies where about Demonic Possession, this one is not. I would more describe it as "Bad Seed" meets "Play Misty for Me". ENJOY!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is what happen if Little Orphan Annie was remade as a horror movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen movies like the Good Son, Omen, and Children of the Corn. I'm clearly a fan of the 'Bad Seed' horror genre. I was really looking forward to this movie. In my opinion, it was pretty decent. The adoption community has a different opinion on it. They felt that the movie will turn away good couples from adopting children from orphanages. The movie got so much heat, that Warner Bros. edited the movie's trailer to remove Esther's line "It must be hard to love an adopted child as much as your own" after receiving numerous complaints from adoptive parents and foster care organizations. The line remains in the movie itself. I believe that the movie could hurt orphanages, but I also believe people can understand it's just a movie as well. Not all children are like that. The controversial story is about a couple, Kate (Vera Farmiga) and John (Peter Sarsgaard) whom are looking to decide to adopt the child. At the local orphanage, they find Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman), a gifted young Russian girl who loves painting and wearing old fashion dresses. They decide to adopt her, and welcome the child into their home to live with their other two children, Daniel (Jimmy Bennett) and Maxine (Aryana Engineer). After a while, Kate sees a bunch of danger signs in events that show that Esther might not be as perfect angel as she seems to be. Concerned for the safety of her family, Kate tries to get John and others to see past Esther's sweet facade. John is pretty clueless about not seeing the series of alarming events and in denial that Esther was the cause of it. At first, it seems realism to see how John cannot see the fact that Esther might be evil, but after a while, John should have started to have doubts and see through the lies, but no, he is pretty much oblivious closed-minded to everything that happening around him. Come on, writers. Not once, did he think, that Esther had anything wrong with her. It was shocking performance from newcomer Isabelle Fuhrman and she was able to make the audience to really hate her. In real life, Isabelle she is so nice in person but sometimes she still pulls that creepy stare. She was able to make a little girl pretty scary, and chilly. Still, there were some scene that supposed to be creepy that makes it a bit cheesy. I just don't believe in the whole turning on and off the night looking at the painting scene. The other girl, Aryana was just the opposite in her character, very sweet and tragic because all she wanted was a sister. Like her character, Aryana has a Cochlear Implant, which has improved her speech and hearing. She is not deaf, but a mild hearing loss. There was an agent looking for a little blonde headed girl that could sign and she was the perfect candidate! Another child actor that did well is Jimmy Bennett as Daniel. He was a bit annoying at first, but his character got better in the end. Too bad, the movie never explains what happen to his character in the end of the film. The movie seems to fail a lot of explaining. It seems like a lot of scenes were cut out from the movie due to rewrites. The movie never truly explain what happen at the pond, Kate's alcoholism and what happen to Jessica. In my opinion, it should have been more clarify. There were a bit of cliché in this film, like the bully who just like to bully, silly jump scares and the cheesy one liner in the end. The ending line was horrible, the minute the words left her mouth my immediate thought was the movie Ring 2 (2005). This movie seems very influence by 1992 film The Hand That Rocks the Cradle as well, except that here the psycho is not a nanny but a nine year old kid. The part where Esther freaks out in the toilet while her "parents" are discussing about her with the child psychologist is a direct mirror of Rebecca de Mornay freaking out in the toilet, smashing things up. About the doctors, when Esther gets the cast on her arm, you'd think the doctors would notice the scars on her wrist. It has enough Grand Guignol moments and scenes of sheer terror to make a quick killing at the box office even though it borrows from just about every other Bad Seed flick Hollywood has ever unleashed. Producer Leonardo DiCaprio also gave us a film that twist ending comes out of left field. It's a wonderful horror however, the twist is far too ridiculous to be taken seriously. There is also a Alternate ending to the film to check out. The Orphan brings a fresh and strong balance of dark humor, thrills, and storyline. However, some parts would work better if the movie was more spread out. If you like this movie, also check out the orphanage (2007). Altogether, it's a good watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent film dealing with a dwarf who passes herself off as a 9 year old. If that isn't enough, she is criminally insane and utterly wreaks havoc on those who take her in.Miss Fuhrman is excellent as the supposed 9 year old. As Esther, she can be charming, polite and well-mannered. Watch her develop into an absolute monster as the film progresses. She is so manipulative.The part I really liked was where the psychiatrist was totally taken in by this person. She actually blames the adopted mother for what is going on.The film highlights how out-of-country adoptions can be so very dangerous.The family is caught in a vicious web. This person will do whatever is necessary, no matter how bad it is, to attain her goals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great job by Isabelle Furhman; morally offensive storyline/message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Contains Spoilers* I have very mixed feelings about this movie.First the good points. Undoubtedly the best thing about this movie is young Fuhrman as Esther, who is more of a second main character rather than just an antagonist. She was absolutely charming, even mesmerizing. Her character easily commanded every scene she's in, from her literary speech (if sometimes convoluted in particular circumstances) to her dashing aristocratic appearance, to the various forms of art at her fingertips. Moreover, Esther was like a Renaissance girl, projecting rare values of intelligence, elegance, and artistic style.As to other characters, Farmiga as the mother was suitably neurotic and conflicted; Sarsgaard did well conveying the tired father clinging to rationality. The child actors were also good.The cinematography and music score did the job well, so the movie was solid in these respects (the burst of Tchaikovsky from under Esther's fingertips was particularly refreshing in this day and age). The visual style was brilliant at times ? the idea about fluorescent paint that glows in violet light (or whatever) was well-placed. The end credit sequence deserves separate praise. However, I wish the director did not resort so often to worn-out "thriller" clichés (mirror closed to reveal person standing behind, sudden bouts of nerve-grating sound etc.) which date back to Hitchcock, were cheap and trite 20 years ago and are just pointless today. I think the film would rather have benefited from a more subdued approach ? it would have more effectively emphasized the realistic violence, instead of putting the viewer into a cheap slasher flick mood.And now, the bad points.First off, the movie is politically and socially offensive. Abuse against adopted children, including those from Eastern Europe and Russia, is a serious problem. To make a movie depicting the adopted child as a horrible villain who inflicts injuries on herself just to incriminate the well-meaning, recovering alcoholic mother, attempts to sexually seduce the father and kill the other children, can be seen as an attempt to implant a suggestion that real-world domestic abuse aimed at adopted children is somehow "their own fault". Needless to say, this came off as terribly wrong, at least for this viewer. It's kind of like making a movie about a dark-skinned person who is a completely irredeemable criminal, but evades justice by exploiting his minority status. Except "Orphan" is even worse, because adopted children are probably the most vulnerable and defenseless members of our society. This wouldn't have been so prominent if the movie had been taking itself less seriously ? e.g. a plain horror or slasher flick. But this film tries hard to be "realistic" ? thus making its unrealistic plot line much more offensive.What makes it even worse, is that the DVD/Blu-ray come bundled with a public service announcement which encourages domestic adoption over foreign. This means that the vilification of foreign children (in particular from Russia and Estonia) was done ON PURPOSE and not as an oversight. It seems like the authors WANTED to portray foreign children as evil so that overseas adoption is discouraged. This sort of political agenda is just plain disgusting.I also didn't enjoy how the authors turned Esthel into a "sex doll" at one point. It was so pedophilic, and incestuous to boot. I don't know how the young actress felt (she was 12 at the time), but I certainly frown upon these instances of pedophilia and incest that sometimes make their way into modern movies. It just seems like blatant exploitation. Even movies like "American Dream" or "Lolita" (both versions) didn't stoop so low. And again it conveyed the meaning that if adopted children get sexually abused, it's their own damn fault. Not a highly moral message by any standards.Furthermore, the authors failed to develop their own premise. After ambitiously laying the groundwork (and offending the hell out of us in the process), when push comes to shove they bail out in a way that is both repulsive and disappointing. Suitable for a thriller, but not for a character drama the movie was shaping up to be. After milking it for all the exploitation they could manage, the authors abandoned the theme of child crime, instead taking the safe, if superficially "scarier", route. So, Esthel's not really a child, but a freak of nature, and promptly transforms from a beautiful young girl into a disgusting woman with bad teeth. Obviously just so that she can be killed without any moral controversy.1. Planted idea that adopted foreign children lie about being abused and in fact abuse themselves; 2. Planted idea that adopted foreign children are dangerous to their adopted families and everyone else; 3. Planted idea that recovering alcoholic mother publicly abusing her adopted child may actually have "good reasons"; 4. Exploited sexual perversions by putting a 12-year-old child actress into a "sex doll" and making her attempt sexual seduction of her adopted father; therefore also planting an idea that sexually abused adopted children have themselves to blame; 5. After the above was achieved, stopped and did NOT explore what could really happen if a child actually did turn violent, taking instead the cheap and easy "monster-of-the-week" way out.All-in-all, a majorly uneven movie. Great job by Fuhrman, solid acting by everyone else, adequate (and a few times excellent) cinematography and music are all undermined by a morally offensive plot, a finale that feels like a cop-out, and an extremely underhanded "message".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>wildest twist ending to any movie I've seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actually liked this movie. Just from the title, you expect some movie about a demon child, but there was more to it. Married couple, John and Kate, decide to adopt a girl after loosing a child. They already have 2 other kids, Daniel and deaf Max. They adopt, Esther, a Russian orphan whom is very talented and articulate. She loves to draw and paint and wear ribbons around her wrists and neck. We learn why later in the movie.Soon, Esther starts causing problems between Kate and John and she always seems to be present around accidents. The nun from the orphanage tells Kate about Esther's past being linked to many accidents and her last family dying in a fire. Soon, Esther starts being really evil and manipulating Max. Evan after trying to burn Daniel alive, John still gives her the benefit of the doubt, but Kate is on to her and starts investigating Esther's past from Russia. That's when she finds out the very surprising twist, that is just creepy. Especially, when Esther is in black with all the heavy make up, you knew something was up.FINAL VERDICT: It had some good scares, I recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe the scariest evil kid movie since "The Omen"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Good Son", "Joshua", "The Children"... I don't really have high expectation when it comes to evil kids movies. In my opinion, people are scared way too quickly by "creepy" kids. The plots of those movies are often stupid, the kids themselves underwhelming in their supposed creepiness. Director Jaume Collet-Serra, however, has managed to breathe some fresh air into the concept with last year's "Orphan".The movie isn't scary so much as it is thrilling. It's actually more in the tradition of films like "Night Of The Hunter" or "The Stepfather", in which an outsider joins a perfectly fine family and destroys it from the inside. Of course, in "Orphan" the new family member isn't a grown up, strong man, but an apparently lovable 9-year-old called Esther (played by the astonishing Isabelle Fuhrmann who jumps back and forth between cute and evil as naturally as if she was already an old veteran in the business).Sure, it's a story we've seen many times before, but Collet-Serra puts her own spin on it. She takes a long, but never boring time to set the plot up and fills every frame with atmosphere. The main characters are believable (for the most part) and played well by Peter Sarsgaard and the always great Vera Farmiga. On top of that, "Orphan" has a twist that I didn't see coming. Maybe it's got to do with the fact that I knew very little about the movie beforehand and didn't expect any twist at all. I still found it to be an enjoyable little extra to the end, and it's actually kinda creepy, too."Orphan" isn't anything special, but it's a more than solid thriller. For an evil child flick it comes pretty close to being a masterpiece. Just steer clear of making any sequels, please.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw the poster and pictures of this movie, along with the sinister title "Orphan", I thought it was just another C-movie, cheaply made, with no sense at all.Thankfully I read a little further on IMDb. Vera Farmiga and Peter Saarsgard? Those are real actors, not top of the A-list, but good. And a rating of 7.2 (as I am writing this) with over 7000 people rating it?Maybe this one, was different?And it was!The story is fabulous, the script well written. The cast is very good too, first and foremost the incredible Isabelle Fuhrman. Kid was 10/11 when they shot this, can you believe it? We are gonna hear big things of this girl in the future !!!Of course you get the genre-typical "Why did not anybody see that?" or "That's just not possible" moments once in a while. But those moments are never utterly made up, and the later revealed truth about Esther is a plausible explanation for most of them..I am very happy to have seen this, it's not often that I watch a horror-movie without regretting it afterwards. A well deserved 8 from me here, if you've not seen it yet, give it a try!</fullReview>

I figured if it did what I thought it was going to do and make adoption look bad I wouldn't be mad losing a dollar.I was amazed by this film. It actually shows the dark side of family life as it is today. A lot of families probably go through some of the things this family went through though not all at once.The girl who plays Esther did such a remarkable job I cannot wait to see her in something else.Although I wanted to strangle the parents through most of the movie for being such idiots in life and not deserving children to begin with it makes you think Thank god that isn't my family.Made me wonder how some people even get through the system and end up able to adopt. Those people should have NEVER been able to.GREAT movie though and the twist I NEVER saw coming. I thought this was just an updated version of the BAD SEED. But NOPE BAM! SHOCKER! Definitely a must see! I did see a family bring 3 kids who looked about 14, 12 &amp; 8. DO NOT BRING ANYONE UNDER 16 YEARS OLD. It is rated R for a reason people!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Orphan seems like a typical, cheesy horror flick. But it's not. It relies heavily on suspense rather than gore. There are a few gory deaths in the movie.The acting is well-done. Vera Farmiga plays the no-nonsense, take-no-prisoners mother. Peter Sarsgaard plays the clueless, loving father. Isabelle Fuhrmann plays the orphaned girl, and was really creepy,and CCH Pounder plays the caring nun.If you've seen the trailer for Orphan, you'll think that is a typical clichéd horror flick. But it is more than that, because it has a horrific twist, and a dark, eerie mood. Sadly, it didn't do that well at the box office because people chose to waste their money on watching secret agent guinea pigs and a clichéd romantic comedy.Overall, if you are a gore hound, you will be a little dissatisfied. If you are a horror fan who doesn't crave a cheesy, poorly edited PG-13 "horror" flick, then you will love this. It comes out on the same week as Halloween. When it does, rent it and watch it on Halloween night, turn the lights off, and you're in for a good, old-fashioned scare.Rating:8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have heard people complain that they don't want to see "Orphan" because it looks like a ripoff of "The Omen." I disagree ? I don't think "The Omen" has a trademark on the Evil Child Movie, and although there are a few similarities between the two, there are also plenty of differences to make "Orphan" worth seeing for its own merits.Granted, the script is pretty allusive. Take a generous helping of "The Bad Seed," a whiff of "The Omen," and ? dare I say ? a sprinkling of "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle," and you have some idea of the shape this movie takes. Yet it is so energetic and shameless that it somehow comes out fresh. For one thing, I'm pleased that the filmmakers have avoided the temptation to make a thriller about supernatural evil. After a handful of movies in which children can make terrible things happen with a flash of their eyes, it's refreshing to see one in which the demon-child simply shoves someone off a slide. This is, I think, one of the key ways that Esther distinguishes herself from Damien: Damien is a vessel, a medium of evil; Esther has her own agenda.I'm also impressed at how Jaume Collet-Serra handles tone here, especially considering that he directed "House of Wax," which had almost none at all. In movies like this that involve families in danger, filmmakers have to walk a fine line between scares and sentiment. To its credit, "Orphan" practices economy with its pseudo-drama, letting us care about the characters but never becoming waterlogged with tears.Reviews and trailers have handled the plot already, so I won't rehash it. I will say this about the twist, though: It's ridiculous, and I mean that as a compliment. Again, the film avoids the supernatural, instead opting for the absurd, which is more fun. That the writers would go for it is a final testament to the movie's shamelessness (Another example: The mother, realizing Esther has just tried to kill her son, lunges at her and belts her in the mouth. "You bitch!" she shrieks. That, along with a few other moments, got applause from the audience). I did get tired of seeing children singing and drawing scary pictures ? "The Ring" was the last straw for me, and I have no patience for those tropes anymore. But the movie is thrilling and somehow, in a way, "original" ? a good summer horror movie that, I have no doubt, we will be reminded of when Halloween comes. And just because I haven't said it yet: as Esther, Isabelle Fuhrman is very, very creepy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ORPHAN is very well made - well-directed and full of strong acting - especially by Fuhrman who plays the "little girl" Esther - you don't have a movie without her performance and it IS amazing. I am a big fan of THE BAD SEED and again - that is from a different time and rather dated but still chilling and fun and with a great evil kid. What I appreciated about ORPHAN was that it took time with the characters - especially the parents - so that when things start to snowball badly for them - you actually care. ****SPOILERS******* Now poor Saarsgaard has the thankless role of the non-believer - and this people are always irritating in horror movies - the last somewhat reasonable and logical person to finally open their eyes and "see" - and of course at the end of the movie he does some incredibly stupid things - yes, I know they have him drink a whole bottle of wine so he's "drunk" but even if I was smashed I would still go upstairs and grab my young daughter to protect her once I realized the adopted girl was dressed like a twenty dollar whore. But look - these movies are always a house of cards and you always need scares and drama and disbelief and for a 21st Century horror film - ORPHAN pretty much delivers. It's funny that Vera Farminga (sp??) also starred in a creepy bad kid movie a few years back with Sam Rockwell as her husband in JOSHUA - I like that film very much too but it is slower and truly NOT a horror film but a psychological drama about a disturbed kid and sibling envy and postpartum depression.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler is at bottom and noted before you get to it! I rarely write reviews so please know that taking a couple minutes to do this means that I very strongly want others not to waste their time as I just did. This movie took 90 minutes from my life that I will never get back. I watched it based on the good review of 7+ stars. This is the biggest disappointment yet from a well reviewed IMDb flick. Granted the acting was not bad, but it had every bad cliché of horror movies that is unappealing. I felt like ripping through the screen and shaking them all and saying "REALLY?" I couldn't wait for the movie to end and very much regret not watching it in fast forward. I guess I only have myself to blame for watching it through. I was hoping it would redeem itself in the end. No suspense, no surprise, and only frustration in how it all unravels. It was incredibly predictable, shockingly pathetic in (SPOILER!) how no one believes the former alcoholic mom that the newly adopted daughter is evil and wants to seduce the husband. I had to put on another movie now (even a really bad one as that's all I could find) to wash away the bad taste in the mouth left by this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only thing going into "Orphan" that we don't know is whether the movie is going to take to the supernatural or not. (Major Spoiler) In this case it takes the higher road in attempting to play it straight. Although, the movie would've been easier to flex the story and add in creativeness had the filmmakers elected the supernatural. Unfortunately the screenplay and dialog continue to bombard the cognizant viewer with gross liberties eventually stretching and finally shredding any kind of credibility or believability. The writing ends up propping up horrible common-sense to the point where characters are utter twits and pawns. The acting was fair, but by the end of the movie it doesn't matter - the movie is a failure - mostly a manipulative exercise with puppet characters devoid of intellect. This is the director and storytellers fault almost completely. Wasted potential.</fullReview>

I've had very little interest in watching horror films that have come out in the past couple of decades, as they're all virtually the same. Blood, sex, and no plot recycled with a new title over and over again. Orphan was different. Although from the beginning you don't really fall in love with Esther, you really have no idea until the tail end of the movie when it's revealed where she's really coming from. I really enjoyed this movie, and would give kudos to the girl who played Esther; she's got a bright future ahead of her.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A clever, twisted, campy and fun Horror film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Orphan could have played it one of two ways. Either a subtle, psychological suspense thriller or a campy, funny and very entertaining horror-revenge film. While it has elements of both, it mostly chooses the latter, and for that I am glad. While I do like some slow, creepy films, I always feel that when it comes to horror plots like these, we need to have fun. The screenplay does have it's amount of clichés, but it plays them out in such enjoyable and devilish ways that I did not mind. The film does have it's touching moments, and when it does, it is very effective, mostly because of Vera Farmiga. She gives a great performance here, adding a lot of heart and depth into this film, and adding a tone of seriousness. Isabelle Fuhrman is also very impressive, and her performance is wickedly enjoyable. Both of these actresses deserve some award buzz at least. Peter Sarsgaard is good, but his character really annoyed me to no end. I went off the rails when he did not believe Kate, but of course, it was all done for the purpose of the story. The film contains some decent amount of humor, which I loved. Some genuinely funny scenes in this film. The director Jaume Collet-Serra really knew how to play with this film, and how to give audiences what they wanted. The twist was WICKED! Of course, I knew it beforehand, since this twist is bound to be let out, but very clever twist. Orphan is a very entertaining, very fun thriller/horror that is more action and less suspense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this fine suspense/psychological horror film, an affluent couple in Connecticut decides to adopt a new child (she already has two children, one deaf, and has just lose her third in a miscarriage) and settles in an orphanage for a seemingly charming and very precocious nine year old Russian girl named Esther. Soon, though, the new member of the family shows a maturity well beyond her years and starts making terrible mischief with an escalating maliciousness that knows no boundaries, manipulating every member of the family to turn against each other and soon involving herself in real (as opposed to merely psychological) violence. Her adopted mother starts to suspect a terrible secret lies behind her. Eventually, things will escalate to murder. Well filmed (though there are too many false suspense moments) and especially well scripted, this movie has a final twist that I will not discuss here as not to spoil it to future viewers, but let me say that it is very nifty, it makes a lot of sense of what we just see before and puts this movie well above other run of the mill demon child stories. The performance by 12 year old Isabelle Fuhmann as an evil woman hiding inside a 9 year old girl is just mind blowing. Vera Farmiga, as the troubled mother seeing with impotence how this girl from hell is breaking her family is also fine.</fullReview>

The main question of if "Esther" was not who she was believed to be, what was her motivation, was answered in one sentence towards the very, very last part of the film. There never seemed to be any motivation behind her bizarre actions. It didn't add up to anything along the way and I found myself losing interest very quickly.To me, the only good parts were the very beginning and the character "Max." Aside from that, it was not the good psychological movie thriller I thought it was going to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You'll wish the ending was not so laughably absurd</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the loss of their third child, Kate (Vera Farmiga) and John (Peter Sarsgaard) still want to have a child and decide to adopt. They want a girl, and after a visit to a local girls' orphanage, decide on the nine-year-old Russian Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman). She seems to know a lot for a kid her age, and acts more incredibly polite and proper than anyone could ever expect. But as strange and bizarre things begin to occur, Kate begins to think Esther is not exactly who they thought she was.For a movie as standard sounding and looking as Orphan, I was expecting a predictable movie with a few scares. I was told the ending well before seeing it, but even with expecting the twist, I still was fairly impressed by just how well done the film was. The film manages to work in solemn reverence of films about evil children that have come before, but adds its own stroke of frights and excitement. It aims to be bizarre and horrify, and it mostly manages to pull this small task off. The storyline stays consistent until the ending, adding layers of baffling questions on top of each other. We really feel for Kate as her whole moral fabric begins to fall apart trying to figure out Esther's past, and we really learn to hate Esther for all the games she keeps playing with the family.But then the ending comes, and it feels like a bullet train collided with your brain head on. I was prepared for the most unlikely twist I have ever heard, but knowing does not nearly prepare you for how laughably ludicrous it is. It just comes as so unlikely, so unpredictable and is played out so silly that you realize why it is so unique and why no one even bothered to think of it before. The only reason it works the way it is, is because of how original an idea it is, and how totally unexpected it comes after watching the rest of the film. I can only imagine how baffled people who knew nothing about the ending felt after the twist was revealed. It is not as earth shattering an event as finding out who Keyser Soze was in The Usual Suspects or the real relationship between the Narrator and Tyler Durdan in Fight Club, but it does make you briefly want to reconsider everything that happens in the film up to that point.In a way, the out-of-left-field ending actually ruins the film. Up to that point, it is a tense thriller that manages to disturb in ways few films can (with its surprisingly obscene violence and fairly enigmatic villain). But after that point, it just descends into being ridiculous and borders on self parody. I realize the effect the filmmakers were going for, but it just transcends into not being anywhere near as worthwhile an idea as it should. The audience should be mortified by the truth, not paralyzed into laughter. Even with the events that come after the big reveal, all you can do is laugh at what the movie quickly becomes. While I cannot really think of any better way to end the film, it just seems so off-putting letting the filmmakers get away with something so preposterous. It is the worst kind of cheat; one that does away with anything the film had going for it. And for a low key horror film like this, it makes for a truly disappointing final product.The film is not all triumph before the ending. While I enjoyed the slow build of revealing the secrets of how troubled the family was prior to Esther's adoption, the entire plot line of Kate trying to figure out Esther's past is a bit hit or miss. Watching everyone doubt Kate over and over again got a bit tedious, and got rather annoying after awhile. Watching the kids act out of fear for their lives was great, but watching the adults otherwise completely ignore their outright cries for help (sometimes literal cries) was nearly as silly as the ending. The film manages to wrap itself so well that these little tidbits just work against it deeply.Farmiga and Sarsgaard work fairly well together, delivering believable performances as a couple in crisis. On his own, Sarsgaard spends a lot of time basically going through the motions, giving the expected responses without an immense amount of emotion for the most part. This is a little disheartening to note, as Farmiga is a force to be reckoned with throughout the film. She has not been on the Hollywood scene for long, and has already acted in a similar evil child film (Joshua with Sam Rockwell), but she really proves her chops here. She rises above the material, looking every bit as worn and tired as her character is. It takes awhile to learn just what is wrong with her, but it is worth every moment you wait simply to see how she reacts to what happens.The children fare even better. Jimmy Bennett does a great job swapping tones and body language, and Aryana Engineer is simply magnificent as the deaf-mute daughter. Really impressive work here on the filmmakers' part by adding in a significant emphasis on the use of sign language by the characters (and totally muted scenes). But Fuhrman is the reason to watch the film. This twelve-year-old delivers the scariest child performance in a long time, and is reason enough to watch the film. She just has an aura all her own that makes every moment she pops up more memorable than the next. If she does not get more work because of this film, then there is simply no justice left in the system. The film may become a train wreck, but watching it get there with Fuhrman in control is the only way it stays watchable.7/10.(Portions of this review originally appeared on http://www.dvdfanatic.com).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, First of all this is one of the best thriller I've ever seen since The Original Ring movie (don't mention to Ring 2, it is simply not a good sequel). Orphan got almost everything that a good thriller must have, it is edgy, dark, well-written and even twisted. While watching the Orphan first time you probably consider it as an ordinary thriller at the beginning but it is so cleverly scripted movie that after the first half of the film you will easily find out orphan is one step ahead of its peers. Besides, Isabelle Fuhrman as Esther and Vera Farmiga as Kate Coleman were absolutely fantastic, they had remarkable performance.In addition to scenario and acting, I also loved to ambiance Jaume Collet-Serra created. In conclusion, Orphan is a must-seen movie even if you're not a big fan of horror or thriller genre, that movie will make you surprised, uneasy and mindful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two thumbs up -- and a third one if I had it! "Orphan" was an incredible mixture of suspense and thrills, executed beautifully and maturely by the well-picked cast. Like many people, I tried to guess what was going to happen throughout the film, but was pleased to witness a unique plot that kept me on the edge of my seat.The actors were superb, making "tired" roles seem new and exciting. There was not a dull moment in the film, although the movie is longer than most of its kind, and I was delighted to encounter surprise after twisted surprise. I would not recommend a young audience due to the graphic violence and dark nature. Everyone else, though, should check this out A.S.A.P.!The biggest surprise of all is that this movie didn't get the publicity it deserved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After years of pointless slasher movies that like to pass themselves off as horror, and movies about haunted houses that couldn't scare a child, I was hesitant about seeing orphan, but after the almost two hours I spent at the theater I can gladly admit, this movie was money very well spent. Its a clever blend of deep psychological thriller, with the right amount of horrific detail to leave you on the edge of your seat, horrified at what you have just seen, but begging for more. What can I say about Esther? The young actress who played her, will most certainly be winning Oscars in years to come, for a young girl of 12, she acts with the experience of someone 2 or 3 times her own age, delivering some truly memorable lines and some horrific scenes. Her portrayal of Esther is chilling, memorable, and believable, much like the movie itself. The first scene sets the tone for the movie, giving just enough insight to what has happened, while not dwelling forever on what will happen, and then the story progresses seamlessly into the main plot. The plot advances on a slowly moving, but well timed frame, and every scene sets up the next perfectly. The end comes right on cue, not too early or late, with the right amount of suspense to keep you on the edge of your seat. Do not hesitate, get to this movie now, and be prepared for the best horror thriller suspense movie since 1995.</fullReview>

With the cold steel nerve of a mafia hit-man to the cuteness of "little miss sunshine", she was a great "bad guy". The movie was well done, the sound was excellent, and the music very powerful. Normally, I hate kid actors, but on every level, this movie was extremely well cast. Of course, the "twist" is fantastic, but that is not really the heart of the movie. As others have written, this movie is about character, and each character is well developed. The dynamics between them are real and the problems hey suffer are genuine. The kill scenes are very well done, and the girl who plays "Esther" is the best actress I have seen in years. Definitely not for kids though.</fullReview>

Other than that This is a great date movie...In any case, Isabelle Fuhrman, as Esther, steals the show. The more we learn of Esther, the more we realize how much this child actress brings to the character's moment-to-moment responses and interactions. Esther is not just a piece of work, but a detailed piece of work. Fuhrman injects nuance into this portrayal, as well as an arch spirit. This is the best spooky-kid movie of them all...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been a long time since I've watched a horror or thriller that I didn't just laugh at. Until now. Orphan made me forget about the silly modern nonsense that is Wrong Turn, these hills have eyes, and the excessive gore-fest that is Saw.This movie is an old-school style horror, presented in a modern way, and it does it very well. Esther just reeks of terrifying sanctimony right from the introduction of her character. Her politeness, facial expressions and tone, were just absolutely perfect in creating the ultimate evil little "good girl".The Father character in this movie seemed excessively ignorant, but in a way that actually brought me more into the movie. I was yelling warnings to the father at my TV screen the same way my Dad used to yell at his team during a Hockey game.The twist ending at the end was just absolutely brilliant and original. My Wife's first comment was "OMG, That movie just seemed so real, I'm so scared". Everyone that I watched this movie with felt there was an unusual level of realism in it, and felt at least that the twist revealed at the ending, is actually at least somewhat possible, which of course, scared them even more.ORPHAN was simply fantastic, especially compared to most modern horror or thriller movies these days.BRAVO!</fullReview>

It's the story of a Mother and a Father who decide to finally adopt a child. They already have children of their own, but they decide to want to adopt. So they came out of the Orphange with a girl called Esther. Cute girl, well mannered, but little do they know there's something very wrong with her. For example, injuring school bullies, threatening to kill people etc. The direction was great and the story builds itself nicely into a nice unexpected twist.Great thriller movie and i recommend it to anyone who likes this sort of thing! :)</fullReview>

What I specially loved about this movie is how well written and orchestrated it was. It all made good sense while it kept you on your toes guessing what was going to happen next.

		<shortDescription>Exceptional Thriller with a Deceptive Conclusion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kate (Vera Farmiga) and John Coleman (Peter Sarsgaard) are rebuilding their marriage after a troubled relationship, since Kate had drinking problem but is under therapy with Dr. Browning (Margo Martindale) and has been sober for one year. Her addiction cost her job; a serious accident with their deaf-dumb daughter Maxine (Aryana Engineer); and the abortion of their stillborn baby Jessica and John had a love affair ten years ago. They decide to adopt a child and when they meet the nine year-old Russian girl Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman) at the St. Marina Orphanage, they immediately fall in love for the well-educated orphan. Max becomes close to Esther while her reluctant brother Daniel (Jimmy Bennett) does not welcome his newcomer stepsister. Sooner Kate feels that Esther is manipulative and has some disturbance and she believes it could be hormone or borderline personality disorder but John refuses to listen to his wife and the wounds in their marriage reopen. Kate calls Sister Abigail (CCH Pounder) in the orphanage and the sister advises Kate that Esther had been involved in many troubles in the past. When Sister Abigail visits Kate, Esther kills her with a hammer and is witnessed by the scared Max. When Kate goes further in the investigation of the past of Esther, she contacts the Saarne Institute, a mental hospital in Estonia, and discovers that the girl is not who she tells she is."Orphan" is an exceptional thriller and a must confess that while watching this movie, I committed the heresy of comparing it with "Rosemary's Baby" to my daughter. Unfortunate the commercial deceptive conclusion is an exaggerated collection of clichés. Kate calls the police while driving back home and hits the house with her car, in the beginning of a sequence of ridiculous scenes. The police arrive late in the usual cliché. Max shoots a gun in the lake nearby the house and no policeman listens. With an appropriate and realistic ending, this movie could have become a new classic of the psychological horror genre. Vera Farmiga has another fantastic performance and Isabelle Fuhrman and the débutant Aryana Engineer are awesome. It is amazing the lack of imagination of formulaic producers, writers and directors that prefer an easy solution with the usual clichés for an intriguing plot instead of daring in an non-commercial ending, like for example, Asians usually do. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "A Orf?" ("The Orphan")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen a good horror/thriller film in a while and this movie kept me on the edge of my seat the entire ride, the plot was fairly realistic and even more so when the clever plot twist is thrown in at the end which ties the whole thing together. Excellent acting from the Isabelle Fuhrman playing Esther the orphan girl. She played her role well very mature for her age and sweet and innocent when need be... I think the comparisons made to Natalie Portman's performance in "The Professional" and Kirsten Dunst in "Interview with a Vampire." is very accurate. (As stated on her IMDb biography trivia page). I wouldn't recommend this movie for younger audiences there was a lot of violence and it was a scary movie with a couple of sexual scenes in it but I will say it did have a twisted sort of "happy"-ish ending where it didn't leave me feeling depressed about the way things turned out but it wasn't some unrealistic everything is cheery either. Overall thumbs up!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly entertaining, shocking twist ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a world where horror movies have pushed the gore dial to 11, there is little that shocks and scares anymore. This film has scary in spades. Visually, of course, there are your standard creepy fare; large foreboding house, children that should have been named "ominous" and tension building soundtrack. The psychological thrill from this movie however, comes from the fact that the child actors performances are all 10s. This isn't a case of Star Wars: Episode I, far from it. Esther (played by Isabelle Fuhrman) is deeply engaging and complex. Of course we know the premise of the movie, she is evil! But rather than take the easy way out and use music and creative editing to hint at her intentions, the acting stands all on its own.Some friends and I went to see a sneak preview yesterday and we were not expecting much. When we were an hour into the film, everyone in the theater was engaged with the plot. The script makes you feel for all the characters, even Esther. Each member of the family has some kind of vice that fits perfectly into the story, and getting the audience up to speed with the family's current problems was done effortlessly. And to round out all the frights, there's plenty of laughs to keep the mood from getting too dark.All in all, a very well balanced, highly entertaining and unique film. You will be telling your friends about it for hours. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I only have 1 word for this movie...WOW!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie can only be described in 1 word: WOW!!! Finally a horror movie that is original, and not a remake of classics or foreign films. Whoever rated this movie a 1 to me are just complete morons. Even if if you didn't enjoy it, it Definitely did not deserve a 1. This movie contained suspense, superb acting, and a fantastic script. I neverthought children at that age can act so realistically. The movie's twist is up there with the ending of Saw and Sleepaway Camp. If you are looking a great roller-coaster ride watch this. Do one of the two things: either watch in theaters or wait till it comes out on DVD and watch on a big screen with blue ray. For those of who compare it to the Omen, I don't agree. As far as the genre and plot, if anything it is closer to The Good Son but better. Can't wait for the Blue Ray DVD. Two thumbs up for the girl who played Esther AND the little girl who played Max.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror fans might enjoy it. Personally, I was happy to leave this dreadful experience behind me.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I *hate* horror movies. Not only do I generally detest the celebration of violence - those movies also quite literally bore me to death. So this review might not be exactly biased. I fear that much of what follows applies to horror movies in general rather than this one in particular. Which in a sense makes it unfair to punish this specimen with a 1 out of 10 and at the same time spare all the others. Still, I'll do my best to describe the issues I had with *this* horror movie. And I hereby promise to award each and every similar movie the very same rating, should I be forced to watch it.Honoring a long-standing tradition in this genre, "Orphan" introduces us into a picture perfect world and acquaints us with a bunch of realistic characters we are supposed to care for and identify with. The aim, of course, is to eventually destroy this world, and ultimately us, as cruelly and completely as possible. And here's already my first complaint with this movie - the introduction drags on forever! I mean how long can you stretch out a plot like "rich family decides to adopt an orphan child"? Do I really want to spend my precious time watching ordinary family life unfold in a snail-like pace? Half an hour into the movie, I start wishing I hadn't drunk that coffee, so at least I'd able to take a decent nap.But we know something is going to happen. We know, because once in a while, something scary takes place. We might see the husband's face appearing in the mirror, or a random kid passing the screen from right to left. You don't think that's scary? Just make the scene a real quiet one, then hit the audience in the face with a sudden, deafening outburst of sound and you'll see them jump in their seats every time. The oldest trick in the book, but that doesn't keep director Collet-Serra from exercising it on us again and again and again.Or the revolutionary "approaching camera". We see John from behind, the shaky hand-camera quickly drawing closer and closer, his vulnerable back exposed, the music tensely ascending, now - CUT! - the actor turns around and sees... nothing. Wow. In the end, naturally, there is this persistent villain who just won't die. Which is rather annoying, to say the least, because really, at this point, I am longing to leave this dreadful experience behind me and start doing things more fun. Like that root canal my dentist has been urging me to have.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One word-moronic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There comes a point when people should be banned from making movies. When you make an atrocity like "Orphan", there is no redemption. I really don't know where to start. Maybe with rich, endlessly irritating main characters who deserve whatever they got, or with the plot that has hole after hole and nothing to show for it. Or even better, sickening flirtation with child pornography,and mindless, suspense less violence. People are entitled to make a mistake or make a bad, even awful movie. What they are not entitled to, is this perverse exercise in pushing the boundaries without consequences. This is a shameful piece of garbage not even worth a second glance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How is this piece of crap at 7.1? Did we watch the same movie? I absolutely hated this movie. Hated it. Hated it. Hated it.First off, the performances are pretty good.That's the only thing that I really liked.The film starts out alright. It's an interesting, if familiar premise. First off, this film is not frightening. It's not scary. It's not thrilling. It's just dull. The last 30 minutes are just your typical mindless horror flick. It also has a lot of classic clichés, like how nobody ever listens to the main character even though (s)he is always right. Then it ends with one of the worst endings that I have EVER SEEN! The ending makes no sense, it's offensive, it's unnecessary and it's just stupid. In fact it's laughable. I was seriously laughing when the twist was revealed. It's so ridiculous. How could anyone take this film seriously after the twist? I guess you people saw something that I didn't. I still hated this garbage. No better than your typical slasher film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Russian orphan being all alone in the world... with darkness around.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**** May contain strong spoilers ****This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.When I heared about this just some time ago, I immediately thought of the single of the rock group TOTOs latest album XIV, called "Orphan". Magnificent and wonderful track! Anyhow.... this is something else.... oh, well.... to the movie.Got onto this story and motion picture with kind of high expectations. Two things that really got me almost directly; a little forced script and lame acting. The things: the nun says goodbye to the family and then all of a sudden needs to go outside and wave when the family is just metres from her? Typical bad directing, script and acting... it is separated from how the social behavior use to be. Nr. 2: the father neglects the sons achievement of Rock guitar all of a sudden in that manner as he has done it for years... and the situation is all new. Nr. 3: The mom and her mother speaks in the kitchen. They speaks around something and all of a sudden A.A.- meeting comes up. And then...just to clarify too much, she has to say that she's stopped drinking and things like that....? Like that were an enigma with A.A.-meetings? Nr. 4 : Oh no..... the boy in the family starts to bully his own sister? Even if she is an orphan and is separated from the rest of the family in that matter, this is just too much... builds up to an ordinary "oh-a-little-cute-child-turns-out-to-be-like-a-demon" movie. Nr. 5: Oh, come on..... one meeting with a professional psychiatrist and Esther has tricked her senseless? This is just too much! This is ridiculous! Nr. 5:Realllly bad acting and directing... about 1 hour and 3 minutes into the movie. Saarsgaard.... please.... you have to push the director to push you further! Nr. 5: A father almost harasses his newly becoming daughter by saying "You're not scared, are you!?", when Esther is going to the dentist? I have to say that by now this movie have to rise like a Phoenix to be good! Nr. 6: The father has accepted and convinced himself that Esther is just misunderstood and all things is just accidental. All of a sudden in less than five minutes he leaves all that and says straight to Esthers face "You are so confused" and "I have to quit this now!". From 0 - 100 in five minutes?This could have been an splendid movie. With the ending this stops by little more than approved.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Well made as normal standard for an American "almost good movie". The blood and shatter is a little off here and there. - The actors : What can I say... sometimes Esther is rolling on her Russian accent with "thunderous" R:s, and sometimes she speaks almost like a full blown American. Well.... I think this is kind of bad. - The story : Little angel girl turns out to be a human demon. Heard it before.... seen it before... bought the t-shirt. - Entertainment : Some entertainment. Almost just waited too see how much terror Esther could drive in and between the family members. - Age : 155,1 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 6 Nice production. Good movie. 5 Approved.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A couple grieving for their stillborn baby decide to adopt an older child and furnish her with all the love that they had for the baby. The premise is an interesting one for a horror-thriller, and Orphan does hit a few highs. Isabelle Fuhrman is quite disturbing as Esther, and not just because of her chilling performance. There is something manipulative and dysfunctional about casting a 10-year-old child as a woman looking to seduce her adoptive father, and using explicit sexual language. Yes, it is acting, but does the actor have the maturity and worldly experience to give informed consent to taking the role? Vera Farmiga is excellent as the protagonist mother, battling more than one demon. There are some jump-out-of-your-skin scares, and the reveal of Esther's true nature is nicely paced. But the film struggles and fails to get over some gaping plot holes. Why would parents grieving for a baby believe adopting a 9-year-old would be a salve? Why would they not consider their existing two children in this discussion? What authorities allow an alcoholic to adopt? Peter Sarsgaard as the husband sleepwalks through a role that is basically a dolt. Even when his son's tree-house catches fire and his son is in ICU he refuses to consider any plausibility in his wife's theory. No wonder his wife drinks if she has had to put up with this unaware idiot for so long. In sum, not a terrible example of the genre, but not an outstanding one either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite the clichés, one of the better evil kid movies I've ever seen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watched this in theaters in the summer of 2009, w/ an ex-friend, and to start off, let me say, whoa! I expected a female clone to the Good Son with Macaulay Culkin, and even though I liked that one too, this one comes out on top. Granted, there are a few clichés-inept therapists, naive husbands, the only real annoying ones imo. Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard do a good job as adoptive parents, although she's a lot smarter than he is after certain incidents begin to occur. But, when the twist is revealed, your mouth may drop to the floor, mine sure did! The movie does drag a little, but the twist is well worth waiting for. Vera and Peter's children, esp. Max, the deaf/mute girl, was phenomenal and adorable. The R rating is very well chosen, not just for the violence, but also for the sexual content, which I didn't entirely expect. This film, though very well scripted and acted, is not for kids, under the age of 18. Trust me on this!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has a great plot. It starts out a little slow, but it definitely picks up. The creepy scenes were VERY creepy! I rarely see anything in movies that I find TRULY creepy, so I just can't emphasize that enough. I wish there had been more creepy scenes, but that might have been over kill. There is some really good acting too. You notice right away how talented the main character is, but the deaf little girl is good too, acting only w/ her facial expressions. The mom was very believable as well. I like the way that the audience is introduced to (and gets to know) the family. It has a realistic element. It also has a few laugh-out-loud parts. And I REALLY like the fact that things are not overly explained. Sometimes obvious things will be told (and re-told) to a movie audience as if we wouldn't be able to pick up on it otherwise. This movie has its subtleties w/o being confusing or hard to understand in any way. It's a great movie all around. I highly recommend it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chilling psychological horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Orphan is one of those kind of movies that subdues your attention at a slow pace. Initially it doesn't feel like a exciting watch however as the movie reaches towards the three quarter hour point, one immediately begins to care about the characters. The interactions and goings on makes one watch on in curiosity. Upon viewing, movies like 'The Omen' and Poison Ivy' will come to mind instantly. However what makes this unique is the central character 'Esther', played by Isabelle Fuhrman. The role was intelligently written and I really think it's open to debate whether a girl can really pull a older aged woman across the ground. But the suspension of disbelief is required if one wishes to enjoy what they're watching. Her character is not an individual to be taken seriously. But if the logical elements are ignored, it turns out to be a enjoyable experience. Many would perceive this to be a horror movie. But I feel it's more near to psychological horror. Suspenseful and thrilling moments are endless. There is a lack of horror-struck moments. But there are a few occasions where many situations appear so suddenly in the first half when Esther begins to have conflicts with the family members. The pace picks up gradually when she begins to physically hurt and even murder people.The writing and performances makes the movie special. The combination of them is fabulous. Every character is well developed so that the story unfolds interestingly without becoming routine and repetitive. Vera Farmiga is a versatile actress. She so easily manages to gut under the skin of any character, whether it be a mother, wife or even a psychologist. But the real hero of the movie is child artist Isabelle Furhman. Her portrayal of the adopted Russian girl is so convincing that it sends a shiver down the spine. The character was very well developed. There are many shades to her. Her every expression and verbal dialect appears so real at times that it makes one wonder that in real life she may have the mentality of a adult at such a young age.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A big surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I settled down to watch this film I really wasn't expecting much but I came away after an entertaining 2 and a half hours actually a little unnerved.I felt that this film delivered on all counts as a well- made psychological thriller.The plot is simple. A couple (played by Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard) who lost their third child due to miscarriage decide to adopt a little girl called Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman). Initially everything is fine and although Farmiga's character was an alcoholic and Sarsgaard's character had previously cheated, the family is stable and Esther seems like the perfect little girl. However, as time goes on we see that Esther has a rather violent dark side. I shall say no more. The film, although not downright scary, creates a masterfully creepy atmosphere with aid of a good score and competent directing. The film is somewhat of a slow burner and gradually reveals more and more of Esther's evil nature. The acting is good and a cut above the usual quality that you see in similar films. Vera Farmiga, who has built up an impressive portfolio including 'The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas' and 'The Departed' (both very good) gives a great performance as a recovering alcoholic and grieving mother. The acting from Isabelle Fuhrman, as Esther, is particularly impressive and she creates a character who I really did despise. In a small role (which was a shame) CCH Pounder did well (as always). My only complaint is that Peter Sarsgaard's character was rather boring and didn't really stretch him as an actor. I think he is a very competent performer but would somebody please give him some good roles (I mean 'Knight and Day' and 'The Green Lantern' just weren't worthy of his talent). Certainly the film is unbelievable and the twist (which isn't really a twist as such and certainly doesn't make you sharply inhale a breath and go "Oh my God")is nothing to rave about. Also, I was not a particular fan of the ending. I feel the film would have had more of an impact if Esther had managed to get away. Nevertheless, the movie is both well directed and acted and achieves something which similar films often don't - it's not laughable. In fact, quite the opposite.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know, I wouldn't necessarily categorize this film as a "horror". Why? Because unlike nearly all other "horror" flicks, this one takes you deep into the story and it's characters.The story has depth, and there is such a good back-bone to it. Everything about it is extremely well done. It isn't just some stupid new slasher, or lots of blood and gore "because we can" type of attitude. No, "Orphan" should be an example for all horror movies to follow, because frankly if they aren't this good (as "Orphan") the point of making and/or watching them is just downright stupid and pointless.Only sad thing is, if your not a fan of horror, you might turn away. But honesty, this is such a good film. Scary, yes. But amazingly well done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kate and John Coleman are attempting to rebuild their marriage. They recently lost a baby, and adopt a 9-year old girl called Esther. Both parents, along with their deaf daughter, Max, instantly fall in love with Esther. She appears very well educated. Kate starts to fell that Esther is psychologically disturbed, while John takes no notice. Kate looks deeper into Esther's past, and realises that she isn't the young innocent girl she appears to be.The director, Jaume Collet-Serra, successfully created this film to be chilling and to thrill the viewer. The good thing about this film is that it is about a regular families life, turned to hell. Simply about a wife, husband, son and daughter, with the addition of a mentally disturbed child.This film isn't some badly rated film, it is rated R for a reason. It is very disturbing at parts, and gets quite gruesome. The basic plot is great. The film also contains several sub-plots which work well. "Orphan" isn't too much or too little. Perfectly structured.All the actors played their individual parts very well, but my favourite character was Esther, played by the fantastic Isabelle Fuhrman. Her performance was fantastic. Every move she makes being perfect. Fuhrman is one of my top favourite actresses in the world, and this film proved that even more.There is a twist at the end, making it even more surprising. I give it 9/10. Full of horror, thrills, chills and gore. Amazing!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a movie about a couple that have two kids and lost one in labor, after that tragic accident they want to adapt the third one. The third one they choose is a 9 years old girl from Russia, she is so talented and so mature for her age, she always acts like a princess, she always wears some ribbons on her neck and on her wrists, but after a while some bad things happens, a girl that hurt her in the school slip when she is playing in the park, accidents happen for the other children of the family, when they talk to the manager of the place they adapted her, she came to their house and tells them some other concerning stories about her, but the father of the family blames the mother for this, after the manager went from their house you see that the girl kills her cold blooded. Even she makes the little child of the family that is deaf to help her.The mother of the family knows there is something wrong and makes some investigations about her. So many bad things happen after these and at the end of the story you will see the family completely torn apart. You will see the little girl is attracted to the father sexually that is so strange, but a call from another country makes everything clear. The girl is not actually a 9 years old girl but a grown up woman that has a special hormone condition that keeps her like kids, also she escaped from a mental hospital last year and she is very dangerous the ribbon on her neck and wrists are for the damage she took when she was in hospital. At the end she kills the father of the family and wants to kill the other children but the mother fights her and kills her in defense. The story and scenario is very good and the directing and acting are both great. The movie altogether is very good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know, a filmmaker must earn his money back with some profit, of course. The story of this film is excellent: what to think about the adoption of a seemingly intelligent nice looking 9 year old girl, that for the parents slowly (for us viewers to soon) appears to be a psychotic 32 years old monster, that kills everyone that comes in her way? I have three questions to the directors of this film: 1) why in such a early stage we viewers have to be aware of the destructive character of this girl, 2) why is the father character such an unbelievable blind person and 3) why do mothers or women in these kind of movies always have to be such hysterical neurotical figures? In my opinion this film could have been much better and more suspenseful if these things were less overdone. Yet it's a good movie for a broad audience.</fullReview>

For some reason I expected Esther to be possessed by something paranormal but her 'condition' was very well thought out, never seen a film with this twist before. Thumbs up to this one, wish they could do a sequel because i'd be the first to see it :o)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If one watches enough horror movies, one gets to know the territory pretty well. I've done so for a few decades now and sure enough, the plot of 'Orphan' is a familiar one. I twigged the twist around halfway through as well. Nevertheless, despite many similarities to the usual cliché-bound dime-a-dozen penny-dreadfuls one sees so much of in the course of exploring the horror genre, this movie actually has something. The acting is good-to-excellent and the script and direction suspenseful above the average, but there's an extra element of uncertainty which makes it genuinely creepy. There were plot holes all right and the rather unimaginative ending didn't quite fit but 'Orphan' was a fun ride all the same. A pleasant surprise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A twist worthy of Shyamalan, and thats not a good thing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Orphan' had the makings of a classic horror movie, and a truly iconic villain. Until the big twist comes in from there the movie is lost. Irredeemable. Any suspense it produces is lost. The twist is literally the equivalent of revealing at the end of 'The Silence of the Lambs' that Hannibal Lecter does not actually eat people, he merely cooks them: the twist removes the creepy aspect of the villain, making her just another bland antagonist. Prior to the twist I was expecting an ending similar to the original 'The Omen' and I would have been quite satisfied with that, but instead I was left with something just as stupid and clichéd as any other run-of-the- mill horror movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Esther's unique problem makes for a great film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was something wrong with Esther, and that something is pretty interesting as far as plot twists go. Pretty effective psycho kid flick, with a young lady (Isabelle Fuhrman) giving an exceptional performance as a little girl with a big secret. The only blemishes is the standard plot clichés that sometimes make you pull your hair out (certain people don't believe the kid is evil, put their heads in the sand, don't want to see the obvious etc....) It's sometimes silly that most movies of this genre have to follow this predictable line, but I guess it's a necessary evil. Regardless, the movie rests on the shoulders of girl power (Farmiga and Fuhrman) who are, again, both very strong in their roles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Evil Adoption Roller Coaster Ride, well worth the ticket!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Caught this on DVD, got it from Blockbuster's discount rack...which is never a good sign. That said, I have to tell you...this was a fun, fun ride! It's a horror film that knows just the right doses of information and set up, it's a simple story that takes on some complicated issues and does such a fantastic job of it all.The little actress who plays Esther, the orphan of the title, is so amazing she puts all the other actors in the cast to shame. How she will ever move on to another role is almost impossible to imagine, but with as much talent as she has on display here I'd be willing to wager she'll do it, and that she has an Oscar in her future acting endeavors.I'm sure it's not easy to be an orphan looking for adoptive parents, and this film will not make it any easier! When a young couple decided to take in a little girl they get far more than they bargained for and soon, people start turning up dead and those who aren't dead...are in constant jeopardy! It's an adoption roller coaster ride with a twist ending I will not mention here as it was one of my favorite bits in the film...makes the girl allllll the creepier.Thumbs up all around, except Peter Sarsgaard, who I must admit I've never been a fan of. He seems to be working so hard all the time, and I'm of the opinion the acting should be unnoticed...and if it is, it should at least look easy. Sarsgaard turns acting into a backbreaking chore...and over the course of a 90 minute film the audience starts to take on some of that work. He's more or less put to shame by Isabelle Furhman's Esther.I hate to heap too much praise on the film, not because it doesn't deserve it...but so as not to raise the bar too much for those of you who haven't seen it yet. I suspect part of what I loved so much about it was I wasn't expecting much and then discovered a little gem.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, first off...let me just say, I was screaming at the screen watching this...and I watched it at home on DVD, so, my neighbors now have a beef with me - ug, I so can't wait to buy a house.This is a very manipulative movie, and I say that in the best possible way...that means it WORKED! Esther, the little girl in the movie, freaked me out, but I gotta be honest with you - not as much as that Peter Sarsguaard fella. It may be a reoccurring thing with me, but why does it seem like half the romantic leading men in Hollywood are just a liiiiittle too light in their loafers? I have nothing against it in a man, most of my friends fit neatly into this category - but when I'm plunking my good money down for a little escapist entertainment I wanna see MEN, not...well, whatever it is this Sarsgaard fella is. Yeah, yeah, I read the rags that put him in a marriage with that too tall Gylenhaal girl, I'm not buying it - are they trying to corner the market on vowels? I'm getting off point here - Isabelle Furhman, who plays Esther is so brilliant in this film that I cannot imagine her in any other role. That is a total compliment, but it's a tough thing for an actress so young to face...seriously, she cannot ever play an innocent after this - no one will buy it. I won't give away what happens in the end, or at least toward the end - but it caught me by total surprise and makes seeing this film all the more exciting.The one bad thing about this film, really, is it's gonna put the idea of adoption right up there with buying real estate in Louisiana.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly true to its genre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are way too many "horror" movies out in the world. Such of them (like House of Wax (2005), Blood of Dracula's Castle, The Uninvited, The Stepfather, Diary of the Dead, Prom Night (2008), etc.) that are honestly not scary at all. They don't stay true to their genre, and more of just a money-making fad that just attracts stupid teenagers into wasting their money by watching a horrible rendition of an over-used idea.This is what I thought when I was first planning on watching Orphan. In fact, the first time I saw it (which I only watched only the first 10 minutes) I was like "Oh dear, it's how I thought." However, I should have given it more of a look. So I did.To my absolute surprise, this movie was actually very good. To everyone who says the horror genre is dead, it's not entirely true. Orphan provides what most horror movie-filmmakers would be jealous of--depth of character and suspense. When I saw the dinner table scene where Daniel drops the F-bomb on the parents, I totally felt the emotion come from this little actor. Of course, Jimmy Bennett has had a very good career start (examples such as Star Trek, Hostage, and Polar Express). Engineer as Max was just so great, she could pull of a sad emotion like she was actually in the situation herself.Fuhrman was excellently rolled. She had the guts to pull off a nearly unmissable Romanian accent. I would for sure have to compliment on her anger towards Farminga's Kate. Her acting has surpassed all my expectations for teenage actors.If you haven't seen Orphan yet, I would highly recommend that you watch it. As Ebert has said, do not let your children see this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The trailer makes this movie look like it will be similar to The Omen, which I guess it kind of is. However I thought it was a better film than that and possibly more believable once you know why the little girl is doing such horrible things.The acting of the girl in this film (Isabelle Fuhrman) is absolutely phenomenal I thought and quite compelling to watch. It might even be Oscar worthy I would have thought, not that this type of film usually gets nominations I would guess.Some of the scenes are perhaps quite disturbing without getting too gruesome. Morever the suspense and slight horror feel are both maintained throughout the film. A good film with a satisfying story line, nothing amazing I would say but definitely worth the watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>New Twist on an Old Standard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I LOVED Orphan and was completely blown away by how unexpectedly good and suspenseful and touching and well.. brilliant it was. Yes, the concept of an evil child wreaking havoc on a family is nothing new but please don't roll your eyes and assume that the movie is unoriginal too. The basis for the movie may not be unique but there is an original twist which has never done before regarding Esther, aka the evil child and even without that crazy twist, the actual movie held it's own. The acting was fabulous and the ending, without giving anything away was not one made of rainbows and puppies and everything sweet which is always a plus in my book since sunshine endings make me roll my eyes.Isabelle Fuhrman who plays Esther, the adopted evil child was nothing short of fantastic. She plays this part masterfully and when the twist is revealed, transforms herself into a whole 'nother character and sells that aspect as well. I hope to see her get more work in the future. She was amazing.Speaking of amazing, the little girl, Maxine, played by in real life, hard of hearing, Aryana Engineer, stole basically every scene she was in. Aside from being adorable, she really was a great little actress for someone with little to no experience. She's a standout.Peter Saarsgard and Vera Farmiga are great as the parents and Jimmy Bennet, who plays the son, was also good.I definitely recommend this thriller. I went into this expecting a run of the mill Omen like movie with some evil kid and the havoc being unleashed on the family but what I got was an original, well written, fantastically acted thrill ride that was above and beyond what I could have asked for when I chose the flick.9/10 Now go watch it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Keep in mind that this isn't really a horror film, it's more of a thriller. The tagline "there's something wrong with Esther" and her ominous picture on the movie poster makes it obvious that her charming act is just that; a facade. Though, the tagline doesn't completely give away the entire plot. While Esther is indeed disturbed, the true secret of the film is not revealed until the very end of the movie. Isabelle Fuhrman is very good as Esther, and delivers her lines well. I can defiantly see her doing more work as an actress in the future. Her Russian accent was also pretty believable. Vera Farmiga also does a good job as Kate, the mother who had given birth to a stillborn baby, and is recovering from the alcoholic addiction the incident created. The movie has an intriguing story to tell, although there are a few plot holes here and there. Overall, a very good movie. 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't mind this movie its OK, a lot of the reviews here are giving it massive praise, although I just felt like it had a bunch of flaws even though you have to give credit to all the actors and the film writers, nearly every film has a flaw or two, but it just seemed that this particular film started to slack a bit halfway through till basically the end.its a good story, but the flaws I'm talking about aren't massive, just commonsense type flaws, the kind of flaws that are deliberately molded into a film that just makes it last the whole 1.5hrs to make it a film in length, i don't want to add possible spoilers or anything like that so I'm not going to bother going into that side to try and holdup why/where i think it was flawed so ill leave it there and just say, it has some flaws, you can watch it and enjoy it, it is tense, i did like the characters the story, and how it moves through, but it just left me feeling a tiny bit disappointed, i quite like 'all' films so its not that this wasn't my genre, but anyway to keep it small ill give it a 7/10 its worth watching and like ppl have said here its not completely what you expect really but it is similar to other (evil)child movies, you will get what you ask for in that sense, but there is a bit more to it.ill end saying if you can just ignore the small flaws its a good way to kill a couple hours :D (most of the flaws I'm talking about are actually in the goofs section but the general commonsense is just a bit slow, meh, watch it and you'll know what i mean I'm sure.)there are a lot of reviews on this film when I'm writing this its like 155 + mine 156, so there is a massive variation in views/opinions, ppl hated it, some loved it, but i think the general consensus is in middle, its a time waster, if you only get 1 night in the week to watch a film and hardly any spare time to kill, don't bother with this film, watch The Omen or something its probably a better variation to the same story, if a bit old now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>entertaining little horror flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie last night and despite mixed reviews (some were positive to the point of excellent whilst some denounced it as boring trash with a silly secret) i was pleasantly surprised at the decency of this movie - I'm not calling it a masterpiece, I've seen better movies in general, but nor would i rubbish it either. The twist ending is in fact not the best part of 'Orphan'... despite the ending being quite intelligent and original. The movie develops in two distinct halves, the first part we have a very subtle, psychological, dark film with emphasis placed on characterisation, we see and understand the motivations behind the characters and in terms of letting the mood develop, it has a dark, edgy vibe that works well, ditto the creepy Esther is introduced to us and she proceeds to intrigue us, whilst we learn nothing about her. The second part of the movie moves on from the subtleness and into terror, as we begin to see exactly what this little girl is all about. The violence eventually goes over the top and in the end, it becomes incomprehensible, but OTT cannot ruin what came before, the early parts of the film an excellent way to utilise suspense in an interesting and intriguing manner. Overall I'm giving the movie 7/10, the story was good and kept me interested, whilst the performance from 12year old Isabelle Furhmann as Esther is astonishing. that child is definitely one to watch. Overall, worth a look if you enjoy unusual horror movies. David Ford</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie truly surprised me. I was expecting an Omen remake, and in the beginning I thought that was exactly what I was getting. Wrong! I will say that if it wasn't for the HUGE surprise ending, this movie would have been as disappointing as I expected it to be. However, it managed to keep me interested enough to see the end. The acting is decent. Unfortunately, I can't comment on the quality or special effects (like the minimal gore) because I watched it online. All I can say is that, thanks to the ending, this movie is almost kind of original. So, if you liked the Omen then you're probably going to like this movie, but if you don't like the Omen (like me) then you might get quite a surprise out of Orphan.</fullReview>

Younger girl, max, is very very charming.The movie starts like an average family movie, where a couple is looking for adoption. It will continue as a normal drama movie.

Sure it might be slightly predictable but what makes this different from recent horror bummers is the acting from the little girl; she's what makes the movie something else.SPOILER: (The seduction scene: A little squeamish)The story is simple enough, couple brings home orphan, orphan looks nonthreatening enough but things start to turn bad. Soon after a small animal is killed the orphan bashing begins. Now I know about the whole uproar about people saying this movie portrays orphans badly but they haven't seen it because there's a twist ending(I already seen it coming)The one thing I didn't care for was the direction, the director would try every chance he got to try for a jump scare that just says "We meant to put something else here but we decided to go with an old cliché instead." If Sam Raimi was behind the camera it could have been a totally different movie, and I'm not just saying that because of Drag Me To Hell.</fullReview>

She indeed robs the bank dry in this one. She is simply put "Evil" in the role and a brilliant and believable evil at that. She is sneaky, conniving,and terrifying.

		<fullReview>Excited that one of my good friends just turned legal age to get into an "R" movie with myself, I was happy that we had the chance and time to see this movie on opening day. Due to lack of TV interest lately, I hadn't actually heard or seen anything about this movie until 3 days prior to watching it. I read the summary of the movie, and accidentally bumped into a major plot spoiler of the movie. Between all of that, and the movie poster and genre I was mostly hooked on seeing it. In my opinion, the beginning started off a tad slow for my tastes (keep in mind that I'm 17). When they brought Ester home is actually the point where I felt that the movie picked up loads of speed and started getting interesting. Of course it wouldn't be a movie in the horror/thriller/suspense category if it didn't have a single sex or nudity scene, right, so I have to say that I half mindedly had to sit through that. But overall, the suspense build up was fantastic, and the comedy breaks here and there were perfectly planted.Plot spoiler or not, I have to say that I was actually surprised by this movie and was nothing like I had expected. I enjoyed wasting 2 hours on a Friday before work: it was well worth it.I give this movie an 8/10, because I feel that it needed a little spicing up in a place or two (or maybe it's just my age!).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Orphan (2009): Dir: Jaume Collet-Serra / Cast: Isabelle Fuhrman, Vera Farminga, Peter Sarsgaard, Aryana Engineer, Jimmy Bennett: Another retread formula horror film with about as many scares as an episode of The Rugrats. It regards where one comes from, or in this case, where Esther came from when adopted by Kate and John Coleman. They already parent two children but after losing a third they decide to adopt. Horrid incidents follow and suspicions of Esther become clearer. Begins well but plays off in typical horror film fashion until a violent climax. Director Jaume Collet-Serra is backed by effective production that is eerie at best. His cast are subdued by characters carefully fitted into horror movie clichés. Isabelle Fuhrman plays the maddening kid who will tamper and torment while playing off as innocent. Her final scene isn't so much a defeat as an admittance to absurd screen writing. As the parents, Vera Farminga is the target of misplaced evidence that has her believed as abusive. Peter Sarsgaard as her husband is required to be in denial. Neither one could find their way out of a closet with the door wide open. Aryana Engineer plays the mute daughter whom will also be subject to torment. Jimmy Bennett plays their tormented son. There is nothing scary about this bore. It can only be described as disturbing and mediocre at best. Score: 3 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Copies the 1993 Film the Good Son...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kate is a mother of two who just had a miscarriage and has recovered from a severe drinking problem. Her husband John joins her in adopting Esther, a girl from Russia who was orphaned after narrowly escaping a mysterious fire. At first Esther seems well-manners, mature beyond her years and great with her new siblings, Max and Daniel. Max (Maxine, Maxie maybe?) is an almost deaf little girl and her older brother Daniel is an average preteen boy. He is at first jealous of Esther, but soon learns, as well as Max, that there is something seriously wrong with her.Orphan rips off several plot aspects from the 1993 slasher/horror 'the Good Son'. In the Good Son the sociopath child Henry shoots and kills a dog with a potato gun. In Orphan Esther kills a pigeon that Daniel has shot with a paint-ball. The winter scenery and tree house is the same, the psychologist is the same looking, the family is the same looking, etc, etc. Watch the Good Son, you'll see what I mean.Esther is not really a 9-year-old Russian orphan. She is an escaped mental patient from Estonia, as well as an adult. She is a dwarf and will never appear any older than a child, so she is angry at herself and others, mainly because no men ever want to be with her due to her appearance. She attempts to dress up as a stripper and seduce John while Kate is in the hospital, but John realizes something is very wrong with her and just breaks down and starts crying. Esther is also very disturbing at times. She catches Kate and John violently making love (in the kitchen no less, gross), and when questioned about it says a curse word casually. She threatens to castrate Daniel (in far more sinister and offensive use of language). She beats in a nun's head with a hammer and carries around a wrinkled old bible full of photos of men she's killed between the pages.Orphan was a half-decent movie but was also highly typical, using the same mental patient slasher cliché and copying ideas out of previous killer children films like the Good Son (1993), the Paperboy (1995), Mikey (1992) and Bloody Birthday (1981). I thought the kitchen sex scene in the movie was disgusting and irrelevant to the plot, and the obscene language was a little much. The acting was great but the plot was very unrealistic.Orphan isn't the best movie in the world. However, it can be a way to pass the time, or if you're a hardcore slasher fan something to add to your viewing collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kate (Vera Farmiga) and John Coleman (Peter Sarsgaard) are trying to adopt. She's a recovering alcoholic and they're trying to salvage their family after the death of their baby Jessica. They adopt Russian girl Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman) at the St. Marina Orphanage. At first, the son Daniel (Jimmy Bennett) didn't get along while the deaf daughter Max (Aryana Engineer) loves her. Then Esther's manipulations and threats causes concerns from Kate. John dismisses all of it. The psychologist Dr. Browning (Margo Martindale) keeps questioning her. Then Kate finds out troubling information about Esther.This starts very slowly. The psycho family dysfunction is well done although John's denial is very annoying. It is extremely frustrating and I wish the movie dials it down a bit. I do love the twist. It fits the movie very well, and it's done smoothly. Isabelle Fuhrman does the role beautifully, and Vera Farmiga is great as the frazzled mother.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really REALLY wanted to like this film. And for the first half hour or so I did, and thought I'd found a real gem. I was all set to add it to my review blog as a recommendation. But then it just all went to hell in a handbag. ****major spoilers aheadMany reviews have already covered the sheer stupidity of the characters actions in this flick as well as the unrealistic (non-existent) adoption process and other glaring gigantic holes in the plot so I wont cover too much in my review. I will mention just one as an example. When the idiot dad finally discovers the pictures on the wall, especially of the house burning, does he do the sensible thing (ie grab the youngest daughter and get the *** out of the house?) No... he decides to take all the pictures off the wall and gaze at all the gruesome images a while then wanders vaguely off downstairs AWAY from the youngest child's room. Then he sees sparks flying from a destroyed fuse box and STILL doesn't get it. Seriously... the man deserved to die, even if he died at the hands of a tiny person he could have smacked unconscious with one hit. I mean come on. She was a teeny tiny woman. How could she over-power a big man like him just by sitting on him? Rubbish. None of the characters were likable enough for me to be concerned about their fates except maybe the littlest kid. She was cute and she was the only character in the entire film who had any smarts(apart from the Orphan herself).With a lot more thought and less lazy writing/reliance on cliché/underestimating the audience's intelligence this could have been a cracker of a movie. I longed for something to happen that wasn't predictable and stupid. Anything!! But sadly it just got worse and worse.We can all forgive a few plot holes in movies, but when there are so many and so serious it completely destroys the movie. And that's what happened here. I thoroughly enjoyed the acting of the two girls, both young actors did a fantastic job, especially Isabelle Furhrman. But there was nothing else to praise in this sad disappointing result of a story that could have and should have been done so much better.DOn't bother with it. You've seen it all before, done a lot better. The ONLY reason to watch it would be to see how great Isabelle Furhrman's acting was - my rating of 2 points is for that alone. Not sure that's enough to justify 2 hours of excruciating boredom tho.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now I don't have much to say about this film so it's going to be a quick review. I would have liked it to be a little shorter, it went on for to long but luckily I didn't lose interest. The plot was decent and the twist wasn't entirely unpredictable. You grow to dislike some of the characters, mainly the husband and the kids. Why you may ask? Because they are stupid, the girl witnesses a murder and they boy is threatened with castration, so what do they do, nothing, you got to be kidding me. The husband was completely oblivious. I don't think anyone cared that he died. It was frustrating to watch as everyone would think Kate is crazy. At some points it got uncomfortable, mainly the sexual situations with the 'real life children'. When Esther was acting sexual to the dad, I felt disgusted. Sure they show boys looking at porn in this film, but I mean come on, this film has balls to say the least. There was some suspense throughout, but nothing major. This film is good for one viewing, I don't think I could sit through it again, nothing memorable just average. I recommend renting it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There is something wrong with Orphan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really liked the title sequence, and the mandatory twist ending was a cool one. However, the content between the title sequence and the ending was just uninspired. I had to turn the movie off several times, not because it was scary, but because it was irritating and predictable. One exception, though: the title sequence was okay. I know, I have already mentioned that, but I can't come up with much else that I liked, so I just mention the title sequence again: I liked the title sequence.While the twist ending was good, it didn't have much connection with the rest of the movie. The ending could just as easily have been implemented in another story. In The Sixth Sense, the ending really made the entire story come together.The movie is, obviously, about an evil child. The audience knows that. It is frustrating to wait one hour for character #1 to figures out that, by Golly, this is *indeed* an evil child, and then having character #2 deny it.Some reviewers loves the film, which really baffles me. I don't have kids myself - I wonder if parents can relate better to this movie? If parenthood will ruin ones ability to distinguish between good and bad horror movies, it is obviously not worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Mystery?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only MYSTERY I have found in this movie is the fact that it has a 7.1/10. The movie is about a kid who gets adopted by a family, The truth is that Mystery films work better when they DON'T show who is doing all these things, It's like watching a movie when the twist is screamed at the very beginning.Speaking of the twist did anybody else see it coming? A little girl kills a nun, pushes a kid off a slide which causes the other kid to break her leg, burns a clubhouse down with a kid in it, goes to that same kid in hospital and knows how to disconnect life support. THE TWIST!!! she is really a 33 year old who looks like a child. Her motive all along is to seduce the father and if that doesn't work kill everyone in the family.The fact that this sets up no character development, awful acting and terrible dialog. As far as Mystery films go, Watch movies like Psycho instead, even The Crow Salvation developed more of a mystery than this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another 'evil kid' horror film that's content to repeat the same old plot elements and tricks from earlier, better films like THE OMEN. I admit I was looking forward to ORPHAN, as it had been a while since I'd sat down with a traditional horror film and I was looking forward to being scared. Unfortunately, it wasn't meant to be.The film does have a couple of things going in its favour. Spanish director Jaume Collet-Serra (who made his name with the lamentable HOUSE OF WAX remake) crafts a good-looking film with a stylishness it doesn't really deserve. Isabelle Fuhrman, as the sinister girl at the heart of the story, is excellent in the role and would be effective if given more taxing characters (Anne Frank, for instance).Unfortunately, that's where the good stuff ends. The characters of the parents are particularly irritating, with Peter Sarsgaard playing an oblivious bore and Vera Farmiga a thoroughly annoying mother. Farmiga, so good in a supporting role in THE DEPARTED, also gives a bad performance that displays none of the talent she showed in the Scorsese film. Only old hand CCH Pounder is any good, and she's virtually wasted.The rest of the movie plays out by rote, with the expected deaths, manipulation and betrayal, before the script throws in a ludicrous twist ending which is so laughable as to be unbelievable. It's a shame, because on occasion ORPHAN comes close to being a decent film, but in the end it just doesn't cut the mustard.</fullReview>

But all I can say is, Its just a masterpiece, The planets and the stars must have been aligned jut right, When the director decided to make this one. The acting is perfect, the characters are perfect, The story is perfect. The whole atmosphere and mood the movie sets is perfect. The action and the violence is perfect. And its make you forgot everything around you and makes you want more and more. Isabelle Fuhrman gives us one of the darkest and uncompromisable killers ever on screen. First she begins very subtle, A few lies here, And little manipulation there. And then, As the movie develops. Little miss orphans true intentions become much more clear. Whomever stands in here way, Will suffer the consequences. And she always gets what she wants. If you're fed up with those typical, over top produced, commercial horror crap Hollywood gives us. And you want a movie with real characters and real depth. You gotta see orphan. And true intelligent horror movie, That you wont easily forget.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kate and John Coleman are rebuilding their troubled marriage. Kate had a drinking problem, but is in therapy and is doing well. She has been sober for one year. The couple decides to adopt a child. When they meet Esther, at the St. Marina Orphanage, they immediately fall in love with the well-educated orphan. Their young son, Daniel, is hostile to his new sister; but their deaf-mute daughter, little Max, is enchanted with her - at first. Eventually, Kate begins to feel that Esther is manipulative and possibly even psychologically disturbed......With another horror movie produced by Joel Silver (Gothika, and The Reaping), I was expecting something high in gore, low on credibility, and some good actors turning in some hammy performances.I didn't expect an intelligent, eerie thriller, which didn't go for the usual jump scare tactics that most horrors do, and it's surprisingly low on gore too.But it's the sense of foreboding doom that the film has, you know from the minute we meet Esther, something isn't right.From the poster, you can tell she is going to be a little madam, like a psycho Problem Child, but John Ritter isn't around to look after this kid. The poster doesn't give anything about the film away, and the final act is original and disturbing (especially if you are a parent).All the cast are good, even if Sarsgaard looks like Kiefer Sutherland and sounds like John Malkovich, and the family are great as their lives are literally crashing around them.The house design is beautiful and adds a sinister edge to the film, and the use of the old scare tactic camera views are clever, as they never get used, just implied.So all in all, it's a great little movie, with everything ticking the right boxes, but the last act, like i said is pretty disturbing and a bit wrong.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Thriller in Many Years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was more than pleasantly surprised by this movie. Based on the title and the trailer, I was expecting a typical soft gut Hollywood formula thriller with a few cheap scares and a namby-pamby pseudo-cathartic ending. What I got was a top notch seat of your pants white-knuckle joy ride.Everything about this film is top of the line, from the beautifully paced screenplay by David Johnson, with rich characters and more suspense than you'd find in your usual Hollywood thriller, based on a great story by Alex Mace.The casting and performances are uniformly superb, but most notable are the three main female characters, who are a bit more complex than you normally get in a genre film from Tinseltown.Vera Farmiga is a fine actress who's been impressive in past roles, but this is a stand-out role that will have everyone remembering her name. Her young co-stars are both outstanding as well. Newcomer Aryanna Engineer is a charming newcomer and Isabelle Fuhrman as the mysterious orphan was simply amazing in this role.Director Jaume Collet-Serra is great not only with the actors but with action and pacing as well. Like Paul Verhoeven, he's one of those rare European directors who handles Hollywood style action better than most American directors.With several top producers on board, including Joel Silver, Don Carmody and Susan Downey, it's not a surprise that the production values are excellent, from the score to the costumes to the efx make-up and stunts.If you're a fan of the thriller genre, this is one you can't miss.</fullReview>

All of the actors in the movie were great!!in my opinion, the two top notch actors were Esther(Isabelle furhman) and max(aryana engineer).Isabelle was just an amazing actress in the movie!!!and max was too and max is the cutest little girl I have ever seen!!all the actors were amazing!!and that's the end of my review!! cutesy little girl I have ever seen!!!all of the actors were amazing!!this movie rocks!!!!this is one of my favorite movies of all time and this has to be one of the best movies ever!!!and this is the end of my review!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, this review definitely contains spoilers, so please don't read on if you haven't yet seen this movie.Orphan is a spectacular, incredible, awesome movie. When I first saw the trailer of it, I kind of knew that I would probably want it. Now, it's really not like me to go and buy movies without first watching them just to see how they would be, but this movie was pretty amazing. I absolutely love pretty much everything about Orphan. I thought of Esther as just an evil little girl doing terrible things. Yes, she seemed to be a child committing vicious crimes, but I really didn't think much of it, never thought that there could have been more to it, as I was sure there were certain other cases with other young children doing those types of crazy things as well. The tag line did say, "You'll never guess her secret," so I knew that there may have been a little bit more to her than just being an evil little girl. But I NEVER would have guessed that she was actually a grown woman with dwarfism. I never would have guessed that at all. I at first thought the twist was a little unreal and ridiculous, but I've grown used to it and actually kind of liked it. Before the twist came, I thought that maybe she was something evil or supernatural, especially hearing in the trailer when Kate said that the orphanage she supposedly came from had never heard of her. I also looked at this movie more as a horror film than a psychological thriller. There were lots of signs that Esther may have been grown, like her knowledge about the F word in terms of sex, the way she handled that gun, and the castration threat she made to Daniel. I must say that when she held that gun to little Max's head, I thought, "Oh my God, she is freaking crazy!" But I thought Esther was just a very mature nine-year-old, really precocious beyond her years. And being that young, she could have been from a country where she might have been exposed to things that were way more mature. And I also kind of knew that Esther would try and seduce John sometime in the movie, even though she was supposedly a child. Even though John may have cheated once, I knew he wouldn't try to get with a "child." She seriously does have a mental problem, because anyone would know darn well that a person might not always have been able to seduce a married man. There was no reason for her to get so upset over it when he turned her down. I also thought the little girl Max was incredibly beautiful and adorable. I also thought Dr. Browning was a total idiot as a psychiatrist, incredibly stupid. And I could not stand John. He really got on my nerves and annoyed me. He ignored completely every sign that Esther was some serious trouble. And it really did annoy me that he had to cheat on Kate. I am in no way trying to sound biased or stereotypical, but stupid men would find any freaking reason to want to cheat, and it just gets on my freaking nerves very badly. I also thought Vera Farmiga's acting could have been a lot better in the movie. I expected a more shock and terrified reaction when she saw John lying on the floor stabbed to death and a whole lot of blood around him. I knew she was sedated with some kind of drug, but still. But I certainly thought Isabelle Fuhrman did a WONDERFUL job. She is a great actress and may just have a wonderful future and marvelous career ahead of her. I loved this movie very much and thought it was incredibly great. Even though it would have been better with the earlier drafts of the script I read about on IMDb, this movie was awesome nevertheless. Yes, it would have made the story more amazing and wonderfully real if Esther indeed was molested by her father, which got her some sexual knowledge at a very early age, and her thing for trying to hit on married men who were her adoptive fathers. The other drafts were great too, such as Esther being a grown-up prostitute for years, and then faking being a child to get her to stay out of prison, or the fact that she was disgusted with her dwarfism: being an adult trapped inside a child's body, but not as good as the first one I read. This movie was wonderful and amazing, and I give it ten stars. I loved it!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty interesting movie, a cut above your usual horror flick. I like it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story involves a 30-something couple who have a normal son and a young daughter who is deaf. As the story unfolds we find out by bits and pieces that the wife has had a drinking problem, and that was probably responsible for their third child being stillborn. She also apparently lost a college level music teaching job because of her drinking problem, but she appears to be dry for good.They decide they want another child and after much consideration and counseling decide to visit the orphanage to find another daughter via adoption. While the husband is aimlessly wandering around the building he comes upon a 9-year-old girl who is very personable and is a fine artist. She is from Russia, the husband and wife both like her, and after a few weeks to process the adoption the girl goes home with them, the newest member of their family.But things are anything but smooth, both at home and at school. The parents begin to wander if they made a big mistake with this girl.Vera Farmiga, sort of an "everywomen" actress, is the mother, Kate Coleman. Peter Sarsgaard, who seems to be showing up everywhere, is the father, John Coleman. Although they never discuss his occupation he appears to be a successful architect and they live in a nice community in Connecticut.The adopted girl is played expertly by American actress Isabelle Fuhrman, as Esther. She turned 11 during the filming. She adopts a slight Russian accent that seems believable for a young girl who has been in the States for a few years.Other key characters are veteran CCH Pounder as Sister Abigail. Jimmy Bennett is the son, Daniel. And cute little Aryana Engineer is the deaf daughter, Max (Maxine).The developments in the story are for the most part not predictable, and kept us guessing most of the time. There were a few parts that weren't very credible, but overall a worthwhile movie.MAJOR SPOILERS: As things happen, and as the parents begin looking into Esther's past, they see a pattern. While she is never actually caught doing anything wrong, she always seems to be present when certain bad things happen. A fire, a broken leg, a death. So when they finally get to her origin they find out she is not a 9-year-old girl, but in fact a 30-something with a type of dwarfism that makes her look young. She also escaped from an institution and is (as we already knew) dangerous. In her adopted family she was out to destroy all the others and have the dad for herself. In an eerie scene near the end, she puts on makeup and dresses like an adult, and tries to seduce him. The final scene is outside, in the snow, between Esther and the mom, they break through the ice into the pond, Esther with a knife, but mom manages a kick to the head that sends Esther, dead or unconscious, down to the bottom. But dad was already dead. Note: In an alternate ending on the DVD, Esther didn't die but walked out of the house dressed again as a young girl, as the police went in to hunt for a criminal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film restores my faith in contemporary horror thrillers!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Horror thrillers are going everywhere, I tell you. From gruesome accidents, to supernatural and nightmarish creatures, to psychos, to ghosts...there's a horror film about everything. It seems like ages ago since I saw a film that made children- children, for chrissake- look truly demonic and terrorizing. That film was, of course, "The Omen" (1976), but Jaume Collet-Serra's "Orphan" (2009) has sparked again that fear. In fact, the 'terrifyingly evil' child in "Orphan", I dare say, is at least ten times more fiendishly demonic than the child Antichrist Damian in "The Omen".Having said that, this film is about a couple: Kate (Vera Farmiga) and John (Peter Sarsgaard), who have two children but are emotionally recovering after the death of their third child, a stillborn. They both have issues, and that is a huge understatement. They try to live a nice, suburban life and at times they seem very, very happy. Their eldest, Daniel (Jimmy Bennett) is your typical pre-tween playing Rock Band with his friends after school, playing pranks, and sneaking up to his tree-house to browse through Playboy magazines. Their youngest, Max (Aryana Engineer) is a cute, timid girl that's gone almost completely deaf. Kate is having the most problems trying to cope with the death of her baby, so she seeks constant help from her shrink (Margo Martindale, thankfully leaving behind her Hannah Montana's granny role), and she's quickly becoming your typical pill popper.Anyway, Kate and John decide they want to adopt a child, and they go to this orphanage where they're immediately impressed by Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman), a cute young girl who dresses like Little Bo Beep (like one of her cruel classmates points out), who has an amazing talent for painting, who's extremely polite, and has a smile that wins you over instantly. Kate and John learn from the orphanage's mother superior that Esther was brought here from Russia, where her house caught fire and her parents died. Altruisticly, our main heroes adopt the adorable Esther and take her home.Everything is fine at first. But, then again, this is a horror film. Esther doesn't seem to be the cute little girl we all thought her to be. She knows and uses a variety of bad words, has no problem killing small animals, roams around the house at night and watches her new parents have sex, pushes other children off tall garden sets, antagonizes Kate against her husband and just about disturbs everyone around her. And when the orphanage's mother superior discovers some really disturbing info on Esther's past, she really pulls out the big guns.As I watched this, I gasped and groaned in terror at how conniving, evil and downright loathe-able this Esther child was. Isabelle Fuhrman has really outdone herself with her role, showing us what I believe is the most hate-able and terrifying villain this century has seen. And Vera Farmiga gives a perfect performance too, as the helpless mother who sees through Esther's diabolic mind but whom no one believes. Sparks constantly fly between these two: the evil and protected child against the resolute but helpless mother. It was a nice change in family roles, and I found it refreshing. Also, this thriller doesn't follow the same formula for scares and thrills every other horror film nowadays pulls out. It bases its horror on the character of Esther herself, and we find chills running down our spine because of the things Esther says and does.The screenplay is, besides the child's superb acting, the strongest point of the film. It's perfectly developed, it has no plot holes I could discover, and in fact, it has the emotional depth and the pitch-perfect character development that reminded me of an M. Night Shyamalan film. You find yourself engrossed in the events unfolding on screen, and relating to the couple and feeling frustrated and irate because of the problems this devil child is bringing on them. And that's one of the things recent horror films fail to understand: that the power of truly psychological horror and tension is NOT a result of gore, or grotesque beasts, or ghostly entities or sudden shocks, but of the drama and tension between the characters. This film, basically, revived my hopes for contemporary horror thrillers."Orphan" is not the best picture of the year. But it is one of the best movie-going experiences you'll have this year. And the end has a terrifyingly disturbing twist that audiences have gone nuts over. See it! You won't be disappointed.Rating: 3 and a half stars out of 4!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Did those line of words make sense? In the real life, it is. And so do Orphan.When I first watch the trailer, just like most of the movie-goers here, I assumed that this movie is just about another evil born kid and bla bla bla. You know, the usual plot stories. With the opening (of the movie) like that, one would be so sure of themselves that this is one horror movie.But guess what? It wasn't. I enter the theater with a great hope that I will see something scary. But somehow, that hope was thrashed. Along the way, another kind of satisfaction came to replace my disappointment. This is not just another boring and bad movie. It got a lot of surprise and twisted stories. Believe me.I think, for most of the thriller fans will find this movie amusing and entertaining. Just like myself. At least, I would give this movie 9/10.Great one. You really have to watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nice surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was surprised by how much I really liked this film. I was hoping it would just be packed full of parts where it's silent and then boom! you're scared because you were, basically, startled. I find that type of horror movie annoying, Orphan was not. There was a nice blend of things being very creepy and kids just being cute. While the kids are just being cute kids doing cute things you get sort of lulled to sleep and the Orphan springs into action. It was hard to really figure her out and what her problem was and why is she acting like such a psycho. In the end you'll be pleasantly surprised and I really liked the ending. I would say go see if you're looking to satisfies your hunger for blood, guts, and brutal deaths scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That is one of the most intense thrillers i've seen in a while. It was very intense and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. Whoever played Esther is one heck of an actress. She was amazing in the movie. To be honest, all the actors played their parts perfectly. The fact that she was really a 33 year old woman was excellent writing. I would have been more surprised if my cousin wasn't a loud mouth and told me. It was very eerie and disturbing. Lookin at Esther gave you the creeps. This is definitely a movie to go see and especially with a date. She smashed a bird with a rock and pushed a girl and broke her ankle. Its worth the money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Orphan is one of the most confounding movies of the year. Not the movie itself mind you, but the process behind which it was made. Ya know how films are cut and trimmed after the filming process is complete. Orphan seems to buck that trend. Everything concept, plot device, cliché, and genre rule within the story's grasp is gobbled up and spit out on screen. I laughed, was shocked, jumped, was legitimately terrified, appalled, and just leveled by how shameless a production this is.The acting is good. Vera Farmiga could be a Oscar-contender yearly if she so chooses. Peter Sarsgaard seemed to have so much fun deploying his role as unsympathetic, wrong in the head husband. The children nail the suspense give their characters a vulnerable feel. Esther is just...great! Orphan is a film not for a critic or just or you or me. It's for the whole auditorium to experiences all the reactions this film supplies. This kind of film seems to understand that we aren't here for but one thing, TO HAVE FUN. Well done go enjoy and be-forewarned, this puppy will leave its mark on you</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Possible Spoilers* Meet Esther. So sweet. So intelligent. So creative.And once you "really" get to know Esther you'll just love hating her guts right through to the very end.Yeah-Yeah. I know that this was just a movie, but, hey, all the same, I don't care what sort of rare form of dwarfism that Esther was cursed with, we're talking about a 33 year-old woman here - And there's no was on Earth that the face of a woman that age could've possibly retained its youthfulness of a 9 year-old for close to 25 years. No way, Jose.And, that, my friends, is why, in my books, this Horror/Thriller lost itself so many points.There's no plausible way that Esther could've ever kept up her devious, little deception for such an extended period of time, especially when you mix into this poisonous recipe the messy ingredient of her committing multiple murders and actually getting away with it for so long.From a standpoint of rational thinking, that was just too much for this viewer to accept.And, besides all of that, Orphan was one of those films that could've certainly used some serious editing.At its 2.5-hour running time, I had grown so bored of the whole charade that by the time Esther's true identity was finally revealed, I honestly couldn't have given a sweet damn about it, at all.In fact, this revelation was almost anti-climatic in nature.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I don't think Mommy likes me very much."I know the "evil child" movie has been done to death, but that doesn't mean that another one worth watching doesn't come along on occasion. I thought Orphan was going to to be one of those worthwhile flicks...until the last act.&nbsp;A family with a troubled past that's only recently managed to move past a tragic miscarriage decides to welcome a new child named Esther into their home. Esther initially seems like a bright, lovely nine-year-old, but soon troubling events make the mother (Vera Farmiga) and Esther's two new siblings suspicious of the girl. And for good reason. Esther has plans for her new family, and deadly things happen when her plans are threatened.&nbsp;Isabelle Fuhrman is perfect as Esther, whether she's being adorably charming, or completely sociopathic. This kind of movie succeeds or fails based on whether the characters involved draw you into the story, or make you laugh at the absurdity of the premise. Largely because of young Isabella, Orphan fell into the later category for me.&nbsp;Up until the ending, that is. I'll be honest, I though the finale was outright terrible. The word "inexplicable" comes to mind. It really hurt a movie that up to that point was fairly good. I guess the silly twist was made in order to make Orphan more believable, but it achieved the exact&nbsp;opposite effect. &nbsp;It's not really a horror movie, so don't expect lots of chills. But as a pretty dark thriller, Orphan works for its first hundred minutes. The twisty (and unnecessary) shenanigans near the end, though, hurt the movie a lot.&nbsp;It's been a while since my opinion of a film nosedived so quickly while I was watching it. Disappointing.&nbsp;</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After losing her baby at child birth, Kate (Vera Farmiga) and her husband Jon (Peter Sarsgaard) decides to adopt an nine year old little girl named Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman). Kate and Jon have two kids of their own, the oldest is Daniel (Jimmy Bennett) and Max (Aryana Engineer). At first, Esther seems to be an normal happy little girl. But Esther isn't what she seems to be. She is highly intelligent, manipulative person, who looks wise beyond her eyes. Very little slowly, the family discovers that Esther is hiding an truly dark nasty secret from them.Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra (Goal 2:Living the Dream, House of Wax "2005") made an entertaining, scary, sometimes darkly humorous thriller in the vain of "The Bad Seed" and "The Good Son". Strong performances by Farmiga and especially young Fuhrman makes this sometimes flawed thriller worth watching.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.78:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD includes deleted scenes and alternate ending. The Blu-ray includes an featurette and an digital copy. If you haven't seen this thriller, don't miss one of the most underrated movies of 2009. Good screenplay by David Leslie Johnson (The Girl with the Red Riding Hood). From a story by Alex Mace. (****/*****).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the scariest movie I have ever seen,i'm not kidding!. I forgot what it was like to be scared out of my wits,and it felt good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had no expectations what so ever for Orphan when I 1st read the synopsis for it on IMDb,I thought it would be another Omen wannabe|which is highly overrated itself| but what I got was much,much more then that. The film starts off with a creepy and effective hospital sequence,from that point forward it gives you this amazingly slow build up,that will grip you right until the end. It's honestly been a long time coming that i've been able to be frightened,while watching a movie. The characters are all beautiful developed,along with giving us a heroine who is strong,vulnerable,but most importantly,one we can root for in Vera Farmiga. The film's real strength comes from Isabelle Fuhrman. She's scarier then any Damien,and shockingly enough scarier then most of the Horror characters that exist now a days. Whenever she is on screen we feel the fear,we feel the tension. The makeup for Isabelle is truly remarkable. Never have I seen anyone look as frightening as she did in the finale,trust me you'll feel the same way. It's rare that a Horror film is so unpredictable,to be honest I didn't have a clue on what was gonna happen,you really don't see that in Horror films anymore,so I thought that was great.Performances. Vera Farmiga is one of my favorite current actresses,she is able to provide a great performance,no matter the genre. Here she puts on a captivating show. She is strong,yet vulnerable at the same time. We feel for her loss,we can see the pain she's trying to hide,but she's never unsympathetic,she's able to make us be on her side the whole way. Peter Sarsgaard plays his role well,however I felt he was nothing but a sleaze ball. His character often felt cold and desperate,I could never get into him. Isabelle Fuhrman gives one of the scariest performances of all time. Her performance is hall of fame worthy as far as kid actors go. The 1st time you see her on screen,you will know. CCH Pounder did well with what she had to do,she's always a competent actress. Jimmy Bennett&amp;Aryana Engineer are actually likable kid actors,as a result we are able to care for them.Bottom Line. Orphan is one of the best Horror films I've seen in sometime. It has all the main ingredients to be an effective Horror film. Be sure to leave the lights on when you spin this in your DVD Player,better yet turn them all off,and scare yourself silly!.Highly recommended.9/10</fullReview>

I challenge you to view this and "Atonement" at one sitting and consider which child gives a more powerful, richly nuanced and emotionally devastating performance. If Miss Ronan was nominated, surely should Miss Fuhrman.Watch her eyes in the dinner table scene when the family discusses her classmate's tumble from the play structure. The little girl covers the soul-wrenching subtexts in all of the vivid spectrum of emotions.And if you're not moved by the brief scene when Esther goes to her little sister and pleas for help when the evil nun comes to take her away -- again, watch her eyes -- then you have no heart.Moreover, the girl's courage in confronting the Last Great Taboo not only of cinema but of Western civilization must assure us that she holds the key to a career that promises monumental achievement.I know I was not alone when I left my first screening of "Interview With The Vampire" convinced I had watched Miss Dunst give the Best Supporting Actress performance. I hope this disappointment will not be repeated.</fullReview>

Both father and mother likes the child . The child adopted girl is very well mannered with every one until she started doing things which child should not do like a jealousy if some other makes fun or talk about her mistakes or spoofs .She started Doing nasty things which include killing and Torturing to her half brother and Sister. When things get nasty mother tried to find out her past and origin which turned out to be more nasty girl is actually a mental patient.Not only a mental she has some other big problem which i will not tell cause it is main climax of the movie .At the end : I thought Child's play Chuck y or Jigsaw puppet of saw is most cruel in small size but this girl orphan blow my mind away must watch or rent as DVD</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I expected this to be just another "evil child" film, but it turned into a very pleasant surprise and is one of the finest new horror movies I've seen in quite awhile, from the maker of 2005's HOUSE OF WAX (which I also enjoyed). A young couple with two children adopt a very unique little Russian girl who turns out to be a terror with a past history nobody could have known. The first half hour or so plays like a typical "bad seed" formula movie, but once it kicks into gear it remains intense, intriguing, and frightening, with a twist. Performances are top notch all the way around, with young Isabelle Fuhrman especially effective as the title character. I'm not sure whether or not this is a remake of anything that's gone before, but if it is it's a damn good one. Also contains one memorable movie quote delivered by the Orphan one evening when she confronts her new stepbrother in his room. ***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

I wasn't necessarily wrong, but it was a lot less cheesy than I expected and a lot more shocking.I know everyone keeps talking about the twist ending, but it really deserves to be talked about. When the marketing campaign featured the statement, "You'll never guess her secret," I remember thinking that was a fairly bold statement to make. Well, they were right. The twist is brilliant and puts this movie into a level higher than it would have been otherwise.The young girl who played Esther was really incredible. It's a shame she won't get any serious recognition for this movie because I definitely think it was the best acting I've seen all year, and that is quite a feat considering she's only 12 years old. Her performance alone makes this movie worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was disgustingly bad. The orphan was a psychotic b***h who got away with everything, and it was due mostly to the imbecilic husband. I can't believe they could write a husband/father who could be that naive and stupid. All that character did was make me angry. Kudos to Peter Sarsgaard for playing that dumb ass character so convincingly.This movie suffers from a fatal flaw: bad writing. Every time that psycho b***h decided to kill someone, the writers made sure the setting was perfect for her. Worse yet, every victim was a character I liked a lot. The one character I hoped she would get...well, you know. A good horror flick shouldn't make you angry enough that your blood is boiling at the end.A good horror flick usually has an element of humor somewhere in it. This had none. And that Jimmy Durante song during closing credits...give me a freakin' break!I'm so sorry to have to bash this flick because my favorite actress, Vera Farmiga, stars in it. She was fantastic, as always. I love her in every movie she's made, and until this one, I've loved her movies as well. I just wish she would have passed on this one because I never would have bought the movie in the first place.This movie was disgusting. I recommend a pass on this one. It just might make you as angry as it did me.As much as I love Vera Farmiga, I'm so sorry I bought this flick. There go two hours of my life I'll never get back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I tried to like "Orphan". I really tried.Sadly, I wasn't able to enjoy this movie at all, mostly because for the incredible annoying and stupid character of John (Played by Peter Sarsgaard) Honestly, he was the dumbest and the most irritating character that I have seen in any other horror movie before.There are many horror films with dumb characters, but he takes the cake: His annoying obliviousness about the extremely obvious evilness of Esther kills the movie for me. I know that this is just a movie, but there is a limit for everything. In real life, nobody could be so stupid as John.Not that I have something against dumb characters, but John is not even likable: He is not only a complete idiot, but also incredibly annoying as well. All what he does in this movie is infuriating to the point of making this movie a very unpleasant and tedious experience. The other characters were clichés, but at least none of them were so annoying as John.Good horror movies as "The Shining", "The Exorcist", "Hellraiser" "The Evil Dead" and "Braindead" didn't need those kind of clichéd (or annoying) characters in order to create their excellent stories. But I have to admit that this was much better than the previous horror movie of Jaume Collet-Serra, the remake of "House of Wax".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Twisted Film with Depraved Undertones</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By all means never never let children see this film. I was drawn into an early morning viewing of Orphan when I saw Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard in an initial scene. They are marvelous actors and typically in movies worth watching, and, at first, the plot seemed intriguing. Then the movie starts spinning its tale of this evil child worse than the Omen's Damien. But that's not what makes the film awful, it's the manipulation of both the children and the audience as it builds the beyond belief evilness of the title character.On top of the depravity towards the end of the film which I will not "spoil" nor do I want to discuss further, the film deteriorates into down right silliness, which would make you laugh if it weren't so morbid. I highly recommend skipping this film, and can't stress enough how children should never be allowed to watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is a strange way with critics.They go on slashing every second horror movie because its 'nothing different'.At least to that extent,I agree but what else they want.I went into theater expecting an evil adopted child type slasher movie. with no character development and some cheap shocks,well i was shocked but in a quite positive way..People who say this is offensive to orphans should stop watching movies,If thats the case then every movie made in a hospital is offensive for doctors and so on.Come on Guys and Gals,The team of this movie has given us very different after a long time.Its no Jig-saw-influenced-supervillian -effort at all,rather this movie till a Very surprising ending (won't reveal because thats the best part of the movie) keeps you shivering because all its scares you see are not different,but the focus is different,an Orphan 9 year old from Russia..The story or basic plot can be read anywhere so I wont go there.But I definitely want to recommend it to everyone who wants a genuinely different scary stuff.The acting performances top of all by the orphan girl (Isabelle Fuhrman) is something never seen by a child in a horror movie.The only such performances by children in horrors can be compared to 1961 "Innocents" and 2001 "The Others".Vera Farmiga as Alcoholic-neurotic-loving mom has given a very mature performance.Peter Saarsgard is OK too..Camera Angles,Lighting and the general atmosphere of the movie is on par for what it was meant to be..No one can conclude the review of this movie without mentioning one of greatest Twist Endings of all.I am a doctor and I didn't see it coming.(You will know when you watch it),it really left my mouth open for a while..So the final verdict is if you missed this movie in theaters,buy the DVD when its out.Your money won't be wasted,its a very very mature,original,horror movie which takes itself very seriously and there is nothing offensive about it at all..Don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warning. Suspenseful horror!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Plenty of suspense and anxiety to keep you wiggling in your seat. Kudos to Jaume Collet-Serra's direction of David Johnson's gritty screenplay. Wishes of a home sweet home go to the wayside, when Kate Coleman(Vera Farmigo)and husband John(Peter Sarsgaard), who recently lost a baby due to miscarriage, decide to adopt. Ready or not the couple visit an orphanage, where they meet Esther(Isabelle Fuhrman), a dark haired, dark eyed mature nine-year-old. The adoption seems to be a fresh start for all; except for the other two Coleman children. Not long after bringing Esther home, a series of accidents at home and school lead Kate to believing that her new daughter is not as innocent as she seems. John doesn't see the young girl's wicked side and loses confidence in his wife. No one really knows the truth about Esther's past...until it is almost too damn late.The snowy winter weather and demure creepy music blend into the anxious atmosphere. You can feel the simmering fear and the few scenes of real violence are definitely graphic. Miss Fuhram is an outstanding young actress. In this role she is mesmerizing. She appears to have the tools already for a very interesting career. Also in the cast: CCH Pounder, Jimmy Bennett and an impressive young Aryana Engineer. To me, ORPHAN has what you go to the movies for. Yes, some images are disturbing and the language is coarse; but still I recommended highly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seen that mediocre (to put it lightly ), unoriginal and full of gore horror movies like HALLOWEEN or Friday THE 13TH receive very good comments (and even get remade ) I quit the genre until I was invited to the pre-screening of ORPHAN and was greatly surprised. ORPHAN was directed by an European director I barely heard about; Jaume Collet-Serra (and I see hundreds of European movies every year). He directed GOAL II a movie and HOUSE OF WAX. I saw part of the first in a plane years ago; without paying much attention because I am not fond of sports movies. To my surprise; ORPHAN does not rely on easy scares or heavy gore to get the thrills. It uses kids as the main victims; and just for that we are already frightened; but the perfectly staged scenes involving them like the tree house or the car going down the cliff are the most terrifying scenes I saw in years. Pure cinema and camera work. This is an American produced movie with European pace. Is more interested in create suspense; as it will become horror later; thus the two hours direction.If this movie has a problem are very little. The tension becomes exhausting sometimes; however there are not fillings; just a lot of ideas and a crescendo that obviously require some extra time. The end is sadly on USA standards and damages and almost perfect movie; but it will probably satisfy most of the public</fullReview>

The horror element is created only by the sound effects and some poor well known director techniques. It is full of impossible events, I know its just a movie but if it wasn't a horror not even the 12 year old children would believe it. The acting is not bad but having in mind all the other bad parts it doesn't deserve watching. There are bunch of other much better movies in the same genre with much less rating. The whole idea is already kind of worn off. The movie creates the feeling that you know what's going to happen in the next few minutes and HOW, and it actually happens as you thought it would. As a conclusion - the worst 2 hours I've recently spent for a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just came from the theater and I'm so frustrated I don't know where to start. This is the first time i write a review in IMDb because the movie was so bad i need to express it and share it with someone. I will try not to write any spoilers in case you still want to see the movie after reading this.The hole plot of the movie is a copy of "The good son", except that it has a girl instead of a boy, and that it is much worse in every sense. The problem is not the acting, its the script. If you expect a horror movie: It's not scary at all, the only way they try to scare you is with cheap and lame "jump" scenes that add nothing to the plot, and make not much sense at all. If you expect an intelligent drama: The plot itself is lame, most of the characters are plain stupid, they act in ways people with at least two neurons wouldn't. I heard many times in the theater people saying "how can this guy be so stupid to do that?". This makes it impossible for you to feel pity for them when and if they die. The problem is that every single character acts stupid.I usually don't see the twists coming in movies, but in this movie i could see most twists from a hundred miles away... all so cliché.If you like not-believable movies, with dumb characters, predictable twists, and slow pace.... then this is the movie for you.Otherwise, don't spend any money in this or you will feel scammed like me.Thank you for reading this and letting my frustration go out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>RACIST nonsense with low artistic quality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why is it that all horrible characters in the movies have to come from Eastern Europa, South America, Africa, Asia etc? Generally from the countries the white native English speaking movie makers know nothing about? There it is - a nice middle class white-western-native-English-speaking couple falls into prey of an Eastern European monster, a cunning nutcase who has run away from a little Eastern European country in North of Europa. I have been in that country and it is a totally normal European country with nice normal everyday people. Just as nice and normal as the western white couple in the film. But making the monster coming from that particular country is also brandmarking the country as dark and dangerous in the subconsciousness of white western movie audiences.It was not necessary for the story line for the monster to come from asylum in Eastern Europa. She could have run away from the asylum located in their own pretty western English speaking home country.There are evil nutcases available in every country of the world, just as there are nice and normal people in every country in the world. From artistic point of view the script, acting and directing was mediocre if not worse. Some scenes were ridiculous such as when the little monster tries to seduce her stepdad. The whole audience in the cinema was laughing at that scene.Instead of watching this racist and offensive nonsense, I would recommend Case 39. It is a thriller with similar (not exactly same!)story line, but has a proper artistic quality and some very good acting works.</fullReview>

It does stop eventually after about 847 and a half hours, by which time you're wondering are pyramid tea-bags better than circular ones, and did we really go to the moon.I should point out that the actors aren't to blame, the acting is okay. The director also doesn't really mess anything up (although the direction doesn't stand out either). It's the screenplay/writing/script here which is so utterly generic and devoid of inspiration that the whole thing falls flat. Nothing happens in this movie which hasn't been done before and better, and that's slightly depressing. THE OMEN remains the ultimate scary-kid-gone-bad movie for my money, and will probably never be topped.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine, but still room for improvement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Orphan" is a horror mystery thriller from 6 years ago and was the sixth directorial effort for Jaume Collet-Serra. The writer duo Johnson/Mace, however, have not made come up with a script before this one, which makes their work even more impressive. The script is certainly among the strongest aspects of this 2-hour movie. Another strength is child actress Isabelle Fuhrman, who certainly elevated this film with her performance. Farmiga was fine too and she was as much of a lead as Fuhrman, but there were sequences, during which she felt really more loud than spot-on with her performance. And finally, the makeup needs a mention too as they carried this movie in terms of the main character's impressive and slow transformation from young girl into middle-aged woman.Unfortunately, there are also weaknesses. The main one may be Sarsgaard. I don't think it was necessarily a problem I had with his performance, but the character was just so bland and stereotypical. He had an affair back in the day, he does not see how evil the girl is etc. and all this was done so that we would not feel sorry for him after what happens in the end. But is this attempt at justification really necessary? I don't think so. He does not have to be bad to die and there really would not have been anything wrong with a good guy dying, so we even feel sorry for him in this scenario. And how did he die to the girl with a knife while the girl could not even take out Farmiga's character with a gun. Apart from that, she was also a bit too much heroic at the end and in the film in general after we find out everything. She was like the perfect mother/wife who saw through everything so quickly. Or it was ridiculous how the police was always a minute too late. Or the uninspired attempt to create atmosphere with stuff like broken drawers.Still I must say that the final sequence was very nicely done. It was good drama, very atmospheric and a thrilling confrontation scene between the two main characters. The only scene I'd put slightly above that was the early one on the playground with the twisted ankle. The camera work up there was outstanding this moment. Overall, I must say I quite enjoyed this movie. I would not have minded an even bolder unhappy ending, but it was okay the way they did it. The only other movie I saw from the director was "Unknown" and I enjoyed that one even more. I sure like his stuff and I recommend "Orphan". A very good watch for horror movie fans and I liked that there was no supernatural evil possession element in here. That was absolutely not needed. Nature can be a much bigger freak. This film does not really offer anything innovative that we have not seen before, but it's still a good watch. And finally, if you liked Fuhrman the way I did, feel free to check out the series "Masters of Sex", in which she plays a recurring character.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am sorry but I have to use some spoilers to review this movie, otherwise I just cannot emphasize how awesome it is. Still, you can watch it and enjoy it.So to begin with, Orphan is a thriller movie that didn't scare me at all. I don't think it aims to, either. It does, however, thrill you. A lot. The story itself is great. You won't see it coming until you see it. How that story is told is even better. But what you'll find truly astonishing is Isabelle Fuhrman's (Esther) performance. She'll make you adore her, she'll make you fear her, she'll then make you feel sorry for her. And in the end, you'll feel truly upset that the villain died. I am not exaggerating when I'm saying she deserves an Oscar for this role. And let me remind you that Isabelle was 11 years old when this movie was filmed. Wow.Don't let the fact that Isabelle was 11 trick you though, this isn't a movie you should watch with your 11 year-old kid; there is blood. Not too much, but enough to immerse you into the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I'm typing this, I'm just finishing up Orphan (2009), a beyond horrific tale of a seemingly young &amp; talented 9 year old Russian girl, who gets adopted by a young couple who's suffered a miscarriage among other rifts in their marriage. Their decision to adopt Esther (the girl's name) seems like a blessing in the skies, until problems with the kids at school and even her new brother make Esther show her true colours gradually more and more.I'm going to be honest with you, creeped out would be an understatement for how I feel right now. Esther's demeanour, her actions, everything about her just sickened me to my core, I never knew a fictional character could ever possibly be this evil. Evil! And I don't say that word lightly. Not only is this a horror film, it's a psychological thriller, at best. Plus it doesn't help how Esther is tormenting and manipulating the very family that took her in throughout the movie.I was amused with The Exorcist (1973) for the most part. What seemed appalling and barbaric back then seems like child's play nowadays, and I can safely say Orphan is this century's Exorcist, hands down.</fullReview>

Product designer did a really good job with the house. None of the actors were gorgeous but their chemistry was very believable. Violence is faithfully and graphically depicted.

		<shortDescription>Nothing great, but not horrible.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alright, this is the FIRST time IMDb actually failed me. This movie is not a 7.2. I think what happened here is some kids found out how to use IMDb ratings from their parents and began to soak up some bandwidth with horribly proportioned reviews. So let's set the record straight.This movie was not 7.2. I consider something from IMDb with a 7+ to be pretty amazing. My own score is a 6, because it's nothing I'd go out of my own wallet to see again or really enjoy watching twice. However if a buddy wants to turn it on during a boring point of the day or night, it's not gonna make you want to rip your own face off.First off let's just state the obvious. This movie has NO SCARY PARTS in it. I like to think I am very easily scared. I didn't jump at all. I looked to my brother and asked 'who the hell said this was scary?' and he replied, 'I think it's supposed to be suspenseful.' Wrong. I was more so laughing and commentating through the bulk of the movie.Second Off, this isn't a rip off of the Omen or the good son. The ending of this movie is what made it jump from a 4 to a 6. If you see the ending coming, good for you. I didn't see it coming (although I wasn't getting to involved with the story) and it was a pretty awesome revelation.The characters were also well done. I enjoyed every character and each one served their purpose. This movie also doesn't give the heroes a butt ton of ex-machina (like most movies seem to have plenty in stock). Nope, they generally do it to it on their own without the help of crappy writers, which make the more tense situations, more believable.Either way, this movie isn't all that, but it certainly isn't horrible either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Orphan-Too Long, Too Wrong, and Too Sad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING THIS PIECE CONTAINS SPOILERS DO NOT READ BEYOND THIS POINT IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE.When we first open up on The Orphan we are introduced to a horrific scene that jolts us into the reality of the movie. In that respect, this is a startlingly amazing entrance, however the remainder of the movie fails to live up to the tone set at the beginning. Once, removed from that scene the rest of the movie strikes us as slow paced and boringly predictable. (Excluding the twist which, respectfully, was hard to see)By about thirty minutes into the movie we are finally introduced to Esther. It may not be thirty minutes, but after twenty or so I felt like Peter Griffin in Family Guy, that scene where he talks about making it ten minutes into "Failure to Launch" then stands up and in a clear voice says "Done!" Sadly, this movie makes me feel the same way. The acting was very well done, and one could not look at the performances and say anything negative about it. Instead, looking at the story and visual choices, there are some annoying and downright irritating events. In particular the choice to finally fulfill the tension at every third point. It seems that the Director over uses the familiar jump out and scare us tactics so many times that someone could have told the audience when to actually be afraid. The effect of said scare tactics wore off by the time we get to the playground scene with Esther. Story wise there are a few plot holes and things that seem unnecessary. John and Kate's conversation about John cheating on Kate many years ago doesn't add anything to the story. It shows up only once, twice if you count the playground scene as flirtatious, and only causes the audience to question John more than Esther. It takes away from whom we want to know more about.However, despite these things that were discovered to be wrong, the movie did have impressive moments. Aside from the plot holes the script stands firm, needing only a few re-writes to truly hammer in its point. The acting is superb and the actual camera work and lighting strike as well motivated. While one couldn't recommend anyone buy this movie, seeing it in the theatre at least once would not be beyond recommendation. 7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very well made and acted, but this can't help its indescribably horrible ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would've never thought that this movie would degenerate so much. Most of its second half is just immensely stupid and unbearably preposterous. While the beginning is suspenseful and seems to build up a good horror movie with a snowballing amount of frightening scenes, it just totally falls apart at the end. I could have lived with some of the absurd stuff happening in Orphan before, but at some point it was just enough. It decayed in illogical, dumbly disturbing horror action that wasn't enjoyable in any possible way. This is pretty disappointing regarding the way the movie started and continued during the first hour: it kept you interested about Esther, the screenplay introduced us better to the other parts of the family as well, the scenes that were supposed to scare you scared me. Everything like it should be in a good psychological horror. But when the grotesque truth about Esther is finally revealed, I was sitting there like "This is why I usually don't like horror movies." It was a very unpleasant experience, not only because of the extremely disturbing things the orphan girl did in this movie, but also because it leaves you sitting there, pondering about why you've ever took this movie seriously. Okay, Isabelle Fuhrmann did a surprising job as Esther although I didn't enjoy her that much since the screenplay wasn't really good, and Vera Fermiga was a good lead, mostly. However, this ending just makes you angry because it totally destroys a movie that could've been good, but ends up being an imbecile disaster. Seriously, this ending was one of the worst I've seen in movie history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie starts out at its strongest and then begins to slow down at around the halfway point. By the time the ending has been reached, the entire movie has fallen apart and will only completely irritate and annoy any avid movie goer. The mother (Vera Farmiga) proves to only constantly endanger her children and takes very little initiative, which creates a very weak and predictable ending. The father (Peter Sarsgaard) is even more dull than the mother and adds very little to the story. Collet- Serra's directing is very Hollywood style and is just okay. If someone is bored and wants to watch a mindless average horror film, then this movie will suffice. However, if someone is looking for a good horror film with complex and interesting characters with a strong screenplay, then this is not the film to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thoughtful commentary on Adoption in America</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In early 2009, America was mired in an epidemic: adoption fever. From Madonna to Branjelina, to Tom Cruise to Michelle Pfeiffer, Americans were at odds with the notion of traditional parenthood. Instead, they traveled afar, to the impoverished nations of Africa and Asia in search of children. The more impoverished the child, the greater the status symbol. It seemed as if the party would never end, and that America would continue to fuel its adoption-binge with foreign babies.Americans were given a sobering expose on the risks of adoption when The Orphan was released in theaters nationwide. The story of Esther (based on true events that took place in 1980s Nevada), gave a reality check to hopeful couples - couples who were caught up in the furor of adoption-mania. Esther's story should serve as a profound reminder of the tribulations all parents face.Sure, kids are cute. They make nice accessories when you're looking to fill seats in your minivan. But every once in a while, they'll set the house on fire, or bludgeon you to death with a hammer. And Esther's story brings these notions to the forefront of our collective consciousness.A must-see for couples looking to adopt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Orphan, directed by Jaume Collet-Serra; whose earlier effort includes Goal II : Living for Dreams; is a movie about a couple Kate and John Coleman (played by the current toast of Hollywood Vera Farmiga; and Peter Saarsgard); who have two kids. Kate suffers a miscarriage in her third pregnancy (rendered brilliantly in the opening sequence); and consequently decides to adopt a third child. Enter Esther; a seemingly introvert, mature girl to whom both of them take an immediate liking. Papers are signed, documents passed over; and Esther is on her way to meet the family; delighting the Kate and John with her efforts to learn sign language( one of the kids is a deaf-and-dumb).And then, Esther slowly starts to unravel her true character, as the kids first; and the parents later on realize that she is most definitely not what she seems...The movie fires up with a scorching opening sequence; showing Kate being carried off for her third child; and suddenly there is blood all around; and John is filming her with a handy cam!Surely she must be hallucinating! The rest of the movie falls in the realm of the conventional thriller with the kid gone bad routine; however it is an extremely well done routine. The movie does not shy away from graphic violence; and at the same time the director also gives us genuinely creepy moments; like the playground castle sequence.The twist in the end is the game changer/deal breaker : from what I have read in other reviews; this one works for some; does not work for others. It worked for me; in that in gave a satisfying explanation to what was happening in the movie; whether outside that it holds water or not is an entirely different matter.The acting is also solid; with Vera Farmiga(she's everywhere now suddenly!; what with her big break in The Departed) delivering a believable performance. Esther, portrayed by Isabelle Fuhrman also pulls in a really good show.Overall, yes, a must-see; with being one of the better thriller/horror movies to come out in recent years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just finished this film and I have to say, that I was very impressed. There are not a lot of horror films out now that have the kind of creepy suspenseful vibe of the classics, but this one has it! I think the real challenge of the film was that you know from the get go that the orphan is something evil. The trailers show it, the poster implies it. The trick was to make you wonder how the family was going to handle it. They did a great job, I am usually pretty good at guessing the twist, but I didn't guess this one. I wasn't even looking! I also really loved the fact that this film didn't rely on gore or sex to drive the show. So many films are just one strange and brutal kill scene after another (Cough Saw Cough) but this one had a good story, a strong and well thought out back story and brings you along for the ride.Not so much a horror, more a suspense thriller.

		<fullReview>Rented this one the week it was released and definitely didn't feel cheated. All the elements are there to make this a great thriller. There's the, from the get go, slightly offkey orphan child, Esther. There's the increasingly odd and, ultimately sociopathic, behavior of Esther. There's the growing atmosphere of gloom and threat to the family who adopts Esther. There's the mother, with her own issues, who is the only one who seems to realize that Esther is not what she's cracked up to be. The script is intelligent, direction well-paced and full of surprises and the cast is excellent.The child lead, Isabelle Fuhrman, who plays Esther is excellent. The fact that she is only 12 (and probably 10 when this was filmed) is truly noteworthy. Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard, as the parents, are terrific. But, once again, enough cannot be said about the performance turned in by Fuhrman.The movie was the subject of a major public hating campaign by adoption advocates when it was released. Once again, an entertainment vehicle was slammed because some people, who believed their oxen were being gored alleged the entertainment vehicle was delivering a message they didn't like. Bottomline, the film company had to add a disclosure at the beginning of the film to the effect that "adoptions happen all the time and you won't end up with a psycho killer, really." Just plain stupid because the real message of the flick is to check your disbelief at the door, sit back and enjoy a good flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ISABELLE FUHRMAN, VERA FARMIGA and PETER SARSGAARD are hardly household names to me but they do a superb job of carrying the main suspense ingredients of ORPHAN--as does the atmospheric photography filmed among snowy Canadian landscapes.So do all the other members of the cast--all very convincing in their roles, especially the little deaf girl ARYANA ENGINEER. She's adorable and becomes a pawn in the manipulations of Esther (Fuhrman), the orphan adopted into the household before a background check can reveal the truth about her past.Of course, anyone familiar with the pattern of most horror films of this ilk can spot some of the usual set-ups: a husband who is clueless about seriously suspecting the orphan can be evil, the wife whom nobody believes because she has a drinking problem, the little brother who resents the intrusion of a "different" kind of girl, the well meaning nun whose social worker instincts will lead to her downfall.But many other aspects of the plot come as a surprise and are, to say the least, unexpected and shockingly gruesome.And some threads of the plot can be suspected pretty early on. Still, the final twist at the end is shocking and satisfying, thanks to the performance Fuhrman has so convincingly given. She plays the role with such sweet and sometimes sinister maturity that the final revelation is acceptable.ORPHAN delivers the chills, all staged brilliantly and turning it into a horror film that is just as chilly as the ever snowy weather with frozen ponds and feathery flakes making the indoor sets of a rustic cabin look most inviting.Good direction and superior art decoration, as well as strong performances, makes this an above average thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie of the day: "Orphan"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, so I'll admit that I didn't go into "Orphan" expecting much. I originally didn't want to see the film, I had absolutely zero interest in seeing it, but I had the opportunity to see it with a girl I liked, so what the hell? I'll take a chance, and $10.25 at the local theater. I don't think "Orphan" is nearly as bad as it could have been, or as bad as people are making it out to be.Yes, the film does concern Esther (Isabelle Furhman), a cute 9-year-old Russian girl who is adopted by the Colemans, Kate (Vera Farmiga) and John (Peter Sarsgaard), who already have a young son and deaf-mute daughter. But pretty soon, the new addition to the family reveals a much darker and twisted side to her personality as a murderous psychopath that has been well-advertised in the commercials.The movie has caused some controversy in the weeks leading up to its release, stemming from the "myths" about people adopting older children. My response is that "Orphan" is just a movie; it's a work of fiction and I don't think this movie will put people off from adopting older children.The movie brings back memories of such "evil child" movies such as "The Omen" and "The Bad Seed," so we know where the plot is going to take us before it has a chance to waste our time and patience arriving at that moment. The film's big "plot twist" revealing the truth about Esther's murderous dark side two-thirds of the way through "Orphan" will not be a surprise to more thoughtful viewers, but at least it's made believable within the context of the film.There are also some funny parts in the movie as well, though I'm unsure if they were intentional or not on the part of the filmmakers, particularly director Jaume Collet-Serra and screenwriter David Johnson. Maybe it was intentional or not, but maybe it's because the laughs were aimed at the people who were two rows in front of us and who were whooping and hollering and screaming at the screen every time something scary happened...6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>starts of finteresting, but then comes Esther....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Orphan opens with one of those truly mortifying scenes that can actually go beyond typical horror into something else, that visceral terror that comes with a catastrophic event. This being the death of a baby, as Kate Coleman (Vera Farmiga) is about to give birth, sees blood under her gown waiting in the hospital, and is told her child has died before even giving birth. Then it gets more and more disturbing: her husband John is filming this devastating scene with his camcorder, and he presents the dead baby to her as she's sobbing in tears. It's safe to say this and The Descent's opening scene are top them all when it comes to the worst scenes that involve personal, familial horror with children (in the most gratifying way imaginable, if that make sense, when it comes to filming it).And then the rest of the plot unfolds... and it never matches up to that, and if anything becomes sillier and more predictable, a Lifetime movie in Omen-skin or Good Son clothing. While early on we get a moving scene with Kate and her little girl Max and how she reads to her at night even though she's deaf, and we get the sense this will be well acted, then comes a scene that turns everything else that will happen in the movie. Esther, from the moment she appears on screen, has not a shred of subtlety about her, nor in Isabelle Fuhrman's performance. You know from her oh-so sweet little speech to her soon-to-be stepfather that this is just trouble. A big part of it, I think, is that her character is European (thought to be Russian for at least most of the movie) and so she's like Natasha Fatale in miniature form and pigtails. To say she's unbelievable is an understatement, even if once or twice among the DOZENS of times she's hiding behind a corner or behind a door listening it gets creepy.But boy oh boy is this movie silly. You get sucked into the story, and it's entertaining, but it's also ultimately about as substantial as a daytime soap opera with the big TWIST so preposterous that you'll be laughing about it long after the movie ends (not to mention a few questions about, you know, the difference between little girls and adult women). It relies on clichés eventually, and it's sad since Vera Farmiga and Stellan Sarsgaard are trying their best to give genuine dramatic performances. They aren't anything to laugh at, at least too much, but it's the script that wears it down, those situations and scenes where Esther ratchets up her evil-bitch-meter or kills another hapless person who may "rat" on her. It ends up being a great audience movie, but also so stupid and without much worth or for anything we've heard (i.e. the lesson is, I guess, don't adopt any child from Russia or whatever-stan, or that two is sometimes enough), and the violence compounds the silliness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Right off let me say that Isabelle did a fantastic performance with her role as Esther. She has a lot of depth for someone so young. All the actors did a commendable job with the material they had.My problems were with the script and directing/production. I read others say the movie had the guts to go in a direction uncharted. While I thought the so-called "surprise" was novel, they seemed to have done a cop-out at every opportunity they could to avoid any controversy.If you removed the few bloody scenes, it was nothing more than a Lifetime Channel movie about a family needing counseling. Nothing after the surprise has not been done before and done better.Their decision to make the final scenes in such dark settings was contrived, frustrating and deliberate. It was actually hard to see and follow what was even happening at the theater I attended !! It's difficult to go into details as I do not want to give any spoilers here, I'll reserve that for the Forum board. Parts were fun,, parts were frustrating and the sum was disappointing..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have watched a lot of movies about "bad children", but this one is the WORST! it is not only boring, it is most frustrating! It has NO storyline, NO suspense, the characters all have NO brains! It's just a string of murders and mayhem committed by the bitch girl, and then everyone says "how can it be her? She's from Russia!" and the same thing just goes on and on for 2 hours! NO story development, no character development, nobody has anything to say except repeating the same words again and again. I don't understand what's the use of the stupid deaf girl, as she doesn't seem to be able to comprehend anything that is going on and contributes nothing to the story. Is this a real movie or just a grade school project?? The people who made this must be so stupid they can't even dress themselves!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very creepy and well done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So after a very frightening trailer, Orphan looked like a very interesting movie, even though we have done many of the evil children films, sometimes it doesn't hurt to see a new twist to the story. Even the rating on IMDb kept going up and up after a few weeks, so I checked out Orphan and over all while it's a very strange movies and no doubt has some flaws here and there, it's a very effective and chilling horror movie. What truly makes the movie though are the top notch performances we get. Isabelle Fuhrman who plays Esther, this little girl is only 12 years old?! I can't believe how well she did, how creepy and charming she could be, her presence on screen was absolutely sensational. Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard who play the adoptive parents are perfect, their chemistry was on key and also are heart breaking to watch as you see their marriage on the shakes over this manipulative little girl that is just plain evil.Kate and John Coleman are having problems in their marriage after Kate's third child was stillborn. The loss is particularly hard on Kate, who is still recovering from a drinking habit that cost her her job. They adopt Esther, a 9-year-old Russian girl they had met, from the local orphanage. While Kate and John's daughter Max embraces Esther, their son Daniel is less welcoming. Kate grows suspicious when Esther, who watched Kate and John have sex, expresses far more knowledge of sex and its slang than would be expected for a child her age. Kate is further alarmed when Sister Abigail, the head of the orphanage, warns her and John about Esther's tendency to be around when things go wrong. Esther overhears this and later silences Sister Abigail forever. John does not believe Kate, despite continued ominous behavior by Esther. Kate learns that Esther was housed at a mental institution in Estonia called the Saarne Institute. Daniel decides to go to the police. However, Esther sets the tree house on fire, intending to get rid of Daniel. Daniel escapes by falling out of the tree, and gets a severe neck injury. Esther again tries to kill him at the hospital by smothering him with a pillow. As doctors rush to save Daniel, Kate angrily knocks Esther down for doing that and is sedated by doctors. But Esther isn't done yet with her plan, but what's wrong with Esther? Well, apparently she's the hand that is rocking the cradle.While Orphan is a good movie, it does have it's share of flaws here and there. Kate slaps Esther severely when she suspects Esther of trying to murder her son, in front of people no less, yet somehow no police are called and she can walk easily out of the hospital after being sedated. Also how did the parents adopt a child only after 3 weeks of meeting her? Normally this takes a good long while, admittedly this is a movie, but still I'm supposed to believe this? Also even though the ending was a good twist, sadly after seeing way too many movies I was able to figure out what the ending was before everyone finds out all together. But if you have continued to read my comment this long I would actually recommend this movie if you let go of the little flaws here and there, this was a very entertaining thrill ride of a movie. This is one of the better movies I have seen this year and it's definitely worth the watch.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the parents didn't deserve any children at all, so unlikable, horrible movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The child actors in this movie were amazing. Absolutely believable, great actors. The adult actors were fine, i suppose, but the characters they were portraying are horrible people who shouldn't have had custody of any children at all. The father is an idiot who should have taken his kids from his wife a long time ago and left her high and dry. The mother is an alcoholic with one child who really needs attention, another who is disabled and another that passed away. The mother only ever pays attention to her own needs to the point that one of the kids fell in an iced over pond and nearly drowned because mom was too blitzed to care. Said mother also lost her job for alcoholism. And lost a baby, before during or after the alcoholism, the movie doesn't specify. The father constantly whines and mopes about her being a horrible parent but does absolutely nothing to protect his children. The mother has bipolar tendencies and serious anger issues she takes out on her kids, after ignoring them while dreaming about another bottle. So, the solution to these problems is to adopt another child, says this movie. We get to watch these two horrible parents, a father too self involved to care about the safety of his children, and a mother who is too addicted to care about the safety of her children, spiral even further into their selfish problems while a whacked out adult with a disease that stopped her from aging twenty or thirty years ago takes advantage of this completely jacked up family, nearly kills the kids, and does kill a few other people. And the end of the movie? The happy ending we'll all be satisfied with? The kids are rescued by a relative who actually gives a crap about them? Nope, dad is killed and the kids are now left with one parent, their awesome, alcoholic, negligent, horrible mother who'd rather let them drown in a pond than put down the bottle. I can't believe anyone watched this and said, 'wow, i really like this movie, what great family values, everyone wins in the end!' I think the ending was the only good 'horror' part of the movie, as those kids will prob be dead within the year after their mom lets them play in traffic, drink Drano, play with fire, run with scissors, use the chain saw, drive the car or play in an icy pond while she's busy focusing on the important things in life: one or two of the thirty seven bottles of alcohol in the family wet bar. It was disappointing that alcoholism and parenting was portrayed like this in this type of movie. The movie was supposed to be about an orphan, as the title said. However, the scariest parts of the movie were when the mother had any interaction with her kids. As stated above, the ending was horrible and the whole movie left me with a bad taste in my mouth. It also portrayed the adoption process as 'anyone could do it, as long as you have enough money'. I thought there were rigorous background checks, etc. I don't know, maybe other people found this movie entertaining, I did not. I was constantly cringing at the adult themes going on around these kids, at the parents just not caring what they did or said or where they did it and who could walk in on it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It'll be tough to find room in your life for this particular Orphan.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Orphan plays out like a sort of sub-The Omen, sub-Domestic Disturbance (although with a nine year old girl fulfilling the Vince Vaughn role); generic thriller that has its jumps and its fun but isn't really up to much save for the advertising of the cinematographer's abilities and proof its director, Spaniard Jaume Collet-Serra, can string together a decent number of scares and set pieces. The film is, in fact, so ordinary that it requires a man to enter proceedings nearer the end dressed in a white lab coat so as to formally explain to us just what on Earth is going on - this is all just before the daft climax, wherein the adult leads fumble around in the pitch black as our villain of the hour negates precisely the same surroundings with consummate ease. At least Buffalo Bill had a set of night vision goggles.Orphan begins with a middle aged couple whose latest of three children doesn't make it beyond the birth stage. Shattered, with regular trips to therapy and a constant fight required to stave off the temptation to turn to drink, it has hit wife and existing mother Kate Coleman (Farmiga) hard. With her husband, Peter Sarsgaard's John, they hit upon adding to their double act of pre-existing infants through means of adoption so as to bury the misfortune. This means a trip to an orphanage and the picking out of a child who's already got some years on them; something that could bring with it some bother for this family of Lexus driving; piano playing; detached house owning unit in that with adoption, introducing an already abandoned, most likely troubled, child into the mix will bring with it its own set of challenges.Hark, for amidst the other kids who wallow in their charging around and shouting and such lies Esther (Fuhrman), the titular orphan and young girl who's able to meet the Coleman's status in that she philosophises and is greatly skilled in painting. She's calmer than the rest of the orphans; her elevated position in occupying the first floor of the orphanage suggests hierarchy above them and is generally perceived as the perfect selection. Alas, Esther brings with her back to the Coleman's house a terrifying secret; something that would be cruel to reveal given it's the one bright point of the film's runtime, a moment wherein the mind frantically peddles backwards so as to work out if all of the behaviour and such syncs up with where now find ourselves.In the meantime, she's free to frolic with the existing Coleman kids; two children in Dan (Bennett) and Max (Engineer), the latter of whom at this early stage of their life suffers with something that's perfect in how it is Esther will come to get her own way and, wouldn't you just know it, allows indelibly for the screenwriter to exploit the means by which Esther will come to royally screw with this family unit. Dan, the elder of the two existing siblings, is becoming aware of his own bourgeoning sexuality and has for himself a neat tree house 'perched' on a rickety tree beam. Sister Max, however, is deaf thus the sensory deprivation in both speech and sound will often make it tough for her to communicate to her parents when communication to her parents is exactly what's needed.The film comes to unfold in a sad world, a world wherein if you happen to know where Transylvania is, you're labelled a "retard". The look of the world is adeptly gloomy, the greys of winter in this leafy U.S. state syncing up nicely with how this family have befallen this tragedy, but the tone is too frivolous and mainstream for it to be an effective enough horror. The usual traits that often stand up to represent the bane of most modern horror are all here: the recklessness of the parents to share their love with one another in the most accessible of places: the kitchen, as Esther watches on; while John's later conversations with a flirtatious neighbour does little to blunt Esther's gradually desire to manipulate, exploit and ultimately ruin this family. Villains in these sorts of films often get what they want, and the supporting acts often aid them with their languid actions and things are no different here.We've seen this sort of material before, but those unfamiliar with the first Omen sequel, or perhaps even the Child's Play films, will not be impressed. The tale of a child bullied for being different, before realising they have a powerful characteristic over those around them - young and old alike, before thus deciding to go on a bit of a rampage, is almost certainly borrowed from "Damien: Omen II" as bullies trigger this murderous entity who then creatively proceeds to pop anyone off who dares threaten their homicidal run. But hey, if you're into watching the latest mainstream slice of horror thriller fiction, wherein there are some jumps and some frights and a twist that does well to cover up the blandness of everything else, you might want to take Orphan home with you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best thriller in years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Orphan has to be one of the best thrillers to come from Hollywood lately. With everything being remade, there seems to be no more originality in movies these days. With Orphan you're not going to be sitting there watching and thinking "Hey, I've already seen this happen in dozens of movies." and that is what truly makes this film unique from all the other thrillers today.This film is two hours long, but didn't have a boring moment in it. The story and characters working together give you exactly what you paid for. This film doesn't disappoint. A thriller that will have the view grasping onto the edge of their seat from start to finish.Almost every horror/thriller movie these days use CGI, and digitally added special effects to create scars, Orphan does not. The gore and horror in this film is very believable, and very realistic. So much so, that it had me clenching each time a moment like that happened in the film. Orphan is a must see!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>..."Orphan" marks auspicious debuts by the story/screenplay team of Alex Mace and David Johnson, as well as a thoroughly engrossing starring turn from newcomer Isabelle "Hounddog" Fuhrman. There's no question in my mind that this little lady will be an actress to pay attention to in upcoming decades; she is simply outstanding. The rest of the ensemble are no slouches, either: Vera "Quid Pro Quo" Farmiga and Peter "Flightplan" Saarsgard as the unsuspecting parents, CCH "The Shield" Pounder as the kindly nun, Margo "Madge" Martindale as the oblivious shrink, and even Jimmy "Poseidon" Bennett and the adorable newcomer Aryana "I really am deaf" Engineer as the kids in peril. Production values are uniformly top-notch, John "The Usual Suspects" Ottman's score is appropriately unsettling, and Jeff "A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010)" Cutter's camera-work is of a piece.I'd have given "Orphan" even higher marks (and may, in fact, decide to downgrade it on further viewing) if not for the plot hinging on some extreme suspension of disbelief. The ending's twist simply begs far more questions than it can reasonably answer, deflating the impact of the whole affair. Also, and this could easily just be me, I found it somehow difficult to feel much sympathy for such an obviously comfortable, secure family (despite the parents' "problems"); I found myself rooting for the "bad seed" through much of the film, since she was the most interesting, engaging character. There were also a number of "oh, c'mons!" scattered throughout the story that weaken it, which I will leave to Constant Reader to discover.Regardless, "Orphan" is actually pretty decent entertainment if you don't think too hard about its omissions and elisions, certainly worth a rental and/or cheap DVD purchase.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent on the surface, lacking underneath</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A good film - very good looking and excellently acted.The downfall seems to be the lack of real cohesion in the story - not so much that it doesn't make sense, but that there is a lot of points made to have an affect that is not really achieved.A couple adopt a child from an orphanage. She is lovely. She turns out to be a somewhat troubled youngster with psychopathic tendencies. The family is divided - the mother can see the problem, the father believes in the adoptee. Isolation, paranoia, etc, etcBut this story is embellished by back story that is blurted out here and there. The mother has a history of a drink problem - can she be trusted? Yes. She is an extraordinarily competent person and the two points where drink is an issue seem to be jemmied in rather unconvincingly.The husband has roving eyes - again rather obviously illustrated with engineered dialogue and a scene where a woman makes a pass at him. But neither of them exhibit any real problems. He seems to be a most loving and attentive husband, and her an extraordinarily composed wife.The mother-in-law hovers around, presumably keeping an eye on the troubled woman - another illustration of how the wife can not be trusted. Yet she only is given one point to make her presence felt in that capacity and then wanders around like a ghost for the rest of the film neither saying anything nor taking power from the wife.Then we have the police turning up at a crucial time - twice - where they are so obviously waiting in the wings for the resolution before stepping on to the set, that it is annoying.I'll highlight this as a possible spoiler, though I shall be circumspect. There is a twist to the film which is almost entirely pointless - the only possible reason for it is that it makes it OK to give a child a good pasting on the cinema screen.The film is very good quality, just fundamentally lacking. There are many ideas that seem to have been sketched out when they were writing the story that should either have been fully included or totally excluded.They are not to the forefront enough to create the atmosphere that they presumably intend or subtle enough not to intrude rather than contribute.Worth a watch, but not a re-watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good thriller hurt by a pace that allows you to think about the plot holes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A family that is still living in the shadow of the tragedy of a miscarriage decides to adopt an older child. They decided to adopt Ester, a girl who seems much more mature than the rest. However once she settles into house, it rapidly becomes clear that all is not right with the little girl. Well made horror film with a couple of problems that I think keep this film from being great. This is a film that has the look and feel of "bad seed" sort of films down. It hits all the right buttons in just the right way so as to make the tension grow and the skin crawl. The film is a perfect sort of guilty pleasure film.As I said earlier the film has a couple of problems that kind of wound the film. First off the film is too long at just over two hours. More than a couple of times I looked at my watch and wondered how much longer this was going to go on. Its not that what I was seeing was bad, its just that it has a couple of sequences that seemed to go on past the point of optimum effect. The other problem for me is that the film has some plot holes that you can drive a truck through. I'm not talking about the infamous twist which has been a make or break for some people, I'm talking about other things, like no one really checking Ester's background until its way too late. There are a few others (including questions as a result of said twist) that kind of made me go "wah?". I suppose the suspension of belief is whats required for any film like this, but this one really pushes the limit and the audiences good graces.(Perhaps if the film had moved faster I wouldn't have had time to reflect and pull the film apart) Reservations aside this is a good little film. I don't think its the be all and end all but it is the sort of film thats perfect for curling up on the couch with on a rainy Saturday night.Between 6 and 7 out of 10 ----- Re the twist: It worked for me. I can see how it might not for other people, but at the same time its something that raises a hell of a lot more questions then it answers</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Did I miss something? I'm not sure that I watched the same film that all the other reviewers watched. The film I saw was contrived and just plain dumb. First off the whole premise is as silly as silly gets. Woman has a stillborn. Women and husband adopt a very strange little girl who dresses as if she is a stand in at a Heehaw reunion. Why would anyone adopt this bizzaro in the first place? As this plot moves forward we gradually find out that the little girl who we already knew was strange is not only strange but in fact very twisted and violent(of course we knew this in the first 10 minutes). The movie plods through the typical horror/suspense fare at an even pace with Ester (the sick little girl) gradually escalating in her violence. There's no real suspense here. We already knew when we saw the trailer that the "orphan" was going to do bad things--and lo and behold she does bad things. There is a plot twist that smells of the director looking for an easy way to explain why this all happened--stupid. I give it 3 stars only for Vera Farmiga.....great actress.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Please do not misunderstand me. The film keeps the suspense, introduces a few new ideas, but it is the same boring story of a typical thriller. Let's try to break it in a few fragments.Beginning of the film. Here is always something interesting, new idea can rise a video from the average.The center of the film. One person sees something unusual, something that should not have happened. Of course no one believes him/her, or He/She can not prove it. It remains only to wait until everyone around you and of course the police say "sorry, you've been right" Ending. Keeping You on the edge of a seat, because the only person who knew everything finally has found evidence of his/her suspicions. Now it is to save all the "blind" people. Maybe He/She succeed or maybe not ... I won't spoil the ending, but of course as always, You think the bad character dies after the big fight, but this is not the end. There has to be another one for the very nervous viewers. The FINAL one...Orphan is getting 2 stars from me only because of good acting and some news ideas.

I call it a hollow script based on nothing that doesn't need 1.5 hrs to tell the story.Director wasted the first 20 mins to show you a few things: woman lost her baby, she got a deaf daughter, got a architech husband, worked at harvard but got kicked out b/c of alcoholism. That took 20 mins!!! After my cigarate break, washroom break, calling on my cell for the next 15 mins, a kid got adopted. Then I decided I gave enough credits of doubts to the director and enjoyed my nap nap in on the coach.Then someone woke me up when the kid's real identity was revealed. Sadly, it's just a cheap Hollywood gimick stole the core idea from a french movie "He loves me, he loves me not" (? la folie... pas du tout (2002)).Totally disappointed and waste of time. DO NOT RENT DVD OR DOWNLOAD. Waste of money, time, &amp; bandwidth</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"ORPHAN" -- You'd better Investigate BEFORE you Adopt! =</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is being sold as sort of a "HORROR" flick-- but it's really a "psychological" THRILLER about an Orphan named Esther (ISABELLE FUHRMAN) who turns out to BE Horrible (tho she pretends to be the opposite). Kate (VERA FARMIGA) is the frequently-dysfunctional therapy-seeking mother of 2 kids (JIMMY BENNETT &amp; ARYANA ENGINEER as a challenged daughter) who wants to adopt another child. John (PETER SARSGAARD) is the often-oblivious husband who tends to undercut her efforts with all the kids. CCH POUNDER plays the overly-trusting nun who runs an orphanage visited by the parents. Besides sexuality, there's a lot of VIOLENCE initiated by the efforts to adopt, &amp; it's repeatedly bloody &amp; disturbing (tho not at the level of the gory "slasher" movies I so dislike). To my surprise, this film is actually somewhat CLEVERLY-constructed &amp; tension-building as "accidents" keep happening to people involved with the various family members. The tagline is "There's something wrong with Esther." Actually, there's LOTS wrong with her-- but, thanks to the acting &amp; directing, there's a lot more "right" with this MOVIE than I'd expected. It's only recommended for those who LIKE films of this general type, tho!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>GREAT! This movie kicks other horror movies' asses. It has a great plot, with secrets that you'll never guess. :) Esther is 9, and is adopted by Jon and Kate, who just lost a child. Once she starts to move in...things basically go downhill from there (in one part, things literally go downhill). The performances I enjoyed the most in this movie were by Vera Farmiga and Isabelle Fuhrman. Isabelle Fuhrman's character Esther has a great Russian accent (probably since she actually is Russian). They built up suspension so you know exactly what the extremely clever Esther is capable of. Vera Farmiga's character, Kate, is the one who everyone doesn't believe. She is the one who thinks Esther is bad...which isn't good, since Esther will take down anyone in her path.Overall, ORPHAN was a very well done movie. 9.5/10 P.S. the fact that the movie took place in the winter was great to enhance the look of the blood and was greatly used later in the plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Orphan not only belongs to the 'evil kid' category of horror (The Bad Seed, Bloody Birthday, Village of the Damned, The Omen), but is also part of the 'cuckoo in the nest' sub-genre (The Hand That Rocks The Cradle, The Stepfather, Pacific Heights, The Good Son), where an outsider is accepted into a household only to destroy it from within. In this case, a couple coming to terms with the still-birth of third child Jessica have their lives shattered after adopting Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman), a seemingly perfect nine-year-old Russian-born orphan girl, who inevitably turns out to be a manipulative, home-wrecking psycho with a terrifying secret.The format may seem familiar, the script is occasionally predictable (that rose bush was destined to get trashed!), and the film might rely rather too heavily on formulaic false scares to keep the tension running high, but Orphan is still a winner thanks to some brilliant performances (particularly from the young and very talented Fuhrman, who is definitely 'one to watch'), slick direction from Jaume Collet-Serra, and one hell of a twisted denouement that goes to prove that Hollywood still has the power to shock when it really wants to.At just over two hours, the film takes a fairly leisurely approach for much of its running time, allowing viewers to get to know the family intimately before the nasty stuff begins: we learn that mother Kate (Vera Farmiga) is a recovering alcoholic whose booze addiction was almost responsible for the death of her deaf daughter Max (Aryana Engineer), and that father John (Peter Sarsgaard) has not long admitted to having an extra-marital fling. Meanwhile, son Daniel is at the age where he is desperate to be accepted by his peers and is jealous of the attention lavished on the newest member of the family. Despite these characters' weaknesses, however, they are all extremely likable individuals, which makes it all the more horrifying when Esther begins to exploit the cracks in their relationships to terrifying effect.Towards the end of the film, Collet-Serra picks up the pace, dropping the psychological horror in favour of slasher-style scares, complete with a house plunged into darkness, bloody knife attacks, and a seemingly dead Esther repeatedly returning for a few more stabs; but with flawless execution, a few genuinely unforeseen deaths, and a twist ending that, although perhaps a little preposterous, is both inventive and perverse, Orphan is a real treat for fans of frightfully freaky films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Orphan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From director Jaume Collet-Serra (House of Wax), I only decided to try this film from seeing a short trailer, and overhearing a conversation about it, and I thank goodness I did. Basically Kate (Vera Farmiga) and John Coleman (Jarhead's Peter Sarsgaard) have spent a year rebuilding their relationship after Kate gave up her alcoholism, losing her job, her daughter Maxine 'Max' becoming deaf and dumb, John having a love affair, and the abortion of their baby Jessica. They decide to adopt a child, and they find what seems to be the perfect child with intelligent nine-year-old Russian girl Esther (twelve-year-old Isabelle Fuhrman). While Max welcomes her to their home almost immediately, and Esther settles in very quickly, brother Daniel (Jimmy Bennett) is not keen on his new stepsister, he's especially upset when she kills a pigeon. Over time though Kate becomes suspicious of Esther, with her manipulation for attention, knowing other words for sex, and pushing a bullying girl down a slide breaking her ankle. Kate voices her concerns to head of the orphanage Sister Abigail (Face/Off's CCH Pounder), who confirms that strange things have happened when Esther is around. Esther overhears, she kills the Sister with the hammer to the head, and forces Max to help her hide the evidence, and she threatens Daniel for seeing something. After the orphanage tells Kate they can't confirm where Esther came from, she picks the flowers from Jessica's memorial plant, and in the scuffle it looked like Kate broke her arm, and of course, Esther does just that to herself. After a near accident with the car and Max, and buying two bottles of wine (tipping away one), Kate is told Esther came from the Saarne Institute, before John confronts her about drinking again. Daniel knows there is evidence to get rid of Esther, but before he can get it he is caught in a tree house fire, which he narrowly escapes, and Esther tries to kill him again smothering him with a pillow in hospital. Next thing Esther is made up and trying to seduce a drunk John while Kate is away, and he realises Kate was right all along and threatens to call the orphanage to take her away. When Kate comes out of sedation, she is called by the Saarne Institute director who has seen Esther's picture, and he confirms that she is a 33-year-old mental patient called Leena Klammer with a form of dwarfism and growth disorder called hypopituitarism, she has spent most of her life posing as a little girl. So Kate is rushing home to stop Esther from endangering the lives of Max and John (already dead from stabbing), and it all comes to a head on the icy lake Max lost her voice and hearing in, and the evil girl gets what she deserves. Also starring Karel Roden as Dr. Varava, Margo Martindale as Dr. Browning and Rosemary Dunsmore as Grandma Barbara. This is a top notch nut-case film, up there with Fatal Attration and Misery, with a "little girl" played to terrifying perfection by Fuhrman, with great support from Farmiga and Sargaard. This is one of the only films that I can see being as good as The Omen with the evil child premise, and this film just laps it up with plenty of tension, suspense and terror, making it a fantastic and most recommendable horror thriller. Good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, i went to see this film because i guess it looked scary and its genre was horror. So yes, i was expecting a horror.Let's start with the good parts, the acting was very good from everyone, especially the children.Now, the bad parts. The film wasn't scary at all!! I don't think I had ever laughed so much in a cinema in my life. I wasn't the only person laughing, the whole cinema was! Esther's screaming, the whole sex stuff, the way she just swore out the middle of nowhere, the whole story line was just terrible! The only reason i'm giving the film 3 stars is because the acting was good and I had a good laugh. The only reason i would watch it again, is because it was funny.So, scary? NO. Comedy? YES!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>::::WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS. Viewer Discretion is Advised.:::: I saw this movie today, on Opening Day, and it was Awesome!!! I Loved this movie!!! Esther is SO AMAZING, SO TALENTED, SO UNIQUE!!! Isabelle Fuhrman did a Stellar, Outstanding performance. I only wish that Esther could have won in the end. I wish she had killed everyone except Max (Max should have escaped and gone to the police) and gotten away with it. I wish it was clear that she survived. The famous slashers "Freddy" "Jason" "Michael Myers" etc, are all male and they all kill everyone while getting away with it. But because Esther is a female...she loses. The movie was good, but sexist. I did not like that and I just wish she could have won. I really do. I hope there is a sequel. It is not probable, but Possible that Esther survived... I give this movie 1,000,000 out of 10 stars. I rank it up there (not in horror, but in how much I liked it) with "The Ring" and "The Grudge." Esther was my favorite character. I am going to watch it again!!! I need to see it again so that I can find out Esther's real name. I think it's Leena Kle--mer, or something. I'm glad that Esther is 33 so that people can't complain about a movie portraying a child as a murderer. I will also buy the DVD!!! I hope there is an ALTERNATE ending where Esther is Victorious. I hope this movie makes a lot of money and has a huge number of Positive comments.- David. TX. 7/24/2009</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first 9 pages or so of comments are filled with praise. Why?I thought that a film scoring 7.2 on IMDb would be good. I though that if it scores better than a film starring all time greats such as Denzel Washington and John Travolta (taking of Pelham 123 - 6.9) then it must be good. It has Peter Saarsguard in it too, a man I thought to be a good actor and one of integrity. How wrong was I.It was clichéd in every sense. Every horror trick in the book was employed and wasn't scary in the slightest. It was so terrible people were laughing through out. I don't normally see the twist coming. I saw this one coming from a mile away.If you must watch it, wait for it to come out on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most entertaining theater experience I've ever had</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's difficult for me to assign a rating for this film. Normally, I choose my rating based on how well the movie entertained me. If it's terrible, but is incredibly hilarious because it's so terrible, I'll rate it highly. The problem is that I usually reserve this principle for shoddy exploitation films that are so obviously terrible that such a high rating should not deceive any reasonable person. Mainstream films I usually hold to a higher standard as to avoid potentially confusing readers and sending them to the theater to watch a film that they're doomed to hate. Hence my difficulty with Orphan: it's a mainstream film that was so ridiculously bad that I couldn't have asked for a more entertaining movie experience. Therefore, due to this contradiction, I have decided not to give the film a star rating.Onto the movie proper. The film is essentially split into three parts. The first is the development stage, during which Esther, our titular orphan, is introduced as a slimy, evil bitch that manipulates all the characters around her into sympathizing with her. This part is a tinderbox of horror-clichés, and as such, it is really more frustratingly awful than entertainingly awful. Part two consists of our mother character, Kate, deciding that something is just not right with her newest addition to her family and begins an investigation into Esther's past. This part sees the movie actually become interesting and leads to some genuine suspense. During the third part, however, the cat is completely let out of the bag, as the film dives head-first into some of the most bizarre and laughable plot turns and events that left the theater howling.First, onto the clichés. The first part is chocked full of these, yet they aren't as ridiculously entertaining as the events that transpire later in the film. Rather, it's frustrating, as the film first appears as just another Hollywood mess of the genre. Such clichés include the lone character who knows what's really happening, yet no one else believes her (including the character closest to the protagonist), despite the obvious and overwhelming evidence supporting her; the use of children in danger to extract sympathy from the audience; the concept that a child could never do such things; and my personal favorite of the bunch: the girl who is picking on Esther in school sees her disappear from a swing, so her first instinct is to become deathly afraid, and in her fear, she immediately heads to a place where nobody can see her and decides to climb to the highest point of said location so that the antagonist can push her off and break her ankle. Since the character was a total bitch anyway, not much sympathy is felt.As said before, the second part of the movie actually becomes intriguing and creates some real tension. The mystery surrounding the origin of Esther piles on suspense as the unknown begins to unfold, yet it unfolds slowly enough that it leaves the audience asking for more. Simply put, it is a good, interesting, and engaging mystery, yet for all this progress, the third part decides to strap the film with a bomb vest and drop a nuke on it. For starters, the twist is the Manos: The Hands of Fate of cinematic plot twists. It is totally unexpected, totally mind blowing, and totally ridiculous. I mean, it's insanely ludicrous, hilarious even. The hilarity only begins there, too. The clichés that were abandoned in the second part begin to reemerge here. The highlights include:-A completely awkward yet hysterical sequence during which the nine-year-old orphan tries to seduce her adoptive father. (This is explained by the twist, but as the twist is so stupid, it remains a noteworthy highlight of awkward hilarity.) -The killer becomes invincible in the final minutes of the film, surviving a barrage of different assaults that are usually fatal, including having a grown woman plus large, jagged pieces of glass fall on her, hypothermia from a struggle in a frozen lake, and unconsciousness while sinking to the bottom of said lake, during which she would have inhaled a large amount of water.-Although Kate calls the police on the way to her house, they arrive what seems to be an hour later, long enough for Kate to slowly inspect her house, look for Esther, be stalked by Esther, try to save her daughter from Esther, and seemingly kill Esther.-Once the police arrive and the killer appears dead, instead of greeting the police and taking refuge with them (perhaps in a squad car), Kate instead inexplicably walks with her daughter into the middle of the woods where Esther can obviously have her final stand.-Despite finally arriving at the house and hearing all the screams coming from a frozen pond not 100 yards from the building, the police never arrive to assist the victims until after the killer is dead.-The completely unnecessary ploy in which Esther tries to gain sympathy from Kate by calling her "mommy," even though she knows damn well that Kate has been intent on killing her for over half the film. Kate's hilariously campy response is icing on the cake.If I purely hated bad movies, I would've slammed my face against the back of the seat in front of me for nearly the entire duration of the film. Instead, I laughed my way through the worst of it (of which there was plenty), as did all of my fellow theater-goers. I've yet to determine if this is one of my favorite or least favorite films, which brings me back to my original quandary. As it turns out, I have decided to rate this film with two different ratings. It gets half a star for being so damn bad and three and a half stars for the absolute laugh riot that it becomes as a result.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nicely twisted &amp; memorable horror film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Orphan starts as Kate (Vera Farmiga) &amp; John Coleman (Peter Sarsgaard) decide to adopt a child after Kate suffers a miscarriage, Kate &amp; John visit Saint Mariana's Home for Girls where they meet &amp; are charmed by a seemingly angelic nine year old Russian girl named Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman) who they quickly decide to adopt. Taking Esther home she seems perfect &amp; both Kate &amp; John are overjoyed, even if their son Daniel (Jimmy Bennett) isn't. Esther seems different, she dresses strangely &amp; whenever something bad happens she always seem to be around. A girl at school breaks her leg while playing with Esther, Esther swears &amp; starts to cause tension in the house between Kate &amp; John. Kate investigates Esther's past &amp; discovers some shocking secrets that ester will literally kill to keep secret...This American, Canadian, German &amp; French co-production was directed by Jaume Collet-Serra &amp; is a great twisted psycho horror thriller that I really didn't expect to be so good or so disturbed. I am sure there are many out there who will consider the idea of an orphaned child being a sick deformed killer who threatens other children &amp; is generally very nasty to be reprehensible, well I say screw then since Orphan is a terrific piece of exploitation entertainment that had more depth than I expected too. At about two hours Orphan takes a while to get going but I never found myself getting bored &amp; all the build-up &amp; scene setting is essential for the insidious events that follow, I just love the idea behind Orphan &amp; a deranged deformed killer passing herself off as a sweet little girl is just a really sick concept, it makes me feel good inside there are still filmmakers out there who are making good exploitative trash. The character's are well fleshed out, the whole family comes across well &amp; the things Esther does &amp; says are just great. While some may find it a little slow going at times I though all the build-up was justified &amp; actually has a decent pay-off at the end. The films main twist could have been explained a little better with a bit more background but it still has impact &amp; is memorable.I brought Orphan on Blu-ray yesterday &amp; there are some deleted scenes which add nothing &amp; a short alternative ending in which Esther lives. There aren't that many special effects here, I think there's a bit of CGI fire which looks OK &amp; some blood splatter but it's not the goriest film you will ever see &amp; it relies on it's twisted concept to keep one creeped out. Shot in snow covered locations Orphan looks pretty nice, the Blue-ray suggests that the colours were muted in post but otherwise it looks nice enough. The loud noise style jump scares are here aplenty &amp; are reasonably well pulled off.Filmed in Ontario in Canada although set in the US the production values are nice. The acting is alright, Peter Sarsgaard looks a little bored although Isabelle Fuhrman as Esther is fantastic &amp; strikes a great balance between sweetness &amp; evil.Orphan is a film that I enjoyed far more than I thought I would, the story is deeper than i thought &amp; the film as a whole held my interest much more than I expected. A real exploitative treat with a twisted story that is it's biggest asset.</fullReview>

Misused cheap horror shots (suspence building moments which don't quite lead to anywhere in particular), predictable plot (actually me and my friend got it figured out by the middle of the movie), comical dialogs which made audience laugh rather than scare and very long playing time (136 mins, half of which you can just throw away and still "enjoy" the movie).However, gotta admit there were some good stuff too. Very nice casting, enjoyed almost all performances, random creepy images and intriguing intro.I hope Hollywood will come up with some proper horror movies before the genre dies completely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a huge fan of horror from The Exorcist to Cujo, but "The Orphan", in my opinion, misses the genre of "horror" and instead registers within the range of obtuse and disgusting. The first scene left me feeling nauseas and the sexual advances, of a character that we originally believed to be a child, felt like kiddie porn. There was no real "scary" moments in this movie nor did I feel like this movie brought anything new to horror pictures. Instead the film was filled with ridiculous sex scenes and predictability. I mean come on. If you know your children are upstairs do you really think it appropriate to have intercourse in the kitchen. Only someone with the IQ of room temperature would do that... oh yea, I guess that explains the writing in this film. I'm sorry, but I feel that horror fans have been short changed once again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, for a little background. I love horror movies, even really bad ones. In fact, I love most movies no matter how bad. My wife gets scared by anything and I just like cheesy spooks and am happy to suspend disbelief.Orphan tested all my limits, I just couldn't get into this movie. I felt bad because other people in the movie (there were only about three other couples) didn't laugh once but my wife and I couldn't stop.The movie was predictable but then again, aren't all horror movies? I didn't figure out the twist ending but I wasn't trying to but I wasn't surprised either. But this movie was just silly. The adoptive parents were just so foolish even after they began to suspect that there was something wrong with Esther.No granted, maybe this seems silly to me because I was a foster parent and am looking to adopt a child. I also know people who have adopted several kids who have come at their foster parents with knives etc. - kids who were horribly abused yet their adoptive parents helped them become healthy and happy (my wife and I have overnight babysat these boys countless times) - also, we have known one family where the adoptive child had severe Reactive Attachment Disorder etc. and just could never be reached - this child never physically hurt the family but terrorized their biological children for years causing a lot of psychological damage.The only part of the movie that was scary was the first scene and the one with the nun, after she drives off the road by the bridge.This movie should have been scary to me but it just wasn't - it was just too absurd! Save your money watch it from one of those DVD vending machines for a buck instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>5 / 10I watched this movie end not even an hour ago, and yet the movie is not fresh in my mind. This is the first thing that came into my head when I thought "What did I think of the film?" Perhaps I didn't think. The movie was not particularly good, to say the least.Sure it could have been good, engaging, and possibly even touching (something it didn't occur to me to do with my feminine viewing partner here while watching this "masterpiece"), had I cared about the characters all that much. I called the "twist" (I don't think they were going for M Night here, if you know what I mean, but i guess that's what i'll call it) at least 30 minutes before it aired on-screen. This movie could have been better in that it could have been made before, or I'm even willing to go with after, my time on this earth.A 7.2 on IMDb should say "this movie is probably enjoyable no matter who you are" not "this movie is probably enjoyable no matter where you are ...other than in the theater it's playing." It was reasonably well-acted and good production value. I usually give films at least a 5 if they are made and presented decently. It had a story, although I could watch doctors, nurses, and other personnel try to figure out who a Jane Doe is and get about the same enjoyment out of it. Not engaging, nothing new, not scary, BUT very dramatic. This movie tries to have scary moments that simply aren't and doesn't have the story to make you care enough about the characters to make them so. I could see anyone who has known protective feelings toward a child, and emotional-feeling people enjoying, or gripping their seat at, this film.... Not many others.5 / 10 - Five out of ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's see, where to begin...I saw this movie late at night about a month ago. I had heard good things about it and saw its IMDb page and was looking forward to it...boy did I ever get tricked. I usually love late-night horror movies, but this was a real snoozer. I kept falling asleep and my girlfriend kept having to wake me up. The theatre started with about 12 people in it, there were 5 when it was done.First off, I HATE Vera Farmiga. I have not liked her in ANYTHING she has been in, and this was no different. Calling her an actress is like calling nails on a chalkboard music.The scares were very predictable. First off, too many "jump" scenes. Second, any "twist" they came up with I figured out within the first 20 minutes; and they weren't even that interesting to begin with.'Esther' wasn't good, scary, convincing, memorable, or even remotely interesting. Her character build-up was poorly done, and she was a very predictable "killer".There was almost no good in this movie, the only thing that kept me watching was some good scenery and some good suspense. Not much, though.3/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you see a thriller, you expect something which is going to catch you guessing and tense from the moment you discover the reason till it's finally cleared. There was nothing to guess about this movie, the disgusting absurdity of actions made me faceplam how weird and convenient everyone acts around protagonist. Worst movie formula for me. I happen to dislike it a lot, because it's so easy to make everyone hate one person, make him/her look bad just because it has to be so. If the story would have been presented without really showing real deeds of Esther and it would have been discovered in the end as a revelation - that would make it a lot more interesting.I really can't say anyone acted that well above ordinary level, though I do like Vera Farmiga.So overall it's a downhill for me with cheap story and annoying, predictable, extremely absurd "coincidences" which the story revolves around.I can't make my tongue call this movie a thriller. But the end left me less bitter, though that's absolutely not enough to earn the movie points for overall performance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was predictable -- yes, the shock ending was still surprising, but after the entire ~two hours~ of laughing, nothing could really be that scary.I'm ~very~ easily scared, but I spent this entire movie LAUGHING. Every little trick that we, as an intelligent audience, have learned over the years is implemented.The acting was very good, and there were points in the movie that you were supposed to laugh on purpose, which was nice. But, despite the great acting and nice cinematography -- the plot was laughable.You never really understand HOW Esther came to be who she is. You never really understand much, just her big secret -- which, I'll hand it to the writers, was a good twist -- but had very little to do with the plot.Highly recommended for a good laugh -- but definitely not a scare.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A ludicrously awful movie with every 'shock' telegraphed well in advance,strongly reminiscent of 'The Hand That Rocks The Cradle',only this time ,the moron of a husband gets stabbed to death...which serves him right for not believing his wife's suspicions 'you've got to stop drinking etc..' Every slasher cliché is shovelled in--'the killer is not really dead'-what a surprise! The plot twist is that the killer 'has a rare syndrome-she's really 33 years old,and is a homicidal maniac'--oh wow! Makes 'Carry On Screaming' look like the masterpiece it is.A low budget old-fashioned' drive-in' movie,lots of hand -held camera,the characters are sticks,laughably bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From Russia With Terror!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Each year I try to attend a couple of Film Festivals in the hope to stumble upon obscure, international and experimental genre movies that normally don't reach wide audiences, but the absolute best film I watched at this year's edition of the Brussels International Festival of Fantastic Film was this relatively "mainstream" horror effort. "Orphan" is a traditional and largely predictable thriller with familiar themes and numerous of inevitable clichés, but nevertheless it's great entertainment thanks to a continuously suspenseful atmosphere and sublime acting performances from the ensemble cast. Evil, murderous children still somewhat form the last taboo in the horror industry, especially if there isn't a straightforward explanation for their malignant behavior, but more than once they guaranteed nail-biting suspense and genuine scares already. "Orphan" reminded me most of the little-known early 90's thriller "Mikey", since both films deal with cherubic but evil-minded murdering their adoption families, but this one is far more elaborated, sinister and engaging. The not always happily married couple John and Kate Coleman want to compensate the loss of their third stillborn baby by adopting a child from Sister Abigail's orphanage. They promptly fall in love with the 9-year-old Esther, an incredibly polite and eloquent girl with a somewhat peculiar dressing style and Russian roots. They take her home and hope to raise the perfect family with her and the other two kids, Daniel and the deaf/mute little girl Maxine. Esther quickly sows fear and terror in school and around the playground, but the other children are too petrified to betray her. When Kate also accuses Esther of being a demonic child, her husband and therapist blame it on her alcoholic background and hallucinations. Meanwhile Esther's vile acts become increasingly horrific and more diabolical. It's good to finally see another horror movie that features all the known and dreadful clichés, but you don't allow them to bother you. Quite the contrary, they even work! You know there will come a scene in which Esther is standing quietly in the bedroom staring at her little unsuspecting sleeping sister, but when the scene finally comes it still sends cold shivers down your spine. You also know that it won't be easy to defeat Esther in the finale, but still you jump up in your seat with fear every time she pops up again. That is called genuine suspense, and it works so effectively because we truly care for the good characters and gradually build up an aversion towards the despicable child Esther. The script patiently ? the film lasts 123 minutes which is quite long for a horror film ? takes its time to draw a detailed image of the Coleman family situation, which makes it practically impossible not to cheer for them. During the last half hour, when you assume Esther already unleashed all of her demons, the story still holds a couple of shocking twists in store regarding her personality and background. "Orphan" is brought to an even higher quality level thanks to all the brilliant acting performances. Peter Sarsgaard and Vera Farmiga are excellent as the struggling couple, but the most remarkable performances come from the youthful actresses Aryana Engineer (as the adorable little sister Maxine) and of course Isabelle Fuhrman as Esther. She's really amazing and 100% terrifying, with her penetrating eyes and macabre karma. Just have one look at the film's poster image and you'll know exactly what I mean. Great film, highly recommended to ALL horror-loving audiences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Adult, Character Driven Horror Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Orphan (2009) *** 1/2 (out of 4) A couple (Vera Farmiga, Peter Sarsgaard) who recently lost a child, adopt a young girl (Isabelle Fuhrman) from Russia. At first everything seems to be going fine but soon the mother seems to think the new addition to their home has a few secrets. I remember seeing the trailer for this thing many months ago and rolling my eyes asking myself why anyone would think we needed yet another bad child movie. Well, this is just more proof that one should never think something has been done to death because if someone is willing to go out there than they can deliver something unlike anything we've seen before. Outside a couple flaws here and there, this is without question the best adult horror film for many, many years. I saw adult because any horror movie can have a R-rating but that doesn't mean adult as usually it's just gore and violence for teenagers. This film here is first and foremost a drama because that's where all the character development comes from. We learn to care for this family because of everything going on and the actors perfectly bring these characters to life to the point where we see their lives go through various ups and downs. It's this caring that makes the horror elements work so well. I've seen so many trashy horror movies over the years that I've become quite jaded but that was erased here because this is certainly one of the most chilling and haunting horror films in decades. There are certain lines that don't get crossed in any movie but they're crossed here several times. Just when you think you know what's going on, something will happen and that will have you hanging off the edge of your seat because you know that the film is willing to take you places that most won't. The big twist, which I won't reveal, worked masterfully well. That's all I'll say about it. The performances are what really makes the drama work so well with Farmiga delivering another great one. She was impressive in THE DEPARTED and just keeps getting better and better. The raw emotions that she displays are brilliant. Sarsgaard also comes off wonderfully well as does character actress CCH Pounder. Jimmy Bennett and especially Aryana Engineer are great as the children. Then there's Isabelle Fuhrman as the bad one. She's masterfully perfect here and some will compare her to the breakthrough of Linda Blair in THE EXORCIST but I thought she was even better. Her character is a mature one and an intelligent one and one false step would have ruined this but the young actress nails it perfectly and comes off quite terrifying. The film does have a few flaws including the needlessly bloody opening sequence as well as some fake scares that really weren't needed. The entire film has a wonderfully dark and creepy atmosphere with the final thirty-minutes packing one terrific punch in terms of suspense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Sadomasocistic Porn Film I've Ever Seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was with a very dear friend when I went to see this movie. I originally had no intentions to see this picture in the first place. I thought it would just be another uninspired, PG-13 "Ring" copycat. But as I let the film begin, mind already disturbed mind was shocked.This is not a horror movie. This is not a a clever Thriller. This is just a test to see what will make you wish your eyes were non-existent. It's like a bunch of people sat in a room, thought out all of the most painful and distgusting unwatchable gross-out gags, and made a movie around it. Not to mention the ending is a rip-off of The Ring 2's ending. They even used the same line that the main heroine in The Ring 2 used.In conclusion, the only reason to see this film is if you are a sadomasicist that needs a new movie to pleasure yourself too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Recommended</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was ridiculous. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Although the actors and actresses were pretty good, especially the little girl who played Max, the movie was full of unnecessary sexual scenes and cursing. This was not a scary movie. We watched it in a full theater, and throughout the entire movie, the audience was laughing, even during the "scary" parts of the movie. The only way this movie scares you is through cheap "make you jump" scares. While we were walking out of the theater, we could hear people saying how dumb and stupid the movie was. Maybe this is just our opinion, but I know the whole theater that we were in felt this way too.</fullReview>
