		<shortDescription>a Truly Moving Picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film on September 1st, 2005 in Indianapolis. I am one of the judges for the Heartland Film Festival that screens films for their Truly Moving Picture Award. A Truly Moving Picture "...explores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life." Heartland gave that award to this film.This is a story of golf in the early part of the 20th century. At that time, it was the game of upper class and rich "gentlemen", and working people could only participate by being caddies at country clubs. With this backdrop, this based-on-a-true-story unfolds with a young, working class boy who takes on the golf establishment and the greatest golfer in the world, Harry Vardon.And the story is inspirational. Against all odds, Francis Ouimet (played by Shia LaBeouf of "Holes") gets to compete against the greatest golfers of the U.S. and Great Britain at the 1913 U.S. Open. Francis is ill-prepared, and has a child for a caddy. (The caddy is hilarious and motivational and steals every scene he appears in.) But despite these handicaps, Francis displays courage, spirit, heroism, and humility at this world class event.And, we learn a lot about the early years of golf; for example, the use of small wooden clubs, the layout of the short holes, the manual scoreboard, the golfers swinging with pipes in their mouths, the terrible conditions of the greens and fairways, and the play not being canceled even in torrential rain.This film has stunning cinematography and art direction and editing. And with no big movie stars, the story is somehow more believable.This adds to the inventory of great sports movies in the vein of "Miracle" and "Remember the Titans."FYI - There is a Truly Moving Pictures web site where there is a listing of past winners going back 70 years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great, great movie even for those (like me) who don't like golf!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bill Paxton has taken the true story of the 1913 US golf open and made a film that is about much more than an extra-ordinary game of golf. The film also deals directly with the class tensions of the early twentieth century and touches upon the profound anti-Catholic prejudices of both the British and American establishments. But at heart the film is about that perennial favourite of triumph against the odds.The acting is exemplary throughout. Stephen Dillane is excellent as usual, but the revelation of the movie is Shia LaBoeuf who delivers a disciplined, dignified and highly sympathetic performance as a working class Franco-Irish kid fighting his way through the prejudices of the New England WASP establishment. For those who are only familiar with his slap-stick performances in "Even Stevens" this demonstration of his maturity is a delightful surprise. And Josh Flitter as the ten year old caddy threatens to steal every scene in which he appears.A old fashioned movie in the best sense of the word: fine acting, clear directing and a great story that grips to the end - the final scene an affectionate nod to Casablanca is just one of the many pleasures that fill a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Disney Sports Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a recreational golfer with some knowledge of the sport's history, I was pleased with Disney's sensitivity to the issues of class in golf in the early twentieth century. The movie depicted well the psychological battles that Harry Vardon fought within himself, from his childhood trauma of being evicted to his own inability to break that glass ceiling that prevents him from being accepted as an equal in English golf society. Likewise, the young Ouimet goes through his own class struggles, being a mere caddie in the eyes of the upper crust Americans who scoff at his attempts to rise above his standing. What I loved best, however, is how this theme of class is manifested in the characters of Ouimet's parents. His father is a working-class drone who sees the value of hard work but is intimidated by the upper class; his mother, however, recognizes her son's talent and desire and encourages him to pursue his dream of competing against those who think he is inferior.Finally, the golf scenes are well photographed. Although the course used in the movie was not the actual site of the historical tournament, the little liberties taken by Disney do not detract from the beauty of the film. There's one little Disney moment at the pool table; otherwise, the viewer does not really think Disney. The ending, as in "Miracle," is not some Disney creation, but one that only human history could have written.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Feel-good movie like "Seabiscuit"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I'm not a golf fan, I attended a sneak preview of this movie and absolutely loved it. The historical settings, the blatant class distinctions, and seeing the good and the bad on both sides of the dividing line held my attention throughout. The actors and their characterizations were all mesmerizing. And I was on the edge of my seat during the golf segments, which were not only dramatic and exciting but easy to follow. Toward the end of this movie, "Seabiscuit" came strongly to mind, although "The Greatest Game Ever Played" is far less complex a story than that film. In both cases, the fact that the events really happened deepened my interest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film in a sneak preview, and it is delightful. The cinematography is unusually creative, the acting is good, and the story is fabulous. If this movie does not do well, it won't be because it doesn't deserve to. Before this film, I didn't realize how charming Shia Lebouf could be. He does a marvelous, self-contained, job as the lead. There's something incredibly sweet about him, and it makes the movie even better. The other actors do a good job as well, and the film contains moments of really high suspense, more than one might expect from a movie about golf. Sports movies are a dime a dozen, but this one stands out. This is one I'd recommend to anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Show, Mr. Paxton</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Actor turned director Bill Paxton follows up his promising debut, the Gothic-horror "Frailty", with this family friendly sports drama about the 1913 U.S. Open where a young American caddy rises from his humble background to play against his Bristish idol in what was dubbed as "The Greatest Game Ever Played." I'm no fan of golf, and these scrappy underdog sports flicks are a dime a dozen (most recently done to grand effect with "Miracle" and "Cinderella Man"), but some how this film was enthralling all the same.The film starts with some creative opening credits (imagine a Disneyfied version of the animated opening credits of HBO's "Carnivale" and "Rome"), but lumbers along slowly for its first by-the-numbers hour. Once the action moves to the U.S. Open things pick up very well. Paxton does a nice job and shows a knack for effective directorial flourishes (I loved the rain-soaked montage of the action on day two of the open) that propel the plot further or add some unexpected psychological depth to the proceedings. There's some compelling character development when the British Harry Vardon is haunted by images of the aristocrats in black suits and top hats who destroyed his family cottage as a child to make way for a golf course. He also does a good job of visually depicting what goes on in the players' heads under pressure. Golf, a painfully boring sport, is brought vividly alive here. Credit should also be given the set designers and costume department for creating an engaging period-piece atmosphere of London and Boston at the beginning of the twentieth century.You know how this is going to end not only because it's based on a true story but also because films in this genre follow the same template over and over, but Paxton puts on a better than average show and perhaps indicates more talent behind the camera than he ever had in front of it. Despite the formulaic nature, this is a nice and easy film to root for that deserves to find an audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was extraordinarily impressed by this film. It's one of the best sports films I've every seen. The visuals in this film are outstanding. I love the sequences in which the camera tracks the ball as it flies through the air or into the cup. The film moves well, offering both excitement and drama. The cinematography was fantastic. The acting performances are great. I was surprised by young Shia LaBeouf.He does well in this role. Stephen Dillane is also good as the brooding Harry Vardon. Peter Firth, Justin Ashforth, and Elias Koteas offer able support. The film is gripping and entertaining and for the first time in my life actually made me want to watch a golf tournament.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie gives golf a high mark, it was well acted and well directed. Giving you a view of history that some non-sports fans will enjoy. The historic factor alone gives it a high rating, the Brookline golf course was really done well. I am in the northeast and have seen Brookline as a fan, and as someone who loves the game. The movie was well done on all levels. A MUST SEE 5 stars. The acting was superb, Disney has another winner in its bag of Great movies. If for no other reason watch the film to give hope and encouragement to young people whom may not see the hope in their life. I would tell you that the setting, while in the late 1800's and early 1900's is very realistic. The costumes and dialect were right on the mark as well. Above and beyond the call of duty for a golf film. A Must see for fans and non-fans alike.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Outstanding Film Centered Around Golf</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, here is another great golf movie. That's at least three in the past few years that I've really enjoyed, that were well-done, beautifully-filmed and inspirational. The other two were "Bobby Jones: Stroke of Genius" and "The Legend Of Bagger Vance."This is a true underdog story, if there ever was one. To have an amateur defeat all the professionals and win the United States Open Golf Tournament is an unheard-of feat. I believe this is the only time in the 100 years it has ever been accomplished. How much of this film is fiction embellished for dramatic effect, I don't know. I do know that I plan on reading the book, and I know that in real-life, Francis Ouimet had a three-stroke lead in playoff with just two holes to go, unlike what we saw in the film.Whatever. Francis Ouimet's victory over golf legends Harry Vardon and Ted Ray is fact. It is an amazing story and the filmmakers did a super job in presenting it here. It isn't something just for golf fans; this is a fun movie. Kudso to actor-turned-director Bill Paxton for an outstanding job.Yes, a lot of this is just plain golf but there are subplots such as Ouimet's relationship with his father and with a pretty young woman who is obviously interested in him. It's also a touching story of someone giving a little kid a chance. The movie also deals with Vardon's demons of coming from the wrong side of the tracks and trying to make it in an elitist's sport, which it was at the time for both Europeans and Americans.Shia LaBeouf is winsome as Ouimet as is Steven Dillane as Vardon. For those who don't know, Vardon was like the Tiger Woods of his day, maybe even more unbeatable. In the film, Vardon is pictured as a warm, nice guy; a genuine human being. the other major competitor, Ray (Stephen Marcus) is shown as somewhat of a brutish nasty guy. The fourth main character of this golf story might be the coolest person in the film: a fifth-grade boy who winds up being Ouimet's caddie in the Open. He (Josh Flitter) brings a lot of humor and charm to the movie.If all of this - a playoff with the huge underdog against two mighty pros and having come down to the last hole - were not true, you would think, "Oh, man, this is so hokey. Who could believe this?" That's what makes this true-life story fun to see finally captured on film. As with another sports film of 2005 - "Cinderella Man" - here is another excellent movie that got unjustly ignored when it came to awards. I guess nice films don't win awards.....just the hearts of their viewers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a sports fan - but I love sports flics! So, why ... what is a great sports flic ... this one. And the storytelling style, is very fine.If you are looking for a reliably fantastic 2 hours of entertainment, "Greatest Game" qualifies mightily. Here is a movie that moves. Bill Paxton has gone to the same Director school as Ron Howard - a.k.a. Richie Cunningham, "Happy Days". That is not bad. Look at the immense body of fine work that Ron did after moving behind the camera.Bill like Ron was a great actor, but will be a superstar director if "Greatest Game Ever" is the indication of things to follow.Wonderful cinematography - fantastic direction - fine acting, especially by Elias Koteas, Shia LeBeouf, Marnie McPhail, Josh Flitter, Stephen Marcus, Justin Ashforth.This is a must see film not just as "feel-good", nor "sports film", this is very good cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest game or not, this is a great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As you know "The Greatest Game Ever Played" is about golf. I used to snicker at the over-dramatic title, but through great visual display credited to director Bill Paxton (better known for his acting in Twister and hilarious supporting roles in Aliens and True Lies) we find out that this has much more meaning than a game.Though the movie is about golf, it seems as though the sport is just the framework for what is really going on. What is really going on is a story of individuals being told they can't fulfill their dreams, be it age or social status. A conflict between a son's wishes and a father's demands. An English golf legend looking to bring the title home with the country breathing down his neck.Shia LaBeouf (Even Stevens) plays Francis Ouimet, a caddy with a God-given talent who was never permitted to play golf in the first place. Despite the resentment of the upper class "gentlemen," it was undeniable that Francis had a gift. What posed a greater threat was the discouragement of his father played by Elias Koteas (Sugartime, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles) who felt that playing a mere game will never improve their poor living conditions. With the continued support of his mother, Francis eventually comes face to face with his idol, the golf legend Harry Vardon (Stephen Dillane).More impressive than the game itself, was the movie's cinematic achievement. This proved that storytelling is successful through pure cinema. The entire movie could've been told without dialog. There are scenes in the movie that build strong suspense and powerful emotion with only pictures. In one particular scene, Francis Ouimet swings and the entire crowd turn their heads to watch the ball fly into the distance, all but the face of Harry Vardon looking intensely at Ouimet without a flinch. The ways in which the golfers visualize the course offer more aesthetic enjoyment.A pleasant supporting cast completes the whole. Peyton List plays the love interest and looks worth playing for, and Josh Flitter plays a lovable caddy that keeps Ouimet focused as the pressure bogs him down. Golf fan or not, you'll appreciate the film for its beauty and its reminder that cinema can be a great medium to tell any story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Touching and sensitive portrait of a golf winner who participates in the U.S. International Open against his British idol</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An emotive tale of triumph and redemption , being based on a true story . Sport film with sentimental story and intelligent character studio . Classic story rings true because of Shia Labeouf's complex and adequate acting and stunningly realized by director Bill Paxton . Exceptional Shia Labeouf displaying a first rate performance reaching an important milestone and a terrific Stephen Dillane as his upright as well as serious contender . In the 1913 US Open, 20-year-old Francis Ouimet (Shia Labeouf) gets a chance as he played against his idol, 1900 US Open champion , Englishman Harry Vardon (Stephan Dillane) . Amateur player Francis gets to achieve for big time , thanks to the coach , as he triumphs over by odds , but sheer determination helps them attain their dream . Ouimet dreams of playing final Open , as he gets the chance to participate in the International Golf Championship against his idol , no matter how far-fetched the dream . Meanwhile , he falls in love for a rich young girl called Sarah Wallis (Peyton List) . But he has an intelligent skill to no match for the class boundaries ; however , being pressurized by his father (Elias Koteas) . From the studio that brought you ¨The rookie¨ , ¨Miracle¨ and ¨Remember the Titans¨ is realized this agreeable tale based on the 1913 USA Open in which took part famous international champs , it contains a classic plot and deals about a slice of American history , and is plenty of good feeling , heartfelt, interesting characters and formidable performances . However , sometimes is some sentimental and predictable but is still pretty amusing . Correctly based on real events as the actual Francis Ouimet and Eddie Lowery remained life long friends . When Ouimet died in 1967, Lowery was one of the pall-bearers . Likable and enjoyable plot about a young golfer and his coach and caddie , both of them face the dual challenge to win a world championship and redeeming themselves . Splendid film from the filmmaker Bill Paxton and writer/producer Mark Frost of another David beats Goliath sports movie , similarly to ¨Rudy¨ with Sean Astin and ¨Hoosiers¨ with Gene Hackman , and it is even better than ¨The legend of Bagger Vance¨ with Will Smith and Matt Damon . Sentimental plot stretches Hollywood manipulation , but is still entertaining . Shia LaBeouf delivers an engaging acting as Francis Ouimet ; he is backed by a good supporting cast such as Luke Askew as Alec Campbell , Stephen Marcus as Ted Ray , Peter Firth as Lord Northcliffe , Len Cariou as Stedman , Elias Koteas as his stiff father Arthur Ouimet and special mention to Stephan Dillane as Harry Vardon , protagonist's idol as well as contender . Spectacular and rousing musical score by Brian Tyler , fitting perfectly to action . Fine production design and good sets , filmmakers had trouble filling the fields with extras for the final game, and needed to move people around when shooting different angles ; extras were given 1910's hairstyles and their clothing was checked for anachronisms . Colorful and evocative cinematography by Shane Hurlbut ; filmed at the Kanawaki Golf Club outside Montreal, Quebec, producers had the club house painted yellow for the film from its original white. Members so liked the change that they kept the color following filming. The motion picture was compellingly directed by Bill Paxton , he's a notorious producer/director and especially actor ; being this one his second film , the first one was a nice terror film titled ¨Frailty¨ with Matthew McConaughey . Rating : Better than average , worthwhile seeing .</fullReview>

I will be watching this movie many, many more times.if you do not have a great sound system. find a friend who does and watch it there.also watch the extra stories and behind the scenes extras that come with it (the BR or DVD.) the interview of Quimet in the 1960's talks about his scholarship fund...but for those times just boys got it. today I hope some of it goes to girls.......</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Greatest Game Ever Played loses points for having a terrible title. But it is an inspirational "true" story from Walt Disney studios and so every inch of melodrama is squeezed from it accompanied by appropriately "swelling" music. Which is not to say I didn't like the movie. I did enjoy it for what it was. As a person who golfs it was both interesting and frustrating to see how golf was played in the early part of the century but much more could have been done with the game of golf itself in the film. (I think that non-golfers who don't know the game will find it hard to keep track of who is ahead in the matches which is a problem in the film's editing.) Instead, the story concentrates on two sub plots. The conflict between Shia LaBeouf and his father Elias Koteas. Shia is a natural golfer but his father is totally against it. The other sub plot is the desire to win back the US Open cup for England. This pits world famous champion Stephen Dillane against influential lords who are portrayed as gross, oyster-slurping, upper-class snobs. There is also a small love story aside between Shia and Payton List. A standout in the film is little Josh Flitter who plays Shia's plucky caddy in a comic relief role which I found amusing but other may find annoying.As for the film-making, the colors of the film are muted which gives it a nice look and since it's a period piece the costumes are interesting. Since golf itself is not very visually exciting the director chose to use Matrix style visuals such as having the camera fly behind the golf ball as it sails to the hole accompanied by a really huge swishing sound. There is one shot as if taken underneath glass looking up at a putt. If you can forgive the melodramatic musical swells, you can find this film an enjoyable 2 hours and if you have any interest in golf it's one of the few movies about golf. If you are in the mood for an underdog film this one makes par.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Good To Miss</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a splendid, delightful film! This one takes not only a compelling look at early twentieth century golf but the period as well. The props, costumes, speech and manners were first rate, both sides of the Pond.And the movie's themes were eclectic. The makers had covered most angles: Anglo-American rivalry, class privilege, pedigree and familial struggles especially between father and son. As an aside we even catch a good glimpse of some darn good snooker play. The London gentlemen club's ambiance reminded me of my stay at a similar venue. Maybe my foray too was on the Isle of Jersey...The grand theme of all though was the game of competitive golf.Young American, Francis Quimet, is born to immigrant parents. At an early age the tender lad develops a passion for the game. For now, the lad caddies for the rich. In his spare time and on his own dime, gentle Francis patiently hones his golf skills.Most nights, Francis dreamt often of a bigger stage. And the drama always revolved around golf.On the other side of the Atlantic, another gigantic saga develops. Already of much renown in professional sport, golfer Harry Vardon has something yet to prove. Before he bows and then leaves golf's pinnacle his rich-heeled minders persuade him to enter one last 'big' tournament: the eighteenth annual, 1913 U.S. Open tournament.Using masterful speech, Lord Grand-Jowls exhorts the famous English golf professional. "You must do it for 'The Empire'; show the Yanks it's still 'our' game." A more likely translation is: "Let's all milk the fat American cash cow, now!" That's more like the truth, ain't it?Unlikely competitors, the young American caddie and seasoned English golf professional are on a collision course. In their unique way both men pursue golfing excellence. In the film often along the fairways we're shown that both men also suffer from inner personal struggles.At times, each man manages to conceal the turmoil within. However, at critical moments like the fifth round U.S. Open playoff both young amateur and seasoned pro alike while pitted against each other reveal their human frailties. During regulation play, small fissures appeared even surfaced in each man's game.In the playoff their nerves and fragile inner selves are tested to the maximum. Both men though reach even deeper. Over 18 grueling holes, they remain calm. Their former demons have since vanished. Relying solely on their unique golf skills the men battle the course, each other, and themselves.In the tension filled round, each man finds personal redemption. On 18, one fellow prevails. The other, though coming up a shot short, accepts his fate. Although humbled, he is most gracious in defeat.Probably like many viewers here, I found myself transported to another era. No doubt it was a simpler time. Like today though ordinary, working folk though still struggled. However, during a major golf competition it was an exciting time for all. Wish I was there then in Brookline, Mass. I would have loved to have lived, well, shared that dream!Overall, this golf film was darn near cinematic perfection! "Read it, roll it and hole it." Well said, Eddie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not a golf fan by any means. On May 26 about 10:30 PM the movie started with a scene in the late 1800's. Old movies I like but not golf however, within the first scene a young boy (Harry Vardon) is awaken by the voices of men. He goes outside to inquire what they are doing and is told they are going to build a golf something... So , then I turned the television off but something stirred me and it was back on. The movie is excellent. We then see this young boy now a man; professional golf player who is haunted with visions from his childhood. Then we meet the true focus of the movie Francis and the decisions he makes for golf. You meet his mother and father who want to protect him from the class thing that is so obvious during the period. Then there is little Eddie Lowery his caddy with encouraging words and little pushes that are instrumental in Francis winning. Don't want to give away too much . I was up until 2 A.M. This is super please see the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Father and son relationship</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The focus of the key relationship in a young man's life, that of his relationship with his father, was excellently portrayed in this movie, "The Greatest Game Ever Played." The movie captured the essence of how important it is for a father to validate his son and let him know that he has what it takes to follow his dream.It didn't matter that economic and social class mores presented obstacles to be overcome by both father and son. It also didn't matter that others were acclaiming the son in exuberant celebration. What mattered the most was that he saw his father's hand and then his face of approval. The real life challenge for both father and son had been met.Considering that in real life the hero of the story kept his amateur status and became a businessman pretty much verifies that all that went before the match was the training ground for a valid father and son relationship.</fullReview>

I give it 3 stars (out of 4), but would only recommend it as (1) family fare (makes sense, it's a Disney movie); (2) to golfers who like the historical aspect of the story or (3) to those who might have read the book. To anyone else, the movie would largely be a snooze.TGGEP, the movie, deviated from the book in many ways and made some of the key personalities (Wilfred Reid, to name one) disposable. But you can imagine what a task it is to cram 5 rounds of golf into just over one-half of the film. To his credit, Bill Paxton, the director, does a nice job with camera angles, special effects and capturing the personalities of the main characters including two of the real characters in the book, Ted Ray and Eddie Lowery.I can understand why this movie bombed at the BO; golf is difficult to sell when its live and the drama is unfolding, its impossible to sell when watching a guy line up a putt that took place 90 years ago and for which you already know the result. But with the U.S. Open a few weeks away, again, it might be interesting for the historical aspect.Credible performances all the way around keep the film from ending up out of bounds.A brief word about Mark Frost's book. If you like golf and/or golf history and you haven't read it yet, do so immediately. It is an easy read and he wastes not a single word in describing the origins of professional golf, the players involved, class struggles, etc., and then wraps up nicely with a summary of the lives after the U.S. Open of the major characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Greatest Movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love golf. I love playing it. I love watching it on TV or in person. There's no other game on earth like it. Just you against the golf course. There may be other players out there, but it's still just you, the course, and that stupid little ball.This was a story that needed to be told, even if they embellished the facts in the screen version. It is so much fun to watch because of the incredible Disney screen effects that I can't get enough of it. The boy golfer defeats his hero. The family story is the sad part. Some fathers just don't seem to understand what's important in a man/boy's life.I started to use the Vardon grip long before I even knew who Harry Vardon was. We finally see what a true gentleman he was. He would have been a great American. It was a great movie about a great game.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story is great, the movie is bad. I didn't care for the casting, except for the actor who played Eddie the caddy and the actor who played Vardon.I didn't care for the directing. The story of Ouimet is so good that it would have been great without all the weird camera work. For example, several times at an exciting point in the game, Paxton used weird flashbacks and cartoon like contrivances. And what was the point of the ladybug on the ball? Sometimes it got just plain weird.I have other problems with the movie, but the playoff statistics were entirely incorrect. In the 1913 US Open playoff Ouimet shot a 72, Vardon shot a 77, and Ray shot a 78. (source: golfweb.com)The movie ending shows Ouimet winning by one stroke. I give it 5 out of 10 just because the story is so good. I just don't understand why Disney felt they had to change history to make it a good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great sports-drama.The (mostly) true story of the 1913 US Open Golf tournament. In particular the lives of the two main protagonists, the legendary Harry Vardon, the first superstar of golf, and the unheralded Francis Ouimet. Shows what lead them to that event, and their personal drivers and demons.An exciting telling of an actual event. You're kept on tenterhooks until the very end. The backstories are interesting too. Solid performances from Shia LeBeouf and Stephen Dillane in the lead roles.On the downside, this is Disney, so some of the characters and plot are dumbed-down for kids. The villains are stereotypical, predictable and one-dimensional. Some occurrences don't make complete sense, especially from a golf perspective and have been changed for dramatic purposes. Fortunately, Disney doesn't overdo the stereotypes and dramatizations, so they don't detract from the movie too much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Review: After many years of this movies release, I finally got to watch it and I quite enjoyed it. It is your typical feel good Disney movie but I did like the cast and the usual zero to hero concept. Its about a golf caddie, Francis Ouimet (Shia LaBeouf) who has a dream to become the best golfer in the world but he hasn't got the money to enter the sport. After getting the backing from some people who believe in his talent, he works his way up the ranks to take on the best players in the world. Its not the most original storyline but there are some other elements which made the movie interesting. All of the performances were great, especially from a young LaBeouf who showed up some of the older actors. I personally liked the coolness of Harry Vardon (Stephen Dillane) who was fighting against the politics in the sport during that period. I also liked Francis's caddie and Ted Ray who was the larger English golfer. Anyway, there is some intensity throughout the golf matches which actually made the game quite interesting, for once. It reminded me a lot of the Rookie, which had the same type of concept were his dad wanted him to make an honest living to put food on the table. Although the concept is basic, it's still a watchable movie which we all can relate to and the fact that it's based on real characters, made it a joy to watch. Enjoyable!Round-Up: Shia LaBeouf, 29, is another one of those actors that started his acting career at a young age. His first film was in 1986 in a film called Monkey Business but he hit it big when this film was released. He had small roles in I, Robot, Constantine, Dumb and Dumberer, Charlie Angels: Full Throttle and Bobby but he hasn't stopped working since he played the lead in Disturbia in 2007. He then got the lead in the Transformers franchise alongside Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, which was very disappointing and he also played the lead in the Wall Street remake which was no way as good as the original. Anyway, his movies have grossed over $2Billion at the box office so at 29, he's achieved a lot in his career. This movie was directed by the great Bill Paxton whose famous for his one liners in Aliens and Predator 2. This is the second movie he has directed, after the 2001 movie Frailty which he also starred in, so he hasn't got that much experience behind the camera but he still done a good job with this film. He covered the period well and his great cast choice made this movie a hit at the box office. There are some little touches, like the caterpillar on the golf ball, which were great so it's definitely worth a watch.Budget: $25million Worldwide Gross: $53millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their drama/history/sports movies about a young caddie who uses his golfing skills to take on some of the biggest golf players in the world. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Straight down the middle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although a keen golfer myself with a love of the history of the game, perhaps due to not being an American, I somehow didn't know about this wonderful true story of young golfer Walter Ouimet winning the US Open golf championship in a play-off against two British golfing-greats Ted Ray and Harry Vardon, being caddied all the way round by a ten year old boy! I doubt even Disney could have come up with a story so implausible although it's perhaps no surprise that it was Disney who funded this warm, if sentimental and idealised bringing to life of the tale.Yes, there are some unnecessary touching-ups to the original sequence of events, like the liberty taken with the last-hole winning putt (Ouimet actually won by five strokes) and especially the invention of a society love interest of young Ouimet, not only to add a touch of romance but also, in the form of her snobbish father and brother, some class-conflict, just one more obstacle for the young golfer to take on. The film wisely chooses not to demonise his two main English opponents Ray and especially all-time great Vardon, indeed the latter is shown to have demons of his own and who apart from one mild example of gamesmanship practiced against an opponent, is shown to be demonstrably fair and sporting, very much upholding the traditions of the game.It does take a bag-full of camera tricks to make golf exciting in a movie and director Bill Paxton uses every one of them to try to do so, using zoom-ins and outs, fast-cutting and slow-motion, at times even sitting the viewer actually on the ball as it flies to its target. These are perhaps overdone and betray the film's target family audience, but are compensated by good acting by all the main actors, especially young Le Bouef a credit to the memory of the modest but competitive Ouimet and the even younger Josh Flitter as Eddie Lowery, his moxy, pint- sized caddie, who was obviously 10 going on 40 (unsurprisingly the real-life Lowery grew up to become a millionaire).Filmed in warm soft-focus with a pleasant depiction of the era of golf's Golden Age and a stirring soundtrack at its back,this was an entertaining film, which while occasionally taking the circuitous route, managed to get round the course in a little bit better than par, I'd say.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not a movie that I would typically watch at 2:30 in the morning, but I got into it and couldn't stop until it was over.Shia LaBeouf demonstrated that he is not just a young actor here, but could handle more demanding roles. The fact that he has been handed those roles in the last two years is testament to his ability.It was really his movie. Sure, there were others involved, but they pale in comparison to his role.This was a time when gold was reserved for the privileged. This victory opened it up to the masses, much the way that Tiger Woods has opened golf to all races.Like Harry Vardon (Stephen Dillane) said to Lord Northcliffe (Peter Firth): " ...if Mr. Ouimet (Shia LaBeouf) wins tomorrow, it's because he's the best, because of who he is. Not who his father was, not how much money he's got, because of who he bloody is! And I'll thank you to remember that." Go get charged up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Based on a true story from the alternate universe of Disney</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoiler alert: The final score, with Ouimet squeaking out a win on the final hole, seems key to the film's claim of "World's Greatest Game." But it is not true. The playoff wasn't even close. Ouimet beat Vardon by five and Ray by six, a birdie on the 17th hole sealing the victory.But he was a 20-year-old kid who beat the pros. Except that the defending champion, John McDermott, had won at 19, and again the previous year at 20, making him the defending champion at 21. But he was a poor social outcast. Except that his father made enough money to buy a house on a leafy location directly across from the 17th hole of the country club when Ouimet was 4. He became a caddy at 11, taught himself golf (caddies are normally allowed to play in off hours) and club members impressed by his skill encouraged him. "It wasn't long before Ouimet was the best high school golfer in the state." - Wikipedia.Ouimet's father wouldn't let him play golf, frustrating his dream of going pro. Except Ouimet never wanted to become a pro, and he played a lot of golf in high school, so much that his father urged him to focus on a more rewarding profession. Oumet wanted to become a banker and stock broker, and did.The big bad rich guys wouldn't let Ouimet play with them. Except they practically begged him to. "He was asked personally by the president of the U.S. Golf Association." Ouimet said no. "Ouimet originally declined to play, having just returned from an absence from work to play in the National Amateur. His participation in the Open was soon arranged, however, with the cooperation of his employer." -- WikipediaHis caddy, Eddie Lowery, amazingly, was only 10. Except that caddies were not allowed to be older than 16, so all the caddies were "truants."Ray, at 6 feet and 220 pounds, was "overweight" but not obese, according to the NIH BMI calculator. Photos show he was not morbidly obese, as portrayed in the film. (But, hey, this is Disney.)Oh, and Ouimet won on a rain-soaked course that he grew up playing, clinching on the hole across from his bedroom window. Poignant, but not astonishingly great.Shane Hurlbut, what were you thinking? This is absolutely the worst use of color I have ever seen in a film. I had to turn if off entirely and watch it in black and white.The color looked like an old hand-tinted postcard. Cute, but it should have been dropped after the beginning of the movie. The movie's setting of the era was so good that the color manipulation was unnecessary.This excessive digital mucking around with color is going to come back to haunt otherwise good movies, much as it did "South Pacific." I see now where "42" got the inspiration for its time traveler color shift.Gimmicks should be used for a good reason. Speaking of which, the CGI is pretty hokey, and often was not integrated well with the actual footage. (But, hey, this is Disney.)The opening credits montage is meaningless, but a stroke of genius. It set the film up as a fable, at the same time claiming the mantle of "true story." So I said, "What the heck, this is Disney, forget the fact checking." At least until the movie is over. What Hollywood calls a "true story" would get any defendant in court a life sentence for perjury. At least the movie showed Francis Ouimet practicing golf for a few days, unlike the master chef rat in "Ratatouille." In reality, Ouimet played in several tournaments before the Open.Surely, the Open is at least portrayed accurately. Wrong. But I'm not a golfer, and don't really care. Brian Tyler, I hope you are good friends with Randy Newman, cause you owe him a beer for ripping off his theme from Seabiscuit. Given the ending music, better make that a truckload. And don't go saying this is an homage two years after Seabiscuit.There is the usual paint by numbers assemblage of plot. We see a dose of Titanic in the cartoon versions of venal rich folks and the romance of the débutante and the plebe. And there's the dad-the-failure theme we see in Breaking Away, etc. There's the natural genius bit from Good Will Hunting, plus some supernatural genius, as suggested by the CGI course-Ouimet mind meld.The movie that comes closest in theme is October Sky, with the kids succeeding in the national championship against long odds, and then becoming successful adults. Ouimet and Eddie Lowery, too, became very successful in life. But October Sky avoided the hokey Disney gimmicks.For a Disney film, this is watchable by adults, but another studio might have done better. On the other hand, the Disney gimmicks add to its juvenile appeal (Hey, mommy, what's the lady bug doing on the golf ball?).The Greatest Game? Who are you kidding? If you are a golf nut, maybe. Ever hear of the miracle 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team? The amazing 1969 New York Mets? Underdog victories are what sports is all about. From a golf perspective, apparently the players were younger back then, and not especially good. From a reality perspective, it seems the "true story" claim hangs on a slender thread. (But, hey, this is Disney.)Francis Ouimet, Eddie Lowery, Harry Vardon and Ted Ray are worth remembering for who they were and what they accomplished, even if half the people in the movie mispronounce Ouimet's name. The question is whether anyone will remember this movie in the years to come?</fullReview>

The costumes and wardrobe were exquisite. Based on a true story, this movie gave the viewer a glimpse into some of the challenges and privileges of participating in traditional golf tournaments as well as highlight the competitive nature of golf as a so-called gentleman's sport. Besides being heart-warming, it was also heart-wrenching and suspenseful. I am surprised this movie was not nominated for more awards. It was truly a rare find.

		<shortDescription>Well crafted, overlooked gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is first of all a good, exciting story, with well developed characters. But all the other details are well crafted on top of that, leading to a wonderful film. Don't let the Disney label lead you to think this is dumbed-down or only for kids -- it has a lot to offer to all ages, whether you like golf or not. One of the more impressive things is that the film manages to make a golf game look really exciting. And speaking as one of many who can't abide golf on TV, this is no small feat.The first half of the film does a good job of laying out the basic characters with their motivations and backgrounds, enough that you end up liking all the important competitors once the pivotal match begins halfway through. Sure, you root for Ouimet's character all along, but his primary opponents are likable and interesting in their own right. The background layer is important once the golf match becomes a match using minds as well as golf clubs, since you get a good understanding for what each person's strengths and weaknesses are as the play progresses.The computer effects are flashy, but they do help the story more often than not. The directing has all sorts of clever golf shots, and the period costumes and sets are really top notch.There are a few small quibbles -- many of the minor characters seem a little too stereotypically cast from the class warfare mold, but this is forgivable with the major characters so well drawn.Shia LaBoeuf playing Francis Ouimet is, as usual, callow and sympathetic. But the real standout is Steven Dillane, playing Harry Vardon. He rarely moves his face, but his intense, often sad, eyes and minor changes of expression say so much.Ouimet's caddy Eddie Lowery, played by Josh Flitter, steals the scenes he is in. After you see the film, Google to find the actual photograph of Ouimet and Lowery at the tournament, to get an even better appreciation of how incredible this match truly was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disneyfied ...But One Of The Better Golf Movies Out There</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching a movie about a kid's struggle to play golf I'd assumed would be about as appealing as sticking hot needles in my eyes. But I'd heard a few good things about THE GREATEST GAME EVER PLAYED and found out that it was directed by Bill Paxton (ALIENS, 1986) so decided to give it a go. I ordered it from my online rental company and, to my additional horror once it arrived, discovered that it was a Disney film. Oh Lord, nooo! Not having anything else to watch, I swallowed my Mouseketeer bile and slid it into my DVD player.Well, it ain't too bad. Shia Le Beouf stars as 20-year-old Francis Ouimet, the historically amazing young man who had a knack for the game of golf and beat out two "veteran" British players (Harry Vardon and Ted Ray) for the U.S. Open, and did so using a preteen caddy with a loud personality but a love of the game.There have been a lot of films made featuring golf at their cores and I've seen many of them. TIN CUP was probably my favorite. HAPPY GILMORE was funny but in a gruff, teenage sort of way. CADDYSHACK: 'nough said. THE LEGEND OF BAGGER VANCE was modestly entertaining. And now we have THE GREATEST GAME EVER PLAYED. Being "Disneyfied" the film takes this historical golfing event and puts a gushing feel-good face on it. This isn't necessarily a bad thing; just something you might want to brace yourself for. Francis is at odds with his father, who believes that golf is a waste of time and is outside their class. Francis and his family aren't wealthy and struggle to get by. So the tensions get moved up a few notches as Francis and his father find themselves in the middle of a generation gap. There's a love interest in a woman who's waaaay beyond Francis' means. And there's the growing attraction of the down-and-out toward Francis as they read about his success in the papers during the pre-depression times.The acting was okay. Nothing outstanding with the exception of Francis' little caddy, Eddie Lowery (Josh Flitter, ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND) who steals almost every scene he's in.What made this film a success was how it was filmed. Cameras perched on top of golf balls as they're hit. Special effects that make the crowds vanish and leave the golfer all alone on the fairway with nothing between him and the green. The slow-motion swings of these men and how clean they were. That's what really helped move this flick along and didn't linger on putts, bad lays, or other golfing intricacies that easily could put many watchers to sleep.If you're a Disney fan you'll probably fall on your knees and give praise to such a high quality film. And even if you're not a big bolster of the Mouse Man, you might find this to be a relative gem amongst their more overly-sweet works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest sports films ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my humble opinion, THE GREATEST GAME EVER PLAYED is one of the greatest sports films ever made. Director Bill Paxton, and Walt Disney Pictures bring you the true story surrounding the legendary 1913 U.S. Open face-off, between 20 year old, Francis Ouimet, and reigning British champion Harry Vardon. Early in the 20th century, golf was a game for gentleman, and reserved for the snobby upper-class. Francis has been caddying for years, and is urged by his peers to play in a qualifying match. Francis' working-class dad discourages any ambitions his son has in the game of golf, seeing it as not his son's place in the world, out of his class, with those people. This movie tells the timeless underdog tale of a young amateur, qualifying for the 1913 US Open and not letting the pressure stifle him from accomplishing his dreams. Leading up to the rousing finale where he faces off against (then only 3 time) British Open winner Harry Vardon in an epic battle in the pouring rain. The fairways and greens are the battlefield. The wooden clubs are the weapons. Who will be the victor: experience or youth? What makes this movie a masterpiece, surprising you on every level, is the issues it examines. From the class system, and how that dominated the game of golf early on, to the stunning visuals, like the camera riding the golf ball literally, as it flies toward the flag at the other end of the grass. This movie is heartwarming, keeping you in suspense throughout, sort of a "Seabiscuit" tale on a golf course. Rated PG.</fullReview>

As little as I'd expect of it, the movie had managed to do anything but that. The story in the movie was well told, with touching moments that inspire. The soundtrack created the right atmosphere and swayed my emotions gently through the story. Every successful man had to be the underdog in the beginning, but it is their dream, passion and persistence - to never give up no matter what - that has made them into what they are. This is a movie I'd recommend to anyone regardless of their age or preference.</fullReview>

From this movie i now no that if you are interested in playing golf you should just do it and not sit back and think about it for 4 years like i did. I regret not starting to play golf at the age of 8. now i love golf even more and i play golf for a Hobie. my favourite part of the movie is when the little guy, the short one comes on set. he is also my favourite character. i first heard about this movie at the local video store(video ezy) and i hired it my mum said no so i hired it with my own money. i really enjoyed that movie and again well done on a successful movie.</fullReview>

It is an inspirational movie and it not only tells a true story but it also teaches good morals such as always judge someone by who they are and never give up.

It made sure it had its story weaved around the true event, with its light moments and sense of vision. I was so glad the makers of the movie didn't try to spin of a love story in between. The movie stuck to the task in providing us a heart warmer. Surely the greatest ambassador for the game of Golf. Makes you wanna get up and go do that something you always wanted to do for yourself.

		<shortDescription>Once again Disney proves it's magic...I am a Disney sucker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I won't tell anyone that for them this is THEE movie to see...I won't tell them that hands down it should be made the best movie in existence. I will only give MY opinion which is what my reviews are all about and I fell head over heels in love with The Greatest Game Ever Played. Disney might make some mistakes here and there but they still have the magic and they always manage to get a hole in one every once in awhile. The Greatest Game Ever played is the true story of an American Underdog who captures the hearts of everyone when he beats out one of the world's greatest golfers to win the 18th US Golf open. You might expect that knowing the outcome of a film like this would completely eliminate any thrill or potential edge of your seat moments but brilliantly that is not the case!! Writer Mark Frost who also wrote the original novel keeps the story uplifting and moving and personal but still makes it about the game which is amazing for fans.Young and rising star Shia LaBeouf who truly shined in the kids' Disney Classic Holes takes on a slightly more grown up role as down on his luck dreamer Francis Ouimet who discovers he has a god given talent for playing Golf. LaBeouf is bright eyed and easy to watch and has a great knack for drawing you into his characters. He's a real kid hero that anybody could look up to and he's got a bright spirit that shines through. Now let's mention the absolutely terrific young star Josh Flitter who plays determined little caddie Eddie Lowery. Eddie is like the sidekick you might find in most animated Disney films. He's cute and encouraging and hilarious...gets all the funny lines. He lifts Ouimet up when he's down in the dumps and is the best caddie and friend in the world. Already landing several big roles Flitter will be someone to watch because he seems like a powerful presence for a little guy. Stephen Dillane plays world class and famous golfer Harry Vardon who really is the counterpart to Francis Ouimet. They have so much in common in the way they led their life and their determination to prove their worth to those who think less of them. Vardon is emotional and has a lot going on and Dillane shows a world of back story behind his eyes. He's a worth adversary on the course but an important "hero" to the story. He does a fantastic job. Stephen Marcus is also great as Vardon's good friend and foe on the course Ted Ray. He's uncouth and brilliant at the Gentlemen's game rounding out the point that anyone can play Golf. He's also a good laugh and a great character. Mention must also be given to both actors Marnie McPhail, and Elias Koteas as Ouimet's parents...one very supportive of his dreams (his mother) and his father much more of a realist having been pounded by work ethic and those who think they are better than he is. Both have valid points and play caring concerned characters although small roles...both equally powerful.Subconsciously when you go to see a film every wants and expects certain things to happen. When you see a film of this kind you expect a certain format and you hope that these events take place and The Greatest Game Ever Played delivers every single thing I hoped would happen and when one of those things I thought didn't happen (his father being there at this winning shot) but it turned out he was (standing in the crowd holding money up to his son like everyone was doing...a tribute to amateur golfers who were not entitled to win the purse) I cried...yep I actually did...before I knew it my tears were welled up and I was smiling from ear to ear like I had just won the championship. From start to finish this beautifully made family film never disappoints and clocks in at 2 Hours but NEVER feels like it is. The golf games are still kept interesting and the film is well kept and a good pace and it's just such a feel good film. Not everyone might love it as much as I did and I can't necessarily explain my love of it except to say it was sweet and cute and funny and uplifting and there are just so few films that make you feel that way. Disney continues what it was meant to be and kudos to them and please don't ever stop making films like this. This is sure to be a classic!! Please check this one out with your family!! 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was wonderful. We took our sons, ages 8 and 14 and they loved it. The story is beautifully told and the unique camera angles really draw the viewer into the action. There were touching moments as you would expect, but this movie was a lot more suspenseful than I would have ever expected.It seems like this film is really under the radar right now, I hope it really starts to pick-up the positive buzz it deserves. If you are thinking of seeing it - DO! You won't be disappointed. Shia LeBeouf as Francis Ouimet is great and his interaction with his caddy, Freddy, is great!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For this genre, it's darn near perfect...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a firm believer in judging a film within its genre. I call the genre that this movie belongs in: "the type of movie I can take my 10 &amp; 12 year old kids and still really enjoy myself." Being big fans of the book &amp; movie "Holes," this was a must see for the family, since they share the same lead actor.The cinematography was great - it made the golf scenes exciting (and I don't play anymore).I realize this was based on a true story - which probably means the golf scores were, at least, accurate. The story outside the golf was well written and well acted by all. Francis is definitely our hero, but a fallible one at times, which is well done, too. The antagonist is the oppressive "elitism" of the age - which makes one smile considering how far the game has come (can you say "Tiger Woods"?).I highly recommend this movie, if you like a good story or good acting or a well shot movie or golf in general...or all of the above.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Basically - two long golf games ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a nice movie. Basically it consists of watching a couple of long golf games. Shia LaBeouf and Josh Flitter (who comes in later in the movie) are a likable team and are fun to watch as they are up against some very high-end players.There is some character development/background but most of the movie consists of watching golf play. It is very similar to watching a boxing movie - you just sort of sit and watch them do their thing and compete for a while. It's kind of interesting but not for everyone.One interesting aspect of the movie was the graphic depiction of how stress and pressure was affecting the players' minds. I haven't seen this done very often in sports movies so it was a nice touch.If you're a Shia fan or golf enthusiast, this movie would probably be of interest. Not for everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All right, I came into this movie with high expectations. Inspirational sports movies are always good. I kind of like golf. It takes place in a cool time period. And, it stars the only legit Disney Channel kid ever. (I don't care what you think about this film, but I'm sure it's better than "The Perfect Man") Well I must say my expectations were met with flying colors. The film had great acting and a lot of good characters, both comical and evil. Shia did an excellent job as Francis, it was good to see him in a more serious role. I really liked Harry Vardon too, he was very likable and honorable. And Ted Ray (the fat guy) was comical and also just a cool guy. I even liked the little kid!! His potential to be an annoying little Schmiddy was through the roof. But he was actually funny and had a few touching moments with Francis. And then there was that Crazy American Guy, the evil British Nobles, and those creepy top hat guys. The best part about the film was the cinematography. (I think I spelled that wrong). They had awesome golf montages. Some flaws obviously, the movie could have been shorter. Some random scenes didn't seem to go anywhere (like that opera scene). Also shortening the golf scenes might have been better. It would have made the ending more dramatic. Also, I wish they would have done more with the relationship with Francis and his father. Point is, I really liked the movie anyway. It made me happy and that's pretty much the movie's purpose.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Golf is not an easy sport to make into an exciting film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My father was a life member of the PGA. He joined in 1931, so he was in the group of golfers that followed Francis Ouimet &amp; Harry Vardon. I grew up with golf &amp; found the film to be quite good, but I suspect it takes a golfer or one who knows the game to not be bored. It's not an easy sport to make exciting. However, if one has ever been present at a tournament which is match play, you know that the suspense &amp; tension is such that you can cut it with a knife.My main issue with the film is that, while it spent quite a lot of time dealing with Francis Ouimet's social inferiority in 1913 society, it didn't fully tell the story. Today top professional sportsmen &amp; athletes are superstar celebrities, wealthy, &amp; the elite of society. Back then it was far different. Francis Ouimet was poor &amp; had caddied as a child. He competed as an amateur, but an amateur was supposed to be a gentleman &amp; a person of wealth &amp; position.... elite. Ouimet had to step into this elite society.... but at least he could... as an amateur. Professional sportsmen were considered &amp; treated as mere "tradesmen," because they played for cash prizes. We get a couple of scenes that show the social tension, but unless a viewer is already aware of the situation, it's not fully explained. We see Harry Vardon idolized by the galleries &amp; theatre goers, but viewers who are unaware of the situation are left to wonder at the snide, rude remarks made towards &amp; about Vardon by the so-called "gentlemen." Professional golfers, like Harry Vardon, were not allowed in the club houses nor the use of any of the club facilities. They had to change clothes in the caddy shack or in their cars &amp; if they ate, it was in the caddy shack with the caddies. These class striations persisted until after WW2 when Ben Hogan refused to play in tournaments unless the pros had equal access to club houses... the dining rooms, locker rooms, showers, etc... as the amateur players. It would not have taken much to clarify this situation, but as it was, I suspect that the film left many viewers confused.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not just a movie about golf</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Greatest Game Ever Played takes the true story of the US Open Championship in 1913 and creates an incredible underdog story that anyone could enjoy. Bill Paxton uses the perfect angles to intensify shots and create an atmosphere that leaves viewers on the edge of their seat. The soundtrack also compliments the film seamlessly, but the critical moments of the film are exemplified because the viewer only hears silence. The movie creates a an accurate representation of the early 1900s by introducing class conflict and anti-Catholic prejudices represented through Francis Ouimet and other characters. Ouimet, played by Shia LaBeouf is an Irish, working-class caddy fighting for his dream against the prejudices of the British and country club members. Throughout the tournament, Ouimet's caddy is a ten year old boy, played by Josh Flitter, whose witty lines and catch-phrases steal the scene almost every time. Stephen Dillane is also exceptional as he depicts Ouimet's lifelong idol, Harry Vardon. Vardon has demons of his own from childhood that he fights against and prevents him from being an equal within the English Society. Almost every viewer will be able to find a character within the film to identify with.There are very few weaknesses to this film, if any being the length. However, it seems almost necessary to accurately represent the magnitude of the situation and the story. Francis Ouimet's journey throughout the US Open will hold the viewers' attention until the last minute and is a must see for all audiences.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a feel good triumph against the odds uplifting true story about a amateur golfer from a poor background who won the US Open golf championship in 1913. The snobbery and class barriers he had to overcome seem a little exaggerated for effect. Shia La Beouf as Francis Ouimet is endearing and his 10 year old caddy is a scene stealer. The David vs Goliath tournament is quite exciting as he takes on the British Champion Henry Vardon played sympathetically by Stephen Dillaine. It's interesting to see that Vardon himself faced class discrimination in the sport.The actor Bill Paxton is a good director. The photography is interesting with a mix of shots and visual effects to make the movie exciting even for non golf players.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Directed by Bill Paxton, "The Greatest Game Ever Played" stars Shia LaBeouf as Francis Ouimet, the first amateur golfer to win the US Open."Game" was produced by Walt Disney studios, and so is wholly generic. We get the usual inspirational messages ("dont give up on your dreams", "be all you can be" etc), much forced sentimentality and the various well-worn clichés typical of underdog movies.Still, it's not all bad. "Game" was directed by the lovable Bill Paxton ("Game over, man!"), who does well to delve into the class divides of early 20th century America. As he's an actor himself, Paxton also coaxes good performances from his cast, particularly LaBeouf and Elias Koteas. Their characters are broadly sketched, larger-than-life and almost mythological. Also impressive is the film's set design, with full scale turn-of-the-century towns, and some fine interior wood-work. Considering Paxton's never directed a big budget feature before, his direction in "Game" is impressive, particularly his handling of architecture and wide spaces.7.9/10 ? Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exhilarating underdog film, with more than one underdog!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE GREATEST GAME EVER PLAYED (TGGEP, 2005) is an amazingly uplifting, infectious underdog film that never (really) devolves into sappiness or heavyhandedness. Yes, it takes several liberties, as most Hollywood films do, but those liberties are forgiven as they actually add to the film's enjoyment, not detract from it. In fact, there are a lot of truthful moments in it. You can really tell that it's a "Rocky" type film from the film's outset, but who cares? Directed by none other than Bill Paxton (I know, right?!), it's expertly done and immensely watchable! TGGEP tells the story of Francis Ouimet (played with confidence, cockiness, and class by superstar-to-be Shia LaBeouf), an amateur golfer from a working class Irish-French immigrant family living in Brookline, MA, in the early 1900s. Ouimet qualifies to play in the 1913 U.S. Open. Included amongst his competition is the legendary Harry Vardon (played with immense class, dignity, and ferocity by Stephen Dillane). Ironically, Vardon is the 2nd underdog in this flick! The film starts in 1870s Scotland where land developers tell the youngster that they are building a golf course on his home and that golf is a game not for the likes of someone like him. Francis undergoes some of the same prejudice as a boy in early 1900s Brookline. The stories converge at the 1913 Open.What's ironic is that even as an adult and multiple major champion, Vardon is still an outcast in British society due to his upbringing. Francis learned much about golf from reading Vardon's books on the subject and Vardon is his idol all growing up. Unbeknownst to Vardon, they actually met back in 1900 in Boston after Vardon, who won that year's Open, was touring when Francis was only 7.In addition to Francis and Vardon, entrants in the 1913 Open include Vardon's friend and champion Brit Ted Ray (boisterous Stephen Marcus) and classless, chest-thumping two-time defending champion John McDermott (Michael Weaver). The film really does a good job of showing the different personalities of these men.Redheaded Marnie McPhail is ingratiatingly serene and stunning as Francis' supportive Irish mum and veteran Elias Koteas gives a stern, reserved, taciturn performance as his French dad. Addtionally, plucky young Josh Flitter (as Francis' pint-sized 10-year old caddy Eddie) almost single handedly steals the proceedings.Paxton throws in a lot of modern details, such as special effects zooming-in shots to show the scoreboard positioning of the players and CGI for a lot of the golf shots to keep the film exciting and at a brisk pace so as not to make the film too much of a period piece. But the film still convinces us of a specific time and place.What's interesting is that, while Rocky-like, this is all based on a true story! So the ending is satisfactory on so many levels. An entertaining film about golf set in the early 1900s...Wow!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watchable little sports film that encompasses many-a positive characteristic and comes as pretty essential viewing to anyone under the age of about eighteen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You hold your breath going into The Greatest Game Ever Played, a Disney-produced piece that documents a lowly ranked American underdog going into a 'home' tournament against the best in the world, who are British, in order to defeat them at their own game. Biggest of biggest surprises then, when you realise it isn't really about that at all and instead we find it encompassing a number of very positive, very re-assuring traits linked to self-esteem; individualism and the class system, even if it borrows from out-and-out cliché on other occasions. It's a pretty routine three out of five stars sports picture that handles everything it wants to in a commendable manner; but as a piece aimed at a specific, more younger audience, the film creeps up into the realm of three and a half to four out of five. This is for its energy, vibrancy and brass-tacks look at young people trying to figure out where they belong in the world; what they want to do and that no matter how famous or skilled you are or might see someone as, everybody can hurt.The scene that documents this best is the instance in which golfer Harry Vardon (Stephen Dillane) is about to take a tee-shot during a tournament, but is suddenly and slightly overcome with fear born out of what happened to him as a boy, as four ominous top-hat clad men loom over him. He acknowledges it, swings and hits a decent shot. It is he whom we begin with in The Greatest Game Ever Played; as his cold, dark and drab Jersey-set place of dwelling is ruthlessly torn down by those wanting to expand, update and modernise his patch of land for sake of a links golf course. "What's golf?" asks a young Harry; he gets a reply from one of the aggressors that resembles something in the region of "a game people like you will never get to play". Golf is Harry's Achilles heel; his ultimate love/hate item. It is the reason he has the demons he does, but it is the reason everyone knows of him through his fame. The scene additionally introduces us to the study of class the film carries throughout; the notion that it doesn't matter who you are or where you're from; if you want to try something supposedly out of your league, then go for it.Cut to the not so far future and we have the welcoming, colourful, activity-laden America, plus a credits sequence. But below the supposed glitz and appeal of the good old U.S. lies an equally troubled young man in the form of Francis Ouimet (Shia LaBeouf), a young adult living in rather a large family in conditions that, I suppose for the time, are just about good enough to see them get by. As the next in line to adopt that old fashioned, and somewhat annoying, 'man of the house' tag; it's thought the logical thing for Francis to do is get a traditional, steady job as his father did in order to earn the money for the keep. But Francis dares to dream, and in Francis many of the film's target audience will see themselves as this young individual on the verge of life. Francis embodies everything you'd want in a lead: he's young, energetic, handsome, ambitious, kind and has the aforementioned Harry Vardon as an idol. Francis opts to go against the status quo and, unsurprisingly, wants to take up golf.Bill Paxton has done the unthinkable, but in an extremely positive sense. He's made a really accessible film using golf as the backdrop for the Disney crowd - a film that studies angst and the career-related decisions of young adulthood, whilst seamlessly incorporating the element of one's 'class'. The film's structure might remind you of 2006's Goal, a similar film in tone and study that came out around about the same time, about this young man daring to dream and having to go through his oppositional opinionated father in the process. Francis' father, Arthur (Elias Koteas), maintains his chief gripe, which is that golf's for 'gentlemen'; the sort that sneer and totally disregard those of the level Arthur sees himself and his family at. Francis ignores the advice, goes ahead and plays golf but his father's concern and disciplined advice turns into confusion and rage when he realises that as an amateur, Francis doesn't even get paid for it.Like 2006's football orientated film Goal, the lead gets an early shot and doesn't quite swipe the opportunity; but he rises from where he subsequently finds himself. As events take their turn, Ouimet is allowed a wild-card entry, as an amateur, into the 1913 U.S. Open; one of only two golfing majors that existed at that time. He is accompanied by his idol Varden; as well as the equally skilled and equally real Ted Ray; a big, booming Englishman who we're introduced to as a boozing, brawling, tavern-frequenting man whom manages to retain his golfing skills despite all this. In there as well is the nationalistic and egotistical true-to-life American golfer John McDermott, who doesn't care who wins as long as an American beats these Brits here, in America, at their own game. McDermott represents everything I feared going into the film, his inclusion is one of a very knowing addition on Paxton's behalf; and his demise from the tournament teaches us of what qualities you need-not possess. In a contemporary climate full of celebrities and the obsessives that follow them, how nice to see a film that's about a young character drawn to someone of great stature by way of his hard work, but a role model whom they themselves carry particular demons. The film is a real winner: tense and entertaining whilst consistently engrossing.</fullReview>

I mean, Wow! Even my young boys enjoyed the film (5 and 6 at the time), though I'm quite certain this was not geared to their age groups.This movie was clean, too, which is a great plus. It is so great to sit down to a movie you thoroughly enjoy without profanity, violence (except one very brief scene) or anything else one is likely to find morally objectionable.This movie brought you along on a journey you are so ready to believe because of the great acting. You feel the vast range of emotions portrayed along with the characters.I never thought a golf movie would have me at the edge of my seat, but I couldn't help being intensely interested in how this one would turn out. I have nothing to compare it to since I have neither watched golf in reality or on film before, but everyone did a great job in keeping the pace and emotions captivating here. The score also did wonders; excellent, excellent score.Even if you don't think this would be your kind of film, watch it. You may be pleasantly surprised. I certainly was.</fullReview>

This film is about the 20 year old amateur golfer Francis Ouimet(Shia LaBeouf)and his competition in the 1913 U.S. Open. What a story; a once-in-a-lifetime chance for a supposedly incapable young man to play along side the best golfers of the time, including British champions Harry Vardon(Stephen Dillane)and Ted Ray(Stephen Marcus). A storybook ending leaves a knot in the throat. The cast also includes: Peter Firth, Elias Koteas, Marnie McPhail, Robin Wilcox, and possibly stealing the show is Josh Flitter, who plays Eddie Lowery, Ouimet's caddy and best friend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Both Disney and Bill Paxton did a fine job in conveying a story that is based in fact. You do not have to like the game of golf to appreciate the story of one man's struggle to overcome the odds. It could have been based on any sport or simply on any other situation which involves competition, though this one just happens to be related to Golf. The only problem I have with the story is that I would have liked to see a bit deeper into each of the main characters, esp. Mr. Ouimet. Mr. Francis Ouimet is a typical young man of his times, turn of the century America, where "class lines" are well delineated and woe be it to anyone who deigns to try to rise above his "class" standing. I did a bit of historical research and my biggest question was indeed answered, to my satisfaction. Although the circumstances are a bit different than those portrayed in the film, I came away with a feeling of content. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, I believe you will too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rainy day with not much to do. We were surfing the movie network channels and found this one just starting, so we gave it a chance.The more we watched, the more we became engrossed in the story. Its the old story of working class underdog trying to make it in a sport which at the time (1913 I think) was usually played by the wealthy upper class but this movie was every bit as interesting as Seabiscuit and this is also based on a true story.The acting is believable and the casting is brilliant. AND . . . . we are NOT golfers, so please don't miss this one just because its about golf. Any individual sport would serve the plot, because it's about the people. Golf works well for this story because of the class distinction and snobbery that seem to involve some who play the game.Bottom line . . . . Its a feel good movie. It's well put together and isn't it always fun to see those who think they are better than others get taken down a peg or two.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My 11th Review. On the Scorecard: Dignity, Poise, and Great Heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you like your sports movies to be about dignity and the best values then this'll work for you big time. Oversentimental in places? Sure, of course it is - and proud of it. It is the biggest and best ride in the Carnival and should be enjoyed as that. Big production values, simple telling, with creative shots: it is not complex, is a very nice and remarkably sweet film. It really feels like a labor of love from Bill Paxton; and I bet his son gets that.The build-up is slow enough to be enjoyed, the conflicts feisty, and the British vs. Americans handled with a degree of vaudevillian villainy, but the dignity between the two main transatlantic protagonists is always to the fore. I have minor gripes: the score wants to be James Horner but is too overblown, and there are too many close-ups, and panning shots for 2005, but if you want a straightforward, decent, and good-looking sports film then this is it.So here's the thing, and I feel like I know my film, but I actually liked it more than Seabiscuit: which is a better film, but Greatest Story is simply Disney at its core and hugely enjoyable! Thanks, Bill.</fullReview>

I thought it was going to be bad because i couldn't see Shia in any other role than his recently cancelled show "Even Stevens". When i turned it on i was ready to turn it off from boredom in about ten minutes. It started a bit slow and i couldn't understand the beginning because the years didn't make sense then they explained that later in the show so i was relieved of wondering about that.

I recently saw the Bobby Jones movie but was still really intrigued by this one - but any true story is intriguing especially when it involves an underdog.My hubby and I just saw Superman Returns but found this more enjoyable - maybe we're getting old or maybe we just enjoy a simple story with no sex, violence or vulgarity in it or maybe it's a bit of both lol! I find Shia L. to be a fantastic actor!!! I loved him in "Holes" and was equally impressed with him as Francis Ouimet. And I think Bill Paxton did a wonderful job for his first time directing!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nice Movie, Subtle and Believable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know a lot about the history of golf. I know the big guys like Bobby Jones and Ben Hogan. This movie is more about what led to Americans embracing the sport that was owned by the British Isles before that. The characters are very low key and gentlemanly. Watching the Masters after having seen the film, I love that there are still elements of a sport that go back to the beginnings. There are some loose cannons on the tour, but most of the golfers observe a code that keeps them on their best behavior. I was impressed by that tug between the aristocracy and those from humbler roots. This is a wonderful story about golf, but it's also a great human story. See it for the performances. One thing I wondered about. They apparently didn't have to mark a ball if it was in your line. There's a scene where the ball is popped over the other ball.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Game Ever Played</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Such a wonderfully done movie. Rented it due to being a huge Stephen Dillane fan (Welcome to Sarajevo), and was never disappointed. He was superb as ever. Dillane is such a special kind of actor; serene, intense and his face says so much. And the actor who plays the lead, well, he's brilliant. This movie is based on a true story, which makes it even more touching. But either way, it's so well-done by the director, Bill Paxton, that even if you don't like golf, it doesn't matter. The period is so well depicted, the golf scenes interesting and fun to watch and the acting by everyone is so worth the rental price. A keeper. One of those "gentle" films that make seeing a movie an experience so worthwhile. Bravo, bravo on this wonderful film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally A True Story Nicely Told.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was amazing. I rented this movie thinking it was going to be another sports up movie of how the little guy wins against the big dudes, but there was more to it than that. For a true story I think it it was told pretty close to the real thing, I mean there weren't a lot of Hollywood add on gimmicks. I was pretty amazed by the acting plus for a person like me the movie managed to get some air dust in my eyes.OK the movie was a bit stretched for two hours but there was good fillers throughout the movie, it kept me entertained all the way. I think Bill Paxton did a great job in directing and the characters did there parts pretty well. If you got nothing to do and tired of crappy Hollywood films pik this up you will like it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to this movie with normal expectations for yet another Disney movie, but this is one of the best ones I have ever seen. Really it's one of the top movies on my list of all time. The acting was excellent. Some of the effects they used were very impressive. Such as showing from some of the golfers view of how they focused out all of the people around them. So many unexpected plot twists. The basis of the story starts with Francis Ouimet who caddies at a local golf course. Quite poor he finds the opportunity to enter in a local amateur golf tournament. With the required score for the qualifying round one point away, Francis loses his cool, messes up, and shoots one point over. Impressed by his abilities, some sponsors want to put him into the U.S. open. Francis eventually accepts the challenge and enters the tournament against some of the best golfers in the world. The question is, can Francis hold his own? Or will he lose his cool again? This movie had me on the edge of my seat the last 30 minutes of the show. Great movie! GO SEE IT!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is undoubtedly - in my opinion - a classic. It shows Francis Ouimet's struggle to prove he can play well, and that class doesn't make you a better golfer. Yes, the movie did cliché a lot but, nowadays every movie has clichés in it, for its basically impossible to make a movie without one. There wasn't a single time in the movie when I dozed off or tuned out. Meaning, it kept me intrigued from beginning to end. When you saw Francis grow tense, you grew tense. And when you thought he'd pull out alright, he wouldn't make it. And vice versa. Even though you knew Francis was going to beat Harry, it still made my eyes teary when he became the US Open Champion. The Greatest Game Ever Played is a very well directed movie, and it's actors could play their part well. Snaps to Paxton!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why alter history? It was a great story without revisionism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Writing a movie script based on Mark Frost's excellent book was no doubt a daunting task; doing a movie about any golf game has to be a challenge. And this rendition of the 1913 US Open was fair but perhaps failed most in not holding to the truth.First, Francis Ouimet didn't beat Harry Vardon by one stroke - he beat him by five (72 to 77). Second, Ted Ray didn't drop out of the final round as the movie depicted; granted, he did tell Vardon that he had basically given up, because of his poor play, but he was too much of a professional to walk off the course. He continued to play and carded a 78.Another distortion was having Ouimet drop out of golf completely for two years - didn't happen. And, when he is asked two weeks before the Open to play, this was a fabrication as well.Perhaps the greatest injustice, not to the movie but to the game, was to have someone utter the words that "this was the greatest game ever played." Okay, fine, up to 1913 this was the greatest game, but since then we've had 90+ years of thousands of games so this is just a memory. NO, THIS was the greatest game ever played, as-of 2005, not 1913. In the book we never read these words, so why implant them? And talk about missing opportunities for a great laugh: after the first day of competition, when Ouimet looked like quite a competitor, a club member suggested to Francis that he had proved his point and that he should drop out and let the pros take over. While Francis reacted in shock, Eddie Lowery responded by asking the man if he was drunk. When I read the book I was sure we'd hear that line - but no, the writers preferred to alter history rather than take advantage of a truthful and humorous episode.Would I recommend the movie? Perhaps, as it is a fair rendition and gets the point across about this 20 year old overcoming all obstacles, even his own, to beat the greatest British golfer of all time. But I'd recommend the book even more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully done!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Greatest Game Ever Played" is beautifully done. It is perfect in many (if not all) aspects. A real winner. It is not for everyone though. Most young people will probably be bored by it, I mean golf isn't exactly the most exciting and action packed game ever invented. However, for those with longer attention spans, it is a very good movie that I really enjoyed.My hat goes off to Bill Paxton for a wonderful job directing. He manages to make the sport of golf actually interesting. To tell the truth, I rolled my eyes when I saw this being billed as an epic. But it does fulfill the word, although it doesn't even remotely compare to the likes of "Ben-Hur" and "Lawrence of Arabia".One of the biggest surprises about this movie is the performance given by Shia LaBeouf as Francis Ouimet. I was rather unsure about how good he would be, especially after seeing him on the Disney Channel's TV show "Even Stevens". But he was wonderful. LaBeouf's definite strength is in his facial expressions. He managed to show every emotion in just his face. If he continues to perform like this, I can see a long and successful career carved out for him.Elias Koteas, he plays Arthur Ouimet, also gives a very strong performance. Just like with LaBeouf, Koteas' strength is in facial expressions. It's a very strong, and apparently heart felt performance.In my mind, Stephen Dillane steals the show. His performance is captivating and seems to truly come from the heart. He perfectly captures the troubled character of Harry Vardon and I look forward to seeing more of him. Just with Koteas and LaBeouf, Dillane is very good at showing emotion through his face. I truly admire and enjoyed his performance.What makes this movie so wonderful, in my mind, is the terrific chemistry the characters have. You don't know if you should be rooting for Vardon or Ouimet. THAT is the sign of a good movie.If you think you can handle it, you can see this movie. But if you prefer the more action packed adventure flicks, than don't bother seeing it because you won't be doing it justice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic Disney Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disney could not have done a better job with this movie. The superb screen writing was done by Mark Frost, who wrote the book on which the movie was based. The detailed set and costume design clearly suggest the year 1913. Director Bill Paxton got the very best out of his entire cast and the golf scenes suggest believable highly skilled players.Hooked on golf from age 4, a young Francis Ouimet would stand on the sidewalk next to the 17th fairway of "The Country Club" (located directly across the street from his house) and emulate all of the golfers' swings. By age 7 he was making 28 cents per round working as a caddy for "The Country Club" and before long had constructed a 3 hole golf course in his spacious back yard. Francis was part of the 1st generation of Americans to grow up loving the game of golf the likes of which included Gene Sarazen (credited with inventing the sand wedge); Walter Hagen (the 1st professional to actually earn a living playing golf); and Bobby Jones, the absolute greatest player of this era and easily in the top 3 of all time. In contrast Francis' father, played by Elias Koteas, hated golf and saw it as a game played solely by pretentious wealthy people. Francis' mother loved and supported her son's efforts as she realized his God given talent for the game. Stephen Dillane plays an outstanding Harry Vardon both in skill level and mentality. Stephen Marcus plays an excellent Ted Ray and while portraying the proper English mentality, has his moments during the film. I'm only critical of his golf swing in that he rotates both of his wrists to the right during his back swing. Anyone knowledgeable about golf knows this movement results in a nasty slice. It should be noted that Ted had a great non-politically correct seen with Amateur Wilfred Reid while Harry had one with Lord Northcliffe. It was refreshing to see their strong characters shine through in these scenes.Best of all we see the gorgeous and talented Peyton List in the role of Francis' girlfriend. On the one hand she must honor and respect her wealthy, snobby parents; on the other hand, she's wonderfully sensitive to Francis the human being who has tenaciously taken his stand and knows no bounds of status. Divine Providence versus free will - Eddie Lowery wound up as Francis' caddy. What are the odds? Yet, Lowery was the perfect fit to assist Francis. What caddy could have done better? It's a beautiful story and a true one. And who was Eddie Lowery; the personification of a child's enthusiasm and optimism. Divine Providence versus cold hard reality ? the question is answered in Frost's book by the only person who actually witnessed the landing and role out of Vardon's tee shot on the final 17th. So much for Lord Northcliffe's reasoning. You be the judge. It should also be noted that Harry Vardon probably had the best of all golf quotes: Golf is master of us all !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great film, even if you have no interest in golf</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disney tells a wonderful underdog saga with "The Greatest Game Ever Played," the true story of Francis Ouimet, the father of amateur golf, directed by Bill Paxton, starring Shia LaBeouf, Stephen Dillane, Marnie McPhail, Elias Koteas, Josh Flitter, and Stephen Marcus.The Massachusetts-born Ouimet was the child of a Canadian father and Irish mother, who grew up across the street from a country club, where he started caddying at the age of 11. Golf at that time was prominent in Britain, and the British were the world's best golfers. It was a sport of the rich. Francis Ouimet, like the great British golfer, Harry Vardon, came from poor circumstances. In one of the first scenes, Vardon is summoned to an exclusive club. He believes, as a golf champion, that he is being invited to become a member; instead, the club wants him to work for them.Against his father's wishes, Ouimet begins to compete as an amateur golfer, ultimately qualifying for the U.S. Open in 1913. The championship resulted in a three-way playoff between Vardon, Ted Roy, and Ouimet. Ouimet's upset win popularized amateur golf in the United States.Ouimet's caddie was a ten-year-old boy, Eddie Lowery, whose brother couldn't caddie because he was caught by a truant officer.Bill Paxton has done a great job directing this rousing film, giving the viewer the feeling that his is there on the course, watching the various shots as they travel across the green.The performances are excellent, with LaLaBeouf doing an amazing job as Ouimet, who puts up with prejudice and hardship to live his dream. As Eddie, Josh Flitter is fantastic as Eddie, a little adult with sage advice. Standouts in the rest of the cast are Stephen Dillane as Harry Vardon, and the actors who play Ouimet's parents, Elias Koteas in a very emotional, heartfelt performance as Francis' tough, protective father, and Marnie McPhail, a pretty woman who exudes warmth as Francis' loving and encouraging mother.Highly recommended - this is an inspiring film for the whole family, beautifully produced and acted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Intensely Personal, Beautifully Photographed, and Musically Score Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There aren't very many golf movies and this one is THE golf movie that seemingly explodes on the screen with an amazing opening series of animated, antiqued colored titles and then with an brilliant display of cinematography and one of the most emotively, provocative musical scores, this almost epic feeling movie about 20-year-old Francis Ouimet ultimately leads to the climatic last third of the movie of the real life 18 U.S. Open Championship that pit young American amateur against the British Open Champion Harry Vardon. Perhaps the only mild weakness was the balance between the portrayal of Ouimet and interestingly a decent effort at simultaneously incorporating some of Vardon's background and personal presentation. This movie avoids the typical stereotypical, over dramatized love affair, and enhances the personal conflict between father and son. Unlike the more mainstream fictional romantic dram Tin Cup (1996) starring Kevin Costner, that decently performs using golf as its major theme, it nevertheless doesn't stand out among its genre whereas The Great Game reverberates with a strong echo of Costner's own epic Dances with Wolves (1990) with its the original music of Brian Tyler and the rich and truly inspirational personal story being told using compelling photography and a script that richly involves the audience. Perhaps the closest in terms of excellence is the somewhat more ethereal The Legend of Bagger Vance (2000) whose focus is both on Matt Damon and Wil Smith as the mysterious caddy and diminished somewhat by the inclusion of an extra character who uses a flashback technique and doesn't quite have that consistent cinematographic or as emotionally gripping a storyline. Other movies that might be comparable include Robert Redford's baseball movie The Natural (1984) and even that movie doesn't capture the focus and intensity and richness of its sport at The Greatest Game, or another baseball movie Brad Pitt's excellent Money Ball (2011) or the horse movie Seabiscuit (2003), the personal redemption tale of Mickey Rourke in The Wrestler (2008). In some interesting respects The Great Game is a more naturalized vision of reality in juxtaposition to the more glorified but just as compelling and appealing as Leonardo di Caprio's The Great Gatsby (2013) or stylized version of The Artist (2011).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest game of GOLF ever played.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When i first heard the title of this film, I thought it was about either: 1. Centre's Upset of Harvard in 1920. 2. The 1958 NFL Championship. 3. The last game of the 1960 World Series, 0r (a tie) Texas Vs. Arkansas, 1969 2.The sixth Game between Boston and Cincinnati in 1976 or 3. The "confrontation", Southern Cal versus UCLA, 1967. As You may have guessed, I prefer Football and baseball to golf. Having said that, and having seen this movie, I will say that this probably the best golf movie ever, and that the game it tells about WAS the greatest game of golf, ever. It was the greatest, not simply because an unknown 19 year old amateur, Francis Ouimet upset one of the greatest golfers who ever lived, Harry Vardon, (And another very fine golfer, Ted Ray as well), but because it marked a turning point in the history of golf in America, helping to make the game popular among all Americans. However, The greatest books about Sports- Beyond A Boundary, Friday Night Lights,, When The Colts Belonged to Baltimore, The Boys Of summer, and a few others, explore the social, ethical and spiritual context of sport, and so do the best movies about sports. This Is a great sports movie based on a great sports book, and it has both a socio - economic and an ethical subtext. The socio-economic context in the book and the film is CLASS , and class conflict.Golf began as a game for aristocrats. In the very first scene, aristocrats confiscate the young Harry Vardon's family farm to build a golf course. Twenty years later, the humbly born Vardon is the greatest golfer in the world. Vardon is a self-made gentleman who infuriates the British golf establishment by picking the uncouth Ted Ray as his co-representative for Great Britain at the !919US Golf Championship. Ouimet himself is an social outsider, a working-class youth who stuns the US golf establishment by his superb play, which culminates in a three way playoff who determine the championship. Ouimets eventual upset win created an international sensation, In addition, the book and the film have a moral context as well. They both celebrate the virtues of true sportsmanship; courage, loyalty, perseverance, and hard work. They also show that true aristocracy is a matter of merit, not birth. The humbly born Vardon and Ouimet- even the Falstaff-like Ted Ray, possess more truly aristocratic qualities than the aristocrats of the gold establishment.On top of all that, this is a well-acted, expertly directed, and superbly edited and shot film. In short, this is the best sports films, ever.</fullReview>

This is quite possibly the oldest story in the book, but Disney does it very well. I'm not at all entertained by the sport of golf, if 'sport' is what you want to call it; however, Shia LaBeouf actually gave an impressive performance considering his antics as Louis Stevens on The Disney Channel series Even Stevens. I hope to see more of him in the future with leading role.

My cousin was 20 years old when I first took him to visit a "driving range" the very first time out he hit the ball between 300-400 feet with accuracy, he could even hit the "ball retrieval cart" at will, but he was bored with golf. Man, just think what a financial blessing golf could have been for him with that kind of talent. No amount of prodding ever convinced him to stay with golf.

		<shortDescription>The match that changed the face of golf in America.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Historically, the invention of golf is credited to the Scots, and many consider St. Andrews, Scotland as the cradle of golf. In the late 1800s and the early 1900s, worldwide golf was dominated by the Brits and in America only a select few of the wealthy had the privilege to play the game. Young boys from working class families became caddies, the ones who carried the bags.This movie is based on a true story, and is taken from the book of the same name. It was 1913 and the Brit Harry Vardon was generally considered the best golfer of the era, sort of a modern day Tiger Woods. In addition, his legacy lives on even today as he is credited with the modern way of gripping the golf club and overall game. So, it was almost a formality that he would travel to the USA one more time and bring back the US Open trophy.Shia LaBeouf plays a young Francis Ouimet, working class boy, and former caddie at the country club across the street. That he even had the gall to try to play golf, a "gentleman's game" (meaning a wealthy game), was met with ridicule. But, as history witnesses, he not only played in the 1913 US Open, at the end he was tied with the great Harry Vardon and another Brit, Ted Ray.Ouimet's play in that 1913 Open is widely credited with changing the face of golf in America. No longer was it considered a game only for the rich. In the next 10 years the number of people playing golf tripled. So, more than anything, young 20-year-old Francis Ouimet became the catalyst for making golf a popular game.Overall this is a well-done movie, and worthwhile mainly for the story it tells, an important one in the history of golf.SPOILERS. In case anyone doesn't know, Ouimet, Vardon, and Ray had an 18-hole playoff, and Ouimet beat Vardon by one stroke to win the 1913 US Open against professionals. One of the greatest victories in all of sport history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Needed More Suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the true story of Francis Ouimet, who was not born on the right side of the tracks, but who had the talent to become the Tiger Woods of his day.If you are going to title your film The Greatest Game Ever Played you should put more suspense and tension into the last match, the one between Ouimet (LaBeouf)and Harry Vardon (Dillane). There was more tension and suspense between Outmet and his father (who didn't want him to waste his time on this game) than there was in that final match. Golfers who barely have heard the name Ouimet were, of course, sitting on the edge of their seats even though they thought they knew who would win anyway. Golfers do that. They sit up and take notice regardless. And, why is that? Because you have two of the best golfers of the day, for that day, competing and they are dead even for the most part and they are playing in the US Open. For Golfers it doesn't get much better than that.But, you see, not only do golfers go to the movies, but non-golfers as well go also and this is a much broader audience. And, the suspense just wasn't there for them. Add to this that Harry Vardon also was born on the wrong side of the tracks there was more than enough room for a lot of tension and suspense, but I didn't feel it. And, I play golf. One of the nicest things I learned was that Harry Vardon was always the perfect gentleman who had already won five British Opens. There should also have been more interplay between Ouimet and Vardon to create a friendly tension so to speak.OK, then how do you create that tension and suspense for that last match? We didn't have the TV analysts we have today, but the director could have showed us every shot on a certain hole that made a difference and he could have had the sports news-writers comment among themselves how things were going and well, doing a shot-by-shot analysis. But, show us the complete hole for the shots by each. OK, there was some of that, but nothing that brought any tension into play, and the shots were isolated ones. A player in a trap trying to get out, a player with a long putt. No tension here.I still liked this movie. Good thing this wasn't in 3-D. The way the balls were shot towards the audience I would have been in the back row in no time at all. Really good animation. I guess that's what it was, and those shots were terrific. I'm still ducking.Two things that I didn't understand. 1) What happened to the rich-girl who followed Ouimet around and 2) We weren't told what Ouimet accomplished afterward unless I missed it.Overall, great acting performance all around.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say that this is a truly excellent movie. It exceeds all of my expectations as a movie watcher, especially since this is a Disney movie! Shia LaBeouf really captured the character that is Francis Ouimet. He was able to play the part so well, he actually had me thinking that he was truly Ouimet.Not only was LaBeouf good in this, but his costar Josh Flitter (who played Eddie) was a brilliant young actor. He definitely added something to the movie. The comic relief that Flitter provided was essential to the movie's success.It is no surprise that this movie has made so much money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this show with a friend this afternoon, and while I do not play golf, I have become a fan with the advent of Tiger Woods. This boy, via Golf, has done more to earn respect for his race than any other human working the earth today. I thoroughly and completely enjoyed the show, loved all the characters, was completely taken by the young lady, but, the 1/2 pint caddy completely stole the show. We have been looking all over the web since returning home and cannot find his name and cannot even remember the character name he played. That comes with being 75 Yrs. old I guess. The boy who played Francis' part, should go far in the movie business, as he was great, as were all the characters in the cast. We did not know if Vardon was an A------ or not, but at the end, he showed he was really for the game and respected the boy for beating him. I cannot say enough about this show, and have to say, Disney Did it again. Many years ago I was a projectionist at several theaters in central PA, and have always been a movie buff. Problem is, there haven't been too many pictures lately aimed at us Old Fahts!!!!! (Thats Mainiac accent)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I took my two daughters, ages 13 and 8 to see this movie last Saturday, and we all really enjoyed it. We are not big sports fans, but the movie is quite universal in it's theme. In the tradition of Miracle and Rocky, what it's really about is being from the wrong side of the tracks, sticking to a goal, and following your dreams even when everybody says you're crazy. It's Disney. It's a feel-good movie, so if you don't want to feel good, skip it. I read another review where the writer stated to go see "The Constant Gardner" instead because it's much better. I can't wait to see "The Constant Gardner" because I heard it's incredible, but I'm not sure we can get more apples to oranges than in trying to compare these two films. If you don't feel like thinking too hard one afternoon, and are looking for a reason to smile, go see it. The best part for me was during a scene where Vardon's ball was stuck in a puddle, and one of the spectators loudly whispered something snide within his earshot. My younger daughter, who is about as non-violent as they come, whispered to me "He should hit him with that stick." Priceless :o)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Greatest Game Ever Played, a heartwarming and uplifting movie for the entire family, was obviously a labor of love for the director. As a non-golfer myself, I was totally enthralled with young Francis Ouimet, a caddy, playing against the best in the world in 1913. He was an immigrant's son and a real American hero who transformed golf from a sport for merely the wealthy. Shia Labeouf, who portrayed Francis, gave the part his all, and we cheered him on as he went up against the snobs at the country club. Labeouf managed to capture the essence of Francis Ouimet, and it was exciting to watch. Take your date, children, or grandchildren. They'll all love it!</fullReview>

Yes, I know it's a Disney film and it isn't directed by Christopher Nolan, but good Lord. This is straight-to-the-bargain-bucket nonsense. They should've had done with it and animated the bloody thing.And what's even worse is the fact that IMDb won't let me simply finish my rant there, because my review needs to be longer! The "Awesome" in-game camera shots are LITERALLY taken from Tiger Woods PGA Tour Golf on the Playstation, the story plods like a sulking school boy, the multi-stranded character and plot development cripples an already weak setup, and the grand finale is plain boring.Aside from that, it really was the greatest film I've ever seen in my entire life. Good, authentic-looking costumes, sets and sports equipment. There, I said it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you loved the movie 'Bobby Jones: Stroke of Genius', then you will really love this.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Greatest Game Ever Played' is the story about Francis Ouimet (Shia LaBeouf), one of America's most famous golfers. Ouimet played golf during a time when it was an exclusionary sport. Only the rich were allowed to play and England practically dominated the sport.Directed by Bill Paxton, this is a good story about an American underdog. When Ouimet won the US Open in 1913, he was the first amateur player to ever win and the second American to ever win. Despite the prejudices of the time, Ouimet goes on to accomplish the unthinkable and spearhead the way for American enthusiasm for golf.I really liked this movie. It is a true story about Francis Ouimet love for the game and how he triumphed despite the odds. If you loved the movie 'Bobby Jones: Stroke of Genius', then you will really love this. Shia LaBeouf (Holes and Constantine) does an excellent job as the young golfer. Elias Koteas (Fallen) is really good as Francis' Father Arthur Ouimet, even though you didn't see him very much. Lastly, check out Josh Flitter, who plays Ouimet's caddy (Eddie Lowery), he's great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For lovers of golf and/or underdog sports dramas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me go ahead and clear this up - no, The Greatest Game Ever Played is not about the time I led my softball team to victory by knocking in the winning run with a triple. Instead, it's about golf. More specifically, it's based on the book that's based on the true story of Frances Ouimet.The story is so simple that even a Tennessee Vols fan can follow it - boy loves golf, boy becomes caddy, boy begins to play golf, dad isn't happy because he thinks it's a waste of time, boy miraculously overcomes insanely enormous odds, movie gives audience a bunch of warm and fuzzy feelings, the end. I'll leave it to you to guess the outcome and whether the boy's father eventually accepts his son following his dream.This is one of those movies that will absolutely thrill its target audience. If you love golf or Disney-produced underdog movies then you'll enjoy this one. For me, it's one of those movies that's good for one viewing. I enjoyed it, but it was a little slow-paced at times, and since I already knew the outcome of the match I wasn't completely enthralled with the tension that Bill Paxton tries to derive by following a golf ball on its arduous journey to the hole. However, others in the audience would clap wildly at every long putt that was sunk.I have to point out that I didn't find the fat little 10-year-old caddy as cute as most everybody else in the audience. He had some funny moments, but his little one-liners grated my nerves: "easy peasey, lemon squeezey;" "okey dokey, pipe n' smokey;" "read it, roll it, and hole it." Sure, the audience guffawed with overdone laughter, but it just seemed to me that this was an attempt to create some new catchphrases for people all over the world to start using on golf courses. I pray that doesn't happen. Allow me to introduce my own catchphrase to whoever thought these annoying lines were cute enough to put into the movie: shovey wovey up your butty.Hey, I never said I'm all that mature.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its just a great story... cliché or not.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is this movie perfect? Certainly not. Is it cliché? Yes. As you might read in other reviews or comments, the story is "typical" of the average sports movie.The problem is... its true! So, when you have a historically accurate (more on that topic in a moment) movie with a happy ending, are you automatically doomed to mediocrity? I don't think so.As a huge fan of the book, I was very concerned that the great story would be butchered in favor of a dumbed-down movie. And, my first impression of the movie (from the trailer) was exactly that. They added a silly love interest to the movie that didn't exist historically. There was some unfortunate dialog that didn't quite fit with the feel of the story from a historical point of view. And, Eddie didn't exactly look the way he does in some of the original photos.But, with that said. It is still a good movie because it is an undeniably good story. Do the good guys win? Yes. But, in real life they actually did win. So, its hardly reasonable to expect them to change history in order to provide a different flavor of drama.As a golfer I liked this movie for several reasons. First, it accurately represents a great story in my favorite sport. Second, the story is set in a time that many golfers view with some degree of reverence. Hickory shafts, brassies, niblicks, and golfers who still played in the rain. Finally, I liked it because it is one of the few golf movies I have seen where the "swings" do not appear to be obviously faked. The actors swing as though they know how to play the game. And, for me, that goes a long way to enhancing the drama of the film.Now, a note on historical accuracy. As with most movies that originated as a great book, it falls short. That doesn't make it a bad movie, it just means you have to know what to expect. Francis, Harry, Ted, and Eddie all survived the translation from book to movie with little defacing. However, many of the 'other' characters and stories that were important to the book didn't survive. This is to be expected, or they would have had to make the movie 9 hours long.For those of you who know the story, but haven't read the book. This is a non-fiction story, of sorts. The only problem is that when Frost wrote the book he didn't always take the time to credit his source when he was attributing thoughts, feelings, or dialog to the characters. So, it is occasionally difficult to tell the difference between dialog that is true to history, and that which Mark Frost applied in the interests of dramatic license.As stated above, the movie survives all of these problems in a way that I didn't expect. The movie stayed true to the large themes and main characters of the book. The movie survives the translation because it is true to the original theme. Perseverance.I am not a professional movie reviewer (or writer for that matter), so I won't bother getting in to my opinion about how the movie was made. I am sure someone else will comment on the relative cinematic value of the movie. Unfortunately, many of the supposed movie experts are not going to know the story, know the book, or know the sport of golf. So, it is unlikely that they will be able to accurately represent the way the movie will be perceived by golfers. Hopefully I have commented in a way that is useful to golfers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What made the film "The Greatest Game Ever Played" one of the best adaptations of an actual event I have seen on screen was its ability to make the characters so rich and believable. I was very pleasantly surprised by the care and detail this story was given. We are all familiar with the principal actors, yet they were able to bring Frances Ouimet and Harry Vardon to life for us in a legitimate way.The story highlights not only the history of the event, but shows us the history of ethnic classism in golf and in Western history in general. Everyone can identify with the various characters because we know them, or because we are them.The costuming was some of the most accurate period dress I have seen in a recent film; very impressive. The casting is perfection. Bill Paxton has done a stellar job.For golf fans, the sticks used are period, and the swings imitated are authentic. That is really impressive when you consider that Shia LeBoeuf did not play golf before working on this film, unlike Will Smith in "The Legend of Bagger Vance" who played 100 holes a week. Working with period equipment is hard on the seasoned golfer; for a young man who has not played, his accomplishment in perfecting Ouimet's swing and his character are astonishing. He is making a fine transition into adulthood in this role and is to be commended for his performance.</fullReview>

The film is about golf (to the same extent that Million Dollar Baby is about boxing), about class vs. merit, about fathers and sons, about passion, and about the ability to focus.The script is fine, if a bit obvious, but the actors sold their lines with their body language, their eyes, and their faces. A great job by director Bill Paxton in what I think is only his second film. They'll be a lot more.This one should go down as a great sports film, along with Hoosiers, Friday Night Lights, and Miracle.</fullReview>

Less about golf than about fevered camera shenanigans. A formulaic plunk into the water. How the hero gets the girl is never explained nor explored, it is simply there as an obligatory plot element. Likewise the relationship with the father (and mother)--never explored in any meaningful way. The one tiny interaction between father and mother is goofy and like so much in the film, pretends to explore but substitutes glibness for dialog. Ditto the Harry Vardon character--glimpses of a conflict that is never more than a vague attempt at exploring class distinctions, so crudely handled that it's like a caricature of a caricature.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the better American films to be released in 2005</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate sports movies, but I found this one exceptionally well done. Kudos to Bill Paxton on his sophomore effort and his second good film, after the flawed but unforgettable Frailty. The Greatest Game Ever Played doesn't offer any surprises plotwise, but the level of acting and the depth that Paxton finds in the material certainly is surprising. Shia LaBeouf plays a working-class young man who is great at golf, and ends up playing against, and doing well against pros in the US Open. The film uses the class issues that come with the game of golf to add a lot of nuance. Paxton's direction and the editing during the Open (which lasts most of the movie) are excellent, and it is certainly one of the most gripping sports movies I've ever seen. LaBeouf is exceptional, as are many of the supporting performances. The performance that's getting all the press for the film is from Josh Flitter, a 10 year-old who plays LaBeouf's caddy. Yeah, he's cute and funny, and the energy he adds is probably needed for a lot of the audience. But, to me, he seemed pretty obviously there just to be cute, and just to keep a segment of the audience from getting bored. If not for the utterly cliché and pointless my-father-doesn't-approve-of-me subplot, this film would be one of the best of the year. As it is, if it had had a little more press, it would have been a sure-shot for the Seabiscuit slot in the Best Picture category.</fullReview>

Even though his role isn't very big, Max Kasch still steals the show with his stunning good looks and helpfulness towards his sister. I feel that this may be one of those Leonardo DiCaprio- Tobey Maguire relationships where they meet and are best friends from day one and later star in movies together one always getting the "big role" but one day the other stars finds his big breakthrough movie. Since the movie "Holes" I've believed that Max Kasch and Khleo Thomas would continue acting. For the most part I was right. You HAVE to see "The Greatest Game Ever Played"!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to this movie with great expectations. That's never a good ides and was especially so in this disappointing film. First of all the only spoiler I can tell you is that there are no spoilers! If you have seen the trailers and know the true story, then that's it.The golfing scenes take up way to much time and are a very poor knock of the scenes from Legend of Bagger Vance, my gold standard for sports movies in general and golf movies specifically. Photograohy is mediocre, the story line is very weak, trite and not well developed and the acting very average or worse.With no star power I expected a great story line and directing. Unfortunately the acting, if you can call it that, was akin to a bunch of extras and C-level actors struggling for something that was simply not there. Too bad Bill Paxton did not appear in the movie instead of his son. Bill should give up directing and stick to acting! The sparse "love story" is given very little development and absolutely NO denouement. The "what happened to statements" printed at the end provide incomplete closure at best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The director to me did a lousy job with special effects that did nothing to display the talents of those great golfers. Dumb ladybug scene. Camera attached to golf ball. There seemed to be a lot of scenes that did not add anything to the story and wasted time that could have been devoted to more historically accurate events. I guess as a golfer I wanted to see more of the game and equipment and realism, which to me would have been more interesting than the opera scene for instance.Since I was a little bored with the movie I started looking for things that may not be accurate. Someone please tell me I did see a cell phone tower in the background poking above the tree line of last scene as Francis walked toward the horizon. I agree with comment on President Taft being called President (although if they said "the" president, then it is another goofup) even though Taft was not in office at that time after President Wilson had taken over. I do not think they would have played in pools of water on the course either. The locker room scene showed phillips head screws (+) in the hinges of the locker door. That head design was not invented until the early 1930s by Mr. Phillips. Did they really have leaderboards back then? My wife turned to me in the movie and said did you hear someone in the movie yell "your'e the man"? I did not, but wondered if anyone else did. If the director could not edit out the cell tower it would not surprise me if he left in the comment of an extra who wanted golfing idiocy/immortality. The course appeared to rather well manicured and too green for a course of that era also. Mr. Vardon showed Francis how to hold the club but no mention of the interlocking fingers they kept showing in the movie not any mention of his earlier stage meeting.I guess my engineering background took over on this one but it was fun trying to find goofups. Anyone else see some also?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. When Hollywood goes after a true story, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. With "Titanic" and "Apollo 13", there is no mystery to the viewer on how the story ends. What keeps us interested (or not) is the how-it-happened, or behind-the-scenes details.The 1913 U.S. Open is one of the most fascinating golf and sports stories of all time. But we know how it ends before we walk into the theatre. Where director Bill Paxton (yes, the "Twister" actor) fails us is with the behind-the-scenes stories. He touches on the class warfare of the time and the family and personal demons that haunt both 20 year old Francis Ouimet (played right down the middle by Shia LaBeouf) and the great Harry Vardon (Stephen Dillone captures the quiet dignity of the champ). There is just very little depth or meat to the non-golf stories of the men. Toss in a pure Disney character in Ouimet's caddie, Eddie (played for all its worth by the interesting looking and full of rhymes Josh Flitter), and you have a mediocre, pleasant film that is going to please most audiences, but will be forgotten the next day.Just for fun, it should be noted that Bill Paxton's real life son plays young Harry Vardon at the beginning of the film and an almost unrecognizable Elias Kotsas plays Francis' father. Having not read Mark Frost's book, I am unable to comment on whether the source material provided more substance than the film delivers. I just know that the film is a quick high and very little else.</fullReview>

From the way the movie establishes the underdog; the usual impossible conditions; the pretty and inspirational girl to the fairy-tale ending, this one was classic Hollywood. I know that the underlying story is true, but this offers very little to draw the viewer into the characters other than the stereotypical formula seen dozens if not hundreds of times before.The movie does have it's moments, though not many and too far apart. The character "Eddie" was very well done and served as a nice foil to the overly dramatic Francis Ouimet and Harry Vardon.

		<fullReview>How about, "The Worst, Most Clichéd, Sports Movie Title Ever?" What a lame name for a movie ? The Greatest Game Ever Played. Every sports movie thinks that it's about the greatest game ever played. So a 20-year-old boy named Frances Ouimet (played by Constantine's Shai LaBeouf) won the 1913 U.S. Open? big deal. It may have been one heck of a round of golf, but it was by no means the "Greatest" game ever played. Personally, I think the 2002 World Cup match between England and Argentina was the greatest game ever played, but I still wouldn't make a movie about it and have the arrogance to called it The Greatest Game Ever Played. The actual movie isn't bad, but it's not as monumental as the title leads you to believe. I honestly couldn't tell you the difference between this movie and 2004's Bobby Jones: Stroke of Genius. They're both about golfers who lived a hundred years ago and piqued professionally in their twenties. Neither film is particularly memorable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>eh... shia, great (as usual) director, crazy, movie, not worth the money</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>if you're a golf love then maybe you'd like this, but the movie is nothing like the rookie, remember the titans, or anything like that. The director put crazy visual affects at the stupidest times. Shia was good but you didn't see him act too much. The movie was disorganized and needed a crap load more editing. I was incredibly disappointed, i thought Shia plus an inspirational Disney movie would rule... I was wrong. It did have potential, but the director ruined it completely... The first thing i thought when i left the theater was... i spent 6.50 to see that? It wasn't pretty. I don't even know if all golfers will like it. I feel bad for Shia. He's a great actor and doesn't need crap like this ruining his rep.If you like golf a lot, then you should see this, if you don't like golf then don't (even if you like Shia a lot)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great golf &amp; special fx = good sports drama, poignant family story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the folks who brought us 'The Rookie', 'Remember the Titans' as well as lesser known 'Miracle' comes a true story about golf.he scene is set at the end of the 19th Century, a time of change, then fills in social, historical and personal context over two dozen years that builds to perfection to the 1913 US Open championship, which sorts through a tough field to a playoff between the worlds best and an unknown local talent diverted from his eventual career in business.Pitted against each other the two share some backstory. Each has inner demons to contend with: The reigning champion, Britain's Harry Vardon (Stephen Dillane) who still is considered among the best ever but cannot secure membership in England's clubs. The young amateur, Francis Ouimet (Shia LaBeouf), from across the street and a working-class, immigrant family.Director Bill Paxton succeeds in a number of ways to blend and balance. One is the way he presents the parents with understanding. Mother (Marnie McPhail) and father, Elias Koteas in a finely tuned performance by the only known name in a capable ensemble, grapple with refreshing compassion. Modern sensibilities often get in the way of historical accuracies; not so here.With shades of international intrigue, Greatest Game is rooted in the struggles of common people to rise above station and means. Young Ouimet (Matthew Knight) grows to love the sport as he chips into the household coffers from his experience as caddy to the members of the country club across the street.Heckled as 'caddy boy' by his more privileged classmates, he wins the state high school championship. Ouimet is then recruited to seek the US Open to the chagrin of his father who knows more in his eyes than he speaks. His mother takes him shopping on the day Vardon is holding an exhibition and the later drama is foretold in a brief lesson from the compassionate champion that wounds the boy in a way that will arm him with an inner courage that he will need.In a rare accomplishment, the inner game of golf is captured effectively while adding to the storyline rather than detract. Expect to hear bits of golfing ideologue from the movie in your next foursome.The production values are excellent and somehow the choice use of outstanding special effects doesn't get in the way. Have you ever followed the arc of a driven golf ball into the sky wondering about its perspective? Well, now you can know. It's every bit as fun as you can imagine.Greatest Game is a great golf story, getting the game right, but also works on multiple levels. (Perhaps the reason an informal exit poll of couples from the sneak preview revealed unanimous satisfaction.) The look into Vardon as preeminent British golfer who can't even get into the country clubs on which he plays due to longstanding class prejudices, offset by the Brookline amateur upstart who can't get the game out of his system, has all the right supporting pieces that includes a capable cast, rich cinematography that evokes the personal as well as the historical period. With a healthy sense of humour, romance and a human drama of pursuing sporting dreams with the days' stark realities placed in sharp but rich bas relief, 'Greatest Game' scores well as a date movie.The only weaknesses are small deficiencies in the script and a false note in the first steps of romance. Nothing that gets in the way of the good time.'The Greatest Game Ever Played' opens September 30th.-/-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Shakespeare play . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If not the greatest game ever played, certainly the 1913 US Open, where 20-year-old amateur Francis Ouimet (Shia LaBeouf) defeated reigning champion Harry Vardon (Stephen Dillane), would have to rank in the top five. Rare it is for any amateur to win a professional tournament; for an American to take it from the defending Brit champion and another top Brit was unthinkable at the turn of the last century.Director Bill Paxton has learned a thing or two from sentimentalist Gary Ross, whose Seabiscuit (2003) is for me the most recent touchstone for all underdog, American-overcoming-odds films. Paxton doesn't miss a chance to show how difficult breaking social barriers was in both Britain and America in 1913. Only by socially powerful interventions can Ouimet play the courses on which he caddies, much less compete as a poor man and amateur in tournaments such as the US Open. But the music and sympathetic close-ups assure us that he will make it as a golfer if not as a socially equal club member.Even more sentimental is Ouimet's difficulty in dating the daughter of a prominent family and convincing his laborer father that golf is a worthy endeavor. Paxton plays all the elements too heavily at the risk of courting cliché and losing "true story" status. Yet the pint-sized caddy Eddie Lowery (Josh Flitter) with the quick aphorisms about playing and winning is an effective way of delivering humor and humanity without the sentimentality.Paxton's best effort is using special effects to help us feel the challenges of the game. Often we follow the ball as if we were riding it, careering behind it, or seeing its point of view. Sometimes a graceful swing sends the ball into the audience (Is Paxton thinking 3-D?). A few times British champion Harry Vardon surveys the crowds before his swing and thereby effaces them to gain a singularly pure view of his shot. Wimbledon (2004) also used similar effects plus voice-over of the athlete's thoughts, but that was a far less effective film.Unfortunately Paxton also has Harry seeing for too many times four dark-clad elders who had moved his family from Jersey to build a golf course. Just as annoying is cutting to Ouimet's disgruntled father as a distraction.The Greatest Game Ever Played tries, and often succeeds, in fulfilling Harold Segall's romantic description of the game: "Golf is not just exercise; it is an adventure, a romance . . . a Shakespeare play in which disaster and comedy are intertwined (and) you have to live with the consequences of each action."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I saw the boom</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am ashamed of Mr. Bill Paxton, as an actor struggling to work in this business, which I love dearly. Mr. Paxton has made my and a lot of other aspiring arts efforts a joke. Not only did he totally wreck would could have been a wonderful story, he insulted the intelligence of everyone that paid for ticket. Mr. Paxton I have watched you as an actor and had respect for you, but not as a director. Please stick to acting.My girlfriend wanted to add that she had to leave in the middle of the movie because, seeing the boom over eight times kind of took her out of the story.sorry about saying these things, but they had to be said.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst movie, ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So overrated, Bill Paxton, this is NOTHING like FRAILTY, which I found a great film, but like I said, this film is way too overrated. I saw this movie in theatres and nearly fell asleep, I found out how horrible it was when I saw how long and boring it was. First of all, Mr. LABOFF never really becomes a golf player anyway, he just becomes a Business man. Disney, stop making awful films like this. And stop making crap that's BASED ONA TRUE STORY because with the exception of MONSTER, true stories are never really good films, they're pretty much dull and it takes out the creativity of a writer's talent. Give up, Disney, give up...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, well, Paxton is saying to himself, I can try to go whole hog and make a really terrific movie about golf, keeping a true grip on it, or shamelessly exploit the kiddies, the many many little tykes that the big people will take to see this baby. And, hell, they are easy to fool. So, is there really any choice. Nope. Okay kids, you got it. Even though you don't understand the word, laddies, this is gonna be a really meretricious piece of hokum that will fool you all the way. It is too. But a warning should be issued for anybody over 15 and or 5 feet tall: don't believe a single instant of this tale supposedly torn from life. It is as rife with anachronism as a summer porch in the Midwest is with flies, and reflects what actually went on at that famous Open just about like a funhouse mirror on wheels. If you want a really good feel good sports movie, catch Seabiscut again. Much much better hokum. Meanwhile, there still has not been a really accurate golf movie ever made, unless msynr in some parallel universe. This one only does have the feel of something being played with a little white ball over lotsa grass on LSD. But the kids will love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That Kid is bothersome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The main character is the punk from I Robot and the Project Green Light movie that did not even make the theaters (Thats what you get when you team up with Matt Damon and Beniffer) I love golf and the story is great as everyone knows. Why would Paxton cast this kid, he is the same category as Froto and Rudy. Disney loves him from Holes and now he type casted himself as a young lovable kid. I enjoyed the movie, but it could have been better. If you enjoy the Disney corporate spin on movies then you will love this. I enjoyed the Transporter2 and The Constant Gardener much more. This is a good movie to take your children, do not waste your money if your older than 8.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great for artistic value, but average everywhere else.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I caught a sneak preview of this the other night. I was looking forward to this for the specific reason to see if Bill Paxton has what it takes to make the transition from actor to director.After not thinking too much of Frailty, I left the theater after seeing this one with the feeling of seeing yet another movie of "cookie-cutter" value. The only thing that REALLY impressed me about this film was Paxton's use of a "vintage" color palette. So I give kudos there, but really nowhere else.I couldn't help but feel that Paxton may have been stifled by the ears of the Mouse, but in remembering Frailty, I can clearly say that Paxton is just "another" average director.The movie itself is your typical "I've seen this this scenario a million times before" true story. It's true weakness is that there is neither highs or lows in the story, it just trudges along at an even keel. The acting is standard (although Elias Koteas' accent slightly bothered me), the plot was uninspiring ...if only for the fact that Paxton failed to inject any caring or emotional impact into the material, relying instead on gimmicky special effects shots to try to make the film interesting.If you're looking for an emotionally gripping film with heart, this one is not it. If you've seen every other "based on a true story" Disney film, then you've seen this one all to many times before.I gave this a 5 just because it was not bad in the sense that it is unwatchable, I just thought it was "typical". And while Paxton is a capable director, he shows no signs of "shining through" the endless sea of average directors (especially actors TURNED directors). I give him merit for the look of the film, but he REALLY needs to work on the emotional aspect of his films if he is going to get anyone to really care about them.</fullReview>
