		<shortDescription>Perfect, Hysterical Madcap Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>C.R. MacNamara (James Cagney), a soft drink executive stationed in West Berlin with his wife (Arlene Francis) and two kids, is given the task of looking after his boss' wild daughter, Scarlett (Pamela Tiffin), who flies in for a visit. But when Scarlett runs off and marries a young Communist named Otto (Horst Buchholz)---and with MacNamara's boss flying in to West Berlin in a matter of hours---MacNamara has to race against the clock to turn Scarlett's rebellious new husband into the perfect son-in-law, or risk losing his job....Billy Wilder's "One Two Three" is one of the greatest comedy films ever made. This wonderfully zany 1961 gem is a lightning-paced, hysterical farce (and with it's classic instrumental theme of "The Sabre Dance," you know you're in for a rollicking, rapid-fire comedy). Based on a French play, much of the movie plays out like a stage comedy, as Wilder simply turns his camera on the actors and lets them do their thing. The entire cast is simply superb, their comic timing perfect. James Cagney gives one of his all-time greatest performances as C.R. MacNamara. In almost every scene, with the bulk of the script on his shoulders, Cagney is sharp, quick on the draw, and just plain hilarious as the bewildered executive. Arlene Francis lends fine comic support as Cagney's sarcastic wife, Horst Buchholz is very funny &amp; perfectly cast as the rebellious Otto, and the gorgeous Pamela Tiffin is simply a riot as the hot-blodded, dim-witted Scarlett. But ALL the actors in this movie are funny &amp; terrific. Billy Wilder's direction is marvelous, and his script co-written with I.A.L. Diamond is clever and hilarious.Some may find the quick pace of "One Two Three" a little exhausting, as the movie's energy level remains high from beginning to end, rarely stopping for air, but it works for me. This movie is pure farce, plain and simple. It makes no apologies for what it is, and it's goal is to make you laugh loudly. "One Two Three" is one of the most hysterical movies I've ever seen in my life, and it never fails to give me bellylaughs. Thank you Billy, Jimmy, and all the rest for this magnificent comedy gem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Howard Hawks usually gets the palm for the fastest dialogue in comedies but Wilder probably ties him here. This must be one of the funniest comedies to come out of Hollywood, at least during the sound era. The gags come fast -- and thick. If one doesn't work you don't have time to be disappointed because the next one is already underway.It's one of those movies in which the gags would be spoiled if they were described to a person who hadn't yet seen the film. For the most part they are tied closely to the plot and often build on one another. But I'm compelled to give one example. Cagney is an executive in Berlin and his first-hand man is Schlemmer. Schlemmer has a habit of clicking his heels before and after addressing Cagney. At one point Cagney chews him out and asks him, "just between us," what Schlemmer did in the war. "I was in the underground," says Schlemmer. "Oh, the resistance?" "No, the underground. The subway. I was a conductor." Cagney says supiciously, "And I suppose you never were a supporter of Adolf." Schlemmer: "Adolf who? You see, I was always in the underground. They never told us anything down there."The dialogue is shouted rather than spoken. Heels are clicked, people leap to attention, fingers are snapped, orders are flung about. The only person who doesn't run around frantically is Lilo Pulver who does not have to run to attract anyone's attention. She can simply stand still and get the job done. She's Cagney's secretary and tells him she's thinking of getting a job elsewhere as a translator. "Don't forget I am bilingual." "Don't I know it," Cagney mutters ruefully.But I won't go on because I'll just wind up giving away more gags. Check the trivia entries too. This was Cagney's last major role and one of Wilder's best comedies. It's simply hilarious and not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Billy Wilder Gets Hot Over the Cold War</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One, Two, Three is from the fertile mind of Billy Wilder where Cold War politics gets reduced to the absurd. This film is so fast and so funny it's only a few steps from Monty Python.For what was and what should have remained his swan song to the world of film James Cagney heads the cast in this. He's the man in charge of Coca-Cola's operations in Germany which is headquartered in West Berlin and he's had a lovely little present dumped in his lap. The daughter of the CEO of Coca-Cola is in Europe and now she's in Germany and he's expected to watch out for her. The daughter is played by Pamela Tiffin and she is one of the biggest airheads ever portrayed on the screen. She's fallen big time for a German kid played by Horst Bucholtz. They've gotten married.Bucholtz is a kid who's real good at spouting all kinds of left wing slogans without delving to deeply into their meanings. He's a Communist and that drives Cagney nuts and if it drives Cagney nuts, Tiffin's father is sure to go over the top. Cagney takes it upon himself to get Bucholtz arrested on the East Berlin side as an American spy.Of course a small memento of their married life has developed inside Tiffin so now Cagney has a real problem. He's got to get Bucholtz back and turn him into a money grubbing capitalist in his image. The frantic pace at which this is attempted, racing against the clock when Tiffin's father played by Howard St. John arrives in Berlin is what the rest of the film is about.Wilder has a ball reducing the Cold War to its basic absurdities. The USA is symbolized by James Cagney who thinks the whole world will become America if only enough Coca-Cola is peddled. Cagney comes real close to proving it so.The Communists come out far worse. Karl Marx's world always looked nice on paper, but always has had a real problem being converted into a functioning state. The Russians are also good at spouting the party line, but in One, Two, Three, Wilder shows how very easily they can be influenced by some of life's most elemental things and I don't mean Coca-Cola.Cagney did not always get along with Wilder, but both men were professional enough to bury certain creative differences. Cagney was kind and patient with Tiffin who was getting her first real break in film. However he grew to positively loath Horst Bucholtz. In his memoirs which came out in the 1970s, Bucholtz was the only colleague who Cagney had anything really critical to say about.During the middle of the film being shot, the Russians stopped the flow of traffic from West and East Berlin. Some shots had to be redone around the Brandenburg Gate, a whole set had to be constructed. I suppose a well trained cinema professional could spot the shots where the real and the fake Brandeburg were used. I sure can't. The following year, the Berlin Wall was built, so Wilder got his film done just in time.Arlene Francis plays Cagney's exasperated wife and she of What's My Line does just fine. Cagney made an appearance on that show just before shooting started and gave the picture a big old plug.The laughs come pretty fast and furious as James Cagney struggles mightily to prevent the arrival of "another bouncing, baby, Bolshevik."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exceptional Cold War Spoof</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billy Wilder's hilarious Cold War comedy that only gets better with each viewing. It does help some, of course, to know the politics of the region and of that time period. Irregardless, one need not be a Hoover Institute Fellow to pick these up quickly. James Cagney, proving his acting range was virtually borderless, turns in a superb performance as the soft drink exec seeking an upper echelon corporate job. With a terrific supporting cast, Cagney's corporate dreams are about to explode, when the boss' wild daughter flies into Berlin. Creating havoc, and not to mention more stress on his wounded marriage, the daughter runs off cavorting about in the Eastern Sector. Corporate ambitions, romance and strong politics collide in this volatile, hilarious, extremely fast paced comedy. This is how a real comedic farce is put together, and it goes off without a hitch, all the way to the last gag. There's also some great homages/inside jokes to boot. A comedy classic, and another gem from Mr. Wilder.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cagney in one of his best roles.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"One, Two, Three" is a marvelously, funny film. It has an energy that you can't help but get caught up in.From the time you hear the first few bars of "The Sabre Dance" thru the final shot of James Cagney, you are on a constant roller coaster, and you don't want to get off. It is a manic, wild movie that never disappoints or lets down.The engine that drives this lunacy is James Cagney. In one of his best, funniest and energetic performances, he is nothing short of amazing. He is a whirling dervish, at the heart of a storm that he has no control over. I don't want to give any of the story away, suffice to say that he is nothing short of spectacular. In Cameron Crowe's book on Billy Wilder, Wilder laments that Cagney was so loud and energetic at the start of the film, that his character really has nowhere to go, in terms of building, and reacting to the chaos. I would agree with that assessment, but Cagney's performance does not let the audience stop and catch it's breath long enough for this to really be a factor.Wilder and Diamond have brought us another gem. Is there another writing team that within a span of three years, have created three better pictures than the ones they have given us (Some Like It Hot, The Apartment, One,Two,Three)? I doubt it.Kudos all around to the supporting cast as well. Especially, Arlene Francis, as Cagney's wife, and Lilo Pulver as his secretary. Also watch for some "inside" jokes. Like when Cagney threatens Horst Buchholz with a grapefruit, and Red Buttons, in a cameo, doing a Cagney imitation.Great fun from start to finish. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"One, Two, Three," is a fast paced, cleverly scripted comedy, with an absolutely stellar performance from James Cagney. Billy Wilder's direction is vigorous and tight-knit, with a tempo that doesn't let up, yet doesn't tire either. One good line after the next, in an original comedy with loads of laughs. But it's Cagney's show, and does he give it his all! This is a wonderful tribute to one of the screen's all-time great actors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of The Ten Best Comedy Films Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're planning on screening "One, Two,Three" for the first time and you weren't alive in 1961, take a moment to acquaint yourself with the political climate of the time....then get ready to laugh A LOT ! I was 17 when "One, Two, Three" came out and all these years later I am still amazed at the majesty of this film. As most of you know, this was to be James Cagney's last picture, and it took a lot of convincing by Billy Wilder to get him to do it. Cagney did come back one more time for "Ragtime", but that doesn't lessen the greatness of this, his final starring role. I saw a comment posted about the film having the perfect cast and I agree, but it's not surprising when you consider this: name me a Billy Wilder film that didn't have the perfect cast ! William Holden and Gloria Swanson in "Sunset Blvd", Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine in "The Apartment", Jack Lemmon, Tony Curtis and Marilyn Monroe in "Some Like It Hot", Jack Lemmon and..well, you get the picture: Billy Wilder knew precisely who he wanted for every part and usually got them, and if he had to go with choice # 2, then choice # 2 was one lucky actor. And each supporting role, no matter how small, got the same Wilder treatment. I know because my dad was the TV Movie Host in "The Apartment". Actors knew that being in a Billy Wilder film meant the script would be first rate and the director would get a first rate performance out of them, even if it took all night. Pamela Tiffin was just terrific in this film, but sadly she never got another role worthy of her ability. The same goes for Horst Buchholz, "The Magnificent Seven" not withstanding. At least they got to do "One, Two, Three" and that might have just been enough. Right up there in the same league with "The Philadelphia Story", "Annie Hall" and the original version of "To Be Or Not To Be" starring Jack Benny and Carole Lombard, Billy Wilder's "One, Two, Three" is a forever film classic for all the reasons I and others have mentioned, and for one more which it shares with every great film: "One, Two, Three" assumes you have a brain and treats you accordingly.

		<shortDescription>Quick, well acted, and funny as hell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mention James Cagney's name, and most people will mention one of his gangster films like G-Men or The Public Enemy or at a push will mention one of his just as memorable Song &amp; Dance roles like Footlight Parade or Yankee Doodle Dandy. While it is true he could be both Tough and Elegant, largely forgotten was Cagney's wonderful ability to play comedic Characters. (Who can forget his film stealing role as the tyrannical Captain in Mister Roberts).One such film that highlights his comedy talent, was Billy Wilder's One, Two, Three. Made in 1961, it shows us a 62 year old Cagney still at the top of his game 30 years after he became a star.Set in a post war yet pre détente Germany, the film is a fast, frantic, romantic, hilarious farce set against the non too funny backdrop of the Cold War which to be honest was far from 'cold' when the movie was made with the Cuban Missile Crisis just months away and American tolerance of the 'red menace' at an all time low.Cagney plays MacNamara, a tough-talking Middle Management executive for Coca-Cola trying to secure the Coca-Cola rights on the eastern side of the Iron Curtain. He Hates Communists, Hates Fascists, and loves his work. He is short tempered, sharp tongued and quick witted. He has two women in his life his wife Phyiliss, played fantastically by the always fantastic Arlene Francis, and his yummy blonde and easily corruptible secretary Ingeborg (Lilo Pulver). His organised yet double life is thrown into turmoil when his bosses 17 year old yet wild insatiable daughter Scarlett (Pamela Tiffin) arrives with the bosses strict instructions to 'look after her'. Instead of staying for the intended two weeks she stays for two months and appears to have successfully curtailed her wayward lifestyle, until one night she fails to return to the MacNamara home, frantic with worry for her safety (and the safety of his Job), MacNamara is calling everybody and his dog in West Berlin that may have a clue to her whereabouts. His Driver finally admits that since her arrival in Germany she's been crossing the Brandenburg Gate into East Germany every night has been courting and now married to a fully fledged card carrying communist called Otto (Horst Buchholz). Knowing that this will be the final nail in his coca-cola coffin if his boss ever finds out, MacNamara proceeds to concoct a plan to erase the marriage from the books and have Otto incarcerated in the East by having him arrested for being an American Spy. MacNamara pleased with his handy work returns home to find out that Scarlett is in a 'family way' with Otto's baby, now he must get Otto Back from the clutches of the East German forces, and pass him of as a blue-blooded, non commie capitalist entrepreneur.The friction between Cagney and Buchholz on camera is brilliant yet the two actors constantly fought off set with Cagney labelling Buchholz as the most un-cooperative active he had ever worked with with Cagney even threatening to 'put him, (Buchholz) on his ass' which made the interplay between their respective characters all the more realistic as two people that detest the sight of each other.Red Buttons makes an early movie appearance as an American MP and steals his scene by doing an impersonation of Cagney circa 1931 right in the face of Cagney circa 1961, which even though his back is to camera you can tell Cagney is cracking up though forever the professional, he gathers his composure well enough to complete the scene. There is also a blink-and-you'll-miss it in-joke where Cagney threatens to hurl a half grapefruit in Buchholz face in homage to the memorable scene he did 30 years before with Mae Clarke in The Public Enemy Another classic line is when Cagney utters rival screen gangster Edward G Robinson's immortal final line from Little Ceaser 'Mother of Mercy is this the end of Rico'.From the opening titles the pace of this movie is set with the fast paced sabre-dance theme. Cagney refuses to let the film slow down either from the moment he first appears on screen he shows more vitality and energy than the rest of the cast combined and still moves with the agility of someone half his age.I love this movie and is a perfect example of a sixties screwball sex-farce. typical Wilder, but a role a little different than Cagney was used to playing, but he rose to the challenge perfectly. It was to be another 20 years before Cagney made another Movie, but hell, he needed a long rest after giving it his all in this one.Jack Lemmon once said that the film would have been much better had a more comedic actor been cast as Otto, I personally would have loved Lemmon himself in the role, but in 1960's Hollywood, any actor willing to play an anti-American communist was committing occupational suicide such was the paranoia surrounding Communism.This movie can never be remade as it is too racially and politically intolerant for today's politically correct audiences to digest with comfort, which doesn't really upset me as the performances is this movie could never be bettered</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although "One, Two, Three" was made at a tense and crucial point in the Cold War standoff, it is bitingly funny and has aged well. As previous reviewers have noted, the performances are top notch, particularly those delivered by Cagney, Bucholz and Arlene Francis. The satire is thick in every scene, with particularly sharp barbs aimed at the behavior and attitudes of post-war Germans. The parodies of and references to Cagney's earlier films are also very funny. Cagney's makeover of the committed young Communist is outrageous.A definite "10"...Wilder during his career peak, and Cagney delivering a fitting career finale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Delightful and Witty Comedy of Billy Wilder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In West Berlin, the ambitious executive of Coca-Cola C.R. MacNamara (James Cagney) is negotiating with the Russian representatives the opening of several factories in the Iron Curtain, expecting to be promoted to a high position in Europe. However, his boss Wendell P. Hazeltine (Howard St. John) calls him from Atlanta and tells him to call off the negotiation since it is against the policy of the company. Further, he asks MacNamara to take care of his seventeen year-old daughter Scarlett (Pamela Tiffin) that is traveling through Europe during her two weeks vacation in Berlin. When MacNamara and his wife Phyllis (Arlene Francis) meet Scarlett in the airport, they feel that she would be a troublemaker with her "hot blood". However, Scarlett gets sick and stays for two months in MacNamara's house. When Wendell calls MacNamara telling that he would come to Berlin with his wife to bring Scarlett back to USA, Phyllis calls her husband and tells that Scarlett has vanished. However, Scarlett appears in MacNamara's office and tells that she got married with the communist Otto Ludwig Piffl (Horst Buchholz). The smart MacNamara plots a scheme to get rid of the youngster; but when he finds that Scarlett is pregnant, he reverts the situation and decides to transform Otto in the ideal son-in-law."One, Two, Three" is another delightful and witty comedy of Billy Wilder in times of Cold War. The hilarious story is developed in a fast pace, with wonderful and ironic lines and situations making fun of the socialist and the capitalist regimes. James Cagney has one of his best roles (if not the best) performing the ambitious and smart executive. One of my favorite lines is the one that Otto says "I have been a capitalist for only three hours and I already owe more than ten thousand dollars". This is the first time that I watch this movie, and I imagine how funny it would be before the fall of the Berlin Wall. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Cupido N?o Tem Bandeira" ("Cupid does not Have Flag")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wilder At His Considerable Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this film in a theater when it came out. Laughed so hard I fell out of my seat (and was spared considerable embarrassment only by the fact that everyone around me was doing the same thing). I can't count the number of times I've seen it over the years, but I know one thing for sure: I've yet to spot all the gags. (They come so fast upon each other's heels that you're likely to miss two for every one you're still laughing over.)Wilder plays no favorites -- and he takes no prisoners -- here. Everything within his considerable reach (the Cold War, the postwar era, spy-exchanges, Communism, capitalism, European aristocrats, idealism and cynicism, JUST for starters) is lampooned equally. (Even at least one of Cagney's early performances, in "Public Enemy," takes a shot.)Frankly, I'm surprised this film today has so many staunch fans who weren't around back when so much of its humor was "topical." Its ongoing appeal has to be attributed both to Wilder's pacing and to James Cagney's hallmark performance as McNamara (a poster child for high blood-pressure if ever there was one). Neither he nor Wilder ever let up, ably aided by a solid cast (Horst Bucholtz in particular, strangely enough!) who manage somehow always to catch up."One, Two, Three:" that's how fast the gags fly. See if you can keep up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"It's that damned German efficiency."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Throughout his long and distinguished career, director Billy Wilder has always excelled at drawing impressive comedic performances from actors that we wouldn't typically associate with comedy. His most exemplary accomplishment would undoubtedly be the case of Walter Matthau, who, prior to 'The Fortune Cookie (1966),' was known prominently for his dramatic work, but went on, with Jack Lemmon by his side, to create one of cinema's most enduring and beloved comedic partnerships. No less remarkable is Wilder's transformation of archetypal gangster James Cagney. Defying all expectations, the director managed to wring a frenetic comedy performance out of his leading man, the experience leaving Cagney so utterly exhausted that he subsequently retired from the acting business {and wasn't seen again at all until Milos Forman's 'Ragtime (1981)'}. Though not one of Wilder's greatest efforts, and certainly paling in comparison with 'The Apartment (1960)' of the previous year, 'One, Two, Three (1961)' is a massively enjoyable comedy romp, and few directors other than Wilder were ever bold enough to poke such fun at the aggressively-escalating Cold War.James Cagney plays C.R. "Mac" MacNamara, a proud veteran of the Coca-Cola Company, who has dragged his family around Europe for the past fifteen years in futile pursuit of the European managerial position. Now located in West Berlin, his goal is seemingly within reach, despite the elevating friction between the Americans and the Communists of the East. Just on the verge of a groundbreaking deal to distribute Coca-Cola across the Iron Curtain, Mac is unexpectedly asked by his boss (Howard St. John) to babysit his hot-blooded seventeen-year-old daughter, Scarlett (Pamela Tiffin), during her stay in Berlin. When Scarlett suddenly announces her marriage to a fierce Communist radical, Otto Ludwig Piffl (Horst Buchholz), Mac realises that he has just hours to transform this unapologetic Yankee-hater into the perfect son-in-law, otherwise his career is as good as doomed. Racing frantically around his office, barking orders with incredible ferocity, Cagney is absolute dynamite in the leading role, the film's hectic conversational pace often reminiscent of a Howard Hawks film, particularly 'His Girl Friday (1940)' {which Wilder notably remade in 'The Front Page (1974)'}.Though some of the jokes occasionally miss their mark, the screenplay by Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond {adapted from the one-act play by Ferenc Molnar} is brisk, intelligent and regularly very funny. The supporting characters each bring a streak of vibrancy to the darkly-themed satire, and, though Cagney always dominates his scenes, each performer complements him well. Schlemmer (Hanns Lothar), an ex-SS member who denies everything, habitually clinks his heels together at every order, despite being asked on multiple occasions to cut it out; Phyllis MacNamara (Arlene Francis) resents her husband's neglect of his family, and verbally articulates her frustration by referring to him as "Mein Fuhrer"; Fräulein Ingeborg (Liselotte Pulver) is Mac's sexy, ambitious secretary, and Wilder certainly knows how to make good use of her. Filled with amusing characters and situations, and more film references than I was able to count, Billy Wilder's 'One, Two, Three' is surefire Cold War entertainment, and fans of James Cagney will relish the opportunity to witness Rocky Sullivan playing the comedian.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you don't like farce comedies like It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, Murder by Death, and The Pink Panther Strikes Again avoid this one because that is what it is. After reading most of these reviews I think people misunderstood this movie. If you compare it to a painting the cold war is just the canvas it is painted on. In reality it is about a person who just can't get things right in his career and hopefully this time around he can contain things and make it all work. Everybody else is trying to do the same thing. On the way they merge in so many references to other movies and one liners it could be considered a history of cinema. If you don't understand them the fast pace may make it difficult for you to keep up with it. But for the younger people today that get most of these references they will like its fast pace. Most movies from that time period move too slowly for them. Oh yes, I guess the McNamara curse does finally get done away with in the end. Or does it? You will have to see the end to decide that for yourself.</fullReview>

I was surprised to see this film did not win many awards and had only one nomination - for cinematography, if you can believe it.James Cagney out did himself. His rapid fire dialogue was one of a kind. I can't think of anyone who could have competed with his version of this script. From the opening narration to the last minute of the film, Mr. Cagney stole every scene. All of the actors in this comedy were at the top of their game.I saved this on my DVR and plan to watch it again in the next few weeks. This is the type of film that has so many nuances, so many punch lines, and so many hidden gems, that one would need to watch it a few times just to pick up on all of the humor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has to Be Best of Wilder Comedies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Cagney is at the top of his game giving a machine gun like delivery of his lines, once again, demonstrating his status as a legendary star.Add to this, a cast of good character actors, some familiar like Leon Askin and Red Buttons and some not so familiar. All in all a cast that helps makes a film that delivers laughs in rapid fire succession!Included in this cast is Horst Buchholz who is especially funny as the loony communist. Now, someone mentioned that Jack Lemmon thought a regular comedian should have been put in that role. I think that would have made the character less funny. It needs the "serious" touch that Buchholz gives Otto that really makes his statements even more ludicrous and therefore even funnier. A good example is the scene where Otto makes his comments on Americanism while being dragged out of the room, "America, unemployment, discrimination, gangsterism, juvenile delinquency, but under our new 20 year plan, we will catch up with you!".If any one has not seen this gem, my advice is look for it on TV, buy it, rent it, just watch it! You won't stop laughing!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember this film from television many years ago and when a friend showed me it on tape in German I finally grabbed a copy on DVD.WOW what a film... few films and even fewer comedies can sustain multiple showings.BUT One Two Three is astounding.Funny, satirical and even romantic with some of the fastest and sharpest dialogue ever to come out of an essentially Hollywood film.Widler was a master and it shows.With a top line cast headed by an extraordinary performance from James Cagney and a group of marvelous German actors and actresses ..and Lilo Pulver deserves special mention as the gum chewing secretary along with Hans Lothar as Schlemmer, Widler and I.A.L. Diamond create a wacky look at East West relations at the height of the Cold War.I must also mention Arlen Francis who is just wonderful to watch as Cagney's long suffering wife.It is interesting that Cagney and Buchholz (apparently) did not get on and this does add zing to their verbal duels!But the whole cast is up to the funny antics that fill this film.The use of music and Daniel Fapp's great wide screen cinematography (this is a film to really watch!!) are excellent.So sit back, relax and just enjoy a great film, great cast and a genius director in action and I do mean ACTION!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Before Wenders, There Was Wilder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a delightful cold-war comedy set in a divided Berlin, whose recent (the movie is set in 1961) Nazi past is still in evidence: all Cagney's employees rise to attention whenever he enters the office, his right-hand man clicks his heels, (the newspaper reporter turns out to have been his Uberlieutenant) and the nearest nobleman is a hotel men's-room attendant. When Cagney's boss in Atlanta sends his daughter Scarlett (Pamela Tiffin) overseas in an attempt to defuse her latest romance, she promptly disappears, only to turn up wearing the wedding ring ("forged from the cannon that defended Stalingrad") of a card-carrying East German student (played by Horst Bucholz), and pregnant. A fast-paced, hilarious hour ensues which can only be compared to the screwball comedies of the thirties and forties in its rapid-fire one-liners, plot complications, and doubletakes. Nothing is sacred, including Cagney's resume, since his "Public Enemy" persona is mimicked by a walk-on cameo Red Buttons (as an MP) and Cagney himself menacingly wields a grapefruit half in a moment of frustration. The transformation of the young Communist into a glad-handing, ambitious aristocrat and bottling-plant manager, even as he zips up the fly of his new striped trousers and turns to greet his instant in-laws at the airport, is as easy as 1,2,3. This film manages to lampoon every identifiable political, economical, and social type it races past, in brilliant form. I viewed this most recently in March of 2002, and found it as freshly comic as when I first saw it, as a boy of twelve or so. Some younger viewers may miss some of the "Marshall Plan" references, but I rather believe a film like this will stimulate interest in the cold-war era, since it does much to capture the atmosphere of edgy, veiled conflict which we were forced to joke about at the time in order to live with. I can't imagine seeing a comedy quite this well-written, acted, or directed being made in the P.C. world we have inherited since then.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw this one during its first-run release, I recall finding its relentless pace rather irritating and wasn't savvy enough at the time, I guess, to catch everything that Billy Wilder and his scriptwriters packed so tightly into its running time.But it was shown (letterboxed - "The only way to fly!") on Turner Classic Movies the other night and I quite enjoyed it, since it may now be enhanced somewhat at today's distant remove from the politics and the contemporary references of its period.Cagney's performance is really amazing and it's not so surprising that this was his last major film role on the big screen. He must have been exhausted when filming wrapped!The rest of the cast seems to be thoroughly in the service of what Wilder intended, which certainly wasn't subtlety, to say the least. And the production values and behind-the-scenes contributions (especially Andre Previn's witty score) are Class "A" all the way (except for that flat-looking studio mock-up of the air terminal interior, apparently necessitated by problems that couldn't have been foreseen).It's not Wilder's best but it's a cut above (and then some) so much of the stuff that passes for comedy on the multiplex screens today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film one two three is about post World War II Germany under the different occupying countries. The film is very funny and you can understand why some of the occupying countries are ridiculed. Wilder is from Germany but went America during the war. The Russians are portrayed as rough men that like to eat caviar and drink alcohol. The Russian side of Germany is still in rubbles. I believe that while in America Wilder became custom to the American ways and this is way he portrays the other occupying countries as less inferior. During the film, MacNamara drives across the lines to East Berlin, you can see how he is able to bribe the security at the gates and that the East side has not been repaired. Wilder is trying to show how the West Berlin is better. West Berlin looks like a typical American city. The first thing that you will notice is the Coca Cola Company is headquartered in West Berlin. Coke is a well-known American icon. Wilder wants the audience to think that the West is America and is better than the other zones. The movie is very fast paced. Everything is about time and not having enough. I believe that the movie is fast paced to show tow things. The first is to show coca-colonization, to show how quickly the coke company was moving its product around the world. The second reason is to show what Germany was going through at this time. The country was divided into four zones and everyone was in dispute of the Berlin wall. The country was trying to re-identify itself after two World Wars. Germany had been proved to be wrong again. I think that the film was very funny and did a great job portraying the times that people were going through in Germany.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Cagney's last great roles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Cagney was pretty much retired when Billy Wilder lured him away from his farm to do "One, Two, Three," a witty, fast-moving comedy from 1961. And what a credit to Cagney - rapid dialogue and plenty of it, taxing to memorize probably for a man half his age.The story concerns an American Coca-Cola executive, C.R. McNamara, heading up an office in Berlin who is asked by his boss to host his daughter (Pamela Tiffin). Hoping for a plum assignment in London, C.R. and his wife (Arlene Francis) welcome the young woman with open arms. She's southern, beautiful, flirtatious, and before they know it, she's got a Communist boyfriend (Horst Bucholz) Then he becomes her Communist husband, and that London promotion is looking less and less likely unless C.R. can pull off a miracle.Wilder's direction for this was to have the dialogue shouted rather than spoken and to keep the film moving at a very fast pace. Admittedly this can get a little exhausting. Cagney gives a high-voltage performance and is extremely funny as the harried executive. And there are some hysterical bits as well as the madcap feeling of a '30s film. The rest of the cast is wonderful: Arlene Francis as C.R.'s long-suffering wife, Lilo Pulver as C.R.'s sexy secretary, and Hanns Lothar as Schlemmer, C.R.'s assistant who was "underground" during the war. ("The resistance?" "No, the subway. Nobody told me anything down there.") Though this was not a happy set - Wilder and Cagney had their differences, and Horst Buccholz was a major pain - the result is very good. Late in their careers, Wilder and Cagney still had it. Big time.</fullReview>

It was a time of the Cold War and the wall being built between East and West Germany.That being said, James Cagney turned in still another fine performance as a soda executive caught up with a wife wanting to come back to the U.S. and a boss who has had his teenage daughter running throughout Europe and now she is set to come to a divided Germany.Cagney's timing and the pacing of the film are in fine form. I didn't appreciate his wife referring to him on occasion as "Mein Fuehrer."

		<fullReview>Consider the relationship between the US and Russia in 1961 and you wonder how Billy Wilder had the guts to make this film.Made when the Cold War was in full bloom, "One, Two, Three" is the story of a Coca-Cola executive running the bottling plant in West Berlin.Sounds like serious stuff Huh?? Well not exactly. "One, Two, Three" is a brilliantly structured comedy that has the pace of a normal drive on the Autobahn.Wilder spares no one. The Russians, Germans, space race, capitalism and communism all are ridiculed in the screenplay co-written by longtime collaborator I.A.L. Diamond. The catalyst is one CP MacNamara, the aforementioned manager. He is living in West Berlin complete with a typical American wife, two American Kids, and a gorgeous mistress who gives him "German lessons". Along comes Scarlett Hazeltine, the flighty daughter of one of the top executives of the company who is being sent to Europe so her father can break up her American romance.It is MacNamara's responsibility to keep Scarlett from getting into trouble, which is exactly what she does. James Cagney is MacNamara. He shouts and bellows and goes way over the top but his interpretation is nothing short of perfect. He is as energetic as the pace and never stops. Pamela Tiffin plays Scarlett and does it so expertly you really think she is a ditz. Horst Buckholtz, never known for comedy shows a surprising flair for the medium, and whoever thought of Arlene Francis for the role of Cagney's wife deserves a special cudo. Known more as a radio hostess and panelist on "What's My Line" then as a major thespian, Francis expertly plays off Cagney.This is one of Cagney's greatest performances. And one of his legendary. After it he went into retirement, burned out after 30 non-stop years on the screen. It would be 2 decades until he came back. Oh what we missed in those 20 years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is Wilder at his best. Nobody comes out clean - the American capitalism, the frail communism, love, hate and marriage, not to mention German language and love for order. Wilder also deals with the common Nazi excuse, prevalent after the war: "We didn't know what was happening". There's not a dull moment. The story moves straight on, not straying aside to deal with the love affair between the two young lover, as you'd expect other directors to do. The cast are in top form, though Cagney's role might have been even better with the late Walter Matthau. Not only is this movie interesting, funny and extremely sarcastic, it also has an educational value. As a teacher, I consider it the perfect aid to the subject of the cold war. There are many historical references: Berlin, WW2, Macnamara, Castro, Khrushtchev etc. But you don't have to see it only for educational purposes. It's a great movie, heartily recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Screwball Comedy updated to the Cold War</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thirteen years after he made "A Foreign Affair," Billy Wilder returned to Berlin for another superb comedy. "One, Two, Three," like its predecessor, is a romantic comedy that combines elements of political satire with pure farce. In the 1930's, this kind of movie was called a "screwball comedy" - with one major difference. Here the focus is not on the escapades of the lovers, but the escapades of Jimmy Cagney, who at first is determined to separate the lovers (Buchholtz and Tiffin) and then is equally determined to unite them and transform Buchholtz from a raving Red into a capitalist aristocrat.Wilder's two depictions of post-war Berlin, separated by thirteen years, also represent the brilliant director's progress reports - wrapped in high comedy - of the recovery of Germany. In a couple of shots, it is interesting to see the famous Brandenburg Gate before the construction of the Berlin Wall, and note the relative ease with which people could still move between East and West in 1961. It is also interesting to note the omnipresent rubble and the many bomb-ravaged buildings still in ruins along the streets. International companies are moving in, former Nazis are participating in the recovery (and recovering their lives) and Germany is, indeed, the focus of confrontation (and cooperation) between East and West.This is a riotous romantic comedy, however, in his typical way, Wilder simultaneously remarks on larger issues. He takes a poke at communism, fascism and capitalism - not to mention simple hypocrisy - along the way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Billy Wilder's Amazing Rapid-Fire Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Our setting is West Berlin, Germany, just after the Second World War where James Cagney plays C.R. MacNamara, a Coca-Cola executive assigned to look after his boss's daughter Scarlett Hazeltine (Pamela Tiffin) while her parents are away vacationing in Europe. As the story progresses Scarlett falls in love with an East German Communist named Otto Piffl, played by Horst Buchholz. When MacNamara finds out that the underage Scarlett is engaged to be married all hell breaks loose as he (with the help of his assistant Schlemmer) hastily undertakes the task of transforming Piffl into a respectable, presentable, and noble husband when Mr. and Mrs. Hazeltine arrive back to greet their daughter.MacNamara's trouble doesn't end there, however. Phyllis MacNamara (Arlene Francis) is unhappy with her life in Berlin, and for the sake of their children she pleads with her husband to take back his old position in Atlanta and return to live in the United States. He refuses and she threatens to leave him.Billy Wilder directs this fast-paced comedy with sheer brilliance it will leave your head spinning. The cast here is top-notch and James Cagney is non-stop hilarious. For a film that has at least a chuckle a minute it is nowhere to be found on AFI's Top 100 Laughs. Fans of Howard Hawks' "His Girl Friday" should enjoy and appreciate this highly underrated farcical gem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Buyer Beware</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The MGM DVD pictured on the IMDb page for this film is a disaster, formatted to fit your screen. Somewhere in heaven Wilder must be shedding tears. Too many times his spatial relationships are off the screen, and a voice comes out of the ether, especially in scenes featuring the three Russians. The finale, in the speeding limo heading for the airport with an artist painting a coat of arms on the door, is particularly effected. I believe there are four people in the backseat but we only see Cagney and his secretary. Young Otto makes his presence with his voice, and when he is thrown in their lap as they take a turn. When they turn in the opposite direction, Schlemmer comes into view.With that warning in mind, this time capsule piece is Wilder's homage to many older films. Cagney's staccato dialogue is right out of His Girl Friday, and he rarely lowers his voice. Wilder wanted Cary Grant for Love in the Afternoon but could not get him. It is as if he is trying to prove that he does not need Grant to produce a screwball comedy.The bumbling Russian trade delegation come straight from Ninotchka. The Sabre Dance scene is a variation of Gary Cooper, the Gypsies and the Dictaphone in Love in the Afternoon. Others have mentioned Cagney's picking up the grapefruit, or doing Rico. Then we have Red Buttons miming Cagney. None of this detracts from the brilliance of the film, but makes you laugh harder. Wilder combines it all into a tasty stew.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the moment the film " One, Two, Three " begins, an audience member might very well believe he is on an express train to the valley of laughter. The quick and lively pace, the quirky characters in the story and the machine-gun dialog, all lend themselves to the inertia of Billy Wilder's movie. The setting is West Berlin, during the cold war. Although, the world of the soft drink business is paramount, it's the C.E.O of the main plant in Berlin, one C. R. MacNamara, who drives the action. His ambition, other than chasing his sexy secretary around the office, is to create a great surge in business, so as to catapult himself to the Head of Operations in Europe. However, his comfortable, stylish life is not only totally disrupted when the boss's hot blooded daughter, comes to visit, but is completely shattered when it's discovered she secretly dated, married and is moving to Russia with a card-carrying Communist. Things ratchet rapidly up towards disastrous, when all concerned learn that she is pregnant and her folks are coming to see their man in Berlin. The cast is talented and superbly assembled. Herein we have Horst Buchholz playing Otto Ludwig Piffl, Hanns Lothar as Schlemmer, Howard St, John as Wendell P. Hazeltine, Pamela Tiffin as his daughter Scarlett. Arlene Francis, plays Phyllis MacNamara and Leon Askin as the Russian trade commissioner. A fine cast and a superior comedy treat for the whole family. ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie for a couple of reasons.The story is originally from a play by Ferenc Molnár, who was Hungarian, like I am, so his other works are well known in my country. I love the play, and I'd give it a 9, but (I don't say this very often) the movie is much better.It all takes place in the separated Berlin in 1961. Its about a rich man(working for a big soft drink company) of "wealth and taste", who has to look after his boss's daughter, which turns out to be a real struggle as the girl secretly marries a communist party member of the east side.The director is our beloved Billy Wilder, who surely knew how to make a good comedy. The film doesn't have any moment without a great joke, I laughed so hard, I fell down from the sofa(not joking). The biggest difference between the play and the movie is the amount of political references and elements. Its a fight between capitalism and communism on every level, mostly by humorous conversations between the characters.The dialogues are fantastic, and haven't lost their topicality over the years(its recommended to know about the political situation though). James Cagney steals the show as the main character, its jesting to see an actor who used to play mostly bad guys as a funny character.I'd recommend this film to anyone. The writing, the characters, the acting are all excellent, and the humour still challenges the diaphragm.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought Airplane 1 &amp; 2 were very funny. I liked all the Scary Movies (the comedies). I really liked It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, World with all of the greatest comedians of the time. And Bridesmaids was really funny too.But compared to One Two Three they all are in slow motion.One Two Three is the fastest most witty comedy I have ever seen. I just saw it on cable. And it is one of Billy Wilder's finest films. You cannot afford to laugh as you will miss the next zinger.The comedic innuendos come a flying at ya' and you better have a cup of Dark Roast coffee to stay alert.Fun is made of East/West, North/South, Communism/Capitalism and a ton of everything including society itself. A real tour d'force of life in the 60s and the cold war.Cagney has the fastest and longest lines you have every seen and he is backed up by a great supporting cast. The story is simple: Executive has to confront his capitalistic boss with the fact that his egocentric daughter falls in love with a commie. The quick witted dialogue between the Russian embassy guy and Cagney are great!I have to buy the video and show it too my friends, ASAP. And had to get my 2 cents in for a legacy post.And no CGI special effects, explosions, gun fire, car chases, impending disasters, foot chases, and the big mean bad guy.All dialogue and funny sight gags.

		<fullReview>Remember when there were imminent nuclear attack drills in school? The alarm would sound and students were instructed to crawl underneath their school desks as if the flimsy plastic top and tin would protect them from a nuclear explosion. Yes the threat of Soviet annihilation was a very real thing back then and the dichotomy of the Cold War informed the world-views of baby-boomers and generation x'ers for decades to follow. Thankfully I was not part of either generation yet having lived on both sides of the east/west divide I can tell you that despite the severity of 1960's evening news telecasts, the standoff is hilarious in retrospect.The hilarity was evident as far back as 1961 when Billy Wilder's One, Two Three hit theaters. Starring James Cagney as a fast-talking Coca-Cola executive, the movie was sly, witty and light as air, masking a cynical and subversive world-view taking the ideologies of the USA and USSR to task. Cagney plays C.R. MacNamara, a dependable company man who is asked to take care of the CEO's daughter Scarlet (Pamela Tiffin) while she's in West Berlin. His wife (Arlene Francis) was looking forward to a vacation in Venice with the kids while his secretary (Liselotte Pulver) was hoping to teach him the sultry phonetics of the umlaut. Naturally no one is happy with the imposition. Things spiral out of control when the seventeen-year-old southern belle falls in love and marries an East Berlin Bolshevik (Horst Buchholz) all while the CEO (Howard St. John) comes in for a surprise visit to pickup his sweet little angel.The screenplay written by Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond based on a Ferenc Molnar play has enough gags to go toe to toe with today's joke a minute youtube generation. Even without prior knowledge of the Cold War, the movie is one heck of a ride featuring, among other things, a high speed chase with a disintegrating Russian car, a constantly heal-clicking lackey who may or may not have been an SS member and the old staple; a man wearing women's clothing. Those who do know their 20th century history will be further rewarded with coy references to Khrushchev, Tito and Yuri Gagarin not to mention the adversarial tones of Cagney's character and the Russians he deals with. "He could use a hair cut?and I'd like to give it to him myself with a hammer and sickle," says MacNamara to the débutante's new liebchen.The characters are exactly what you would expect from a fast-paced farce; broadly drawn and exaggerated by a single feature or fault. Buchholz's Otto is an overzealous card-carrying Red, bloviating about Coca-Cola colonialism and dead herring in the moonlight. Scarlet is so overwhelmingly dense to the point of annoyance, at one point musing "did you know Otto spelled backwards is Otto?". Meanwhile the trio of Russian dignitaries who complicates MacNamara's plans remind me of an old Russian joke: why do Russians walk around in sets of three? One reads, one writes and the third keeps an eye on the other two intellectuals. If you're looking for anything more than stock characters causing havoc in post-war Berlin, you may be setting your standards unrealistically high.I have a real affinity for Billy Wilder and his directorial efforts to which One, Two, Three is a splendid addition to my Seen It list. Like The Apartment (1960), One, Two, Three achieves wonders with its cast; like Ace in the Hole (1951) it has the propensity to be cynical yet charming and like Some Like It Hot (1959), One, Two, Three is gut-bustlingly hilarious.http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hilarious and one of a kind film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most fans of Jimmy Cagney know that he could talk a mile a minute in his films. Few actors had quite the gift for gab on screen like Cagney, but this film manages to take his frenetic personality and shift it into overdrive!! It's like the usual Cagney film combined with a massive dose of speed!! The end result is very impressive--in particular for Cagney, as he practically carried the film with his energy and lightning pace.Cagney plays a top executive for Pepsi in West Berlin, but he has his sights set much higher with the company. When an even bigger-wig entrusts his daughter with Cagney during her visit to Berlin, chaos ensues and the film is a great Cold War comedy.This daughter, it turns out, is pretty wild and pretty dumb! So wild and dumb that she falls in love with and marries a rabid Communist after she runs off from Cagney's supervision. Instead of panicking, Cagney sets in motion an amazingly complex and insane plan to make this marriage work out and be acceptable to her parents!! In effect, he is like Professor Higgins from MY FAIR LADY but does it all in much less time!! Along the way, there are many wonderful laughs about the Cold War and the uneasy alliance the ex-Nazis of Berlin have made with NATO. For examples, every time Cagney talks to his German assistant, the guy clicks his heels like a German soldier and when the new husband is picked up by and when the Russians capture the new husband (thinking he's a Capitalist spy), they torture him by playing the song "Itsy, Bitsy, Teeny, Weeny" until he cracks!! Lots of laughs, lots of clever writing, great acting and Billy Wilder's amazing direction make this a treat to watch.</fullReview>

Make sure you see it in letter box mode, or get the DVD or else this won't be as enjoyable an experience.Otherwise, this is one of the great fast paced comedies ever. Being old enough to remember it when it was new and relevant, it's a little surprising to now see it as dated as the great 1930's screwball comedies. But it's still very funny and Cagney is his usual magnificent self.BTW, Cagney listed Horst Buchholz as one of the two actors he detested, "Cuddles" Sakall being the other, for his obstinacy in the filming of this production.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No wonder Cagney had a long rest from films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was around 20 years before James Cagney subsequently re-appeared in a film role. It would be little surprise if he based that decision partly on the amount of effort he had made and energy he had used, in his portrayal of MacNamara, the head of Coca-cola in West Berlin at the height of the Cold War, in this most wonderful of films, One Two Three.Without doubt this is the fastest-moving, most exhausting film I have watched, so what it must have been like for the cast and crew is difficult to imagine. But Billy Wilder has directed a masterpiece of comedy and satire, with Cagney absolutely excellent. I would love to know how many takes were required for some of the scenes, as there was much to memorise and deliver and all at break-neck speed.With one exception the supporting cast, both American and European, play their parts to perfection, made easier by some great one-liners from the writers. I would have given this film full marks had someone other than the late Horst Buchholz played the part of the idealistic but hapless young Communist, who eventually marries the daughter of the main man of Coca Cola. His acting just does not gel with the rest of the cast, while his part required someone with a much lighter touch who could have made us laugh.The test of any film for me is whether I can imagine I am really in the location and with One Two Three I most certainly felt I was in Berlin, around 1960. Indeed having been to East Berlin myself during the cold war, the drab surroundings and entertainment on offer in the "nightclub" scene,(excluding of course the great part when Ingeborg did her sexy dance on the table to tempt the Russians), was not that far from the truth. The car chase that followed when the Russian car kept dropping to bits was just hilarious.While Wilder took every opportunity to mercilessly satire the Communist system, he still had a few barbed swipes at American-led capitalism and did not spare the West Berliners for their Nazi past. But despite such deadly serious matters he manages on all occasions throughout the film to cloak them into satirical comedy, which is no mean feat.I never tire of watching One Two Three as it regularly appears on British TV and I also have the DVD. However one thing that does rather mystify me when I look back on this film is why Pamela Tiffin did not become a superstar. She was beautiful, funny and talented.But two people who did go the whole journey in their careers were Cagney and Wilder and we are very fortunate that they came together in this most memorable film when both were in superb form.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meaning of the title of the movie "One, Two, Three"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As to the question of the title of the movie "One, Two, Three", it is quite simple: Translated directly from the German, "Eins, Zwei, Drei" and given in the form of a command it indicates that things are to happen in the time one counts to three. It is an expression that substitutes for "make haste" i.e. it translates into the English equivalent of "not now,but right now!". The Spanish equivalent that is sometimes used in the USA is "undele" (The spelling may not be correct) The title is well chosen for this fast moving comedy that has satirical overtones and semi-inside jokes.The viewer has to appreciate the political climate during the time when the Berlin wall was erected. The movie was a flop in Germany when it came out as the people there were in no mood to appreciate the film during the sinister times in the early '60's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ONE, TWO, THREE is now historically dated but it is still a barrel of laughs. Almost every subject lampooned here no longer exists (I believe that the only icon to survive the passage of time is Coca-Cola!), but those familiar with the Cold War era will find that it remains entertaining in the present day. James Cagney delivers a powerhouse performance as Coca-Cola's "man in Berlin", C.R. MacNamara. It is a marvel to watch him in action, rattling off dialog at a machine-gun pace. Horst Bucholz is great as the scruffy East German intellectual "beatnik" Otto Ludwig Piffl, who is determined to beat the Capitalist system but ends up succumbing to it. Pamela Tiffin has never been better as the air-headed but beautiful Scarlett Hazeltine. Add a great supporting cast (Standouts: Hanns Lotharr as Schlemmer, the long-suffering office assistant with a dubious past history as a German soldier, Lilo Pulver as secretary Fraulein Ingeborg (mit der umlaut!), and Leon Askin as Comrade Peripetchikoff, overweight representative of the People's Soft Drink Secretariat.).I did spot one possible error during a recent viewing. When Scarlett and Otto display their steel wedding rings ("Forged from the brave steel of a cannon that fought at Stalingrad!") to MacNamara, they are both wearing the rings on their right hands. I'm not sure if this is an actual error or a hidden swipe at the inability of the East Berliners to do anything correctly. Either way, it doesn't detract from a great film that has stood the test of time and is as lively and entertaining today as it was 42 years ago. Bravo!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wilder's delayed home run</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this hilarious comedy first came out, history had just outrun its subject: on August 13th, 1961, the Berlin wall became the impenetrable border in a divided post war Germany ... While the movie still showed the semipermeable division and post-13th August every-day reality of people pretty freely changing from East to West, this should be from now on an impossibility for the next the 28 years ...This accounts probably as the main reason for this movie to be a box- office failure at its opening in Germany at that time ... Nobody really wanted to see a comedy about a situation that had just dramatically changed and would cost the lives of many who tried to 'jump the border' in its consequence ... Even in the U.S. this movie was not the typical 'Wilder success', as the turn of events tainted the fun of this great comedy even on this side of the ocean ...Wilder's only return to shoot a movie in Germany, after he had left to flee the upcoming Nazi regime in 1933, proved to be somewhat of a 'flop' (at least commercially) at the time ... Nevertheless -- it had its second coming in the 1980s, when it was re-released in Germany with tremendous success ... Considered an 'almost forgotten gem' at the time, it was as popular as it could have been at its original release in 1961 ...Interestingly enough, it proved to be as fresh and timeless in its humor and very sharp in tackling German and American stereotypes ... A wonderful cast of German and American actors make it a special treat, especially if you are at home in the cinematic world on both sides of the ocean ... One of the many innuendoes and an extra treat is the part of the secretary, performed by the sparkling Lilo Pulver: her whole look and interpretation is so 'Marilyn'-like, that it can only be seen as a Wilder attempt to take a little revenge on he legendary MM, who also was known to be on his 'black list' of actors never to be worked with again, after they shot 'Some like it Hot' together ...Few movies (especially of this genre) have proven to hold so true over time: when the wall came down on November 11th, 1989, it was obvious everywhere in the streets of Berlin: capitalism had outlived communism (at least for a while) with the people ... Coca Cola cans were littering the streets everywhere, Coke being the preferred beverage of the liberated East Germans who spent their first West Marks on long missed 'Western goods' ... Wouldn't Mr MacNamara have had a field day?!Julia McLaughlin</fullReview>

A wonderful Billy Wilder comedy, using both American and up-and-coming German stars like Horst Buchholz and the irrepressible Lilo Pulver. It's the only true comedy I can remember seeing Cagney in.

(One notable exception without resorting to spoilers: the scene where the MP officer finds the polka-dot dress and its contents and nearly faints - that one is just silly and not really funny, but you can't win 'em all).One, Two, Three is screwball farce as well as political satire at its best, with marvelous actors portraying every stereotype around in 1961. Literally no one is left unscathed, which may cause some of the more biased Commies, Nazis, West Germans, East Germans, Americans, Russians, journalists, managers, secretaries etc. etc. not to like this film, once they recognize themselves.

James Cagney is well-casted and up to the challenge of a face-paced script, portraying a materialistic Coca-Cola factory manager. The film's Communist quirks date it immensely to modern audiences, but the comedy is ageless.However, Arlene Francis does some damage via mediocre acting and the part of a strong-willed wife that was cliche even in 1961. She is a deflated fifth wheel to an otherwise monster truck of a cast: Cagney, little-knowns Tiffin and Buchholz, and Pulver.The best part is a hilarious car case through East Germany, enhanced by the Oscar-nominated cinematography.</fullReview>

Probably the greatest thing about Wilder comedies is that the viewer doesn't have to think about the content to enjoy them, though there is tons to think about. You don't have to realize that they're satirical social commentaries to like them. "One, Two, Three" can be enjoyed on a purely comedic level without even thinking about the proletariat/bourgeois and capitalist/socialist points presented. One can just sit back and enjoy the genius that was James Cagney. Is it any wonder this was his last on-screen performance for two decades with the amount of energy the man puts out? Techno music and fast-paced cinematography in such recent movies as "Run, Lola, Run" can't hold a match to Cagney's motor-mouth and stunning on-screen presence as he barks out orders "Eins, Zwei, Drei!"

		<fullReview>Following the massively acclaimed "The Apartment" from Billy Wilder is this lesser-known James Cagney-starring cold war farce based on a play by Ferenc Molnár and penned by Wilder and frequent collaborator I.A.L. Diamond, who also worked on Wilder's previous two, very famous, films "Some Like it Hot" and "The Apartment". Although the film sometimes feels too much like a stage-play in terms of performance and even writing, and Wilder's handling of the film as director feels pedestrian at times, "One, Two, Three" is for the most part very funny and enjoyable.Cagney plays MacNamara, Coca-Cola's man in West Berlin, who is told by his boss to look after his daughter Scarlett. Of course, MacNamara fails miserably at this task, as Scarlett ends up marrying a rabid young Communist named Otto, and many farcical occurrences naturally follow, some funnier than others but for the most part it all works quite well.I've heard some call this a better cold war satire than Stanley Kubrick's "Dr. Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb", but I would never say anything of the sort because outside of the story's background and the odd political commentary line (which are often rather heavy-handed and obvious here) this is really a straight-forward farce except the son-in-law happens to be Communist this time around. That's not to say it's bad, but it doesn't exactly get points for originality. The film ends on a high note and has plenty of hilarious dialogue (mostly from Otto, played excellently by Horst Buchholz) which helps it overcome its flaws and work as a cheery, farcical comedy. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wilder and Cagney Together in a Cold War Farce</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>POSSIBLE SPOILERSThis wonderful film, combining the talents of Billy Wilder as writer-director and Jimmy Cagney in his comedic persona, has largely faded from memory but it deserves to be revived. It is "based on a play" by Ferenc Molnar but Molnar was dead almost a decade before the film appeared, and the Cold War was in a different phase. Not having read Molnar's play, I'm inclined to assign most of the credit for the screenplay to Wilder alone. Cagney is cast as the head of Coca Cola's operations in West Berlin, trying to negotiate a deal to open the Soviet market. His boss in Atlanta vetoes dealing with the Russians but instead tells McNamara (Cagney's character) that he and his wife (Arlene Francis) must host the boss's daughter Scarlett (Pamela Tiffin). Scarlett a deep-fried Southern belle is boy crazy and has been sent to Europe to get her away from her many beaus (several of whom she seems to have been engaged to). While under McNamara's roof, she takes to spending her nights in East Berlin where she meets an eager young revolutionary (Horst Bucholz). With Scarlett's parents on the way to Berlin via London, McNamara learns that Scarlett is missing and when she is found again, it's discovered that she is pregnant and is married to her Communist boyfriend. Racing the clock, McNamara contrives to have the young man arrested in East Berlin where he confesses (after being forced to listen repeatedly to a moronic American song about a girl with a "teeny, weeny red bikini"), then has been rescued and brought to West Berlin where McNamara hurriedly transforms him into a well-dressed German aristocrat (adopted by a down-at-the-heels but titled gentleman working as a men's room attendant) just in time to meet the plane carrying Scarlett's parents to Berlin. Most of the comedy is built around the boy's rescue from the German police (by one of the Russian trade delegation McNamara has been dealing with) followed by the manic transformation process, with Cagney barking orders while barber, manicurist, tailor, hatter, and other merchants (shirts, underwear, shoes) are assembled to make the surly young man presentable. Cagney carries out his role with a style that is uniquely his. Arlene Francis, mostly famous for being famous in her day, is a wholly suitable foil. While some of the other characters -- McNamara's driver, his office manager, his beautiful blonde secretary and the members of the Communist trade mission -- make important comic contributions, this is Cagney's film and, of course, Wilder's. I don't know if they had ever previously worked together. Cagney is known primarily for his gangster roles and for a star turn as George M. Cohan (McNamara's coo-coo clock plays "I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy") but he was also a marvelous comic actor and this role is unquestionably in his best comic vein. Some have described the film as "dated" -- and it certainly is with the Cold War having ended. But a successful farce is never really dated and this is among the funniest farces ever filmed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Forget "Some Like it Hot"; this classic farce is Billy Wilder's funniest film. In fact, it may be one of the three or four of the funniest films ever made. A satire on the Cold War, played at break-neck pace, it stars James Cagney in his penultimate role as Coca-Cola's Head of Operations in West Berlin who finds his chances of promotion dashed when he fails to prevent his bosses' daughter from marrying, and getting pregnant by, an East Berlin communist.It's almost a one-man show, (Cagney is a great farceur), but Pamela Tiffin, Arlene Francis and Hanns Lothar as his heel clicking assistant ensure that he doesn't have it all his own way. There are more gags in this film than probably in any other, (and about a million movie in-jokes), it's verbal pyrotechnics the equivalent of the visual jokes that Tati employed in "Les Vacances de M Hulot", except there are more of them. Any yet it was never the success it deserved to be. Maybe it was too prescient for the public to find jokes about communism and Cuba and the Cold War funny. Or maybe they just couldn't keep up. It's certainly the fastest comedy ever made, though you're guaranteed to miss a lot of the jokes; you'll be laughing too hard.</fullReview>

Of course, we don't know this either so we are up and down with his antics to make it all work... I will never forget the bewilderment this man was having at young love, his life and his expectations of how is was to all work out. Somehow it does work out and we get to laugh about it all the way through the journey.

		<fullReview>James Cagney is magnificent in this movie especially in his monologue where he is snapping out the orders for suits, shirts, socks, shoes, hats,jewelry,etc to turn the new son-in-law of Coca Cola's Chairman of the Board into a gentleman (Count Von Gros De Shottenburg) from a card carrying communist before the Chairman arrives in West Berlin the same day. The supporting cast was also very funny, his wife, secretary, chauffeur Schlemer (who cannot forget his old days in the Nazi Party and keeps clicking his heels at every one of Cagney's orders), the three communists from East Berlin who are trying to steal the secret recipe for Coca Cola are hysterical. A Cameo appearance by Red Buttons as a Military MP when he does a Cagney impression was great. This is truly one of my favorite favorite comedies of all time, as the laughs keep coming from the very beginning until the very end, where Cagney puts money in a Coca Cola vending machine at the airport and a bottle of Pepsi comes out. It was probably one of the best ways that Cagney could end his brilliant career by showing his true versatility as an actor, from a song and dance man, to a gangster to serious roles and ending with comedy. A fitting end to a truly great career.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Setin cold war Berlin. This comedy is very fast paced. Cagney plays a finger-snapping Coca Cola executive who barks out orders to flunkies like a machine gun. His daughter has fallen in love with a truculent sandal-wearing communist East German. It amazed me that this latter character was played by the same actor (Horst Bucholst) who played the Polish seaman in "Tiger Bay" - another one of Mr Bucholst's excellent performances.There are some favourite scenes that I have from this film. When McNamara (Cagney) has fitted a "Russki Go Home" balloon to the exhaust pipe of Bucholst's motor cycle, he leans out the window with a satisfied smile - like only Cagney can do.My favourite of favourite scenes - and the one that cracks me up every time I see it - is the Mercedes limousine being chased by some Russians in a Moskvich. Every time the scene switches to the Moskvitch, something has fallen off it until finally the steering wheel comes away in the driver's hands and......well, I'd better not spoil it for you. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. Having never heard of it before, I thought it must have been a dud for Billy Wilder, but it's very, very good. Not being a James Cagney fan, I even found him to be enjoyable but have to give credit to Arlene Francis, who was very funny in her role. I always thought her claim to fame was appearing on "What's My Line?" If there is one complaint that I have, it has to be the screaming tirades of Mr. Buchholtz in the role of Piffl. I didn't like his character, and found his continual outbursts annoying. Perhaps someone with more comedic flair, say, Jack Lemmon, could have made the character more appealing.The "flame dance" at the Hotel Potemkin is hysterical, as is the character of Schlemmer, and the three communists.</fullReview>

From what I've read, Cagney and Wilder did not get along very well while making the film, but whatever tension there was between them did not detract from the creation of a collaborative masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Billy Wilder's Finest Work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Comedy about Coca-Cola's man (James Cagney) in West Berlin, who may be fired if he can't keep his American boss's daughter from marrying a Communist.This is Billy Wilder's finest work, and considering that I think pretty much everything he touches is gold, this is high praise. The humor, the action, this is just a great film from beginning to end. Cagney apparently hated working on this one, but I would also say it is one of his best roles, as well.What strikes me is the use of puns and fast-paced action (not quite slapstick, but close). Some jokes are hard to catch because they go so fast, and many are just downright clever. I was hooked as soon as they let loose with the ten-foot pole joke. I did not know they even made movies like this since the Marx Brothers stopped, and I cannot say they have done anything like this ever again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Billy Wilder gives James Cagney a Shout Out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coca-Cola executive James Cagney (as C.R. "Mac" MacNamara) works in Berlin, Germany; he's trying to sell Coke in the U.S.S.R. As the Russians erect the "Berlin Wall", Mr. Cagney smooches sexy German secretary Lilo Pulver (as Ingeborg); this will, later, upset wife Arlene Francis (as Phyllis). Aiming for a London promotion, Cagney agrees to look after his boss' pretty 17-year-old daughter, Pamela Tiffin (as Scarlett Hazeltine). Ms. Tiffin turns out to be a swinger; out for a hot time, she hooks up with handsome Horst Buchholz (as Otto Ludwig Piffl), and becomes a pregnant bride. To make matters worse, Mr. Buchholz turns out to be a card-carrying Communist. How is Cagney going to explain all this to his Capitalist boss? Doing a "Cagney impersonation," Red Buttons makes a brief appearance. It's one of several scripted references to Cagney's impressive film career.Writer/director Billy Wilder does not accomplish as much without Garbo and Lubitsch; instead, see "Ninotchka" (1939).For some reason, Cagney SHOUTS almost every one of his lines. This adversely affects the other performers, especially Buchholz. Cagney later accused Buchholz of scene-stealing; but, with so much time devoted to the good-looking young man in his boxer shorts, Buchholz didn't have to work very hard. Buchholz' performance is quite good, considering. And, others in the cast were nominated for acting awards: Cagney was the "New York Film Critics" runner-up "Best Actor", Ms. Francis was "Supporting Actress" #3 in the "Film Daily" poll, and Tiffin was a "Golden Globe" nominee. Mostly, this was due to Wilder's reputation; Cagney was not fooled, and decided to semi-retire after "One, Two, Three". Fortunately, Wilder had more classics in his future.***** One, Two, Three (12/15/61) Billy Wilder ~ James Cagney, Horst Buchholz, Pamela Tiffin, Arlene Francis</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Feels Dated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a big fan of screwball comedies from 30's and 40's and somehow they always seem fresh. However movies like One, Two, Three seem to be really dated. All the jokes fall flat.I did like the movie in the start but it just went downhill. Nearly everybody in the movie is a stereotype. There is a blond dumb secretary, unscrupulous capitalist manager who sleeps with every secretary, wife who tolerates cheating, idealistic communist young guy and unscrupulous communist guys who will risk anything for a beautiful blond. I understand that this is a recipe for a good farce, but everything feels artificial and I didn't laugh once during the whole movie. And I laugh a lot during funny movies.I can see that it may have been funny when it was released but that is not the case now. By the way I have loved older comedies by Lubitsch, Hawks and Sturges which are still very funny.This movie falls in middle, not good enough to recommend to anybody but not so bad that I fret over time wasted in watching the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How the mighty have fallen! Here's a Billy Wilder farce loaded with gimmicks and some of his favorite predilections, but it just doesn't come off! Wilder's direction is too heavy-handed. Likewise, the acting is too earnest and enthusiastic for a script that should have been played with the light touch of a soufflé. What was needed was a group of players with a collective tongue-in-cheek air about them. Plus the ability to throw away lines. Because ? let's face it! ? the dialogue is just not very funny. Cagney's pow-pow-pow rendition is all wrong. True, Maurice Chevalier might have got away with this approach, but Jimmy Cagney is definitely not a Chevalier. Alas, the support players try hard too, and that's jut the trouble. Only Lilo Pulver knows the score and acts accordingly. You can scratch the rest of the cast. They all try hard too ? and that's just the trouble! To cap it all, even the technical credits fail to impress. In fact, one might be pardoned for deducing that the movie had been heavily subsidized by a prominent soft-drink company.</fullReview>

Not content with merely filling his script with then-contemporary references to the Cuban Missile Crisis, Hollywood starlet-turned-Princess Grace Kelly, Nikita Kruschev's shoe-pounding at the United Nations, the Marshall Plan, the advent of the Berlin Wall, the likelihood of Russians landing the first people on the Moon, Sputnik, shoddy Communist consumer goods, Pan American Airlines, periodic Soviet leadership purges, Nazi war criminals in hiding, "German efficiency," and European nobles serving as men's room attendants, writer\director Billy Wilder has James Cagney quote Edward G. Robinson's final line from LITTLE CAESAR, and he also has Cagney sort of reprise his own infamous grapefruit-to-the-face move from PUBLIC ENEMY (both gangster films from the early 1930s). Therefore, anyone born later than former U.S. Veep Dick Cheney's Loser Generation (that is, the cohort which failed to produce a single American President) will find ONE, TWO, THREE a time capsule of ancient humor, not unlike a classic Greek satire or a Shakespeare comedy. So if YOU were born after 1945, don't watch ONE, TWO, THREE without some sort of Cliff's Notes!</fullReview>

It can be a lot to take when I am not in the mood for his intense, quick style. On the other hand, Cagney can be an engaging actor who keeps the pace of a film moving interestingly. Cagney was in good form in this film, proving that he still had it after all the years of typical, prime roles behind him. I could not help thinking that he was an anachronism; but then, I get a kick out of that sort of thing in films.Everything else about the film was as odd as films might be in that time period of film making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>sure its old, and sure most people have even forgotten that there were two Germanies, but its a forgotten classic. And since Wilder used lots of German actors, even the dialogue he didn't bother to translate is hilarious: two particularly funny scenes were the Vopos interviewing Otto about his "wedding present" and the Stasi torture scene--who wouldn't crack after days of "itsy bitsy teeny weeny yellow polka-dot bikini." Too bad most viewers won't recognize the old posters slipping out of the picture frame in the table-top dance scene, or the million other topical references. Its like a post-graduate seminar on cold war Berlin. And if that ain't enough, remember "Good-Bye Lenin?" Their Coca-Cola scene is an outright homage, right down to the Building the "new' movie chose as Coke's Berlin headquarters. Look familiar?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece of Billy Wilder,but not timeless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As usual,I don't want to write much about the story of this movie,because others have done that more than enough.The title of this movie-"one,two,three"-reminds you (surely not accidental) of military and let's you assume that this movie has a brisk tempo.After having watched this movie you will know that this assumption was fully justified! James Cagney is playing the choleric manager McNamara outstandingly.His play strongly reminds me of the French actor Louis de Funes,who played choleric characters so often and so convincingly.Also the other characters give a very good performance.The ever-obedient and submissive Schlemmer (Hans Lothar),the fanatic East German communist Otto Piffl (Horst Buchholz),Mc Namaras sexy secretary Fraulein Ingeborg (Liselotte Pulver),Mc Namaras sarcastic wife Phyllis (Arlene Francis),the members of the Soviet delegation...Yes,and also Pamela Tiffin.She played the "silly goose" Scarlett Hezeltine (the daughter of McNamaras boss in Atlanta),and she played her convincingly.Yes,some might not like this character,but that only proves that convincing play.I read that in the original English version she speaks with a deep southern accent,which,I presume,shall underline her character as a silly goose.Maybe that's why some people don't like Pamela Tiffin in this movie.But that's an internal matter of the U.S.I should say that in the German version of "one,two,three" the East German policemen speak with a Saxonian dialect,although the whole story takes place in Berlin and the policemen would be likely to speak the local dialect "Berlinerisch".Their Saxon dialect is a clear allusion to Walter Ulbricht,the East German political leader at that time,who spoke with a strong Saxon dialect.What concerns the national stereotypes in this movie: Yes,they are rather dumb for today.By the way,when laughing about the German's obedience in this movie you should be aware that West-Berlin (as well as East Berlin,of course) until 1990 was,different from West-Germany,a pure military regime,where,in principle,the allied commanders had nearly absolute power and the right to decide about everything (in practise the only did it if they saw a need,of course): Who had the right to enter West-Berlin,whether a hill could be used for military purposes etc. McNamaras reaction to the refusal of the West Berlin senate allowing a coca-cola vending machine in their building is an allusion to that...But don't forget that this movie is from 1961 and at that time the end of the war was only 16 and "Stalins" death only 8 years ago! And don't forget Billy Wilders personal biography.And don't forget,how,for example,South eastern Asians were portrayed in Hollywood at that time (Oh,God...)And especially-don't forget that this movie was made during the cold war.During the making of "one,two,three" unfortunately the Berlin Wall was erected (the movie mentions that at the beginning) This and all the ensuing personal tragedies surely didn't help promote this movie,and the dangerous showdown between U.S. tanks and Soviet tanks at the newly erected wall two months later eroded the interest in a parody of the cold war.To expect the people in Germany (and elsewhere) to laugh about "one,two,three" at the time the movie was released (end of 1961) is like to expect people in the U.S. and elsewhere laugh about a movie making jokes of Islamist terrorism at the end of 2001,shortly after 9/11.And don't forget,the horrific Cuban crisis was approaching in 1962.That's the reason,why "one,two,three" is not timeless.I think it's really difficult for younger people putting themselves into its atmosphere,to understand its countless allusions etc. without having experienced the cold war.At least you should have some basic knowledge about the political situation at that time,especially the one in Berlin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wilder's satire strikes again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billy Wilder is well-known of his comedies and his satire, which usually strikes to Soviet Union's communism, western capitalism, materialism.. And the only right ideology to Wilder is humanism, which he seems to be telling to us through many of his movies.First this movie became a flop, because it was banned until the Berlin Wall collapsed. And after that people didn't find the subject very amusing anymore. What I know is that this movie was banned in many countries for years. Reasons in the eastern Europe were mostly that it was too anti-soviet.And the reason what makes this movie so great, and most pictures by Wilder. Is that the movie has a great message, Wilder's satire is brilliant, good casting, good writing and the film's basis is strong.This movie is like a non-stop laughter. It just keeps going on and on. As someone already said here, there's just a great line after another. I also think this is James Cagney's best performance.I just can't tell how great this is by words; Delightful, funny, political, serious, crazy! Actually that's what this movie is, crazy, everything seems incredibly absurd in this picture and I think that's the way for Wilder to deal with this issue.Highly recommended to everyone!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great all-time comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best comedies of all time, with Billy Wilder and James Cagney at their absolute best. While there was much contention and arguing behind the scenes, none of it came forward. In fact, the bitter dislike of Horst Buchholz by Cagney aided Cagney in his attitude toward Buchholz's character.The Plot: A Coca-Cola exec (James Cagney) in pre-wall Berlin is asked by his boss to watch his "virtuous" daughter, who turns out to be quite the flirtatious vixen. After 6 weeks, it is discovered that, not only has the daughter been sneaking out, she has secretly married a young German communist (Buchholz) from East Berlin, and she is pregnant. To make matters worse, the girl's parents phone and announce they are coming to Berlin the next day. James Cagney's character has just 24 hours to set everything to right and transform the revolutionary into the ordinary.Amid this is a terrific send up of mid Cold-War politics and some hilarious characters as everyone scrambles to fix not only the girl's problem, but Cagney's marriage and life as well.There is no true weak spot in this story, other than the age of the girl (17 in the story... marriage and pregnancy for this age might be a bit less acceptable today. Buchholz is wonderful, and steals many scenes (much to Cagney's chagrin), but the cast hold its own all the way through.Even if one doesn't understand all the cold war references, it is still a fast-paced hilarious movie with more laughs than any modern comedies, with typical understated Billy Wilder human observations.Definitely a great movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loads an Astronomical Punch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the movies that renewed my love for Billy Wilder. I had seen The Lost Weekend, Stalag 17, The Apartment and The Seven Year Itch all in a lump two or three years before, but in the interim had discovered Wyler, Stevens and Lang, fellow directors from Wilder's era whose work on average proved superior to his. But after revisiting him through some of his later comedies, I have found that Wilder will always hold his place with those other three, because his talent as a director of actors, his matchless briskness of pace through dialogue and forces within a frame and his gift for telling a perfectly satisfying story, having been a screenwriter as much as a director, he knew how to make a light-hearted film hit you with a bang rather than leave you to forget all about it half an hour after watching it. He draws you in, ties you up in the dizzying histrionics, and once you're locked in he sends the roller-coaster zooming down the tracks.I'm going to have to buckle down and confess that Jimmy Cagney has never before been at the fore in my purview of silver-screen Hollywood cinema. I've always recalled him as a good actor since seeing him in Public Enemy and Yankee Doodle Dandy as a kid, and I was savvy with the film's meta-references to both, including the use of a Cuckoo Clock that plays Yankee Doodle Dandy, complete with Uncle Sam with an American flag in his hand that pops out. But here, as an older, chubbier man making some kind of comeback, I am in awe of Cagney's energy and timing in this wildly audacious movie. You can clearly see the bitter fatigue in his face in the film's closing shot. His character, MacNamara, is a high-ranking executive in the Coca-Cola Company, assigned to West Berlin after a past business debacle about which he is still bitter. After manipulating a compromise to bring Coke across the Iron Curtain, he gets a call from his boss. The boss's impassioned 17-year-old daughter is coming to Berlin, and MacNamara undergoes the undesired strain of taking care of this young ram.Amidst all deserved recognition for the rest of the cast, all of whom are genuinely worthy, such as the voluptuously sexy Lilo Pulver as a German secretary whose curves Wilder is not afraid to bring to attention, Pamela Tiffin, a new young beauty, as the daughter, Horst Buchholz as her East Berlin socialist love interest, Leon Askin as a Communist flunky, and myriad more, the weight is carried by Cagney, who is nonetheless a good three quarters plus of the pageantry. His wife, played by a remarkably natural Arlene Francis, hates his nationalistic capitalist guts almost as much as the commie his boss's daughter intends to marry. He knows all the ways of beating the Black Hand nature of business and has no shame in it. He is mercilessly enterprising and unabashed, recklessly shrewd and articulate. He makes you have such doubts about his intentions, but he also makes you laugh with him. And that's essentially the disposition of the movie. It is one with which you can laugh, with its own crassness toward foreign crises, while laughing at its raucous whirling clowning, in the debris of which can be seen a Cagney impression by Red Buttons. Cagney also alludes to his peer Edward G. Robinson by using his line "Mother of Mercy, is this the end of Rico?" from Little Caesar, which was an accompanying challenge to Public Enemy.Wilder's eighteenth movie as a director is a piercing, lightning-quick, vigorous yet jolly pratfall sitcom brimming with political witticisms and flavored with incisive inferences. Despite its frank and instinctive black-and-white cinematography, the script's theatricality is thrown in our faces, having been adapted from a Hungarian play of all things. The story is so strenuously agile that some of its acuity gets choked and entangled in moment-to-moment shingles. But all things considered, the overall experience loads an astronomical punch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>funny capitalist vs. commie comedy, but wouldn't be as good without Cagney</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The script for One, Two, Three must have been a lot of fun to write. It's a screenplay that's loaded with such an awesome level of cleverness by Wilder and Diamond that I wonder if maybe they went a little overboard with it. I don't mean that they went too far with making an absurd movie, and in fact one of the joys of the film is how completely over the top and crazy it is. But for all the laughing I had watching the film it wasn't a total knockout. It's the kind of comedy that is funny, but maybe knows it's being too funny at times, and perhaps thinks its funnier, if only in some small parts, than it actually is. When it comes to comedies or satires dealing with East vs West and Capitalism vs. Communism, I'd probably go first for Dr. Strangelove (even if that is more about nuclear annihilation anything in that involving "Communist infiltration" or Russians is totally golden).This isn't to totally decry One, Two Three, far from it. It's a near-classic that when you just tell the premise to someone - a Coca-Cola executive in West Berlin in 1961 with a fast mouth has to contend with the Atlanta bosses' super-Capitalist-bourgeois daughter coming to town and marrying/getting impregnated by a proto-typical proletariat Otto and after trying to break off the marriage and put him in jail gets him out again, grooms him to be a Coca-Cola engineer, in 24 hours time - it's funny in and of itself. But while most of the actors are on one wavelength of speed as a quasi-screwball satire, the star James Cagney takes it somewhere else. While Cagney might not be the single funniest thing about the movie he's certainly the highlight, talking at a speed in some scenes like he might explode at any second with hardcore leadership and meddling with things like marriage annulments and newspaper headlines, all for his character's possible promotion to the London office.In fact, if for nothing else Cagney makes One, Two, Three a must-see of comic timing and total nuttiness. Anything that might seem too obvious, well, is, from the Russian execs and/or turn-coats or whatever to Cagney's assistant who clicks his heels every time he leaves the room ala Nazi soldier, to the sexy secretary who will get "fringe benefits" to stay on, to the lovely couple of Otto (name is the same spelled backwards!) and his Coca-Cola capitalist wife, nothing is too out of game for Wilder to tackle, which is something awe-inspiring. Some of it almost just silly, and occasionally almost stagy since it was based on a play, but there's enough laughs and pure manic energy to go around that you wont want to miss it if you're any kind of fan of the director or star, who for him must have drained the life out of him by the end of filming. 8.5/10</fullReview>

She promptly marries a very ornery communist. To call this film's pacing rapid would be an understatement...it's machine gun paced. Wilder (and I.A.L. Diamond) have written a film so rich in character &amp; one-liners it's a real marvel. Cagney is brilliant and Wilder surrounds him with a very strong supporting cast including Pamela Tiffin, Horst Bucholz, Lilo Pulver and Arlene Francis. Cagney spars verbally with each of them and with varying degrees of success. Tiffin is a very funny mix of Scarlett O'Hara and Ann-Margret. Pulver, as Cagney's not so long suffering secretary, is priceless and Francis has many of the film's most acidic dialog. Only a cameo by Red Buttons slows the film down (and even that's only for a few minutes). Hysterical!</fullReview>

Snap.One Two Three is quick snappy full of good laughs, and an unforgettable experience. One hardly has time to consider what's being said or what it might mean.The plot is straightforward. A Coca Cola executive (James Cagney) is asked to baby-sit his boss' daughter (Pamela Tiffen) who is a flaky and slightly boy crazy southern bell who knows nothing about the world beyond her country club Cosmopolitan values. She is always engaged to someone and as she comes to Berlin, she sees nothing wrong with the prospect of dating someone who is "cute." Since there is no one in West Berlin who she would consider cute and male, she secretly goes to East Berlin and finds Horst Buchholtz a card carrying East German Communist and proud of it.The joy of this movie comes from watching Jimmy Cagney first try to annul the ensuing marriage and then when he discovers she's pregnant. The father is our card-carrying red, who loves her, but knows nothing about her or her values.She's no dummy. She knows how to seduce him or she knows how he could be seduced. Being the daughter of someone who could confer many shares of Coca Cola plus the 10000 she already owns is no small consideration. Though he struggles to resist what she offers ultimately he fails.Horst Buchholtz is not James Cagney and therefore does not come off as well. It is really all Cagney. Nobody does that rapid-fire staccato dialog the way he does. It's a great movie well worth the 10 I give it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lots of Laughs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Missed this great comedy starring James Cagney, (C R MacNamara) who is an executive in Berlin for the Coca Cola Company and he has his wife Phyllis MacNamara, (Arline Francis), "What's my Line" TV series. The cold war is going on between West Germany and East Germany which is communist occupied by the USSR. MacNamara has been informed that his boss wants him to keep an eye on his daughter who is a seventeen year old teenage who is going to visit Germany and he does not want her to marry a communist boyfriend from East Germany. As soon as this teenager arrives the film goes into a complete wild scene of excitement. This comedy never stops and goes at a very fast pace and the acting and fast lines being thrown around by all the actors is outstanding. MacNamara also has a rather sexy secretary named Fraulein Ingeborg, (Liselotte Pulver) and the film does indicate that this gal is having an affair with MacNamara. If you have never seen this film, you are in for a big surprise and especially the way James Cagney steals the show along with a few supporting actors. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny movie, but with a serious side too</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This one of Billy Wilder's better movies, which is saying a lot since most of Mr. Wilder's movies are great. James Cagney gives one of his greatest performances and Horst Bochholz was great too. The dialogue is witty and snappy and the action is nonstop. But alas, time relentlessly marches on and has left this movie behind in its wake. The movie is dated and for one reason: the political landscape has so radically changed since this movie's release in 1961 that all the material that would have been relevant to a 1961 audience mean little if anything today. But then again, this movie provides an excellent glimpse into the the situation in Europe at that the time, with Berlin and Germany divided, which was definitely not funny. For the story is set in a location that was a point of contention between East and West for over four decades and which almost caused a war. Of course, this movie had nothing to do with creating that situation. It just that when you watch Mr. Cagney's shenanigan's and Mr. Buchholz's character whining and complaining, don't forget that for many, a divided Berlin and Germany was anything but a joke.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say I am a novice within this group. I watched the movie for the first time this summer. DVD lent to me by a German friend in Moscow so that I had something to watch on my long flight on Aeroflot - Moscow to Seoul. (I was the weird one on the plane laughing and hurting in my guts all the way to Seoul) I must say it was the funniest, zaniest movie I have ever seen and I have not stopped recommending it all - people I know and some I don't know. This was the best post WWII movie I have ever seen. Casablanca does not count since it was during the WWII. I m really glad so many here paid so much attention to the details. I m planning to get my own DVD so that I can watch it again and yet again. (I never noticed the changes in the Hotel name nor the picture in the frame)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would have given this movie ten stars if it hadn't been so one-sided. But otherwise, it's a hoot. C.R. MacNamara (James Cagney) is a Coca-Cola executive stationed in Berlin at about the time when the Wall goes up. He and his family have it made, but there is always bound to be something unfulfilling about the corporate life. To add to the drudgery, C.R. now has to look after his boss' daughter Scarlett (Pamela Tiffin). Just when it looks like things couldn't get any wackier, Scarlett announces to C.R. that she's pregnant and marrying East German scientist Otto Piffl (Horst Buchholz). Otto seems pretty normal at first, but when C.R. learns that he's more Communist than Lenin or Marx, things really get turned upside down.Basically, according to "One, Two, Three", the Western Bloc can be summed up by corporate products, while the Eastern Bloc can be summed up by faulty technology. Overall, the movie is slightly more pro-Western, but it does cast corporations negatively. And C.R.'s secretary Ingeborg (Lilo Pulver) was...well, let's just say ZOWIE!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Indeed, things go better with Coke. Open Happiness with this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd like to buy the world a Coke. I'd like to teach the World to Sing (In Perfect Harmony) isn't what this movie is about. One, Two, Three is a cold war comedy film directed/written by Billy Wilder that makes fun of the Cold War tension. Supposedly, based on the 1929 Hungarian one-act play Egy, kett&#x151;, három by Ferenc Molnar, the movie has little to do with Molnar's source material, as Wilder add his own touch to the script. In many ways, Wilder borrow plot elements from his earlier films such as 1939 "Ninotchka', 1954's Sabrina, and others to get this movie, off the ground. Set in West Berlin during the Cold War, before the construction of the Berlin Wall, a high-ranking executive in the Coca-Cola Company, C.R. "Mac" MacNamara (James Cagney) is trying to introduce Coca Cola Operations into the Soviet Union; only for it to backlash, when an upper management, hot-blooded 17 year old daughter, Scarlett Hazeltine (Pamela Tiffin), his family was babysitting, fall in love with a young Communist extremist named Otto (Horst Buchholz). The film is known for its quick pace deliver of lines and action, and it shown with its writing and the music, it does use. Great use of the music from Aram Khachaturian, 'Sabre Dance'. You really get how energetic action, the movie will be. "Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini" during the interrogation scene was also hilarious. The movie also have clever sexual innuendos as you can tell that the conservative 1950s were ending, and the hip 1960s was about to start. The movie has a lot of politics about life as a communist, and capitalist. All of the jokes were mostly hit than miss for me. One joke even seeming to foreshadow, oncoming the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962. The film also had a lot of inside jokes or references from a lot of James Cagney earlier films such as 1942's Yankee Doodle Dandy, 1931's Public Enemy and others. There also a joke about Cagney, himself with the whole idea of sent the money to unemployed cotton pickers of Mississippi. Cagney was accused of being a communist sympathizer for sending money to striking cotton workers in the 1930's. You can really see, how much work, the middle age James Cagney put into the film with his character. Billy Wilder feed him with so many lines that needed to be spoken in a fast pace, that he got overwhelm by the pressure. Add that with his declining health, Cagney decide to quit Hollywood for years after this film. It would be Cagney's last film appearance until 1981's Ragtime, 20 years later. Cagney during the production, had a hard relationship with co-star, Horst Buchholtz, as both of them openly disliked each other. Cagney believe that Horst Buchholz was overacting and scene stealing. While, Horst Buchholtz believe that Cagney was just being a big bully during the making of this film. In my opinion, I think Horst Buchholtz did a good job, and I think Cagney might overreacting to what Horst's character was saying, than the actor. The rest of the supporting cast was alright. Arlene Francis as Phyllis MacNamara got some great one liners, but somewhat comes off as too mean-spirited. Pamela Tiffin was indeed very attractive, but the badly done Southern drawl was bit nail-biting. The production also went through another trouble as locations had to be reshot due to the building of the Berlin Wall, and the crisis that was happening there. The crew and cast had to move to Munich to shoot the missing scenes. The building of the Berlin Wall during production badly hurt the film's marketing in Germany. It was very ill-received by German audiences and had minimal success during its initial run. The film does portray the Germans in a negative light. Still, I have to say, characters like Schlemmer (Hanns Lothar) &amp; Fräulein Ingeborg (Liselotte Pulver) really did stood out. They really have some funny and sexy moments in the film. Another reason, why the Germans didn't like the film was because of Coca Cola. Coca Cola has a long love and hate relationship with Germany. Germany once banned sodas, as they deemed unsuitable for children due to its sugar content and additives. Also, they didn't want it to interference with the beer market that most adults drink at the time. Coca-Cola also adopted an apparent policy of ignoring the practice of eugenics and anti-Semitism by Nazi Germany. By the time, the Cold War came, Coke, took deep advantage of the situation by establishing new franchises in the newly liberated countries where many Germans saw as a threat to their culture. About the movie being about Coca Cola, it didn't hurt the film with its product placement. I didn't mind all the product placement, as long, as it felt like a movie, than a commercial. A few people did hatred that Coke was in the film, like actress Joan Crawford, whom at the time, was a board member of Pepsi. In an odd way, Coke was deem 'too American' for Communists, and Pepsi became the main exported soft drink to Eastern Europe for much of the Cold War after this film. The film was indeed banned from most Eastern European countries. One, Two, Three was even banned in Finland in 1962?1986 on "political" grounds ? it was feared that the film would harm the relations between Finland and the Soviet Union. Overall: It's a very hot Cold War movie. A must-watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One, Two, Three on Reel 13</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be honest, I hadn't even heard of ONE, TWO, THREE before I saw the trailer on YouTube (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOiDKpNqOE4&amp;feature=user) for its airing on Reel 13 this past Saturday. It's easy to see, though, how the film got lost in the shuffle of time in spite of its big names (James Cagney and Billy Wilder). Its broad comedy style feels very dated and probably foreign to most modern audiences. Similarly, its political references to Cold War issues and sentiments (How many do you think got the reference when one of the Russian characters started to bang his shoe on a table?), which feature prominently in the plot, don't have the resonance they would have had back then.The film takes place in 1961, the year of its release, and features James Cagney as the head of the Germany branch of Coca-Cola. The plot starts to unfold when his boss ? the CEO of Coke ? asks Cagney to look after his daughter during her trip to Berlin. The daughter (Pamela Tiffin) is an unruly (and dim) Southern belle who gets herself into trouble when she gets involved with a Communist from the wrong side of the Berlin Wall. And it's up to the resourceful Cagney to bail her out (in order to save his own job).The deft hand of Wilder counterbalances the potential corniness of the plot. In the world he creates, most of the events that transpire seem plausible, in spite of some of the conveniences. It all fits within the style. I only wish some of the supporting characters were a little more drawn out. Tiffin doesn't have much to work with at all, which is problematic, because the daughter character is the catalyst. Her Communist lover is a little more three-dimensional on the page, but is unfortunately played by Horst Buchholz, who is as equally bad here as he was in THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN. It's Cagney, though, that is the real engine of the film. His machine gun delivery is in perfect alignment with the verbose and fast-paced screenplay. His energy and presence are the foundation for all the things that make the film work.At times, the film feels like a sitcom. Some of the wacky plot coincidences are something you might see on THREE'S COMPANY or SEINFELD. It also reminded me of some other Wilder films like THE SEVEN YEAR ITCH and THE FORTUNE COOKIE in the sense that they never seem to be able to escape their theatricality - One, Two, Three was based on a play and I imagine it would be riotous on stage. On screen, though, about a quarter of the jokes fall flat because successful comedy films move at a different rhythm that they do in theater. Another quarter of the jokes are dead air because they are references to things that are lost on modern audiences.The remaining half, however, work anywhere anytime and most of the belly laughs in the film, in true keeping with the tradition of farce, come in the zany final act. For most of the film, I felt detached, bored and a little put off by the silliness of the style and the borderline offensive xenophobia (the film is plays up on archaic stereotypes of both Russians and Germans). In the last thirty minutes, however, Comedy General Cagney leads his troops in a race against the clock where all kinds of mayhem ensues. Several story lines intersect with each other and work toward satisfying resolution with breakneck speed. It takes ONE, TWO, THREE about an hour to really get moving, which is probably way too long, but given there are moments of the film that still make me laugh days later, I almost wonder if it wasn't worth the wait.(For more information on this film or any other Reel 13 film, check out their website at www.reel13.org)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The plane is arriving at noon tomorrow?.. Unless those damned commies shoot it down!" This is how Wendell P. Hazeltine, the boss of Coca Cola announces the arrival of his daughter Scarlett in Berlin. The commies did not. They shot Billy Wilders film down instead. They erected the Berlin Wall just as the film was finished. From one minute to another it wasn't funny anymore. It was just embarrassing. So this movie was a Box Office Disaster, in Germany even more than in the US."What tears our hearts apart, Mr. Wilder thinks it's funny" a German newspaper wrote. Like a sarcastic comedy about the New York fire fighters, released at September 12th 2001? Even though Wilder himself always refused to use this unexpected political incident as an excuse, "One, Two, Three" is probably the most undeserved failure in film history, because this movie is one of the most hilarious comedies ever made.C.R. Mc Namara is the head of the Coca Cola plant in West Berlin. The President of the Company sends him his 17 year old daughter Scarlett for vacation, to make her forget all these pimpled boys she used to fall in love with every other day. And what happens? In Berlin she fells in love with a young communist from East Germany and gets instantly pregnant. When her parents announce their arrival in Berlin, C.R. Mc Namara has only one chance: he's got to change this young fanatic idealist within three hours into a perfect capitalist son-in-law.Decades later, the movie was re-released in Germany and with the distance of 25 years especially young people just loved it. Probably it's because Wilder ridicules everybody. The Germans, the Russian and the Americans, the communists and the capitalists, employers and workers, men and women, everybody gets what he deserves. So the sarcasm of Wilders jokes seems even fair. Nobody is perfect ? let's have fun with it.James Cagney, known as the ultimate gangster of the black movies, shows his great comedy talent in the choleric character of C.R. Mc Namara. Some of the German cast, particularly supporting actors with their heavy German accent, make their best appearance on screen ever. The exaggerated acting and the breathtaking speed is intentionally and gives the story an extra thrill.You still can feel what Wilder called "the Lubitsch touch". The running gag with clicking heals for instance is a reminiscence of the dumb Nazis in "To be or not to be" the three Russian commissars of trade are inspired of "Ninotchka".It's fast paced, it's funny it's great. For me it's the second best comedy of the last century. Only "Some like it hot" is a little bit ahead, only because it got more sex appeal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Billy Wilder Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was a pity that they made the picture just when the Berlin Wall was built up. Although it is a very good example of comedy. And also of what the Americans thought about the Germans those days. But it is one of the rare movies that's giving you fun every minute. Just enjoy and think about what Billy Wilder might have thought ... The actors are the best that could be found those days, especially Liselotte Pulver as the secretary of the CocaCola president in Berlin. Also Horst Buchholz as young communist and the unforgettable Karl Lieffen as chauffeur Fritz. The situation in 61 was that bad that this picture was a real flop, but nowadays it's cult. So watch it if you can, and also all other Billy Wilder movies, cause he's one of the best directors that Germany lost because of it's dark years between 33 and 45. For the German viewers of nowadays it's extremely funny to see Fritz clack his heels and to hear James Cagney telling his employees "sitzen machen". That's not the way our companies are run today, but funny to see what Wilder thought in 61 how it was then. So just watch it if you can!</fullReview>

James Cagney had along and varied career, from Yankee Doodle Dandy to Mr Roberts and more but this performance of his is just the best.Today directors use lots of cuts and different angles to tell the story, i am not a particular fan of this style most of the time. If you have an actor on screen of Cagney's stature you want him to take control of the screen and captivate the audience and this Cagney does in this movie. The long dialog and great delivery is reminiscent of a stage production. Just amazing.</fullReview>

James Cagney proved that he had a flare for comedy and showed that he was one of the greatest all around actors in the history of film. Too bad that right after he made this film he decided to retire from films for 20 years. Horst Buchholz also showed that he had a flare for comedy. Too bad he was perceived as trying to upstage Cagney because the two of them showed that they had great chemistry. Also, Arlene Francis gave a good performance as Mrs. MacNamara. She definitely proved that she was a great actress and if it wasn't for her commitment to "What's My Line?" she might have more roles as far as Hollywood was concerned.

		<shortDescription>Manic comedy taken to all new heights!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One, Two, Three is relentless comedy at it's very finest. Just as you think that nothing else could possibly happen, Wilder introduces something else and then something else and then, just when it couldn't be any more manic; something else happens! The film follows this formula for it's duration, and it's all much to the dismay of James Cagney's character, C.R. MacNamara. The plot follows MacNamara, an employee for the Coca Cola Company in West Berlin, who is lucky enough to get entrusted with the job of looking after his boss' daughter. However, while in his care; the naive seventeen year old travels to East Berlin, where she marries a communist, much to the dismay of our hero, himself (and his boss) a devout capitalist. Things take a turn for the worse (it happens a lot in this film) when the boss decides to come back to West Berlin to pick up his daughter, meaning that MacNamara now has to do all in his power to hide this marriage from the girl's father as his job may be on the line! But things get worse when...ah, that would be telling.Despite being a farcical comedy, this film has a more than obvious commentary on the cold war and the relations between the capitalist West and the Communist East. The commentary is more geared up towards the Western side of the hemisphere, which wont come as a surprise to anyone, but as this is a farce; it's hard to tell whether or not Wilder is being entirely serious in his appraisal of capitalism. My guess, to be honest, is not. Not all of the jokes in this film work, but none of them bomb terribly. The film isn't very witty on the whole, and tends to rely on quick delivered dialogue that emits from it's quick fire sequences that follow on from one another in quick succession. This is a fine style of comedy, but it can get a bit tiresome after a while - and it does, which makes that point one of the few bad things about the film. It also uses a lot of visual gags, which I'm too big a fan of. The jokes that do work, however, are hilarious and some parts of the movie are among Wilder's all time best. The film also benefits from a great score, that's funny on it's own, but even funnier when intertwined with the manic pace of the film.As mentioned, James Cagney takes the lead role. Cagney was great in White Heat, but to be honest, I haven't seen much else of him. Here, although he's not as brilliant as Jack Lemmon (but who is?), he does fine in his role. His comic timing is good enough, and the fact that he had the patience to put up with some of the goings on in this film deserves a standing ovation. I was knackered by the time the 'The End' flashed up on screen, and I was only watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rapid-Fire Dialogue, James Cagney, and Cold War Characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One critic nominated "The President's Analyst", and "Dr. Strangelove" as the funniest 'cold war" comedies (1950--1991). I would add "The Russians Are Coming, The Russians Are Coming" and the present film, "One, Two Three". The piece was adapted from a Ferrenc Molnar comedy "Egy, Ketto, Harom", the same title in Magyar. With his partner I.A.L. Diamond, Billy Wilder adapted the play to film, to feature a harried and high-powered U.S. Coca Cola executive, Macnamara, played powerfully by James Cagney, in search of a marketing coup. He wants to open up the Soviet Union to Coke, knowing it will easily outsell its putrid rival, Kremlin Cola. To accomplish the opening up of the Soviet Empire to corporate pseudo-capitalism and the big rubles, he has been wooing three commissars (lifted from Wilder's "Ninotchka"). He also has a sexy secretary played by lovely Liselotte Pulver, about whom his U.S.-based wife, Arlene Francis, knows nothing, whom he is anxious to please. But on the verge of success with his coup--gained by giving up the secretary to work under the commissars in return for them giving him the business--his magnum opus is torpedoed by the arrival of his Boss's daughter. He is to chaperone her, keep her from harm or worse. The "or worse" turns out to be Otto Ludwig Piffl, a noisy and anti-USer radical with long hair (Horst Bucholz), who secretly marries the Southern-belle hippie daughter (Pamela Tiffin) after she escapes scrutiny long enough to become a disaster in the making. This leaves Macnamara only one way to save the situation: he must turn Piffl into something presentable. The ironic ending will leave you laughing as hard as I did when I first saw this very original comedy, notable for its satirical rapid-fire dialogue, its effervescent characters and its jaundiced look at the ethically-challenged best of both sides in the Cold War.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Indefatigable Cagney Pulls All the Stops in a Frenetic Cold War Relic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A genuine Cold War relic, this frenetic 1961 comedy is the film that master director Billy Wilder made right after two genuine classics, "Some Like It Hot" and "The Apartment". While it's not nearly in that league, the 61-year-old James Cagney is in top fighting form as ever-resourceful C.R. MacNamara, the head of Coca-Cola's West Berlin plant. The pugnacious screen legend went into a two-decade-long retirement after making this film which pointedly satirizes both American capitalism and Russian communism. He makes the film watchable but not necessarily essential since this sitcom-level rehash of "Ninotchka" (which Wilder co-wrote with Charles Brackett) doesn't really resonate now as much as it did when the Berlin Wall was hastily built despite all the obvious sweat in the effort. Despite the scabrous political rhetoric and Wilder's unmistakable mark, it all feels more like a period piece along the lines of a Keystone Kops comedy or Stanley Kramer's "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World".Co-written by Wilder and his constant partner I.A.L. Diamond based on a one-act play by Ferenc Molnar, the story has MacNamara discovering that his Atlanta-based boss is shipping out his promiscuous seventeen-year-old daughter Scarlett for the summer. A family man with an exasperated wife and two kids, MacNamara is forced to cancel a long-planned vacation to Venice to baby-sit the Southern belle. However, before he knows it, Scarlett has become Mrs. Otto Ludwig Piffl, the wife of a die-hard Bolshevik. In the middle of brokering a deal to open a Coca-Cola plant in the Soviet Union, MacNamara contrives to get rid of Otto by having him get picked up by the secret police in East Berlin where he is tortured by the repeated playing of "Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka-Dot Bikini". However, complications ensue when it is discovered that Scarlett is pregnant, which means MacNamara needs to retrieve Otto pronto and convert him into a capitalist just in time for the arrival of Scarlett's ultra-conservative parents.The indefatigable Cagney is really the whole show here as he single-handedly accelerates an addled screwball comedy into a free-for-all farce on hyper-drive. His showpiece is a ten-minute segment where he barks orders to his staff in machine-gun fashion to get Otto cleaned up and groomed for Scarlett's parents. Horst Buchholz ("Fanny") - whom both Cagney and Wilder detested during filming - is appropriately didactic as Otto, while the long-forgotten Pamela Tiffin ("Harper") plays the bubble-headed Scarlett with surprising élan. Effective on the sidelines are Lilo Pulver as the sexpot secretary, Hanns Lothar as the heel-clicking assistant, Arlene Francis as MacNamara's wisecracking wife, and in a cameo, Red Buttons as an MP not above doing a Cagney impression in front of the master. However, they all appear understandably overwhelmed by Cagney's all-cylinders-on presence. Composer André Previn orchestrated the music score which makes maximum comic use of Khachaturian's "Sabre Dance". The 2003 DVD offers the original theatrical trailer as its sole extra.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you like to witness Jimmy Cagney being constantly on the brink of a heart-seizure AND a nervous breakdown for almost two hours, this is the right place. To cast an ageing actor best known for playing gangster-types in the role of a Coca-Cola exec is a good joke in itself. But it's surely not the only scoring off of Western capitalism (and of Eastern communism) in this hectic Cold War farce.Some, one is inclined to say: too much of the (still funny) one-liners are downright silly, which deprives Wilder's movie of any possible satirical leanings, and the whole affair comes across as rather strident, but the ensemble cast is first-rate and the whole manic enterprise is over before you can even start grasping at what you didn't like about it.7 out of 10 Pepsi vending machines</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed it from the first to the last minute. I am no fan of Coca Cola nor too enthusiastic about American imperialism. But this kind of import - kindly supported by Germans (in the German version the German actors speak their own roles ) is welcome. It ridicules about everybody and everything. Some do not like Billy Wilder Commedies. Some do not like people that are shown in a much too sympathetic and philantropic way. Here You find this plus cynicism. A rare find. This comedy is an astonishing high-velocity-masterwork. This is very human, even the communists are likable. All are spoofed, the Americans, the Germans and the Russaians, East and West. I have no doubts that Shakespeare would have liked it (he was not that serious)Of course,this is far from reality. Why not! An exaggeration of exaggerations. Why not! The world is dull enough, let us laugh about it - sometimes! Just sit down, relax and have fun. Perfect entertainment, except for aliens and cranks and too serious people...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing Cagney performance in a film that has no resonance now.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>C.R. MacNamara is the head of Coca-Cola's bottling interests in Germany, he is a forceful man who wants to be all that he can be. He hopes to be the head of European operations for the company and is well on his way until the teenage daughter of Coca-Cola big wig Wendell P. Hazeltine shows up and he is asked to baby-sit her for a two week trip thru the continent.I wish I could have been around to watch this on its release in 1961, for I'm sure I would of laughed my head off at the relevant jokes of the time. Full of communist bluster dialogue and jokes in keeping with the times, One, Two, Three has all the trademarks of a classic Billy Wilder/I.A.L. Diamond picture. Yet viewing it now, one finds that the jokes are tired and weary, and although the frenetic pace of the film is incredible {it really is like a scattergun exploding upon the viewers senses}, the film is something of an archaic oddity. Boasting a quite brilliant performance from James Cagney, the picture is never less than watchable, but the advent of time means the film is stuck firmly in 1961, regardless of the fine work from lead man and director alike.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MacNamara's Brand</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've just read the first half dozen or so reviews of this gem on IMDb of which every one is a rave and I can only endorse these sentiments. Not that it is surprising to find a movie co-written and directed by Billy Wilder to be anything less than outstanding. This was the second time he had satirized Germany in a movie set in Berlin, the first, of course, the equally unforgettable 'A Foreign Affair', also shot on location and there's a fetching symmetry between the two; in 1947 Berlin was largely rubble in the wake of World War Two and in 1961 the rubble was still in evidence every time the characters cross from West to East Berlin. In a script spilling over with brilliant moments Wilder throws in several referential moments, an uncredited Red Buttons does a Cagney impression right to Cagney's character, Cagney emulates his classic 'grapefruit in the kisser' scene not to Mae Clark (who got the full benefit in 'Public Enemy') but to Horst Bucholtz (who, by all accounts, deserved much more), Cagney's character parodies a fellow Warner Bros actor, Eddie Robinson, in the line 'Mother of God, is this the end of Rico' (from 'Little Caesar'), when Cagney and Lilo Pulver enter the hotel in East Berlin the band leader is Frederich Hollander (who wrote 'Falling In Love Again' and 'See What The Boys In The Back Room Will Have', both associated with Marlene Dietrich, one of the stars of 'A Foreign Affair') and they are playing 'Yes, We Have No Bananas', which Wilder had featured in his 'Sabrina' in 1954, and so on. Like a lot of Wilder movies the source was an obscure (in the West) play by Hungarian Ferenc Molnar - author of 'Liliom' which Rodgers and Hammerstein turned into 'Carousel' - though the chances are Wilder and Izzy Diamond reworked it considerably. The plot has been detailed in other reviews so suffice it to say that Cagney is superb, Arlene Francis a nose in front of the rest of a brilliant cast. One, two, three, four, FIVE stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rapid-fire farce with a terrifically unflappable Cagney...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coca-Cola and the Cold War. Fast-talking fracas from screenwriters I.A.L. Diamond and Billy Wilder (who also directed), adapted from a play by Ferenc Molnár, about an American soda pop executive in West Germany assigned to look after the nubile daughter of his boss; almost immediately, things go awry once the lovestruck girl falls for a Russian and the executive runs into trouble with his East German shipments. Whether comically rattling off orders to his wife and staff or taking care of business manners in a slightly duplicitous manner, James Cagney is a hoot in the starring role; at the top of his game, and completely in the spirit of Wilder's screwball handling, Cagney has rarely been so wonderfully natty. The film begins on such a high-note, you may feel you've missed a reel; after the frenzied comedy has had time to soften, you may not want the picture to let up. It eventually does wear itself out, though the cast is uniformly excellent (especially Arlene Francis as Cagney's wife) and Daniel Fapp's Oscar-nominated cinematography is also first-rate. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw a really bizarre film yesterday, called One, Two, Three.Now considering it was written by I.A.L. Diamond and Billy Wilder what would we expect of this? It is a total farce, and 49 years later much of the contemporary references and humour seem as funny as a slap in the face with a wet fish. I was watching the film on a Saturday afternoon while doing something else, and it followed The Three Stooges Meet Hercules made the following year and at times it was hard to tell the difference, The film appears to treat all sides with the same vicious satire. East German Police are rude and suspicious and frame their own citizens as spies. The trade delegation from the Soviet Union are more interested in acquiring the main character's secretary than anything else. The main character - MacNamara as played by James Cagney - is a blatant capitalist who employs ex-Nazis and is willing to use deception to get what he wants. In fact when I was watching this, I kept thinking that it should have stared Cary Grant in this screwball comedy. Almost every character in the film is a caricature : MacNamara is the company man who who do anything to save his job; Otto Piffl (played by Horst Bucholz) is the arch communist spouting propaganda that gets transformed into a fake aristocrat.But does it work? A lot of the film seems awfully flat, whereas some scenes are still funny. I thought the chase scene (in the video segment above) was an overdone comment on East German Cars. Very hit and miss, this film</fullReview>

		<fullReview>James Cagney plays C.R. MacNamara--a Coca-Cola executive working in Berlin during the Cold War. The daughter (Pamela Tiffin) of a Cola executive is sent to him to take care of. She ends up (somehow) meeting and marrying communist Otto Ludwig Piffl (Horst Buchholz). And her parents are arriving in a few days. Cagney has to figure out a way to smooth things over.Frantic comedy going full blast. Jokes go flying left and right. The problem is they're either dated or just not funny. I almost turned this off after 20 minutes--I was just horrified at how stupid it was. But (slowly) it grew on me. There are plenty of eye-rolling groaners in this one but there are also some laugh-out loud funny gags. My favorite is when an MP does a Cagney impersonation to his face! The acting here is...interesting. Cagney is uncharacteristically frantic but pulls it off. Arlene Francis is actually very funny as his long suffering wife. Buchholz is VERY handsome but overacts to an embarrassing degree and yells his entire role. More than once I just wanted to gag him. Tiffin plays a straight person to all the jokes but pulls it off. Also there's excellent use of the "Sabre Dance" in this one. I did see it again a few months later and enjoyed it a LOT more. The dated jokes are now pretty funny and Cagney is just great. I guess I just had to get used to it. I've upped my rating from 6 to 8 also.It's worth seeing but you have to sit through some stale, stupid and dated jokes, pointless sexism (Cagney's secretary) and offensive German and Russian stereotypes. Cagney hated doing this film. He wasn't used to having to say his lines so quickly and (purportedly) one scene took 52 takes before he said it quickly enough to satisfy director Billy Wilder! Also he hated Buccholz (understandably). This was enough to make him retire from films until 1980s "Ragtime".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>C.R. MacNamara (James Cagney), is a Coca-Cola executive in West Berlin tasked with increasing sales behind the Iron curtain. His wife (Arlene Francis) is the best part of the whole movie. He is entrusted by his Atlanta head office boss with taking care of his out of control daughter, Scarlett (Pamela Tiffin - in her first movie role), who is hopping around Europe, recovering from a series of parent-broken engagements.Scarlett elopes with a Communist, (played by a constantly roaring Horst Buchholz, the most irritating presence in the entire movie). Madcap farce is reached with the imminent arrival of SCarlett's parents. MacNamara has to transform Scarlett's propaganda spouting husband into a capitalistic son-in-law in a matter of a few hours.The film is based on a play, and is very stagy as a result, it does not transform well. James Cagney gives it a great shot and carries the movie as he is in almost every scene and in that era, misogynistic to the extreme - even going so far as trading his mistress/secretary as part of a marketing deal.This will not be to everyone's taste the pace is relentless and many characters are too badly drawn, even for a comedy. But there are some interesting bits, not the least of which is an MP doing a Cagney riff and a doctor singing some Wagner.7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Count this Wilder comedy out.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billy Wilder begins to show his age with this heavy handed satire set in Berlin made during the cold war. Coco Cola exec CR MacNamara (James Cagney) has been pining for a promotion and transfer to London, he's even bought an umbrella. When his Atlanta boss sends his daughter Scarlet (Yes Scarlet from Atlanta) to stay with him and his family for two weeks MCNamara sees it as an opportunity to impress. Unfortunately the young lady has a wild streak and to make make matters worse falls for a Red in East Berlin. MacNamara rids himself of the boyfriend by sabotaging his return to the Eastern sector then has to collude with corrupt Communist officials to get him back when he finds out Scarlet and he are married and in a family way. Once they have him back Mac Namara's faced with the task of sanitizing him for capitalist consumption.One, Two Three is filled with tasteless humor, repetitive routine( clicking heels, entire office snapping to attention) and flaccid Commie mocking jabs that Wilder was more adept at in Ninotcka twenty years earlier. There seems to be more mean spirit than humor in the film as he takes tactless shots at Germans, Russians and Southerners while the story's pervasive chauvinism reeks of misogyny and bad burlesque. The slapstick is Keystone Cop, the screwball witless and archaic.Cagney shows more energy than the rest of the cast combined and remains out of synch with them most of the way. As wife Phyllis, Arlene Francis has little chemistry with him and there scenes together are flat. As the young lovers Horst Buchholz and Pamela Tiffin overact monstrously. Cagney' s stridency meanwhile wears thin as he races ahead of his co- stars and Wilder's plodding script.This was Wilder's follow-up to his acclaimed The Apartment. His last nine directorial efforts beginning with One,Two, Three would be mostly abysmal affairs with none approaching the glory days that began in the early 40s and led to a string of critically hailed films up and through the 50s. The times were a changin' though and Wilder's style became more forced, abrasive and out of touch. With One, Two, Three he was down for the count.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cagney miscast, Wilder off form and why is everyone shouting?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a massive Billy Wilder fan but count this as a rare mis-fire from one of Hollywood's greatest directors. It has the odd good one-liner, but the political satire is crude, the portrait of the Germans is so stereotypical it would get prosecuted under race hate laws these days and the pace is overly furious, so that you're left gasping for breath at the sheer pace of it all halfway through the film. Worse, it has little charm - Liselotte Pulver as the secretary is great, as are one or two of the German supporting cast, but Cagney is a long way off his best here and the film would have been redeemed if instead of Cagney Jack Lemmon had taken the lead - because Lemmon always had charm, even when he was barking his lines - see him in Avanti! if you don't believe me. This movie had the singular misfortune to be overtaken by historical events, as the slightly uncomfortable spoken prologue reveals: its comedy of east-west tension looked a little tasteless when the Soviets built the Berlin Wall between the start of shooting and its release in the cinemas. My least favourite Wilder movie, by a considerable margin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loud, obnoxious and jingoistic - certainly not among Wilder's best works</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Made in West Berlin while the Berlin Wall was being erected and dealing with the Cold War while it was escalating dramatically, there is no shortage of historical interest in this Billy Wilder comedy. However, as much as I don't want to be put into the position of defending the U.S.S.R., One, Two, Three comes off as painfully jingoistic and the same kind of propaganda that it itself is deriding. It's also guilty of being wildly obnoxious and loud in its comedy, which is, at best, hit or miss. James Cagney plays Coca-Cola's man in West Berlin, on the brink of getting the drink behind the Iron Curtain, for which he expects to get a promotion. His boss scoffs at the idea of commies drinking America's favorite beverage. A different possibility for promotion arrives when Cagney welcomes the boss's 17 year-old daughter (Pamela Tiffin) to stay with him and his family. If he does a good job, keeps her away from trouble, he could get out of Germany, whose population reminds him of the war with their boot clicking and militaristic habits (played as a joke, of course!). Unfortunately, Tiffin is kind of a tramp, and immediately sneaks through the Brandenburg Gate and marries a communist (Horst Buchholtz). Cagney is at his worst here. His character is a mean, petty, unlikeable jerk who yells and throws around his superiority to everyone else constantly. But as annoying as he is, he's nothing compared to Buchholtz, who spouts communist mantras and anti-American slogans at the top of his lungs every time his lips part. Yes, yes, Billy, we get it! He's indoctrinated! Now, please, hand me the aspirin! Add to those two the horribly lame wisecracks of Cagney's wife (Arlene Francis), and we have a triumvirate of the unfunny. The movie does have its pluses, of course. I thought Tiffin was hilarious (she's not offended at the "Yankee Go Home" balloons because where she comes from, Atlanta, everyone hates Yankees!), and I also liked the hot young secretary (Lisolette Pulver) with whom Cagney is having an affair (after the unsubtle sex of The Apartment, it's no longer believable that Cagney's not sleeping with this woman). I also liked the three Russian boobs with whom Cagney is negotiating. Perhaps the best scene in the movie is the one where Cagney tries to sell them Pulver by having her dance on a table in front of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes LESS is MORE.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just finished watching on PBS, for the very first time, a highly regarded movie comedy from 1961, "One, Two, Three". And I have a headache from it. A very quirky film. I have never seen its like.It was written and directed by Billy Wilder at his height of fame, he being one of the legends of screen writing and movie direction. He had just won huge acclaim for the classic and charming "The Apartment".Even after watching this the title is itself odd. If you look at IMDb the rating and written reviews are mostly glowing. And it is clever. No doubt the lovers of this film were the ones who wrote.BUT. . . although it is very well done it was like a movie on uppers. I was paying close attention and I felt like I was in a cyclone of jokes, many not good; a few hilarious. I did laugh out loud at Arlene Francis' character commenting on how she knew Cagney was having an affair because he started wearing his "elevator shoes".Jimmy Cagney (acting legend) headed a frenzied hyper cast delivering lines fast rat-a-tat like machine guns, and doing so at the top of their lungs. So much yelling. The jokes and apparent jokes and all the lines went flying by; you hardly knew when one ended and another began. And if something was funny if you laughed you'd miss the next line! :o And I had the volume way up.You get the idea. Somehow, it being in black and white didn't help.It was set in Berlin in 1961, just before the Berlin Wall went up, and the Cold War jokes had to be understood in historical context.It was good and well done, BUT. . . if ever there was an example of "Less is More" this is it. If Wilder removed a third of the jokes, especially the poorer ones and slowed the pace it would have worked better.How Cagney could deliver lengthy lines that loudly and fast I don't know, but he did. It was almost funny to see that alone; he was like some kind of crazed machine not a man in his sixties.Jeez. It was like the entire film was on heavy doses of caffeine.That thing lasted almost two hours, and it needed two intermissions for the audience to take a break! But it was good, sure. But I still have a headache trying to follow its frenetic pace.</fullReview>

But the film also, over a decade before 'The Godfather', shows how big business, gangsterism and fascism are connected, which it does by framing the film as a commentary on James Cagney's career, from liberal to conservative, from transgressive thug (in 'The Public Enemy' et al) to soft drinks executive. The film's famed narrative speed accurately embodies capitalism's bulldozing indefatigability. Patchy, but often hilarious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A rare misfire for Wilder, this is a loud, mildly amusing comedy about a Coca-Cola executive trying to keep his boss's daughter out of trouble in West Berlin. Cagney and Buchholz seem to be screaming at the top of their lungs throughout the film, as if the elevated volume equates with funnier dialog. The script by Wilder and Diamond lacks the bite usually associated with the duo. There are only a few chuckles, with Francis delivering the best lines as Cagney's long-suffering wife. It seems Wilder asked Pulver to impersonate Marilyn Monroe from "Some Like it Hot." Although Previn is credited for the music, he does little more than use Khachaturian's "Sabre Dance" incessantly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Obnoxiously Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A loud, painful Cold War farce directed with bludgeoning precision by Billy Wilder. The humor is as stale, obvious, and corny as you can get, and it is unfortunately delivered in an unrelenting stream by the actors, who blare their lines at an increasing volume as the film barrels on (this has to be the loudest movie I've ever seen). The film also has an underlying hostile tone and absolutely no likeable characters. It's ironic that "The Producers," another farce from a few years later, was considered more vulgar and in bad taste than this one; Mel Brooks's film also utilized dark historical themes for its humor, yet by comparison it is presented in a cheery, mirthful tone with endearingly off-the-wall characters.There are only two memorably funny moments: when a Berlin jeweler holding up a briefcase of his wares tries to get the attention of Cagney by saying, "Schmuck? Schmuck?" (which is the German word for jewelry); and when Red Buttons, in a cameo as a military policeman, breaks into a Cagney impersonation in front of Cagney. There are also some charming references to two much better films, "Public Enemy" and "Little Caesar."If you're looking for a broad farce in a similarly dark vein, see "The Producers" or "Duck Soup" instead; or if you want to see a good Wilder film, try "Double Indemnity" or "Sunset Boulevard," which are the most virtuosic examples of his famous jet-black cynicism that is unfortunately mishandled in "One, Two, Three."</fullReview>

All of the characters are two-dimensional caricatures which presumably pandered to the anti-communist dogma of the late 50s in the US, but now it is truly embarrassing. One has the feeling of thinly disguised political rhetoric under the superficial humour. I'm not a big fan of Wilder anyway, but this is by far the worst of his films that I've seen. The only thing in the film worth seeing is the scenery of Berlin before the Wall, although I'm told the Brandenburg gate was in fact a fake, constructed in Munich!</fullReview>

'Fell out of my seat laughing', 'witty', 'uproarious', etc. Well, it's uproarious in the sense that Cagney roars out most of his lines as if he were yelling them, unamplified, in the Berlin Olympic Stadium, and wanted to make sure those in the back rows could hear. And it's as witty as most Billy Wilder movies--not very, in my book. It's loud, vulgar in a very careful, 'inoffensive' way, and every 'topical' joke was recycled from the topical jokes of the previous couple of decades.It is the sort of movie that made a lot of us cringe about the quality of American movies in the late fifties and the sixties, and it's just as cringeworthy now as then.</fullReview>
