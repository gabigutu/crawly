		<fullReview>Buoyed by the tremendous energy of Cary Grant and Ginger Rogers, MONKEY BUSINESS is a charming throwback to the screwball era of the 1930s and 40s. You know that you're being asked to leave reality behind and just settle back for a good laugh the second the film begins, especially when the narrator repeatedly warns Cary from beginning the film before the credits are done rolling! Directed with great skill by Howard Hawks (mastermind of brilliant films such as 'Bringing Up Baby' and 'His Girl Friday'), the film shares the trademark rapidfire dialogue and zany situations typical of most Hawksian comedies. As always, following the conversation between the characters is more than enough to leave the viewer breathless... One example, out of so many, is the scene in Room 304, when young!Edwina loses her temper and the couple squabble about Hank Entwistle and she finally locks Barnaby out of the room--to hilarious and painful effect!As with most screwball comedies, the premise of the film must first be accepted, since the entire film is a logical development from the original (zany) premise. In 'Monkey Business', Barnaby Fulton is working on the development of some kind of youth elixir, which he is testing on chimpanzees. Unbeknownst to him, one of his test subjects escapes his cage and successfully concocts the potion, leaving it in the water fountain. Of course, when Barnaby tests the potion on himself, he drinks some water to get the bitter taste out of his mouth--and almost immediately becomes about 20 years old mentally and physically. Before the elixir wears off, Barnaby gets a funky new haircut, coat and car, all with his boss' sexy young secretary (Marilyn Monroe, who else?) at his side. His wife Edwina (Ginger Rogers) then gets in on the action, taking some of the elixir to allow Barnaby to make scientific observations about someone else's reaction to it. It isn't long before she drags her husband to their honeymoon hotel, dances the night away, and impetuously starts divorce proceedings when he upsets her. The ending is a terrific exercise in belief-suspension, as the rejuvenated Barnaby and Edwina (simultaneously, this time) engage in paint wars, hair-pulling and scalping.The best part of the film really would have to be the central performance given by Cary Grant as Barnaby Fulton. He's evidently one of Hawks's favourite actors, and for good reason too--he makes the trippiest of dialogue sound perfectly natural, and plays science-geeks and debonair reporters equally convincingly. With Barnaby, the viewer is instantly reminded of David Huxley, a role Cary Grant infused with life about 15 years ago in Bringing Up Baby. Just as David is kickstarted to life by Susan, Barnaby is youthened by the elixir, and in both films, it's a delight to watch the transformation take place. Initially, Grant's Barnaby is as stuffy as you can imagine a scientist--he's absent-minded and somewhat stern; in effect, all 'grown-up'. But the moment the youth elixir kicks in, the change is miraculous yet believable. Watch in delight as Barnaby flips an effortless cartwheel; drives like a daredevil; and conducts an entire chorus of children in a rousing war song. The 'joie de vivre' that Grant infuses his character with is almost palpable.Cary Grant is also capably matched by Ginger Rogers in their second film together. Her ability to turn into a little girl is charming in the extreme, and you can see the years drop off her in her final stint as young Edwina... it's so evident that she's having fun as she tap-dances through the hotel, or flips rubber bands at people, chews gum, and scribbles "Barnaby loves Edwina" across the conference room chalkboard.In general, the film itself is a little uneven: it has brilliant and hilarious moments, but you definitely get the feeling that much of the film is coasting on the considerable energy and skill of its cast--a splendid Cary Grant, a lovely Ginger Rogers, and an intriguingly young Marilyn Monroe. You probably won't be in too much of a hurry to rewatch this film once you've seen it the first time, but there's really no reason to put off your first viewing... so what are you waiting for?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very good movie to watch when all you want to do is to have a good time and some good laughs. There isn't a minute of it that would hold up to logical analysis, but there's barely a minute of it that isn't fun to watch. The story is pleasantly zany, the characters are entertaining, and the stars were all perfectly chosen for their roles.Hawks's opening gag with Cary Grant in the doorway sets the tone, and lets you know right away that you can sit back and not take anything seriously for a while. Grant's character, a somewhat befuddled scientist who is trying to come up with a "youth formula", is the kind of role he could play in his sleep. As Grant's wife, Ginger Rogers doesn't get much to do for a good while, but then she has some fine comic moments later on. Charles Coburn is perfect as Grant's boss, and he gets a couple of the best lines in the whole show. And who better than Marilyn Monroe to play Coburn's secretary?It's an entertaining throwback to the screwball comedies of a slightly earlier era. "Monkey Business" may be no masterpiece, but it's good fun of the pleasantly offbeat kind that is rare anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Give this one ape for effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thoroughly enjoyable comedy with Cary Grant as the absent-minded professor who's messing around looking for the fountain of youth. Ginger Rogers gets to dance a little without Fred Astaire plus demonstrate a wonderful comic style as she mixes it up with Marilyn Monroe. It's 1952 but you wouldn't know it (except for Marilyn's presence). Howard Hawks takes you back to the good old days when Hollywood demonstrated total mastery of time and space with the screwball comedy.Along with monkeyshines and child actors, you really get a lot in this film: Grant and Rogers play off each other very nicely and the driving scene with Monroe and Grant is a classic. Adding to the hijinx is Charles Coburn, who always dominates the screen with his easy charm. I bet he loved chasing after Monroe with a spray bottle. The movie holds up well over 50 years later which makes one wonder why Hollywood hasn't, cringe, chosen to ape the storyline for Jim Carrey or maybe Tom Hanks, who might be looking for a comic turn these days.But then they remade Freaky Friday this summer, didn't they?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you like good solid wacky comedy, this is a strong bet. An utterly silly movie, it makes me smile just thinking about it--I've seen it probably a dozen times. Cary Grant really was in a class by himself, managing to do virtually every genre, even though he seems to have been typecast by movie history--here he plays a hopelessly stuffy absent minded professor, after drinking a youth serum of improbable origin, he immediately becomes a teen ager from the early fifties. Changing on a dime, the transformation is hilarious. Ginger Rogers, always really engaging, isn't give a lot to do as an adult, but she excels when regressing into a juvenile. One thing--for anyone who really likes Marilyn Monroe (and who doesn't), this is a must see. Not because it's her best part, or because she has a lot of screen time, it isn't and she doesn't. But since she made this movie really before she became famous, it's instructive: the part is just another ditzy bombshell secretary, but something about her just jumps off the screen. This seems to me to be a great example of how there's an ineffable unexplainable quality of "screen presence". She manages to hold her own with Cary Grant, not an easy task for anyone, let alone some yet to be discovered starlet. Now that we're in a gross out downward spiral for comedies, this might be the best tonic--a movie that's very silly, and very funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"If one hundred monkeys typed on one hundred typewriters for forty years..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Basically this nice little comedy by Howard Hawks is based on the urban legend that I used in the summary line: If you put a certain number of monkeys in front of type writers, for a long period of time, eventually you are going to get the complete works of Shakespeare, the King James Bible, War and Peace, Little Women, etc. This urban legend is based on probabilities, but whether it is true or not is something nobody is really prepared to attempt (it would be too difficult to monitor and too expensive and too long). Here the whole idea is that an overly observant chimpanzee in a laboratory might be able to mix the elixir that regains lost youth or zest.Howard Hawks had directed several comedies with Cary Grant, and Grant's Dr. Barnaby Fulton seems like a cousin of Dr. David Huxley, the hapless paleontologist in Hawks' 1938 comedy "Bringing Up Baby". Huxley is a child in handling the madcap heiress Susan who is pursuing him no matter what. Fulton is not as helpless as that, but he does have some similarities. He wears eyeglasses (like Huxley), and he can seem somewhat absent minded like Huxley. Fulton has attracted the attention of Miss Laurel (Marilyn Monroe), the secretary of Mr. Oxley (Charles Coburn). When Fulton goes to see Oxley for a brief conference, Ms Laurel tries to lure his attention by showing him her lovely leg - supposedly demonstrating her new nylons using a process he's invented. Fulton looks at her leg closely, but clinically regarding the success of the unbreakable nylon process.*Ginger Rogers too showed some fragments of her past screen career as Edwina Fulton. She constantly wants to go dancing, and when she drinks the rejuvenating formula she starts doing some nice dance steps (reminding us of her days with Astaire, but even of her work in the Busby Berkeley musicals of the 1930s). At one point when she has taken too much of the formula she is suddenly 10-12 years old, and we see a repeat of her "Sue-Sue" Applegate in "The Major And The Minor".Grant works for a corporation headed by Coburn and Larry Keating. They have been prospering from Grant's chemical inventions and patents, but Coburn is particularly interested in this rejuvenation formula. It is supposed to make a man feel decades younger and vigorous again. As Coburn has the beautiful Monroe as a secretary with indifferent skills (he hands her a paper to have someone else type, and when she protests to get another chance to type it instead, he gently explains it is too important - "Anyone can type!", he says to Grant) it is obvious that if the formula works he will be using it to pursue Monroe. Coburn is so desperate he wants to convert the entire factory to just produce the rejuvenation formula if it succeeds.Grant is not too happy - he's been working for two years on the formula and there has been no success yet. He leaves the monkey cage open, and a female chimpanzee (who has been watching Grant mix the formula) throws the chemicals together and hides it within the water cooler. And every time the formula that Grant makes is tried, the guinea pig (Grant, Rogers, whoever) takes a drink of water to help make it palatable. And, of course, it is the unknown concoction of the monkey that actually sets off the rejuvenation.The film follows the good and bad points of rejuvenation. Yes it does make a person more vigorous and able to do things that he hasn't been able to do for years (Grant does a cartwheel at one point). But it makes the user unreasonable to others who are not similarly peppy - Rogers thinks that Grant is a drag, as he doesn't take the concoction when they go out back to the hotel they honeymooned in. She is ready to jitterbug, and he's collapsing. And if too much is taken you become emotionally immature, leading to Grant arranging the scalping of his former rival (Hugh Marlowe) by some real kids.The film has some nice little bits in it. An immature Grant is asked for the "secret ingredient" to his formula. How much, Coburn asks him, for the formula? "I want a zillion dollars!", Grant says - which he claims is a trillion million. And when he is trying to arrange the scalping of Marlowe, one of the youths (George Winslow) keeps bringing him down to earth by reminding him they need a war dance if they are going to scalp anyone!Probably not on par with "Bringing Up Baby" or "His Gal Friday", but it was a good comedy for all that. *However, later on, when he's taken the rejuvenating formula, Fulton does recognize Ms Laurel by her legs under a sign - suggesting that the attractiveness of her legs did make an impact on him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>O Youth and Beauty!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Monkey Business is a sort of late screwball comedy in which a scientist discovers a formula for returning people to their youth. The problem is that they become a little too youthful, and all hell breaks loose as a result. Directed by veteran Howard Hawks, co-authored by Ben Hecht, this is a funny if one joke film. Leading players Cary Grant and Ginger Rogers handle their parts capably, Charles Coburn is marvelous in a large (in all senses of that word) supporting role, and since it's a cliche to call Marilyn Monroe eye candy, I won't. Good fun all-round, the movie is in the end not as good as its thirties prototypes; some of the jokes go on for too long; and the repartee, such as the dialogue can be called, isn't as zingy as it might be. A good try, though, and intermittently hilarious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something went wrong with "the formula"...only Marilyn shines...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The cast includes some of the top masters of screwball comedy and is directed by the man who made BRINGING UP BABY--and yet this is not the bright and witty farce it strains to be.Ironically, it's MARILYN MONROE, in the film's smallest role as a dimwit secretary, who steals the spotlight from CARY GRANT, GINGER ROGERS and CHARLES COBURN whenever she pops up...which isn't often enough. Superstardom was just around the corner and this film is proof that Monroe had the kind of charisma that charms even when her dialog is not that funny.CARY GRANT does well in most of his scenes but the Indian romp with the boys is too unbelievable even for this far-fetched comic spoof. At times, he seems almost detached from his role. Poor HUGH MARLOWE looks mighty uncomfortable as a victim of the "let's play Indian" stunt. So much so, that one can only picture him wishing he was back in ALL ABOUT EVE. GINGER ROGERS has an irritating sequence where she and Cary revisit their honeymoon hotel with disastrous results when she goes into a crying jag over the mention of her mother's name. Ginger only perks up when imitating an even more youthful version of her "Major and the Minor" role--but she is given only brief moments to shine. Coburn plays his role effortlessly and is especially amusing when referring to his secretary's lack of skills. "Anyone can type", he says of Monroe as she wriggles away.But true wit is missing for most of the film and the laughs come at the expense of the two main stars who show a surprising lack of chemistry when thrown together. The formula just doesn't work here. Something went wrong and it shows.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen this film for years,its very rarely on TV these days,which is a shame,i managed to get a copy on DVD,its always been one of the comedies I've wanted to own.The scene i always remembered best,was the one in which Cary Grant is playing cowboys and Indian's with the local children,and where Hank Entwhistle gets his just deserts,for being a smug playboy still trying to get Edwina.Ginger Rogers proved she could still dance and did a great comic turn,when she turns into a child.This film goes to show,that in them days they could make classic comedy without any foul language and without crudity,they didn't find any problem doing that.Marilyn Monroe provided the sexual interest in one of her more low key performances,and the plot only mildly focus on that,which is good.If you have never seen this film,and you like films from the early fifties,this is definitely worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Movie because of Talent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie Monkey Business could have been pretty bad. I would say that it's saving grace is the fact that the people involved are all highly talented. Howard Hawks turns in some excellent direction per usual, although I'm sure he was only paying the bills. Cary Grant and Ginger Rogers are pitch perfect. Marilyn Monroe is essentially eye candy in this movie but she still steals every scene she is in, which unfortunately isn't very many.The script was written by the highly respected Ben Hecht , Charles Lederer (of His Girl Friday fame) and I.A.L. Diamond (Some Like It Hot etc...). With so many excellent writers involved you know the script is going to be at least decent. Granted that a monkey discovering a potion for the fountain of youth is a pretty silly premise they managed to pull it off for the most part. The dialog is a bit awkward in places but overall very good and the script certainly got it's message across.Cary Grant's performance makes this film. He perfectly embodies what a typical teenager and child of the age would be. Of course the scenes in which he takes the potion are the highlights of the film and he does an excellent job with them. He also has considerable chemistry with his female costars particularly Ginger Rogers (Who plays his wife).Marilyn Monroe plays Grant's bosses slightly dim but wonderfully innocent secretary. Although she has limited screen time you cannot take your eyes off of her anytime she is in the shot. The sign of a great actress.Overall a very charming film with a feel good message. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>''Monkey Business'' is a funny movie, but Marilyn Monroe has a small role as Dr. Barnaby Fulton's secretary, miss Lois Laurel. We also have the very famous Ginger Rogers as Mrs. Edwina Fulton, the female lead role. The story is about Barnaby Fulton(Cary Grant), a scientist who is working in a formula to make people young again. He is two years trying to find the exact proportions and ingredients for the formula, but he doesn't have any success. His old boss,Mr. Oliver Oxley(Charles Coburn) is always telling Barnaby to have success, because without the right formula is not going to promote him, but for his luck he has a very nice and supportive wife, Edwina Fulton, who is always helping him. One day,Esther, the young ape goes out of her cage and mix Barnaby's ingredients, making it a success, but she gets the formula mixed with the water, and that's how the problems starts to begins: Barnaby, Edwina and even the other scientists and Mr. Oxley are going to drink it, making many confusions and bringing problems for them all.aka "O Inventor Da Mocidade" - Brazil</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Monroe Dazzles Despite the Silliness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A stellar cast that includes Cary Grant, Ginger Rogers, and a chimpanzee, direction by Howard Hawks, and a screenplay by Ben Hecht, Charles Lederer, and I.A.L. Diamond, what could possibly go wrong? Plenty. Perhaps considered hilarious in 1952, "Monkey Business" is hopelessly dated, occasionally amusing, and often just plain silly. An absent minded professor, who seems more demented than distracted, concocts a mysterious formula that causes people to act younger. Of course, the formula is tested and gets loose via a water cooler. Stir in the chimp, a bunch of kids, and a baby, and the results are generally less than funny.A chasm yawns between acting childlike and acting childish. In "Big," Tom Hanks beautifully captured the mannerisms, energy, and curiosity of a child in an adult's body. However, Cary Grant and Ginger Rogers do not act like children. Instead, they cavort like childish adults. The bookish professor that Grant plays would never have thrown paint around, pulled a girl's pigtails, or danced an Indian war dance as a child. He was probably as studious at ten as he was at 40. Unfortunately, Grant did not have Tom Hanks's nuanced performance to study, and he overacts wildly. Grant's turn here is arguably his worst since "Arsenic and Old Lace," which compensated with a terrific supporting cast and a funny script. Even worse, Rogers tries to keep pace with Grant's antics, and, speaking in a little girlish voice, her silliness is even more ridiculous than Grant's.However, Marilyn Monroe in an early supporting role is the one sterling reason not to miss "Monkey Business." Marilyn never drinks the formula and remains the epitome of the dumb blonde throughout. But Monroe is no ordinary dumb blonde; she is sweet, vulnerable, and innocent. The screen grows brighter when she appears, and she is drop-dead gorgeous. When Marilyn hikes her skirt to show her acetate stockings to Grant, she is oblivious to the effect she has. Of course, a half century ago, sexism was rampant and tolerated, if not encouraged, and "Monkey Business" has more than its share. Charles Coburn, the geriatric laboratory boss, admits Monroe is there to look at, and Grant leers at her legs shamelessly. Ginger Rogers is no liberated woman either; she is the housewife with nothing to do but buy new dresses, plan social events, and care for her helpless husband.Considering the credits, "Monkey Business" should have been an hilarious classic; unfortunately, the Marx Brothers film of the same title is much funnier. The Hawks film is notable only for the dazzling presence of a young Marilyn Monroe and little else. Even the chimp has done better work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Fountain Of Youth In Your Water-cooler</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Monkey Business Cary Grant's second film with Ginger Rogers and his fourth and final film for director Howard Hawks has him reaching back into some of the lunacy of his previous work like Arsenic and Old Lace. Not since that madcap piece was Grant ever so frantic on the screen.Ginger Rogers doesn't yield one inch of screen ground to him in that department though. In The Major and The Minor she faked being a teenage girl very convincingly and in this film she and Cary go back even farther in their return to adolescence. Cary is a research scientist who is working on that eternal quest for the fountain of youth. A chimpanzee gets loose from her cage and mixes some chemicals and dumps the result in the water-cooler. Everyone thinks it's what Cary's concocted and the company bigwigs led by Charles Coburn and Larry Keating try to get it from him, but in his adolescent state it's no avail.Monkey Business does meander over into just plain outright silliness, but with Cary and Ginger you don't really mind. I do so love the way Cary with a gang of kids he's playing Indians with leave poor Hugh Marlowe tied to a tree ready for a scalping because the wolfish Marlowe's been making moves on Ginger. Second to that is Charles Coburn and Ginger Rogers trying to talk to an infant who they think Cary has morphed into. Coburn may have been one of the screen's greatest actors, he'd have to have been to hold his own with that baby. Note the dignified expression on his face never leaves.Of course Monkey Business is also known for having one of Marilyn Monroe's early screen roles in it on her way up. She's Coburn's secretary and note the expression on Coburn's face as she is showing Grant the result of his work on a no run stocking.Monkey Business is second tier stuff for Grant, Rogers, and Hawks, but fans of all three will like it and quite a few more than those people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Every Hawks Film Hits Target</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has all the names of a top rated classic movie. It falls short because of the script. It just is not as funny as it should be. It tries to get by more with dialog comedy than visual and I think that is because most of the cast except Ms. Monroe are advancing in age. Cary Grant is 48 and shows amazing energy here, more frantic than I have ever seen him elsewhere. Grant gets a kids hair cut in this and looks younger with that style than his age.Marilyn Monroe in this film is good but her role is support. She has the full curve look here as it appears her weight was up into the plump area when she did this movie.This did happen sometimes in her career. Still even plump she looks attractive. Ginger Rodgers always was quite slim and I like her figure in this one. She gets to do a few dance steps but not really the dancing she did with Astaire. Her acting is frantic in this too. I'd have dated Ginger with this look. The chemist who has invented a youth formula here is pretty thin to hang the plot on and at times the story line blurts and some of the acting is really over the top. This Monkey Business has no relation to the Marx Brothers film of the same name. Given a comparison, the Marx film is much funnier, the only thing it lacks is Monroe. This movies only assets are the great cast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The last screwball comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Screwball comedies that had begun with "It Happened One Night" in 1933 came to an end with the bombing of Pearl Harbor. So-called sophisticated comedies replaced screwball comedies with the likes of "Woman of the Year" and "To Be Or Not To Be." One of the best directors of screwball comedies, Howard Hawks, made one last hurrah with "Monkey Business" which can be considered the final comedy of the genre (there were elements of screwball comedy in "Some Like It Hot" and other later films but these don't really fit the category completely)."Monkey Business" is all but forgotten today even though its cast includes many of the best actors around at the time. The only element that keeps it from being swept under the rug totally is the significant appearance of sex goddess Marilyn Monroe who was beginning to show the world that she was more than just a sex kitten. Though Hawks focuses on that aspect of her persona, she is able to rise above it with her immense comedic talents. Perhaps another reason for this movie's obscurity is the title, since one of the great Marx Brothers films is also called "Monkey Business." This little gem is a winner. The writing talents of Ben Hecht, Charles Lederer, and I.A.L. Diamond are utilized to create a laugh-a-minute marathon of science fiction hocus-pocus brought to life by Cary Grant, who is outrageous in his antics especially when he reverts to childhood, Ginger Rogers, who gets to cut a rug in what becomes almost a parody of her dances with Fred Astaire, the always wonderful Charles Coburn, Sex pot Marilyn Monroe adds the spice, and all threaten to be upstaged by Esther the Chimp.The lines in the script are at times saucy to say the least for a film made in 1952. When buying a sports car Dr. Barnaby Fulton (Cary Grant) mentions adding a beaver tail. The camera pans and shows Marilyn's feet and legs, then travels upward. While Barnaby and Lois Laurel (Marilyn) are driving the sports care for the first spin, the conversation becomes titillating with Lois Laurel telling Barnaby how hot she is. When Barnaby and his supervisor Oliver Oxley (Charles Coburn) speak about secretary Lois Laurel, the camera pans from her bottom to Oxley who comments, "Anyone can type." There are many other sexual innuendos sprinkled throughout including a scene when a naked baby crawls into bed with Edwina Fulton (Ginger Rogers). She thinks it is her husband Barnaby who has become an infant by drinking the youth potion. She first arrives at this conclusion when she feels the baby's butt.The story sounds simple when outlined. In reality, it becomes complex in its presentation. A brilliant chemist, Dr. Barnaby Fulton, is extremely absent minded. Consequently he continually misplaces notes to experiments and forgets at times to write down some of the main ingredients to his formulas. Working on a youth concoction and using chimps in his experiments, he is not adverse to drinking his own mixtures becoming a human guinea pig. While a monkey is loose in the laboratory, the skillful creature mixes his own potion which is accidentally put into the water cooler. This leads to all types of hilarious situations, including one scalping, with the team of scientists headed by Oxley trying to find the one ingredient that makes the formula work.The humor is fast-paced, the lines fly like a buzz saw. If you don't find this film hysterical, then your funny bone is out of whack. See a laugh doctor immediately. Oh, as a bonus, you get to hear Cary Grant croon "The Whiffenpoof Song"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly, slapstick not up to par for Howard Hawks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Monkey Business" is not a typical Howard Hawks comedy. First of all, it has two leading stars that have very little "chemistry" together. This is especially troubling since the two leading stars are Ginger Rogers and Cary Grant. They both look uncomfortable in this not very funny film."Monkey Business" reminded me of some of those ridiculous films that Disney made in the late '60's thru the late '70's. Loaded with animals, kids and lame slapstick.Cary plays a chemist/inventor who tries to discover a "fountain of youth" potion for boss, Charles Coburn. Rogers is his supportive wife. Thru a fluke in his lab, Cary is given the potion, and instantly reverts to childlike behavior. Rogers also takes the potion and turns into an annoyingly shrill child herself. The rest of the film is predictable, and not very funny.The movie on the whole seems very flat and unfunny. I got the feeling that Grant, Rogers and Hawks did this movie, if only to complete their contractual obligations with 20th Century Fox.Not really worth your time.** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found "Monkey Business" to be an uneven comedy. It offers many hilarious and memorable moments (the monkey preparing the formula, for instance), but there are also a number of scenes which come to a standstill; many of them are the ones involving the professor and his wife. Cleverly written dialogue provides most of the fun, and the film leaves an overall good feeling. Considered a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Comedy classic directed by Howard Hawks and starring Cary Grant as a research scientist who drinks a formula mixed by a monkey that makes him act younger. Soon other people are drinking it and reverting to a younger state as well, including his wife Ginger Rogers and sexy secretary Marilyn Monroe. It's a delightfully funny romp reminiscent of the screwball comedy films Hawks made in the 1930s and 1940s. Grant, Rogers, and Monroe are all great. Charles Coburn steals many scenes. He would re-team with Hawks and Monroe the following year in another classic, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. Monkey Business was the fifth and final teaming of Hawks and Grant. They definitely went out on a high note. As for Marilyn, who is often advertised today as the star of the film, she makes the most of her supporting part and shows that she was more than just a pretty face or curvy figure. Definitely recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Youth formula is put into water cooler with comic results.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>_Monkey Business_ works if, and only if, you can buy the premise that a lab monkey, working behind the scientist's back, can produce an elixer that makes people young again and dump it into the lab's water cooler to watch the results. I find suspending disbelief here no problem, and the result is a wonderfully silly movie. Cary Grant is spot on as the absent-minded scientist, Barnaby Fulton. (The opening credit scene, which seques seamlessly from Cary being referred to as "Mr. Grant" by the off-camera director to Cary being Barnaby Fulton, is a classic in itself.) Ginger Rogers (Mrs. Fulton), is hardly credible as a scientist's wife, but she is brilliant whenever Mrs. Fulton is under the influence of the elixer. Monroe is effortless as the dumb blonde secretary wanting to have "fun" with the youthful version of Barnaby Fulton. Charles Coburn is perfect as the frumpy boss, Mr. Oxley. The comedy is in the situations and dialog that develop as the elixer is repeatedly unwittingly imbibed by Grant and Rogers, and then by others. I would rather not spell these out, but they are fully within the screwball comedy genre that goes back to the 1930's.</fullReview>

When a research monkey accidentally spills Grant's serum into the water supply in his lab, wild things happen. This was the first movie I have seen with Marilyn Monroe. Though she has a very small part, she is completely sexy.Monkey Business is not among Grant's or Hawks' very best movies, but is still a lot of fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That spells hilarious, in case you've been on another planet. Cary is a chemist who's trying to come up with a formula to make people younger. Ginger is his wife, and Marilyn is his boss' secretary. Well, someone comes up wih the final ingredients, and the whole building practically goes drunk with the stuff. This was filmed just months before Marilyn's career took off, and fans of hers will probably want to see this. This isn't Ginger's best, or Marilyn's, or Cary's, but it's very good, very funny, and something to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The secret formula</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Barnaby Fulton is a typical absent minded scientist. When we first see him, he is preparing to go out with his wife Edwina to a dance. He clearly does not want to go, because in his mind, the formula he has been working on has him worried. The secret youth producing elixir will not be able to be produced. Barnaby works for a company that is capitalizing its existence on the success of a product that will change people's lives as their lives will benefit with a youth feeling that no one else has marketed.Unknown to Barnaby, one chimp in the lab, decides to imitate Dr. Fulton and creates its own formula which he dumps in the water cooler. Barnaby, decides to taste his own creation himself, something the company does not encourage. Finding it ever so bitter, he must have some water to take away the after taste he gets after drinking his formula. The results are amazing: Barnaby becomes a reckless young man."Monkey Business" owes its success to the great Howard Hawks, a man that produced some of the best comedies of Hollywood that still are seen again and again. Mr. Hawks was a versatile man that knew what the public wanted. The comedy worked because all the elements came together to make it a timeless piece that will be enjoyed by audiences of all ages. The screenplay was by Ben Hecht, Charles Lederer and I.A.L. Diamond, and based on a story by Harry Segal.An inspired Cary Grant is the basically the excuse for watching the film. He shows his range in playing the morose scientist as well as the younger man that has fun playing with children as well. Mr. Grant is perfect as Barnaby. Ginger Rogers also has some excellent moments when she tastes her husband's magical formula, reverting to the time when she had just married Barnaby. Marilyn Monroe added a touch of mischief playing the secretary with all the right equipment to distract men at the office. Charles Coburn and Hugh Marlowe are also seen in supporting roles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hawk's most underrated comedy!!!!!!!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are browsing through your local Blockbuster you might run across this DVD. You can't miss it....it has Marilyn Monroe plastered all over the cover. And while the sight of Marilyn is always most welcome, in this film she is not the biggest attraction. Howard Hawks made this film at RKO in 1952 after "The Big Sky" which broke an unbroken string of box office hits that began in 1939 with Only Angels have Wings and ended with 1951's "The Thing" which may be Hawks most influential film. After the relative failure of the Big Sky Hawks returned to the genre that never failed him: comedy! And who better to work with in a Hawksian comedy than his go to guy Cary Grant. With two of his favorite script writers, Ben Hecht and Charles Lederer in tow it seemed a match made in heaven. Grant always seemed to work as well with Hawks style as any other actor and this would be the fifth (and final) film that they would make together.However most critics and fans and even Hawks himself (he felt that the outrageous storyline robbed the film of it's effectiveness.) find this film to be a failure. I disagree! This film is actually my favorite Hawksian comedy (that i've seen so far). The film succeeds in part to Cary Grant's performance (brilliant as usual) and Ginger Rogers who demonstrates rare comedic ability in this film that I think is most overlooked. Rogers received a golden globe nomination despite not really receiving much support from the master. (Hawks was quite rude to her on the set) The situation which (except for the fantastic element of the plot) could have been lifted straight from Three's Company simply works. This film will make you smile and has enough of the little Hawksian touches to make any student of Hawks quite happy. Pay close attention to the interplay between Grant and Rogers. The usual subtleties of dialogue so typical of hawks imply that Grant and Rogers have a very normal sex life which is something not always implied in period movies. The situations are of course ridiculous but achieve a level of entertainment and joy that measures up to any Hawksian comedy. And yes I HAVE seen Bringing up Baby and His Girl Friday. Monkey Business is simply underrated. O....and if doubt me, you can always look at Marilyn!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this film. I do prefer His Girl Friday, but this movie is wonderful. The production values are top notch, with lovely cinematography and costumes. The pace is snappy, and the story is wonderfully constructed with seldom a dull moment. Monkey Business is also brilliantly directed by Howard Hawks, the writing is superb and the acting is top notch. I have always loved Cary Grant, he was a very charming, urbane and likable actor, and he is sublime here. Ginger Rogers is also very good, it shows that she is just as good as acting as she is at dancing. It is Marilyn Monroe though who steals the show, very beautiful and sassy, she is delightful in Monkey Business. All in all, this movie is a delight and definitely worth the look. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hawks knew his business.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This farcical adaptation of *Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde* is also an affectionate valentine from director Howard Hawks to a veteran pair of campaigners (Cary Grant and Ginger Rogers) as well as to the audience who remembered when Hawks, Grant, and Rogers were in their youthful prime back in the Thirties. The great thing of it is, Hawks &amp; Co. are asserting here (in 1952) that they are most definitely NOT past their prime, both in comedic execution and in terms of the movie's theme, which is the inadvisability of wishing to turn back the clock.Grant is the absent-minded professor working -- rather unenthusiastically -- on a "youth elixir", which he's testing on lab chimps. Well, one of these chimps gets out of his cage, inadvertently creates the perfect "formula" by mixing and matching chemicals, and finally dumps the beaker into the water cooler. Hijinks follow. With each encounter with the formula, Grant and wife Rogers regress further and further into youth, all the way back to infancy. The gags here are as good as anything Hawks, and Grant in earlier Hawks films, ever put on the screen. Grant's performance is really a wonder: a slow-burn, rising to an almost scary lunatic crescendo wherein he's slathered in Indian war-paint and administering a mohawk haircut on an old chum (and romantic rival) with a group of savage children as his aides. And Hawks gives Ginger the opportunity to cut a rug or two. What more do you want? Marilyn Monroe?OK, *Monkey Business* has MM, too. It's an early picture for her, and it's a small role . . . but I must echo a comment below that her magnetism is an irresistible force. It's beyond "acting": the woman was clearly a star. When this absolutely ripe tomato is on-screen, she's all you see. (Old Charles Coburn must have relished the scene where he gets to chase her around the lab, soaking her with a spray nozzle. An enviable role for any actor!) Because *Monkey Business* was one of her first movies, Cary Grant is also able to get away with asking MM to pull his finger (!). "Dr. FULTON!" she huffs. Monroe was wonderful before superstardom, barbituates, and the Actors Studio got their hooks into her.I suppose I should bring up the meatier subtexts underneath all the farce: YOU know, the sublimated desire to escape Fifties conformity; the catastrophe of male mid-life crisis; the dark side of consumerism (Grant is a hired-out chemist for a crass pharmaceutical company which is willing to foist any poison on the public as long as said poison is profitable); the discovery of Sex After 40 (notice how much lovelier Rogers looks when she releases her long blonde hair from that horribly severe Fifties bun); Freudian connotations of repressed adulterous desires . . . oh, but why spoil the fun? Along the lines of spoiling the fun, the wet blankets bemoaning the un-PC treatment of animal experimentation and kids playing Cowboys and Indians can go jump in the lake.All in all, *Monkey Business* -- this screwball throwback -- is funnier and more substantial than its Thirties antecedents. It requires great artistry to return to one's old material without parodying oneself. I guess Howard Hawks and Cary Grant were great artists, eh?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This screwball comedy with tired blood shows why people were staying home watching television in 1952. Hard to believe that a movie with so much talent (Howard Hawks, Ben Hecht, a great cast) could just sit there on screen, alternately lifeless and shrill but never for one minute funny. Yet it has a bewilderingly high reputation -- maybe people look at Cary Grant in thick "professor" spectacles and think they're seeing comic genius, or maybe it's the monkeys: they act just like people! Actually in this film it's the reverse, and watching Grant and Ginger Rogers monkey around in middle age is just painful. That said, it's an improvement on their earlier teaming, Leo McCarey's jaw-dropping Nazi-fighting screwball "Once Upon a Honeymoon" -- in that movie, as in this, the two stars do nothing for each other. Too bad Rogers turned down "His Girl Friday" and "Ball of Fire"... I wonder if this movie was Hawks' revenge, because he films her with an ice-cold indifference that leaves her stranded on the screen.</fullReview>

It is when Cary Grant and Ginger Rogers get called into the board of directors room and they both are acting like children, having both taken the formula without knowing it. To top it all off, the monkey was on the ceiling throwing light bulbs. Overall it was a very funny movie, clever, yet far-fetched. I would rate this as one of Cary Grants best performances. Ginger Rogers was also very good. However for some reason there wasnt enough Marilyn in this movie. I few parts that she was in, she was very funny. I don't know why she only played a small role in this movie. Her funniest line was at the beginning when the boss told her to go to every ford dealership and look for Barnaby. Her reply was, "Which one do you want me to do first." It was a funny movie with parts that will have you on the floor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MONKEY BUSINESS is a madcap comedy starring Cary Grant as a short-sighted professor who's been conducting experiments into the intelligence of chimpanzees. One day, when he's out of his laboratory, unbeknownst to him a chimp escapes and pours his newly-made concoction into the water cooler. When members of his team and family begin to drink the concoction they experience a newfound youthfulness...Let's be fair: most of this film's enjoyment stems from an ever-professional Cary Grant, who shows that he's every bit as good at slapstick comedy as he is in other genres. Grant's transformation from a geeky scientist into a youthful playboy is a hoot and he delivers a straight-laced performance that fits perfectly with the production. The highlight comes late on in the proceedings when he plays Red Indians with a group of mischievous kids. It's a sublime moment.Elsewhere, the production falters a little with Ginger Rogers - who plays Grant's wife - asked to do increasingly stupid things for the camera. There's a great trick she pulls off with a glass of coffee, but when Rogers acts the kid it's pretty embarrassing, I have to say. Watch out for Marilyn Monroe, taking an early role as a sexpot secretary. Although MONKEY BUSINESS is rather a juvenile film, there are moments of slapstick and madness which equal Laurel &amp; Hardy at the top of their game. Just a shame the tone wasn't more consistent...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this movie on Netflix streaming movies. I happen to be a Chemist and that didn't help, because the Chemistry displayed here was very far from what might happen in a real Chemistry research lab. Anyway, to the story. As the movie starts and his wife is trying to get him out of the house, he is acting like he might be mentally challenged, but he is acting the part of an absent-minded scientist, deep in thought. Cary Grant is intelligent and inventive Chemist Dr. Barnaby Fulton. He is working on what could be the invention of the ages, a formula that would arrest aging, and perhaps even reverse it.The title has two meanings. Barnaby's lab is using chimpanzees, which they often referred to as "the monkeys", it was part of their research business. But the title also refers to the human "monkey business" that the characters seem to get into, over and over.Ginger Rogers is just great as the wife, Mrs. Edwina Fulton, and always very understanding and forgiving of Barnaby's foibles. Marilyn Monroe is also in it, as a typist who can't type, but her character introduces some additional high jinks. SPOILERS: Make no mistake, this is a slapstick comedy. Not only is Barnaby having trouble perfecting his formula, one day a chimp lets himself out of the cage, and proceeds to randomly pick up chemicals on the lab bench and mix them. The chemical mix ends up in the water cooler, and turns out to have the effect Barnaby was searching for. But with no witnesses and no idea what had happened, the chimp became an unwitting inventor of a technology that no one could duplicate. All the better for humanity, I suppose!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A monkey invents a potion that rejuvenates humans and plops it into the office water machine in a science lab. Meanwhile, chemist Barnaby (Cary Grant) has been trying to develop a youth formula for years. He drinks his latest formula but it tastes a bit off so he goes to the water cooler. Yep - he takes a drink of water and ....woah ........what's happening..? Well, he's the monkey's first victim. He starts acting 'youthful' and everyone thinks he has succeeded in inventing Life's Youth Juice. We follow Barnaby and his wife Edwina (Ginger Rogers) as they inadvertently keep consuming the monkey formula every time that they take a drink of water from the water cooler.....will the monkey get credit for the invention? The film has a cast that excites on paper but it doesn't live up to expectations. The whole beginning sequence drags - the first 15 minutes should have been thrown out. The cast are all likable but Cary Grant and Ginger Rogers are made to act out scenes that could be over in a couple of minutes as opposed to 'let's drag it out' for 10 minutes. However, opposed to the tedious, drawn out slapstick rubbish that we are offered, we are also given moments of comic genius. George Winslow, who plays one of the kids, provides laugh-out-loud entertainment with every word of dialogue that he utters. Genius.Overall, the film entertains. It has peaks and troughs. Ginger Rogers displays good balancing skills while balancing a cup of water on her forehead as she stands up and lies down and goes back to standing position. Cool trick. Cary Grant is occasionally funny, Marilyn Monroe (Lois) is also good - she's not so irritating and baby talking as usual - while Charles Coburn (Oxley) is good value as always. Check out his request for his secretary, Marilyn, to pass on the simple duty of typing to someone else other than her.It's worth watching if you can get over the crappy beginning. I don't particularly care for kids in films but George Winslow rules.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly Fun and Games For Cary Grant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dr. Barnaby Fulton (Cary Grant), a research chemist working on a fountain of youth pill for a chemical company, is urged on by his commercially minded boss Mr. Oliver Oxley (Charles Coburn). One of his chimpanzees Esther gets loose in the laboratory and pours some chemicals into the Fulton's mix ? chemicals that just happen to have the rejuvenating effect for which Fulton is searching.I really love the verbose, nerdy Cary Grant, who is sort of a pre-Jerry Lewis and follows in the footsteps of William Holden in "Born Yesterday". I'm not big on Grant generally, but this is one of the few exceptions (alongside "Arsenic and Old Lace").Fulton's character makes a point of saying that the "history of discovery is the history of people who didn't follow rules", or something similar. That's an interesting theory, and to some degree probably true. Many of the great discoveries would today be seen as unethical, but we are still glad we have them. The field of psychology especially had some unorthodox methods...Sadly, Marilyn Monroe has no real purpose other than to be pure sex on screen, though she does work well with Cary Grant. More of this would have been nice, perhaps they work together in other films? Basically, if you want silly, and I mean really silly -- like classic Disney silly -- this is a film you may want to check out. Now, I can't explain why the elixir cures Fulton's eyes but doesn't physically make him younger... but let's not dwell on such things. A decent film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good fun, but not really a Monroe movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recap: Barnaby Fulton is a chemist with Oxly labs, working on a secret formula to make people younger. Bright as he is, he is almost to focused upon his work, sometimes forgetting to have a private life. His attempts at the formula is rather unsuccessful, but one of the laboratory's chimpanzees has more luck. Breaking out of her cage the ape mimics Barnaby and accidentally makes a potent formula, but pours it into the water dispenser before anyone sees. After that anyone that drinks the water becomes very young at heart and sets out on irrational adventure.Comments: A pretty funny comedy, mostly because of these little adventures the characters set out upon. Their behavior is rather irrational and puts them in rather peculiar situations. The story is pretty imaginative and rather funny, and the movie works very well even now, more than half a century later. Laughs are timeless and even though it is in black and white it would work just as good as a recent comedy for an evening.Cary Grant and Ginger Roberts star in this movie, and do it well. Both are two great actors that deserve credit for their effort. Marilyn Monroe has a small part in this but does not in any way have a big impact on either the story or movie as a whole. However, it is her face and name that, shows on the DVD nowadays. Sure, Monroe went on to have great success, but to forget two such big stars such as Grant and Roberts, and not giving them their due credit, is a little odd.I was a little fooled by it, as I rented it in the hopes of catching another Some Like It Hot, a really good comedy in which Monroe stars. This was something else entirely, as Monroe is not in the lead, but I wasn't disappointed at all when I discovered that that wasn't the case. The movie was good enough by itself.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hawks Comedy Rings the Bell.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This may or may not be Howard Hawks' funniest comedy but it's one of his best. In "Bringing up Baby", there was conflict between two sets of surface traits -- blind and submissive intellectualism (Cary Grant) and self-indulgent whimsicality (Katherine Hepburn). In "Monkey Business" the script digs a little deeper. There is an insane, semi-science-fiction plot involving Grant's discovery of a chemical "formula" that reduces the effects of aging and makes mature people act like children. That's the main plot -- Charles Coburn as head of the Oxley Corporation trying to worm the formula out of him, while Grant and his wife (Ginger Rogers) each regress twice to the age of adolescents. The real formula has been mixed together by a chimp and dumped into the water cooler without anyone knowing it.The chief conflict, though, is buried in what the script calls the unconscious. The Grant/Rogers marriage has been dulled by seven years of living together and both are a little dissatisfied. Grant neglects his wife and is absent minded. He pays more attention to his scientific endeavors. And Rogers is resentful, but not openly. It's only under the influence of the elixir that she brings up the fact of Hank Entwhistle's (Hugh Marlowe's) attraction to her. This in turn causes Grant some pain.In other words, if in "Bringing up Baby" there were two characters who were fully aware of what and who they wanted, in "Monkey Business" there are two subconscious personalities in conflict. In other words it's not a battle on an open field. It's rather like two sets of rival miners boring big holes towards one another.It ends happily, with Grant and Rogers leading a more balanced married life and the accidental formula being accidentally disposed of.It's pretty funny. This is the kind of comedy that Cary Grant excelled at. When he's not under the influence of the formula he wears glasses half an inch thick. He bumbles around, forgets where he put his keys, examines Marylin Monroe's shapely leg (covered by the fabric he invented) and explains, "I was just examining her acetates." UNDER the influence he gets a crew cut, buys a suit of new clothes that would sputter even in Las Vegas, and acquires a new MG in which he speeds Monroe around town -- until the formula wears off, he crashes into a hurricane fence, and wonders where his glasses could be.Ginger Rogers is good too. She's fine as a whiny ten-year-old girl. As a modern housewife, the fact is that the fashions of the time weren't really suitable for someone like Ginger Rogers. Those umbrella-like long skirts are no substitute for what she wore in the 30s with Fred Astaire. I speak to you as your costumier. And that upswept hair do is less than becoming. Now I thpeak to you as your coiffeur, but I'm going to quit because next I'll have to start charging.There is some silly business to do with chimpanzees climbing the furniture and throwing light bulbs around. I hope to never see a comic performance by a chimpanzee again.Hugh Marlowe seems to have been made for the part of lawyer Hank Entwhistle who would (unconsciously) love to abscond with Grant's wife. He has no visible talent for comedy whatever, and the part calls for exactly that. A well-intentioned, reasonable dullard. The funniest scene in the movie is when the stoned Grant talks some neighborhood kids into tying Marlowe against a tree so he can be scalped. (Don't ask.) At first Marlowe refuses, believing it to be a lot of nonsense, but one of the little kids asks in his bullfrog voice, "What's the matter, don't you like children?" And when Marlowe, still puzzled but not entirely unwilling to comply, replies, "Why of COURSE I like children," his smooth voice drips with ordinariness.There are some outright belly laughs in this -- not just sight gags like Marlowe's Mohawk haircut, but effective verbal gags too. The aged Coburn calls his secretary, Monroe, into his office, hands her some papers, and tells her she'd better find someone to type them. Monroe's face falls with disappointment and she asks if she can't try again. "No, no -- these are important, better find someone else." Then Coburn glances at Grant, shrugs, and says, "Anybody can type." Well worth catching.</fullReview>

All throughout his career, no matter what the role or the film, he always is able to bring a smile on the face of those watching him. Here, he plays a variation of the befuddled scientist he also did in Howard Hawk's Bringing Up Baby. Teaming again with Hawks and this time Ginger Rogers as his co-star, Grant gives one of his very finest performances; not realistic in any way but always warm and funny and sometimes sophisticated.In fact, this whole story is sheer nonsense for the sensible and rational. Yet, on the whole it works if only for the simple fact that Grant and Rogers sell it the whole way. Playing two adults that experiment with youth serum cannot be an easy role, but they pull it off. They each get their time, with Ginger doing a small but memorable dance and Cary performing a traditional Indian scalping.The screenplay is filled with screwy dialog, the sets are simple yet elegant, and the supporting cast features Charles Coburn as a greedy executive and Marilyn Monroe as his dumb but voluptuous secretary. Seeing her alone makes this worth the hour and a half. But what also makes it worth it is that Hawks was able to sneak in some interesting stuff about whether it is worth it to be young again. Perhaps we should appreciate our time as we have it rather than try to grow up too fast or get young too soon. That is something a comedy most likely wouldn't do today and how could they without some of the greatest and most beautiful stars to work with? It makes you long for nostalgia.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hawks and Grant and Rogers and Monroe- good, not great, "youth" comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been hard for me so far in viewing the bulk of what's considered Howard Hawks' best work (i.e. Big Sleep, Rio Bravo, His Girl Friday) to be disappointed. Monkey Business is no disappointment, either, but it is kind of lacking in being a really great story or with truly memorable characters. It's a solid comedy, with a couple of intriguing points raised, and only left so much cooked, about truthfulness in marriage and the wackiness and total inhibition in childhood. It even has a screwball set-up, if not quite the overall pay-off: Cary Grant plays a chemist developing a new substance meant to not only stop aging, but to reverse it and make the person young again. He's unlucky for a while, until an industrious young chimpanzee escapes the cage, mixes and matches just the right chemicals (because, eyes roll, the chimp knows just right), and dumps it in the water cooler.From then on Grant and wife Ginger Rogers keep taking what they think is the right mixture, which it isn't, with a chaser of "bitter" water. Can you say "wackiness ensues!" loud enough with exclamation? Yes and no. Yes, Grant immediately gets a "poodle" hair-cut and rides around ridiculously stunning and bubble-headed Marilyn Monroe around in a young-person's car, speeding and crashing. Yes, Rogers wants to dance and dance despite her poor husband (who can only see without glasses with that youth juice working full-tilt), and goes maniacal with it. And yes, the climax- which is, arguably, the real howler of the movie and one of the funniest set-pieces of Hawks' comedies- features Grant in ridiculously racist Indian garb scalping the man he thinks kissed his wife once.But then again, there's some scenes where it's just the typical plot moving along, and with some scenes of the screwball and just plain cutesy variety becoming a little grating. When Rogers finds the baby after waking up, thinking it's her dear husband, she panics and takes him/her back to the laboratory to see if she can give it a nap and re-emerge her brilliant husband. It's all too silly, and also distracts from that otherwise amazing finale. Maybe it's a case of Hawks' motto- three good scenes, no bad ones- being taken to a somewhat logical conclusion: no bad scenes, just OK ones. It's standard fun that isn't very ambitious, and relies heavily on its two stars, who are, thankfully, very well-suited in their parts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If a room full of monkeys will eventually generate the works of Shakespeare, who's to blame for this?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's ironic that the MacGuffin of Howard Hawks' Monkey Business is a pharmaceutical 'fountain of youth,' as the film increasingly appears a tailor-made project designed to reignite the spark of genius of his past zany screwball collaborations with Cary Grant (with Grant even portraying another absent-minded professor with an animal co-star here, a-la Bringing Up Baby). On paper, everything was in place: an intriguing, and even topical premise, with the 1950s demonstrating an increasing cultural obsession with 'wonder drugs,' sterling co-stars, both established (Ginger? As in 'Fred and Ginger'?!) and new (why hello there, Miss Monroe!), and Hawks, one of the most acclaimed directors of his age. Surely Monkey Business was primed to be the most rip-roaring comedy of its time, the new pinnacle of the screwball heyday. Wasn't it? Sadly, the film itself offers a poignant metaphor for its construction: Grant's scientist, toiling away at his wonder drug, has all the right ingredients, but can't seem to cobble them together in a way to get the desired result. The film's script and editing feel rushed and piecemeal, with the film lurching between scene to scene with minimal cohesion, giving the impression the script was being constantly reworked on set (hardly an unusual practice in Classical Hollywood, but seldom this evident). Even the normally flawless Hawks flounders directorially, struggling to settle on a tone (zany or deadpan?), and settling on a languid, meandering pace that doesn't seem to fit the increasingly wacky mischief, making Grant and Rogers' youthful running wild feel oddly polite and strained. This is not to say that all is lost: the script blurts out some audaciously risqué and clever one- liners here and there, and the central premise remains novel enough to yield comedic mileage aplenty. The antics of Grant and Rogers gleefully suffering the effects of his anti-aging serum do offer moments of exquisite comedic timing (Rogers' titter when surreptitiously sliding a goldfish down Charles Coburn's pants is a comedic sight gag for the ages). On the other hand, they also forcibly rub many particularly, cringe-worthily antiquated comedic bellyflops in the viewer's face. A scene of Ginger Rogers dismissing very founded allegations of spousal abuse played off as a joke? An excruciatingly long sequence of Grant, regressed to full- fledged boyhood, painting his face and "playing Injun", whoop-whoop-whooping and all? Yeesh. It's moments like these that make contemporary viewers leery of watching "old movies". As the film ambles along to its madcap finale, Hawks finally hits his stride, delivering a climax of amiably memorable chaos, including Rogers mistaking her husband as having literally regressed into a baby, and a lab full of stuffy scientists, cackling, having a water fight while swinging from chandeliers. If the film as a whole had tapped into this same sense of energetic lunacy, Monkey Business might have lived up to its name. Instead, we conclude with a trite, disingenuous monologue about the benefits of age and maturity that feels so slapped on by the Hays Code the lens is practically clouded by the fingerprints of Joseph Breen. The audience subsequently departs feeling like the titular monkeys may have been left in charge of the editing suite. It's hard to imagine a more appropriate actor to meld bumbling pomposity with youthful sprightliness than Cary Grant, but even the screwball king is not immune to the off-kilter feeling pervading the film. The film's opening, an inspired breach of the fourth wall, has Grant attempting to walk into the scene, halted by an offscreen voice (Hawks himself, in an odd cameo) intoning "Not yet, Cary", proves oddly prophetic, as Cary never appears to be fully present in a scene, delivering his perfectly precise zingers and customary tumbling in an oddly distant, disinterested manner. While it's true that Grant on autopilot is still a more capable comedian than most others at their best, the feeling that he's never really enjoying himself certainly doesn't help the audience do so. As such, it's left to Ginger Rogers to steal the show with a hugely commanding presence, sliding between heartwarmingly caring wife to mischievously destructive, pouty girl (and the only cast member to convincingly tap into the quirks and nuances of portraying a child). The early scenes of Rogers gently coaxing the absentminded Grant into remembering to leave through the door before locking it are practically awash with a warm glow, which is perfectly shattered by her later flopping on the floor, screeching with laughter, like a caffeine-addled salmon. As support for the headliners, Charles Coburn maintains his reputation as cinema's best blusterer as Grant's hem-hemming CEO, and, though it's disappointing for Marilyn Monroe to have little to do other than suffer objectification jokes on her behalf, she still plays the wide- eyed airhead stereotype with as much class and coy timing as possible. Ultimately, however, the clear runaway star of the show is Esther the chimpanzee. The unfathomably choreographed scenes of her physical comedy interactions with the cast, and later sequences of her serenely mixing chemicals with a fluidity that would put Gene Kelly to shame, are the few moments where the film achieves an almost transcendent fascination, never to be seen in the loathsome subsequent 'animal humour' comedies polluting the 80s and onward.While Monkey Business may fizzle rather than crackle considering the almost intimidating array of talent on display, there are still many throwaway bits where the stars momentarily align and offer comedic gold. Screwball fans willing to indulge the film's somewhat lumbering tempo and wince-worthy 'product of its time' breaches of political correctness will still find enough zaniness on display to cobble together a breezily enjoyable time. Otherwise, viewers with a more sensitive palate will find the film rather like its youth serum: rather bitter, and resulting in a fairly obnoxious and forgettable cacophony of adults who should know better. -6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Screwball Retread from Howard Hawks Boasts Strong Talent But Few Peaks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The shadow of Howard Hawks' earlier screwball classic, 1938's "Bringing Up Baby", hovers over this equally inane 1952 farce like a dark, foreboding cloud. In his fifth and final collaboration with Hawks, Cary Grant plays a very similar character to the bespectacled, absent-minded paleontologist he played in the earlier film. This time, he plays a bespectacled, absent-minded pharmaceutical scientist named Barnaby Fulton who is on the verge of discovering a fountain-of-youth elixir in his laboratory when a hyperactive chimpanzee takes seizes the formula and pours it in the water cooler (thus the movie's title). The inevitable comic shenanigans ensue. While there are sporadic laughs throughout, the film's underlying problem has less to do with the preposterous storyline (scripted by the veteran trio of Ben Hecht, Charles Lederer, and Billy Wilder's constant partner I.A.L. Diamond) than it does with the uneven pacing and a palpable lack of the genuine manic energy that marked the earlier film as well as Hawks' other great Grant film, 1940's "His Girl Friday".Much of the comedy comes from how Barnaby and his wife Edwina revert back to adolescence once they drink the elixir. He starts acting like a twenty-year-old - getting a crewcut, wearing a loud plaid jacket and driving a sports car convertible at breakneck speed. What's worse, he has his boss' curvaceous secretary Miss Laurel join him for the hi-jinks, and she is more than willing to accommodate. Edwina sees the after-effects and drinks the elixir herself as a test subject. She reverts to her high school years and entices her old flame Hank Entwhistle to believe she wants a divorce. Meanwhile, all hell breaks loose at the laboratory when everyone drinks from the water cooler and reverts to a second childhood. Barnaby and Edwina end up throwing paint on each other at which point Barnaby plots to seek revenge on Hank whom he thinks is running off with Edwina. It all ends in pretty ridiculous fashion with the inevitable results.By this point in his career, the 48-year-old Grant could sleepwalk through a role like this. Fortunately, he is better than that, though the devil-may-care energy he had in "Baby" and "Friday" is missing until he reverts to his childhood. A brassy personality by nature, Ginger Rogers seems strangely restrained as Edwina until she moves dexterously into the childish manner she used to better effect in "The Major and the Minor". Hawks likes to recycle bits from his earlier movies, for instance, the contrived scene where Edwina wears a backless apron over a black slip much to Barnaby's chagrin when Hank comes over. This is a virtual replay of the country club scene where Grant inadvertently rips the back of Katharine Hepburn's gown. It's just not funny this time.Charles Coburn plays his blustery self as Barnaby's merciless boss, while Hugh Marlowe as Hank repeats the pompous ignorance he displayed so well as the na?ve playwright in "All About Eve". As the vacuous Miss Laurel, Marilyn Monroe has a smallish role and is relegated to some silly lines to emphasize her dumb-blonde character. However, when she joins Grant for his juvenile delinquent escapade, whether on roller skates or poolside in a form-fitting swimsuit, she is so beautiful and vibrantly alive that her future seems completely assured in this early role. There are three extra features on the 2002 DVD - the original theatrical trailer, a twenty-picture stills gallery with some production shots of Monroe, and a brief restoration comparison details the work done to restore the film back to its original quality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grant at his screwball best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cary Grant and Ginger Rogers go back to their childhoods in "Monkey Business," about a youth formula mixed up by a monkey. It's a real '30s screwball comedy in the hands of three masters - Howard Hawks, Grant, and Rogers, and the concept is a funny one, even if it does get a bit tedious.Marilyn Monroe is delicious in a supporting role as a secretary who can't type. Hugh Marlowe and Charles Coburn are the straight men - Coburn is the head of the company that wants Grant's formula, except that Grant's formula is worthless. When his back was turned, one of his experimental monkeys mixed up the magic concoction and dropped it in the water cooler. After a glass, Grant becomes a college kid again and takes Monroe on a whirl. Then Rogers uses the water to make coffee...It's amazing that Grant was still making these movies twenty years after he started, but he's as agile as ever. This is a fun watch and of great interest because of Monroe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny, Funny, Funny...Ginger Rogers does it again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those films you could watch over and over. It never gets old.Just about all of Ginger Rogers comedy films are pretty close to this one in terms of laugh-ability. She found her niche after leaving the dancing films of the 30's. She and everyone else found out that she, along with Carole Lombarde, was a true wise cracking comedienne. You can see where Lucille Ball got some of her persona. She just shines in this one.It starts off with a chemist, played by Cary Grant, is on his way to a dance with his wife and he just goes off into space at the front door. He's a smart guy and his wife loves him dearly for it. He loses track of what he was suppose to do (going to a dance/party) but that's OK with his wife. She would rather be with him anyhow. He's working on a formula to make people feel young again and he can't concentrate on anything else.From this you'll get some seriously funny scenes of Ginger Rogers and Cary Grant not acting their age. A lab chimp gets out of it's cage and comes up with the formula they've been trying to figure out and dumps it into the lab water cooler. They mistakenly take the formula they make and it doesn't taste too good so they drink some water...from the cooler. It's chaos from her on in.Let's give Cary Grant some credit to. The end of the film where he plays Cowboys and Indians with a bunch of school-kids is just hysterical. For laughs, it easily matches anything on film from these days.Ms. Monroe is in this one also and she's a side note but she does the job fairly well. It's easy to see why everyone watched her for her looks and Ginger Rogers for her ability to entertain. Ginger Rogers was in a league of her own.Folks, it just doesn't get much funnier than this one. Grab your friends and plop yourself down on the couch and give this one a whirl. You'll see the same thing I saw...funny.</fullReview>

It was a part for Rosalind Russell.Charles Coburn, superb character actor, does all that was required of him.But the monkey, how did he manage to remove the lock to his cage then all in one take cross to the laboratory bench and confidently manipulate the various beakers and containers?

		<shortDescription>Too much monkey business</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlikely comedy centred on Cary Grant's bumbling chemist's attempts to find an elixir of youth, which by its end sees just about every cast member regressed to childhood. Throw in some interaction with a mischievous chimpanzee, which even more improbably creates the anti-ageing formula and then mixes it with the water-dispenser in Grant's laboratory, for everyone naturally drinks from, and there's the supposed recipe for a no doubt expected hilarious farce.Only, it never really gets off the ground. I didn't like the too-smart-by-half opening scene, where Hawks ambitiously cuts away the wall between viewer and the actors by voicing-over directions to "Cary Grant" and while both Cary and co-star Ginger Rogers, both no strangers to slapstick, try hard, it resolutely failed to tickle my funny bone. In truth, it all seems rather forced and mannered, everyone acts as if they've been told to act funny rather than feeling the comedy.A very buxom-looking Marilyn Munroe gets a fairly chunky supporting part as a dumb secretary obviously employed for her looks, but even she barely registers in the memory apart from when she flashes some leg at Grant early in the piece. With the normally funny writing team of Ben Hecht and Charles Lederer handling the screenplay and Howard Hawks behind the camera, you might reasonably have expected a regular laugh-fest, but sadly for this fan of most of the above, this late example of a "screwball comedy", has too few screws loose to entertain humorously</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>this is NOT a Marilyn Monroe movie----don't believe the studio hype!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I went to the listing for this movie on IMDb, it featured a movie image (usually from the DVD or video box) and this picture irritated me to no end! It seems that this MUST be a Marilyn Monroe film, as she's the only one in the picture. That is very odd, as she is definitely a supporting character and it is definitely a Cary Grant and Ginger Rogers flick! I hate when studio PR men play games with movies to try to fool the public--especially in this case, as I almost always prefer to watch a Cary Grant movie over a Marilyn Monroe one--he was such a consummate professional and his movies almost never failed to please.The movie is played for laughs, as Grant is working on a formula to make people feel more youthful. He and his wife, Rogers, take the formula and act like young whippersnappers. It's a lot of fun to watch and a rather inconsequential film--but well worth watching for Cary Grant fans and fans of the classical age of Hollywood. The only negatives are that occasionally the acting young sequences went a little "over the top"--they were so silly that they were also a tad tiresome BUT not enough to make you want to skip it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the great screwball comedies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With Cary Grant, Ginger Rodgers, Charles Coburn and a young Marilyn Monroe this hilarious testament to the great screwball comedies is worth it's weight in gold. Far funnier and more delectable than the paltry Hollywood comedies (i.e. Adam Sandler) that grace theaters these days, this gem filmed in black and white is a model of a great genre.Directed with mercurial class by Howard Hawkes and featuring the great Ben Hecht among the screenwriters, this 1952 comedy has a zany but totally logical premise. All the players simply shine in the material; especially Grant and Rodgers who do hilarious takeoffs on becoming and behaving like children.I find comments made here concerning the political incorrectness of the cowboy and Indian scene to be laughable. Why do modern movie goers judge a movie 50 years old by current standards. I was born in 1950 and every kid on the block all over the USA played cowboys and Indians. It wasn't politically incorrect in 1952; it was in fact, part of the mainstream socio-cultural structure. Shall we not play "The Merchant of Venice" because Shakespeare's Shylock is anti-semetic. I'm reminded of how ludicrous "Pearl Harbor" was with none of the sailors smoking because it's "politically incorrect" these days. One must put the time and context of certain works of art in perspective. Frankly, the cowboy and Indian sequence is one of the funniest in the movie and very true to the 1950's. Anyway, enough of that diatribe. Run out and see this movie. It'll make you laugh! Guaranteed!</fullReview>

It's hard to believe that's actually a monkey.Ginger Rogers always seems to be a better actress when she's not with Fred Astaire, for some reason. And Cary Grant is always a good goof.There is one uncomfortable scene (very un-PC) for a modern audience about a group of children playing cowboys and Indians, which may have kept this movie from being in the pantheon of classic screwball comedies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Monkey Business was very-Very-VERY bad comedy. This movie was garbage.Both of the aging actors, Cary Grant and Ginger Rogers gave terrible, "phone-in" performances. These 2 were a good part of the reason why this 1952 Comedy fell flat on its face into the muck of movies that are best left unwatched.Aside from the cast member of Esther, a mischievous, little chimp, it was Marilyn Monroe who was the only human actor worth any notice in this picture.Since it has been said that director Howard Hawks saw no talent in Monroe, she was wasted and reduced to playing the nothing-part of a clueless, blond, bimbo secretary who frequently showed off her legs and naively flirted with anyone in pants.This film has Esther, the chimp, (all alone in the lab) escaping from her cage (and imitating what she's seen the professor (Grant) doing), she starts mixing random chemicals together into a large beaker.As it turns out, this monkey's concoction of chemicals has a miraculous rejuvenating effect for which the professor has long been searching.Esther pours this mixture into the lab's water-cooler tank, and, it's at this point that (with everyone completely unaware of what Esther has done) all of the fun is supposed to start when the professor (as well as his wife) drink down the formula.Both Grant and Rogers put in such bad performances as the rejuvenated couple that this film's intended humor fizzled away long before it even got started.I can't believe that I actually wasted away 90 minutes of my time watching this very-Very-VERY bad garbage movie.</fullReview>

In true Hawksian fashion, the keyword is 'screwball.' That means one absurd moment gets piled on top of the next. Until all of a sudden, all heck breaks loose and a comic free-for-all ensues. In this picture, the leads play a couple that seem to be growing old as well as growing young together thanks to a rejuvenation serum. There is an uproarious sequence where Miss Rogers thinks Mr. Grant has become a baby. Charles Coburn costars as the meddling boss, and Marilyn Monroe is the secretary who must find someone who can type his correspondence. (Coburn and Monroe would re-team later in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, continuing their version of a perversely funny couple.)Careful, there's a banana peel on the floor...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Considered by some to be a minor or a slight comedy, I simply love this "20th Century Fox" film. I saw it when I was very young on TV and it sparked an interest in Marilyn Monroe for me that has continued to this day. The film is fast paced and very cleverly written. The film allows all the distinguished cast involved to just really cut loose at all costs. The effect is completely hilarious. Carey Grant and the wonderful Ginger Rogers offer true comic genius. Scenes where they mentally regress to teen and child like behavior after accidentally consuming a drug mixed by a chimp in a research lab are a delight to behold.I especially liked the sequence when we first see Marilyn Monroe as Mr Oxley's secretary Miss Laurel. She is in the middle of showing Cary Grant her leg and the snag free asatate nylons he lab created. Mr. Oxley summons Carey Grant to his office. He then tells Mr Oxley he will be in his office in a minute. He is checking out Miss Laurel's Ass-a tates. (hmmm... Classic..!) The film continues to delight us in all scenes involving Marilyn. She is magnetic and mesmerizing even in this small supporting role. She even giggles beautifully and she does that in a very well done speeding car sequence. Her youthful exuberance would not be denied. Its hard to believe she would pass away just 10 years after this film was released. Its to bad her role and character weren't expanded upon a bit. Marilyns fan base and fame were rising at an alarming rate in 1951 and the studio didn't quite know what to do with her. Studio head Daryl Zanuck declared, "Put that girl in every film on our lot that requires a blonde" At this period in her career FOX was using her for little more than window dressing. Marilyn was in several light comedies between 1951 and 1954. I would recommend this film to anybody who appreciates Marilyn Monroe or good old fashioned Hollywood madcap humor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By 1952 screwball comedies were about as hip as a Stutz Bearcat with a raccoon coat and a ukulele on the rumble seat. Fortunately Howard Hawks who had already made a couple of the best in Bringing Up Baby and His Girl Friday didn't let that stop him from adding one more to the canon.Though it's light years short of the other two Monkey Business is still great entertainment and the perfect antidote to the pretentious stuff that was creeping in (The Next Voice You Hear, anyone) and attempting to hijack the purer out-and-out entertainment movies be they comedy, musical, western, thriller or drama. For this type of comedy it doesn't get better than Cary Grant and whilst Giner Rogers is no Katie Hepburn or Roz Russell she is able to hold her own against both Grant and Charles Coburn who comes close to stealing it. Even George 'foghorn' Winslow features in a wacky sequence and would, of course, feature with Monroe in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (also helmed by Hawks) a couple of years later. 92 minutes is about all the premise will stand but they are 92 crowded minutes with, at the most, five minutes of fat. Stands up well 58 years on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Screwball at a mile a minute</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the opening credits you believe that you're in for a bit of monkey business. But then, as you watch this seemingly normal, loving, albeit boring couple (Cary Grant and Ginger Rogers as Dr. and Mrs. Fulton) in the first minutes of the movie, you think to yourself "This is a screw-ball comedy?" But hang in there, because the brilliance begins when a monkey lets herself out of a cage that the cleaning man forgot to lock up and proceeds to mix up an elusive age-fighting elixir which Barnaby has been trying to discover for two years, unsuccessfully -- to the great chagrin of Barnaby's boss, Mr. Oxley, as played by Charles Coburn.Now, even when Barnaby -- who has eyes only for his wife -- operates in his "normal" state, the eyes of the young, sexy secretary (as played by Marilyn Monroe) are set firmly upon the attractive, yet absent-minded doctor. Edwina Barnaby notices this, yet, as a mature, secure wife, she only shows mild irritation towards this young lady.However, when the elixir first takes effect upon Dr. Fulton, and then Mrs. Fulton, their reactions toward this secretary -- and each other -- take quite the transformation.First, when Dr. Fulton unknowingly consumes the elixir (dumped into the water cooler), he proceeds to take the secretary out as he buys a speedster, get his hair cut into a new style, and goes swimming with Ms. Lois Laurel. However, when he hears his wife's and his song, he refuses to turn the radio channel, to Lois' disgusted chagrin. She wants Dr. Barnaby, but even in this state, he does not imbibe.Mrs. Fulton also has an admirer - Hank Entwhistle, played by Hugh Marlowe; while Edwina clearly loves her husband, she seems to dangle Hank over Barnaby's head almost as a form of insurance.Anytime Edwinda consumes the elixir, she gets a sudden fascination with fish and playing tricks with them -- upon Mr. Oxley, in particular. The prankster comes out in her, as well as the dancer, and very jealous woman.What I love is that Ginger Rogers' character actually does what every woman who has to put up with seeing unwanted advances upon her husband would love to do; she yanks Lois' hair, hits her with rubber bands, etc. It's quite funny, actually.But don't worry. Cary Grant's character gets the best revenge in the whole movie. You'll laugh out loud when you see the "scalping scene." Hank Entwhistle truly gets what he deserves for acting the vulture in this relationship.If you're looking for people to act serious and in a mature manner, then this movie is not for you. However, if you like screwball comedy, then I highly suggest this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Monkey Business</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From director Howard Hawks (His Girl Friday, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes) this film was five stars and had a good cast list, so I was going to watch it. Basically research chemist Dr. Barnaby Fulton (Cary Grant) is working on a youth formula for a chemical company, to be tested on chimps, and his wife Edwina (Golden Globe nominated Ginger Rogers) is very supportive. When chimp Esther is out of her cage she mixes her own formula, placing it in the lab's water cooler, so after taking his original and unfinished formula Barnaby drinks some water, and the trouble begins. The formula changed water has changed Barnaby's personality to that of a much younger man, eager to drive a hot sports car with Miss Lois Laurel (rising star Marilyn Monroe), and he will only change back when he falls asleep. Edwina also takes the formula, and some water, and she also changes to a much younger self loving jive dancing and looking for old flame Hank Entwhistle (Hugh Marlowe). Mr. Oliver Oxley (Gentlemen Prefer Blondes' Charles Coburn) and his assistants are trying to find the explanation for the incomplete formula, and when both Barnaby and Edwina drink the changed water together this makes it difficult. Also starring Henri Letondal as Dr. Jerome Kitzel. The players of this film together are all great, Grant and Rogers acting like kids are of course really funny, and Monroe gets her moments even in a supporting role, it is a very funny classic comedy that you can't help but love and laugh at. Marilyn Monroe was number 39, and Cary Grant number 10 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Grant was number 19 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, he was number 4 on Britain's Finest Actors, he was number 2 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, and he was number 23 on The World's Greatest Actor, Ginger Rogers was number 14, and Monroe number 6 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Women, Monroe was number 3 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols (she could have been number 1), and she was number 11 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Good Screwball</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very good Screwball comedy that is mainly carried by Cary,Marilyn and Ginger. It is just so much fun watching these legends have fun in this movie. For some reason,it looks as if Cary and Ginger look intimidated by Marilyn's beauty and presence. See it and notice this. Marilyn's role here was small but she just literally jumps off the screen! Could have been better if this film had a better Script/Screenplay. Low budget B type production yet well directed. The Cinematography was also only of fair quality. Only for Screwball comedy fans and big fans of the lead actors.......</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would have liked this movie were it not for Ginger Rogers. She is so painfully annoying from start to finish, I wanted to scream. After consuming her first dose of the formula... Oh what an absolute disaster. She is whiny and irritating to the point that I wonder how any man agreed to marry her in the first place. Had I not known that she was such a brilliant dancer before this movie, I would say that her skills in this area are clumsy and embarrassing. I would have been laughing as an innocent bystander watching her gallop around the dance floor. She only seems like a drunken fool rolling around on the floor then weeping before locking her husband out of the honeymoon suite she insisted on staying in. And, to top it all off, we find out that she called her ex beau (who she continues to contact throughout the movie to arouse jealousy) accusing her husband of abuse. All of this disaster is lightly sloughed off by her the next day as angry reporters, mother and ex boyfriend are infiltrating their house and interrogating her husband. Yet, he doesn't even seem in the slightest bit bothered with her. How unrealistic. I cannot believe this garbage actually made it through the screening process of production.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting Cast Mix</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A funny, sort of silly, movie, but worth seeing. It has a most interesting mix of cast members: Cary Grant, Ginger Rogers, Charles Coburn, and Marilyn Monroe. It's surprising, but they actually work well together. The script is good, although the story is ridiculous. Grant and Rogers make a great couple. It should have been filmed in color. Being in black-and-white indicates to me that the production company did not expect great things from this movie and wanted to keep the costs down. Its popularity probably surprised the studio. I did not expect to enjoy the movie as much as I did. I probably liked it primarily because of Grant and Rogers, and because Howard Hawks directed it. I don't believe I've seen a Hawks movie that I didn't like.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cary Grant and Marilyn Monroe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Because of the up and coming talent of Marilyn Monroe, you almost forgot that Ginger Rogers also appeared in this film. The encounter between Grant and his secretary (Monroe) where she bears him her leg is probably the most memorable part of the film. Although it's not a film that you would want to watch again and again, it does deserve some merit because Grant was teamed up with Monroe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Was Funny Then May Not Be Now</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Time has heavily taken its toll on the funny quotient of this screwball farce. Cary Grant plays a scientist who invents a formula that makes animals younger; a chimpanzee in his lab puts it in the water cooler and chaos ensues. Ginger Rogers as Grant's wife lacks much chemistry with her co-star and both roles seem demeaning to both actors. Grant has better chemistry with starlet (at the time) Marilyn Monroe, expertly portraying a ditzy secretary. Their big scene in a car produces some good laughs. But when Monroe disappears for long stretches, the film falters and becomes labored and sillier. A most politically incorrect sequence has Grant (in his child-mode) and a bunch of children portraying Indians and tying up Roger's ex-boyfriend (Hugh Marlowe) to a tree and almost scalping him. Tasteless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Monkey Business Goes Totally Ape *1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One or two steps above awful best describes this 1952 comedy farce. Despite a wonderful cast, the writing certainly does this ridiculous film in. Chemist Cary Grant is married to economics major Ginger Rogers.While experimenting with a formula, Grant takes some of it and the supposed hilarity begins. Ditto for Rogers taking it as well and the couple revert to silliness, talking about past men and ladies they knew and all other sorts of nonsense.The best part is probably where Grant, under the influence of the chemical, takes Charles Coburn's secretary for a whirlwind ride. It was said that both director Howard Hawkes and Grant saw no talent in Monroe. Of course they didn't. There was no picture here to speak of.The ending sequence with the baby is even more ridiculous and the only part that was also good was when The End appeared on the screen. Hopeless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marilyn shines; the film doesn't.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cary Grant &amp; Ginger Rogers are totally miscast (or possibly they just didn't play well off each other) in this screwball about a professor (Grant) who invents a youth serum. They only bright spot is a supporting role by Marilyn Monroe as the secretary. stanhejl@netscape.net</fullReview>
