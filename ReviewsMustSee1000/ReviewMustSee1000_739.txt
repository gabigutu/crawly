		<fullReview>Strings, at it's simplest level, is a dark fairy tale of the Brother's Grimm variety. The film begins with a King writing his final message before he kills himself, asking his son to take up his crown and strive for peace between his people and the rebellious enemy of the nation. However the King's evil brother finds the note first, and wanting to get rid of the son, and also wipe out the rebel faction, he concocts a plot to achieve his goal, and claim the throne for himself. The son soon finds himself an outcast from his land, and learns some shocking truths, whilst also falling in love. Sort of Snow White meets Gormenghast, the tale itself is nothing new. What makes this film different is the style in which it is presented. The characters are all puppets.Now, this isn't the first puppet film to have hit the screen. In the past there have been various attempts, most recently the spoof Team America. However, in all the films before the puppets were used to represent humans. Here, in Strings, the fact that they are marionettes is integral to the tale, and the strings that hold them are as important as the characters. Each of them are aware of these cords, and they play such a huge part in every scene, and in the grand design of the whole thing. The details such as the city gate being just a piece of stone which is lifted to a high level, preventing the strings from passing, thus stopping anyone entering or leaving. The prison which is a simple grid of beams at a height, leading to some poignant moments when an imprisoned family can see each other, but cannot touch. Fights are enacted where the intention is to sever someone's cords. A child's birth is a different affair, with the baby being carved first before the strings themselves can be attached. Truly imaginative, and quite a high concept, yet working so well.The marionettes are not the detailed dolls that Team America gave us. The only facial movements here are the eyes which open and close. This could have presented a problem, but thanks to the marvelous animation of the wooden puppets, and some passionate voice casting, it doesn't. There is never any confusion as to who is speaking, and what is going on, as the film presents us with wonderfully conceived scene after scene. Some elements are beautiful and touching, such as an underwater rescue, or the aforementioned birth scene. Some are quite shocking, but without being upsetting. Burning string has never seemed so dark until now.This is possibly one of the freshest, most creative films of recent years, and is another example of someone doing something new with a genre. Visually superb, and wonderfully played out, the only concern is where the market actually lies for this kind of film. As a kids story it is very mature and dark, and as a mature film, the puppetry is a little alienating to the masses. Instead this film lies somewhere between the two, and if you can cope with a delightful tale, with poignant moments, enacted by some of the best 'classic' puppetry you would ever see, then go and take a seat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A unique take on the fantasy genre with puppets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie at the Norwegian International Film Festival, and I was totally blown away. The atmosphere, world and characters this movie introduces you to feels so incredibly unique and extraordinary.The most brilliant thing, however, is the fact that instead of editing out the strings, or pretending that they're not there, they use the strings as a sort of...lifeforce.. If somebody looses their head-string, they're dead. This simple fact made the world seem even more real, and suddenly made the puppets into something living.If I had to say anything negative about this movie at all, it's the fact that since the mouths of the puppets aren't moving when they're talking it's a bit difficult to get into at first. I found myself confused in the beginning as to whom it was that was talking, but I guess this is just the nature of movies that use puppets like these.I couldn't recommend this movie any stronger than I do. Pray that this gets a US distributor, because as of now it's not picked up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I happened upon this film the other night, fresh (!) back in Phuket from Burma. Tired though I was, and the film was perhaps a quarter of the way through, I was absolutely mesmerised by it.First, I was trying to guess the actors' voices. Second, I was captivated by the ? don't laugh ? "acting" skills of the marionettes.Granted, there were no facial expressions, no morphing/animatronics/etc but still there was a warmth to these carved blocks of wood. BTW I was brought up watching Gerry Anderson (Thunderbirds, et al) and now realise that I have retained a soft spot for filmic puppetry.Perhaps that is part of the attraction of the film for me, the fact that it is reminiscent of half a dozen long-forgotten puppet programmes ? generally from Eastern Europe, as I recall ? shown during the school holidays when it was probably raining.Gentle ? despite the violence in the story ? moving and entrancing.Watch it if you can ? through child's eyes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the world of modern films showing you the realistic nature of violence, this film is a peaceful moment for your soul, allowing you to see the beauty of life. The story is neither complicated, nor exciting, but it's not a drawback. You can feel just by looking at the puppet whether he or she is "good" or "bad", and you can guess how the tale will end. We see a true tale, in an enchanted world of small details and simply-big thoughts: tears are rain, strings are life-force, freedom can be reached, loved ones are connected. We are falling into the screen, into this fantasy world, smilingly. People need tales. (Zita)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Puppets like you've never seen them</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For all those who say "I'm too old for puppet theater" I can only say "Think again".The story might not be the most original (though it is leaps and bounds more complex and consistent than most of the actual blockbuster) but the directing and effects are simply beautiful.The original part in the film is indeed that the puppets know of their strings and live and play with them. As another commenter says, the film does not try to hide the strings, but it does hide the puppeteers. Part of the mystery of the film is where the strings come from (and here you have several great shots and effects).I can only recommend the film, but I doubt it will run in too many big cinemas (I saw it in the Edinburgh Filmhouse)...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strings you along nicely......,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Strings" is quite a unique and interesting movie going experience. This just happens to be one of those movies I had never heard of before that I ran across doing research, and decided to give it a shot. My biggest problem with Strings is that the puppets do not move their mouths, which made it a little hard to follow as the dialogue as it switched back and forth between characters. Once your able to get past that - this is really a beautiful little film. A little over-dramatic but with some pretty high production values, "Strings" is unlike no movie you have seen before. The cinematography, voice overs, and set designs are well done and very pleasing to watch and to listen to all throughout.One thing I enjoyed about "Strings" was the how the actual strings were incorporated in the movie. There is no effort to hide them. In fact, the strings themselves are part of each characters actual being, reaching all the way up in to the sky with the "head" string being the strongest and most valuable. Cut the head string, and your dead! Get a little to playful, and you might get tangled and need some help getting undone! Interesting little concept. Strings is a fantasy story about a King who commits suicide, leaving the thrown to his son. When his son is lead to believe by his evil uncle that some outside rebels are responsible for his death, he seeks out to find them and avenge his father. In the process he goes on a magical journey, learning about life, love, war, and the fact that people and things aren't always quite what they seem. "Strings" is a film that stands on its own two feet- apart from anything else out there. All in all, it's a very impressive piece of work- and a good family oriented film. Recommended!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The whole concept of strings interested me from the start, I'll admit i have a strange fascination with puppets anyway from somewhere unknown, i think probably Fraggle rock and that sort of thing which was re-established when i saw 'being john Malkovich' with the beautifully worked string puppets.but anyway the whole concept of the strings being part of the puppet i found really enthralling, like they weren't quite in control of their own movements as we feel we aren't. the mystical scenes of the sky with strings in looked awesome.the opening scene really captures your attention and you feel so much empathy towards the king that you forget he is a piece of wood and treat him as human from the start.i was really intrigued with the explanations of birth and death and think they really added to make the universe seem believable.on the whole the story was kind of predictable but in a classical fantasy way really worked in the new context. the design of all the surroundings was breathtaking, i think this would be great for kids also, despite the lack of happiness within the story</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unique and innovative - but slightly dull</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hadn't heard anything about this (Danish!) movie until a friend brought over a DVD he'd ordered from Thailand, of all places! (Available from www.ethaicd.com.) Four of us watched it and agreed that it was interesting, unique and original, but also rather dull. The story is a stereotypical (but very decent) fantasy fairy-tale, with the very interesting added element of the "stringed puppet reality". It worked very well, with a quite serious and emotional story a bit reminiscent of Gormenghast - all immensely well produced. But it wasn't engaging enough to maintain that much enthusiasm in the viewer. It was a bit too dark to be for children, and somewhat too, I dunno, uninvolving to be for grown-ups. I appreciate it as an honest, very competently produced fantasy movie with a detailed and good-looking but also quite crude and limited universe.I do think it would be more engaging on the big screen than on a TV screen, because I was slightly bored through much of it. Granted, I was a bit tired when we watched it, and this is not a movie one should watch while tired. But it was a very interesting experience.7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a world of marionettes- the king of a great kingdom writes to his son, giving him the throne, asking him to find peace with their mortal enemies and warning against the evil of the king's brother. The king then commits suicide by cutting his head string. Unfortunately the king's act was discovered by his evil brother and the suicide is rearranged as a murder, the perpetrator members of the very enemy the king had wanted to find peace with. The Brother then sets in motion a vile plan to kill his nephew and seize the throne for himself.So begins one of the most unique films I've ever seen. Sure there have been puppet films before, but none that I've seen that have ever embraced their limitations so well that they turn them into an asset. Yes you see the strings, actually the strings are even more noticeable then they would be in a real live puppet show (and yes the characters are very aware that they have strings). The reasoning is two fold, first it creates a wonderful visual motif at times with shots using the strings to create beautiful images such as emphasizing a rain storm or the bars of a prison. The strings also are used symbolically to allude to how we are all connected, how we are often on a leash and how there may be forces (god/puppeteers) above us. Its amazing.The best thing is that it's a great story. This is grand fantasy or grand adventure of the highest order. What happens is very human as we are forced to confront what we are told is the truth which often turns out not to be the case. It's a story of greed and hope, how your worst enemy can be your best friend, and how the sins of the fathers need not be visited on the sons. There is real pain and real danger. If this were a novel it would be a classic of the genre. Trust me I sat on the floor of my living room doing some sorting, totally and completely enraptured by what was going on because even when I wasn't looking up I was listening to a well acted (Derek Jacobi as the villain) and fantastically written story. It's the type of tale you'd curl up with on a cold winter's night before going to bed.Yea, I liked the film.If you want to see a great adventure, a great story, see this movie. Please don not let the fact that its marionettes keep you from seeing it. This is not for kids, or rather too small ones, since there is death and darkness, and a plot that maybe hard for them to follow. It's a kick in the head and there's a chance, at the end that maybe it will even cause a tear to run down your cheek.See it if you get the chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great and ashame never a theatrical release in U.S.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just recently saw this movie at the Fantastic Fest in Austin, TX, and I was blown away. One of the best and most original movies i've seen. Usually puppet movies would just pretend the strings weren't there but this movie gives life to the strings, its actually what gives them life. If thinking of seeing it. The story is great, reminds me of the Shakespeare story of I Henry IV where the prince Hal (also name of the prince in Strings) overcomes his weak character of the beginning and becomes this Christ like figure and saves the day by the end of the story. SEE IT and then get its name out there more and perhaps can get it a small theatrical release in the U.S. and other places so more people can see this great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Superior Film Than, Say, The Dark Crystal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The king commits suicide, but his evil brother covers it up to make the death look like murder from a rival faction. The prince disguises himself as a slave to go out and avenge his father's death, but after infiltrating the "enemy" camp, begins to learn an alternate history of his people -- sometimes the good guys have a dark past.This film was incredible. You very rarely see a film with puppets in it these days (or ever, really). Sure, there was "Team America", but I really found the puppeteering on that to be average and the overall film to be a waste of time. This one had a rich back story, characters with epic lives and a whole realm of fantasy that could have been real life.I think of the movie like "The Dark Crystal". I don't know why, but I get a similar vibe from them. With one key difference: I don't like "The Dark Crystal". Other films could be compared to this, I suppose: "Lord of the Rings" to some extent, maybe "Willow", probably a hundred more. It had all the classic fantasy elements: a hero, a kingdom, love, betrayal, evil, an oracle, battles. Everything you'd want.There was an underlying political message here, too, which I enjoyed although I don't know if I really got the exact parallel they were shooting for. But the idea that "we" are always the goo guys and "they" are always the bad guys when not viewed as people was very nice, and could be used to talk about America and the Middle East (or the Native Americans), it could be used to talk about Israel and Palestine, or just about any other rival groups.The love aspects were a bit much at times. I liked the idea that our strings are all attached and that love really makes that stronger. I tend to agree with the sentiment. At times I think it bordered on hippie or New Age levels (my ability to digest peace and love only goes so far). But, it was never so much I became uninterested in the film.If you want something different than your usual action or romance, give this one a chance. You might have to open your mind a little bit because it's fantasy and puppets and voice-overs (not just because they're puppets, they're also Scandinavian). I think you'll find a special treat in here. Really glad I had the opportunity to catch it at a friend's house, as I probably never would have found it on my own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie, is one of those, you must NOT miss, if you appreciate wonderful pictures and a beautiful atmosphere. The scenes and environment was what hooked me. One glance at the backgrounds and the detail level is enough to make you beg for more. The story is okay, it is not fantastic, but I think it's well told. The concept of this movie is fully thought through bit for bit, it is revealing the ground rules for a world, where everyone is bound by strings, like a little world inside a box, but still it's a whole new gigantic world like on another planet. The sound and sound score is perfect, it gives this film, the last bit of atmosphere. It has already become one of my favourites, and there is no film like this one out there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Technically original stunning; a shame the story isn't?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Strings Directed by Anders R?nnow-Klarlund (2004) The young prince Hal seeks to avenge his father, the king, for the murder made against him. This means travelling in disguise to infiltrate the enemy camp. But his journey brings him another truth than the one he original was seeking after.This is one of the most original Danish movies made in a long time. Never has there been a Danish movie featuring only puppets as the actors of the movie. The technical element of the movie is great. Brilliantly cinematography means that this movie is captured as another "live action movie" in its genre. The art-direction is beautiful and fits the puppets very well. The sound effects-/monologue editing is superb and helps create a great atmosphere, along together with the above-mentioned aspects.This means that it is a pity the story isn't nearly as original as the technical aspects. It is a very typical fantasy/adventure bringing no big surprises. It is shaped very dramatically, leaving no form for humour or funny sidekicks in the movie. This serious take at the story can be pretty linear at times, but if you have the patience to watch through this it can be interpreted as a good sign. Another shame is that there are no facial expression on the puppets, unlike other puppet movies like Team America: World Police. The puppets have the same expression on their faces through the whole movie; which doesn't help the emotional part of the movie.The movie has some weak points, but even though it is still a good movie, and a very original and refreshingly technical take on the puppet movie genre.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unoriginal story in an inventive-style-idea movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Strings" is both ordinary and original. First the bad things about the movie: The story is old and had been used too many times before. It's the well-known "king dies, brother is evil, son has to be the hero"-plot. Besides the dialogs are so terribly dorky and ridiculous. Now the good things: The strings of the puppets are included in the world and in the plot of the movie, which gives the film a clever and remarkable touch. Furthermore the plot contains some unexpected twists, which improve the otherwise boring story. Some well directed fighting scenes at the end of the movie give the movie the style, which it needs to be be unique. All these elements manage to keep the movie above the average and let the movie get better the longer it lasts.One thing is clear: The movie wouldn't work even half as well without the idea of including the strings and puppets as it finally does. Still the wannabe dramatic dialogs and the too often used story keep the movie far away from being called a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting. Very interesting. But ... well, it's interesting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had expected to like this movie better than I did. After all, I live in Denmark, and "Strings" was created by a Danish Director and the production company behind it is to a large extent Danish. Furthermore, I had read several positive articles and reviews about the movie before seeing it.The whole concept is very interesting. We are watching a puppet movie, but not one where the puppets represent people. Well, yes, they do in a way, but at the same time the puppets represent puppets.The many strings that go from the various body parts of the puppets and disappear up into the heavens play a major role in the story. A puppet cannot move past any obstacle above his/her head that prevents the strings from passing. To kill a puppet you cut the "head string", and a new baby puppet is "born" when a new head string is attached to his/her head.Maybe it's my background as an engineer that makes me start to think of all the implications of these concepts. Instead of concentrating on the beautiful photography and the metaphorical side of the story (we, as humans, also have "strings" that put limitations on our freedom of movement), I'm thinking about the architectural implications, etc.The story itself is not particularly innovative. A king dies, the king's evil brother tricks the king's son into going on a mission in preparation to waging war on the neighboring puppets, the son slowly but surely determines the truth, he also falls in love, and eventually peace is restored to the land. If it weren't for the interesting puppet-contra-human aspects it would be rather boring.This is not a movie for children, because children see the story as boring and aren't able to grasp the interesting repercussions of the fact that these beings are puppets and not people.As for adults, I'm sure that many will find the movie innovative and artistic and intellectually stimulating. But then there are the people like me who try to analyze the concept to death, and find it hard to concentrate on the story, while not being particularly impressed by the story.Rennie Petersen</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is a very interesting movie ultimately for the way it was shot and produced. It has a short, simple and quite obvious plot, still all its elements combined with the intelligent way the puppets are used make it very touching and UNIQUE. The way the film deals with the strings of each puppet, how it gives life to each character you can tell they worried about certain details that makes this movie special. On the other hand, at certain times, it can have a slow pace which will almost bore you and some characters are not consistent and others are unnecessary.All in all it's a good escape from the crash boom slam we're used by Hollywood industry, still I'd say the story needs a bit of a spice.</fullReview>

The story has been done a thousand times before, and although is not a hindrance to do good work, it doesn't really amount to anything here in strings. If you do not know how this movie will end after you've watched the first 20 minutes then you haven't paid attention.

Joe was there, and Johnny West; Captain Action; whoever I could get my hands on; and I would act out my own story lines. I'd read enough comic books and classic adventure tales (not to mention mythology) and seen more than enough episodes of SUPERMAN and THE LONE RANGER and THE GREEN HORNET and CAPTAIN SCARLET by then to know how to tell my own tales. And I did. When times were tight, I made do by cutting out comic book panels and making my own paper dolls (THOR, SUPERMAN, BATMAN, etc.). What I'm getting at here is this: my drive to tell stories was very strong. Nothing could stop me. Nor was I alone. Years later, on Public Access shows, I would see guys, in their twenties, apparently driven by this selfsame desire, go so far as to videotape themselves literally playing with toy soldiers (whose various voices they provided) (and the "speaker" was literally pointed out as he "spoke"). The makers of STRINGS seem to have had everything they needed to tell a compelling story... and instead chose a clichéd hodgepodge that bored the daylights out of me.

Either the script writer or its translator should be hunted down. I went to see this on the basis that puppet films are an oddity, and may bring something interesting to the cinema. About half way through, realisation finally battered its way through my numbed brain that this was just a bad film with puppets as a gimmick to gain funding. Half the time the strings are referred to, the rest they are conveniently forgotten. I mean, how do you hide BENEATH people when you have strings attached to your head at one end and heaven at the other? And the pseudo-religious element would make even George Lucas curl into a ball and vomit in disgust. If you want to see good puppetry, watch Being John Malkovich.
