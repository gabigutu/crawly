		<shortDescription>A hauntingly beautiful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Andrew Dominik's The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, is a deliberately paced, stunningly visualized, and emotionally charged exploration of the early development of mass media celebrity in America. The film riveted my attention for two hours and 40 minutes, and has remained on my mind for several days after my viewing. Although centered on one of the iconic legends of the Old West, it is far beyond an updated reincarnation of the Western. It is an epic allegory about the development of the American cult of celebrity and the effects of this obsession on the individuals caught in its web.Visually, the film soars beyond anything that has hit the screen since Conrad Hall's final masterpiece with Road to Perdition. Roger Deakins, the cinematography genius behind The Shawshank Redemption, Kundun, and all the Cohen brothers" films since The Hudsucker Proxy, surpasses his best work. He pulls out all the stops here?intricately orchestrated changes in focus, richly textured colors, dazzling use of light sources, careful manipulations of time, powerfully significant fade-ins and fade-outs, and shots through rain, snow, and rippled old glass?to communicate the story. Deakins' contribution stands out in the railroad train robbery sequence at the beginning of the film. Clearly defined, flickering light sources and deep black shadows create a dazzling, nightmarish vision that haunts the rest of the film. This sequence alone is worth the price of admission.The richly textured, historically precise visual aspects of the film bring to mind Terrence Malick's Days of Heaven and Robert Altman's McCabe and Mrs. Miller. However, instead of the understated, "realistic" performances featured in those films, The Assassination of Jesse James?showcases powerful, yet still realistic performances by an outstanding ensemble cast.Sam Rockwell, as the not-too-bright but well-meaning Charley Ford, and Mary-Louise Parker, as Jesse's loving wife, stand out. Yet the film belongs to the two titular leads, both of whom deliver the performances of their careers and create characters filled with disturbing contradictions. Brad Pitt's Jesse James is alternately pitiable and terrifying?an affectionate, loving father, an old-before-his-time sage, an adventurous daredevil, an unrepentant bad boy, and a vicious sociopath. Casey Affleck's Robin Ford is a complex, repellent, and tragic character who challenges the audience's complicity in the undercurrents of the film.All in all, this is a great film?not for those seeking the simple pleasures of instant gratification. But definitely worth the attention of those who still believe that movies are an art form.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great but hard to sell...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you have watched the trailer and know this movie is two hours and forty minutes long you know what you are getting into and should not be disappointed. This movie delivers on every level of film making, be it cinematography, acting, or writing. Casey Affleck delivers a fantastic performance in how he portrays Robert Ford as the bright eyed fawning kid in a way so sincere it makes the audience uncomfortable even when it shouldn't. Brad Pitt underplays his part as Jesse James hitting all the right notes while never saying much. Exactly the way one would expect an outlaw to act when they have everything in the world to hide. I can't say the movie didn't FEEL two hours and forty minutes long but I never wanted it to end sooner than it did. I guess I just enjoyed the time I got to spend watching these characters for the full running time.I loved this movie. Unfortunately, a long western without action is something seemingly impossible to sell to the public these days. It would be to the advantage of the studio to sell this like The English Patient was sold 10 years ago. Just make people feel like ignorant idiots if they don't like it! As much as it pains me to say it, I think most people don't care enough to bother seeing what makes this movie so great. The only other option to make this a success is to fool them into THINKING they love the movie. I'm really curious how many folks out there that like the movie agree with me here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the most beautiful film ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been thinking of a good way to start my review, I've been pondering many opening sentences, but none of them are close enough to the point, so I've decided to just say that this film is perfect in all aspects. When the credits started to roll I didn't move at all, I sat staring at the screen just thinking about what I just watched. I was trying to understand if what I just saw was really that good, or if I was just thinking it was. The film runs at almost three hours, but never looses your attention for one second. It moves forward through dialog that is poetic, but increasingly haunting at times.First off, the performances. Brad Pitt as Jesse Jame makes you feel that he is a vulnerable person, and then at the next second he'll make you completely change all your feelings for him. He doesn't talk much in the film, but is none the less flawless. Casey Affleck as Robert Ford is in his best performance ever, makes you hate him. His character is very shaky, very nervous at times, but always seems confident of what he's doing, whether it's right of wrong. He steals most of the scenes he's in. The biggest surprise however for me was Sam Rockwell as Charley Ford, Robert's brother and Jesse's right hand man. At the beginning of the film, you think that Charley is the stupid brother and that Robert is intelligent beyond any standard Charley could reach. At the end of the film though, the roles switch. You realize that Robert has been making all the dumb decisions, and Charley has been trying to save him by covering them up and usually taking all the crap for it. His last scene was intense and beautiful. One other performance to talk about is Paul Schneider as Dick Liddil, an outlaw womanizer. His performance is somewhat comedic, but in some scenes he can be the backbone for the drama. I can easily see Pitt getting a Best Actor nomination while Affleck pulls in the Supporting Actor for the win.The musical score by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis is on par with Clint Mansell's classic Requiem for a Dream score, if not better. In the films most horrific scenes, the music turns them into something beautiful. You'll want to sit through the end credits just to hear it one more time. The music will draw you back to the film to see it again. The score also fits the tone for the most of the scenes.Andrew Dominik's direction is perfect. He uses the camera in such a unique way that you never miss anything that happens. In one of the film's best scenes, he places the camera so that you can only see Pitt's silhouette become meshed into a train's smoke and then reappear seconds later as it pops out. Dominik also wrote the entire script by himself, which really shows how versatile he is. He originally wrote the film into a 3hr and 50min cut that the studio made him trash. I can't wait to see that cut.The best thing in the film though, is Roger Deakins' cinematography. That is what you gives the feel for the film. The blurry landscapes, the wheat fields that Pitt gracefully moves through, and the greatest train robbery scene ever on film. It perfectly portrays the landscapes of the old 1800's and everything that took place there. The film is consistent with providing one memorable scene after the other. When the assassination finally happens, you'll be sitting in your chair gawking at the screen in amazement of how sudden it happens.I am very proud to say that this is now my favorite film of all time, and my definite choice for Best Picture of the year. It brings new flavor to the art-house scene and never lets you down. I recommend this film to everyone. It truly is a beautiful film.I give it a 10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pitt assassinates the Oscar competition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From writer/director Andrew Dominik comes the long titled and lengthy timed The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford starring Academy Award nominee Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck. The film in so much of its glory has both positive and negative components that make this an uneasy experience at the movies.Director Dominik has great control of the picture but when the film went into the editing room the film underwent some problems. The film never keeps the momentum to be an amazing picture. The viewer is connected for the first 15 minutes, then bored for 10, then enchanted for 45, bored for 15, then comes the anticipated climax and you think its over, then it goes on for another half hour. Dominik gives the audience the best understanding of Jesse James possible so we can become better acquainted with him but brings in an slew of different characters that, to be perfectly honest, I don't care that much about. I believe this might be a example of over character development where we get all the aspects of his life but all we want is Jesse.Last year, many critics were stating Brad Pitt gave his best performance ever in Babel however, his Jesse James is the best performance of his career by a mile. Pitt wears Jesse like an overgrown coat that you don't want to get rid of. Pitt gives the most tortured, endearing, and frightening performance of the year thus far. He makes the audience so uncomfortable and awkward yet gives off sensitivity and compassion for a very unlikable and ferocious man. If buzz builds, expect Pitt to be a huge contender at the Oscars.Casey Affleck, arguably the better actor of the Affleck clan gives the most pathetic, annoying and cowardly performance in the last ten years; and its brilliant. With his deep "admiration" for Jesse, his Robert Ford is engulfed in Jesse's presence and wants enjoy the moments with him, even if he is in fear of him. The finale is truly his show as he stretches out his acting legs and dissolves into a character you can't wait to see off-screen.The cast ensemble is a true revelation as each character as over-developed as they might be, all bring a sense of humanity, charisma, and heartbreak to their roles. Sam Rockwell who is on the verge of being a household name and coming his way to a nomination one day plays Charley Ford, brother of Robert, as magnetic as the character demands. Mary Louise Parker, who is one of the better actress' working today, goes nowhere as Jesse's wife. This is a role that is very Academy friendly, and throws it away in a her limited screen time Sam Shepard who plays the older brother of Jesse, shows fear and anguish built up in a man who yearns for emotional freedom from crime. Paul Schneider, Jeremy Renner and Garret Dillahunt all turn in exceptional performances and enhance a cast of big name stars. Expect a possible Screen Actors Cast Ensemble nod for these men.Expect a possible and much deserved cinematography nomination for the overdue Roger Deakins, which is the strongest technical aspect of the picture. Also a great score by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis is a possibility along with great costumes by Patricia Norris and perfect art direction by Janice Blackey-Goodine. The appeal is there for the film as a whole but it leaves us floating a little too often in a long river of bravery, artistry and commendation. Dominik will likely be cited for some breakthrough director awards with the picture popping up during precursors' season.Get ready for the assassination everyone knows is coming but no one can prepare for. Never has been a film that tells you the entire story in the title and can still surprise the viewer with beautiful cinematic moments.Grade: ***/****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>unbelievable!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was quite simply AMAZING! Oscar worthy performances from Affleck, Pitt, and Rockwell-Oscar worthy cinematography-Oscar worthy directing. Hate me if you want, but the pacing was perfect. I was glued to my seat. The best part about this movie is that it could have easily been a set up for failure given how slow the story is, but the tension created by each actors performance left me wanting more. The last thing the world "needs" is another typical, gun slinging western. This is by far the best movie I've seen all year.P.S. for any little Ben Affleck fans... I just have one thing to say, his brother just made him look like a joke.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing Work of Art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, does this film have style or what? The Assassination of Jesse Jamed by the Coward Robert Ford, is one of the longest titles I've ever seen for a film and the movie's run-time follows the same pattern. I have no problem with this. I would sit through a ten hour "Jesse James" because of the excellent tone given out by director Andrew Dominik. The frozen Missouri/ Kansas landscapes are a treat for the eyes. The musical score does its job: to blend into the film so subtly that I cant imagine the images on the screen without it. The narration neither detracts or adds to the tone, although there is one bit of bad editing that confused my friend as to whether the narrator was speaking or a man's voice had been dubbed poorly."Jesse James" delves deep into the inner conflicts and emotions of every character. We live with them, eat with them, and often feel their pain or their confusion. This confusion is often associated with the bi-polar nature of the film's central character, Jesse James, played by none other than Brad Pitt. Casey Affleck delivers a subtle performance here that actually becomes the most effective as the film progresses over its 160 minute running time. I hated Robert Ford for a good portion of the film, thought he was so annoying and clingy that it was a wonder Jesse James didn't kill him within the first day of their complex relationship. But then, as I sat through the so called "gruelling" running time of the film, I learned to feel for him and understand his motives and attraction for Jesse. But ultimately, his childhood, comic book worship of the famous outlaw changes.The "style" of the film is evident in the first frame of passing clouds. Roger Deacon's cinematography is the best I've seen since Conrad Hall's work in Road to Perdition, perhaps better. He is definitely winning the Oscar this year, between this and No Country For Old Men. There is a scene involving a train robbery where the visuals and utter style blew me away. The lighting and camera direction becomes more subtle and less noticeable after the train scene, but, does not lessen in quality and pure artistry. There is a topic on the IMDb message boards approaching the topic of whether certain films should be labeled "art films." Well all films are works of art, some are horrendous, some are extraordinary. Well, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is an extraordinary work of art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though Jesse James through the newspaper accounts of his exploits and through the dime novels of the day was already a legend, his immortality was sealed on April 3, 1882 by the manner of his death. The lengthy title of the film tells all or at least the official version of the story.But was that accepted version the real story? For the first time the Ford brothers, Robert and Charley, get their due. As played by Casey Affleck, Robert Ford was a most complex character indeed. Ford is shown for what he was, a moonstruck kid who was brought up on those dime novels and idolized the legendary bandit. The fact that Charley was already riding with the James gang got him into the group.After the last job the James gang pulled and the only Ford was ever in on, the Fords kind of attached themselves to Jesse James. Of course the idol is no hero. Brad Pitt plays a most unheroic Jesse.Hints of Pitt's interpretation of Jesse's character are found in the classic portrayal of Jesse James by Tyrone Power. Remember when the laconic Henry Fonda as Frank James dresses Jesse down, tells him he's getting mean, meaner every day even with some of his own gang members? Power was showing signs of it, but we see Pitt as Jesse do some really brutal and cruel things. At the same time he's a loving husband to Mary Louise Parker and doting father to his two children.As good as Pitt is I think the acting honors go to Casey Affleck. His gradual disillusion with his idol is really something to see on the screen. He becomes really scared of Pitt for reasons I won't reveal, but were definitely sufficient to want him to get Pitt. We also get to see the Fords sorry aftermath. Things did not go so well for them. Bob Ford did not quite get the acclaim he would have liked as Jesse James became bigger after death than in life.Frank James as played briefly in the beginning is an odd peripheral character in this film. The James brothers did separate some months before Jesse's death. Frank is played by Sam Shepard who has an encounter with young Bob Ford at the beginning of the film and announces to one and all, the kid creeps him out. But Jesse likes having the kid follow him around like a puppy dog to his ultimate regret.The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is a very good western and we sure don't see too many of them in these times. It's shot in an unusual color, almost like one of those sepia-tone films that were in vogue for a brief spell. The location shooting was done in western Canada and looks a whole lot more like Missouri then than Missouri does now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best so far this decade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This almost defines the oft-used term "elegiac Western". It has some of the well-worn themes of Westerns, such as the creation of Western myth vs. the cold, harsh realities. But for some reason, it never feels like anything else I've ever seen. It has a style more reminiscent of Michelangelo Antonioni than any of the great Western filmmakers. It's slow and likes to surround its characters with enormous landscapes that almost swallow them whole. But it's also not averse to close-ups. Director Dominik, who has only made one other film, Chopper, and it's been seven years since then, loves to concentrate on facial expressions, as well as body language (don't know if I've ever seen a film with this level of attention to body language, or maybe it's just not something to which I've ever been lead to pay much attention). The cast is uniformly brilliant. Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck are the titular leads, and neither has done as well. Affleck is a revelation. The supporting cast includes Sam Rockwell, Mary-Louise Parker, Jeremy Renner, Garrett Dillahunt and Paul Schneider. Andrew Dominik is the star, though. There have been plenty of successful Westerns over the past couple of decades, but I'd be hard-pressed to name a single one out that so beautifully and completely re-invents the genre. 3:10 to Yuma may well be the big money-making Western of the year, but I think history will recall it as being the year that The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford was released. It is the best film of the year so far, and will be hard to top.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Casey Affleck's has officially come into his own. Fantastic performance! Brad Pitt's performance complex and stunning as usual. Brad does not shy away from the real roles and proves time and time again what a brilliant actor he is. Roger Deakins shots are stunning, capturing the true beauty that lies within the Canadian rockies. The artistic shots through the old style glass is fantastic. Score is very unorthodox yet amazingly effective.The only downside to the film many say is the running time, but I admire that Andrew allowed for the performances of the actors to be the showcase. Many scenes with not a lot of background music, just the intense performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Execrable tedium</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit, looking at some of the other comments here I'm not sure if I and other reviewers saw the same movie. I want the mind-dulling 2:40 of my life back.Moreso than even your average Hollywood movie, this picture is overlong. Sufficiently overlong, in fact, that it makes the overblown title seem succinct in comparison; it has one of the lowest plot-to-movie-runtime ratios I have ever encountered in cinema. (And at least a film like, say, Koyaanisqatsi, does not pretend to involve plot but is more honestly a painting in motion rather than a photoplay.) I did not come into this movie expecting a typical, shoot-em-up Western. But at the same time, some hint of charisma in the portrayal of Jesse James, some hint or shadow of how one of the most famous outlaws in American history *became* famous and even revered, would have been appropriate here. This movie relies on *telling* us Jesse James is revered and having a simpering Robert Ford hanging at his heels for most of the picture like a spineless puppy dog. There is very little in the character himself to suggest even past greatness or charisma. Russell Crowe's Ben Wade in "3:10 to Yuma" illustrates -- even, and especially outside of the actual shoot-em-up scenes -- the kind of charisma, the personal presence, force of personality, what have you, that make his gang fanatically loyal to him. There is essentially no trace of this from Brad Pitt's Jesse James. If the viewer's knowledge of history and the film's many narrative assurances weren't constantly reminding us that Jesse James was a Very Great Man, you certainly wouldn't guess it from the portrayal of the character here.As for the portrayal of Robert Ford, it is overly kind to call the performance nuanced or low-key; it is so low-key that there might as well not even be any music. The character is weak, dull, uninteresting, and shows very little actual development. Essentially, he goes from being a lightly-regarded lightweight who retreats into his Jesse James fantasies to a lightly-regarded lightweight who is spurned by the object of his fantasies to a self-puffed up caricature of himself, cashing in on his notoriety (or rather, as the film might have us believe, the notoriety of Jesse James) before someone finally, mercifully ends his "story" and thus the movie.As for the other characters in this film, they are sufficiently even more forgettable that I have literally forgotten them. Large stretches of film yawn, devoid of anything happening, great empty spaces more forsaken than the Western landscapes the cinematography so lovingly dwells upon. Main characters disappear from the screen for long periods of time, and their return is heralded by a lethargic second helping of yet-increased tedium.It is true that some of the landscapes and cinematography are quite beautiful -- however, for around the price of an average movie ticket these days, one can instead go to the local chain bookstore and obtain a coffee-table picture book of lovely Western landscapes and/or national parks from the bargain bin. I would have greater respect for the camera-work and locations if they were either the backdrop for an interesting story, or the centerpiece of a more documentary work in which the open spaces themselves starred. This movie is neither -- in fact, the lingering shots seem to exist primarily to pad, both the movie's already-bloated runtime and the equally bloated and self-satisfied egos behind the excretion of this allegedly artistic work.In the end, to me, a movie may involve skillful work or some measure of importance beyond the creators' self-importance, but if it fails to somehow intrigue me or draw me in or, perhaps above all, entertain me on some level, then I judge it to be a failure. By this standard, this picture is an utter failure. It bored me with almost perfect uniformity from beginning to the end to such a degree that the only dramatic tension I experienced was whether I would literally fall asleep in the theater from sheer tedium or simply walk out of the theater in pure disgust at wasted time and money. Sadly, I did neither.In retrospect, I would rather have had three hours of my life painlessly and instantly excised from my lifespan than have my memories polluted with the remembrance of what is easily one of the most dull and flat-out worst movies I have personally experienced.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Expectation of Applause</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford" is a handsomely mounted, film-school like study of the last days of the infamous James' Gang by director Andrew Dominik. Growing up in awe of Jesse James (Brad Pitt), Robert Ford (Casey Affleck) finally gets to live out his dream of living side by side with his idol when his brother, Charles (Sam Rockwell) joins the gang. Young Robert quickly learns that the exploits of the murderous train-robbers are far from the exciting flights of fancy he grew up reading about in newspapers and dime-store novels. A series of cowardly acts in the wake of double-crossings and humiliations ultimately lead to the titular event.The style of the film is often visually arresting and downright disturbing, especially in the acts of violence, which leave the most gruesome parts slightly off camera, but are frequently shot and framed in such a way as to maximize shock value and leave an uncomfortable feeling of tension in the theater seats. Dominik sometimes relies too heavily on voice-over narration torn straight from the book upon which the film is based leaving us to assume that aside from dreadfully beautiful photography of passing clouds and desolate Midwestern landscapes, he wasn't always sure how he visually wanted to tell the story. This leads to a sometimes snails' pace as the plot unfolds, though the haunting Oscar-worthy cinematography from Roger Deakins and mesmerizing music score from Nick Cave and Warren Ellis eventually get under your skin even as the hands of the clock seem to move slower as if stuck in a pretty photograph of a nightmare.The acting in the film is superb from all involved. However, the performances often blur the line between caricatured scenery-chewing and emotional nuance (especially from Pitt and Rockwell). While there is some entertainment to be found in the lighter scenes of camaraderie amongst the gang members, the audience never really feels anything for the characters aside from sharing their sense of paranoia and fear knowing that around any corner someone will be betrayed and shot. The film also suffers from some scene stealing cameos from James Carville as the governor hell-bent on catching Jesse and the otherwise lovely Zooey Deschanel, who appears out of nowhere for a few moments about ten minutes after the film should have rightfully ended.When the credits finally rolled, I wasn't sure what to make of the film. There's some unforgettable imagery (my personal favorite being the almost surreal depiction of the cloth-masked robbers waiting in the dark woods as the train comes roaring down the tracks), and many commendable artistic elements to be found in the film. If the idea was to leave the audience feeling the era showcased was a tension-riddled and violently lonely existence, then the film succeeded wonderfully. Those seeking a more pure entertainment will most assuredly be left stressed and stretched to their limits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Shakespearean tragedy with one of the finest performances in history.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite some pointless narration (and irrelevantly blurred editing during the scenes with this narration) and the complete mistreatment of one of the finest actresses of the decade, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is easily one of the finest modern films around and certainly one of the best of the year. It plays as a Shakespearean tragedy instead of an outlandish, action-filled western that one would expect when hearing the name Jesse James. Featuring some of the best performances of the decade, the film is a wonderful mix of subtle and emotional heartache with biting realistic tension and a beautifully flawed character that everyone can relate to in some way. Slowly the film builds a tension and knowing dissension towards the inevitable downfall of Mr. James. It's a heartbreaking story of one man trying to be remembered and another knowing a betrayal is quickly coming upon him.A contrast between the main characters Jesse James (Brad Pitt) and Robert Ford (Casey Affleck) is presented throughout and really shows the truth that Ford is exactly the same as James, just at an earlier stage in his life. Jesse was the youngest of three boys and rose above all of them to be the most renowned outlaw in American history. He murdered and stole, but gained nothing but respect and admiration from those who heard the stories of his crimes. Of course with all of this fame, and the bounty of men he's had work with him and in his trust, Jesse knew that a betrayal was soon coming. He averted one before, but he can see the end in sight and this time, he is welcoming it instead of trying to fight it.This portrayal of James is one of the many things that make this film so brilliant. He's a melancholy, brooding, bipolar and enraged mess. A man who knows the end is approaching, but has come to a point in his life where he doesn't see any reason to try and stop it. We see him for how he truly was, instead of the gun-slinging charismatic outlaw that James is constantly portrayed as time and time again. This deeply heartbreaking man is perfectly personified by Pitt's award-worthy performance. We see a side of the light, breezy Brad Pitt that I personally could never have imagined. He presents so much pain and anguish behind those steely blues, that my heart stopped every time he started intently with his eyes ever so lightly filling with tears.I have no hesitation in calling Robert Ford the most tragic character in cinematic history. He is the youngest of five brothers, and all day he gets picked on and disrespected so when he sees another man who's the youngest of a number of brothers, he begins to idolize him. When he finally gets the chance to meet his hero, and work alongside him, his tendency to give a bad first impression (albeit he is a bit eerie with his strong admiration of the James boys) leads to more humiliation from the man he considered to be everything he wanted to grow up into. Obviously this leads the young man into spite and bitter insecurity. He becomes a wreck, but in this state of depression he is able to finally realize his true feelings and express them to the world. Due to this, Bob begins to get more respect and fear from those around him, and the Sheriff decides to capitalize on this bitterness by enlisting Bob in a sort-of undercover mission to arrest James, though everyone knows there is no way to arrest the man. It can only end in the death of one of the men.Of course the title, and any kind of history book, reveals who the dead man is and Ford assumes that this will lead to him becoming a legend in the same way that Jesse was. An icon on the morally right side, instead of as a criminal. However he is gravely wrong and he's met with more disrespect and tales of him being the biggest coward in American history to match Jesse's status as the biggest and most respected criminal. James was an icon and Ford was just the snake in the grass who stabbed him in the back. This undoubtedly brings more depression to Robert; he killed his hero for fame and was forever remembered as a coward who betrayed an icon. And then another man gets the idea that Robert had; he was going to murder someone infamous in order to be remembered and with this second murder ends the tragedy that is Robert Ford's life. The man who wanted nothing more than to be Jesse James, and became his killer.Casey Affleck's performance is the stuff of cinematic legend. His dynamic brilliance, deeply emotional strength and powerful absorption into this fatally flawed character combine to create what is easily one of the best performances I've ever seen and quite simply the best performance of the year so far. I've been a fan of this underrated genius for a long time now, and this performance is his best by far and is sure to get him a lot of attention come awards season; I could even see an Oscar in his future. He completely steals the show from Pitt, who still turns in an excellent portrayal, and perfectly embodies a character who just breaks my heart. Casey creates such a nice demeanor and personality for this dangerously awkward young man that makes him one of the most complex and, as I said before, easily the most tragic character in the history of film in my eyes. A true revelation to modern acting and proof that when you get the right role in the right film, you can take it all the way to the top.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to imagine this film being much of a success, despite starring Brad Pitt. It's a long-haul: slow-moving, intensely melancholic and sombre, dealing in grey-paletted landscapes and skyscapes, pauses, silences, things unsaid as much as things said. Still, it's been critically successful, and it address questions pertinent to today's society. Fame. Hero worship. The desire to be someone else, as an escape from the drudgery of your own life ("do you want to be like me, or do you want to be me?"). The realisation that that someone else is "just a man," just like you, and that he perhaps struggles with the same sense of drudgery and hopelessness, as you do. Notably, the film conveys a sense of the drudgery and sheer hardship of life in the west that many films miss, and, unlike most other westerns (with the exception of 'True Grit'), the dialogue often feels authentic ? slightly grandiose, perhaps stilted to our ears ? almost Elizabethan; slow, deliberate, unusual, and just right. Roger Ebert comments on the bleak emptiness of the landscape (like McCabe and Mrs Miller, it was shot in Canada- all huge grey skies, desolate waving wheat-fields, snow, ice, and mud), and how, because of this, because "the land is so empty, it creates a vacuum demanding men to become legends." As in the Russian drama 'The Return', the landscape becomes almost a character, or at least a driving force which partially dictates why the characters behave how they do and what courses of action they take.I say this partly because no explanation is sought, or offered, by anyone in the film, for the gang's actions. This is simply what they do - perhaps to avoid the drudgery of working in a grocery store, like Bob, or making shoes, as Frank suggests he will do; perhaps for the money, to give themselves a chance of a fuller life. Perhaps simply because, in this environment, doing anything feels almost like a random act. The film is detached from the characters, and the characters are detached from themselves. At one point, Jesse speaks about watching himself from outside: "I look at my red hands and my mean face... and I wonder 'bout that man that's gone so wrong." The state governor comments that, while some say Jesse's crimes are revenge on Republicans and people who wronged his family, his victims didn't seem to be chosen on account of their political persuasion. In other words, he's no political rebel. He's just an outlaw, who does what he does - who knows why? That's not important to the governor. He wants the man captured, not to understand his motivation. The film should go beyond his concerns though, and examine the latter..shouldn't't it? Doesn't it?I'm not convinced that it does, and more context of the sort hinted at in the governor's two or three lines might have helped. For all the film's desire for historical accuracy in detail, in the bigger picture it's rather sketchy. I'll return to these criticisms later. But, still, it's a film easy to admire, for several reasons: the use of space, and silence, building tension in long, drawn-out dinner-table conversations. The inexorable build toward death, like Sergio Leone's 'Once Upon a Time in the West', a dance of death - or a slow, deliberately paced walk towards it. It feels like something winding down: everyone is aware of impending confrontation, but unable to escape from it. People face their deaths with stoicism, as if this is what fate has dictated for them, as if it is their role to play: the gang member Pitt shoots in the back for real, or imagined betrayal; James himself, who glimpses his assassin in a mirror but makes no attempt to dodge the bullet's path.It will probably be admired most for its performances: Casey Affleck's insinuating, awkward hero-worshipper, at once understandable and pitiable - bullied, insecure, unloved - and at once somewhat contemptible, annoying and disturbing. Pitt's James - aloof, detached: melancholy, for no clear reason, at one point he hints at his desire for death, for suicide. "Once you've looked over the other side, you'll never want to go back into your body," he says. Or something of the sort. Then shoots holes into the ice.Ultimately however, despite this admiration, it's hard to like, much less love. It is characterised by the same aloofness I've just discussed in its protagonist. Jesse's occasional mentions of the soul raise the possibility of a deeper philosophical strain (which might be somewhat out of place, given the dour 'factual', 'realistic' nature of the film, such as the vomit that smears Bob Ford's suit when he falls over on a saloon floor)- but it remains merely a suggestion, adding to a vague impression of some sort of inexplicable sadness. Of course, James is not simple: a psychotic family man. But there's a lack of insight into his character, and the other characters in the film. They seem to remain ciphers who simply exist, rather than fully fledged human beings who act. James' family seems barely to exist, except for occasional shots to show that he has one. The film observes dislikeable characters doing dislikable things; the audience is left to judge, but are not given that much to base their judgements on, despite the slow pace. The film's attitude to its legendary titular character is unclear: do we admire him? He's a cold-blooded murderer - surely just as much of a coward as Bob Ford. Or is he let off the hook because he's Brad Pitt, because he's brooding and handsome and has a family? Ultimately, the film is indifferent - neither tragic nor exciting, just generally glum, it gives the impression of saying more than it actually does. It had the potential to be more than it is, and is thus an interesting, perhaps necessary, but flawed movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Reflection of Our Society</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a very good movie and I would definitely recommend it but it is 2 hours and 40 minutes with it being slow at times. Still it has some great acting, musical score, cinematography with good directing.Casey Affleck has had a great year in acting with this movie and Gone Baby Gone. He gives such a deep, authentic and complex performance you could say he deserved an Oscar for it . He has what his brother Ben Affleck does not have, dedication to the character and the meanings and purpose they have within them. When I think about his performances and roles in both Gone Baby Gone and this really makes me wonder about myself and my character. Brad Pitt gave a very interesting performance as well but I still did not find it to be that great. At times he was a bit over the top but this is not to say that he was not good.What really transformed this movie was the cinematography and directing. The directing and cinematography really delivered on what the purpose of this movie is. It helped you understand the feelings, personalities but most of all the complexities of all the characters involved in the story. The cinematography and music fused together and really made me get a feel for the story and the movie.In a way this movie reflects our society today. The message of this movie was really deep and meaningful saying that everyone plays a role in society even if you don't like your role that is what you are. The public determines your destiny and image. It depicts gang life and how betrayal is the worst act that can be committed and in which loyalty is a must even if you know longer have relations with it. It shows how there always has to be a necessary evil or a scape goat no matter what effect it has on people because people do not want to blame themselves they want to blame others instead. This is movie happens to take place in the west rather than it being a western. This movie/story tries to tell us something that is deeply embedded in our minds and in our society. It displays what we think of ourselves is drastically different of the image of ourselves from other people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wasted opportunity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1. The film has a good, quite authentic look to it - at least as far as props, costumes, sets, etc. The sound of the old, wood-frame houses was right on. The landscapes are obviously not where they are supposed to be, but that follows an old tradition in Westerns. Canadian locations have become very identifiable &amp; are obviously not Missouri nor any adjoining states.2. Brad Pitt made a good Jesse James. I know Jesse's photos quite well &amp; was able to forget them. Mr. Pitt did his best to be enigmatic - I don't know if that was intentional in his portrayal of Jesse or simply because he didn't know how else he could carry on through this script.3. The rest of the cast did as well as they could. Sam Shepherd seemed a bit old for Frank James, but then I always thought that Frank looked old for his age in the few photos that exist.4. Now for the bad part - it is as slow moving as molasses in winter.5. Almost every film that has extensive voice-over explanations has had post-production problems. When it's all been put together, they've found that the explanations are needed, because the film had become a muddle.Having been a professional genealogist who has researched Jesse Woodson James &amp; family &amp; who has worked with celebrities, I understand what they were trying to do with this. In an oblique way they were using Bob Ford as "stalker" ... as well as exploring Jesse's emotional-mental issues (which included drug use) &amp; the various family connections that that are often neglected. It is rare that any film for popular consumption has mentioned the murder of Jesse's favorite cousin, Woodson Hite, by the Fords. It also often goes unmentioned that there was a lot of blood relationship amongst these various outlaw clans. Therefore, there were family issues, as well as the historical background that is more commonly known.I commend them for the attempt, but such an exploration was perhaps better left to print. Despite knowing most of the story already, I found it almost impossible to follow. Perhaps, the problem was that it simply could not retain my interest enough to follow it. Sometimes, a work that is very literary, with lots of explanation &amp; internal action, but little real physical action, can be impossible to transpose to film. I suspect that is what happened.I really wanted to like this film, but sad to say, I didn't. Perhaps one day a mini-series will do justice to the complexity of these people &amp; their era &amp; will still manage to be entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A riveting, poetic, masterfully crafted, cinematic experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every now and then, in the realms of western / period dramas a very special film comes along. This is such a film. It's haunting, compelling, thought provoking, (dare I say) conversation inducing - a visual tour-De-force with stunning landscapes, emotive lighting and classic film-making techniques all rolled into one. It's been a long time since a film enveloped me in the way Andrew Dominic managed to take me right inside the carriage of the train the characters were robbing on screen. But that's just a small part of the visceral, assured strength of a film that takes its time unfolding and trusts in the performances of a well rounded, tight, cast. Yes, it was Brad Pitt who won the award at Venice, and he's competent within the range of his ability - by which I mean I've seen him give performances like this before, and he is improving with age ... but the truly subtle, charismatic and deft performance comes from Casey Affleck - his is an Oscar-worthy performance and key to the emotional success of the film. All other supporting actors are seasoned character actors.There are some disappointments in the film too - mostly a couple of (in my opinion) bad decisions. The first is the voice over narration which is superfluous, and devaluing to the flow of the film, and the second - more serious problem - is the placement of the 'wrap up' scenes which explore Robert Ford's life after he assassinates Jesse James. The movie was over when James was shot dead. These scenes were unnecessary or at best should have been handled earlier in the story.Regardless, Andrew Dominic's debut feature in America - like his Australian debut 'Chopper', marks him as a exceptional talent, and I for one hope to see Casey Affleck in progressively more challenging roles.Though 3.10 to Yuma has broader appeal, this film is a more significant cinematic achievement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Recapitulating the act of betrayal?The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In what could be my favorite film name of all-time, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is much more than its superfluous moniker. From its bloated runtime to its slow, methodical pace, Andrew Dominik's epic tale contains an inner beauty that allows for all the pretensions one seems to associate with it. Dominik is unrelenting on his quest to tell the story the way he wants it told, never compromising by cutting scenes or shortening the name so it will fit on theatre marquees. The film even seems to have been languishing in the doldrums for over a year before finally seeing the light of day. Maybe the time was spent because no one would distribute it without changes, and if that is so, I'm glad to have waited for its introduction. Had anything been compromised, I don't think I would have enjoyed my time nearly as much. Do not expect the wild west or gun fights at every corner. This is not a tale of excess or young guns, but instead one of paranoia, suspicion, friendship, and betrayal from all sides.I thought I would be seeing James during his heydays of robbery and murder, eventually meeting his demise at the hands of one of his crew. Instead, we are introduced to the legend just before his final night ride with brother Frank. It is the last train robbery he undertook, before attempting to retire home with his wife and kids, that he meets the Ford brothers and their ragtag degenerate friends. James is no longer as God-like as he might once have been. A shell of his former self, he is constantly uprooting his family, children who don't even know his real name, in fear of capture by the Pinkertons. Always paranoid and untrusting of those around him, after all his brother has retired and his normal crew all gone, jailed, or dead, James begins to fear for his safety. By riding to cleanse himself of those that may be conspiring against him, he begins a journey that will take him back into the friendship of Robert and Charlie Ford. Whether from depression caused by the memories of all he has done or an escalation of the malice and crazed disposition that allowed him to do it, this reunion for a series of planned bank robberies finally leads to his end.Dominik's film is filled to the brim with nuance and subtlety. At every turn we are even quiet moments of the landscape and metered prose of speech, slowly contemplated and released into conversation. Everything is orchestrated with great care and each frame a thing of beauty. The film must have been storyboarded like crazy because the compositions of each scene is balanced and gorgeous to behold. From the extreme close-ups, the smoke-laden atmosphere, and the visions from behind period-aged impure glass, Dominik has taken painstaking care in making sure each second is perfect. Even the narrated moments telling of James' past are vignetted and blurred to give a sense of age and dream-state. Everything is deliberately timed, both enhancing the period being portrayed and adding to the mood and almost nonexistent changes in mental disposition as the wheels turn inside each character's head.All the acting on screen is top-notch. Brad Pitt really shows how good he is as the man behind the stories. This is a time of instability for him as his state of mind causes uncontrollable outbursts of violence followed by fits of laughter at the lapse in control. He realizes that he is not himself anymore and it is this knowledge of his own fallibility that makes him even more cautious of what is happening all around him. Did he deserve the best actor award at Venice this year? I don't know. He is very good, possibly close to his best, however, he was overshadowed, to me, by costar Casey Affleck's Robert Ford. He truly shines as the young kid able to ride alongside his idol only to be shot down as strange and queer. His joy, expressed very openly to his hero, comes at a very bad time. Just as James starts to look at everyone more carefully, in comes this kid with a dangerous obsession. As Pitt says before sending Ford away, "I can't tell if you want to be like me, or be me." Affleck's performance is one of the years best. The times when he must try and hide the rage bottled up inside while his dreams of being the James Brother's sidekick shatter are tough to watch. From this showing, Ford was no coward, but a man tired of being kicked while he was down. Perhaps the act of murder itself was cowardly, but only because of the circumstances surrounding it. Ford was working for the sheriff in order to capture the criminal, but when the opportunity presented itself, when James finally realized what was to happen, you can't help feel sorry for the 20-year old has he wrestles with what is about to transpire.I applaud Dominik for having the courage to create something that is by no means a bankable commodity. For every person that goes to see Brad Pitt's new movie, there will be at least three that scoff at the almost three-hour duration and slow unfolding of plot. Either way, this film is a masterpiece to behold, a work of art encapsulating a moment of history. Even the epilogue, of what happens to Ford after the assassination, helps shape the motivations for all that transpired during the course of the film. It never feels boring and it never shies from the weight it carries on its shoulders. The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is simply something that needs to be seen to understand the effect it has, and that experience should be at the theatre so its composition and visual splendor can be viewed in all its glory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome and spectacular Western with good performances from Pitt and Affleck</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a sprawling and glamorous Western but overlong. Packs colorful scenarios, slow-moving pace and slick edition. Wonderful cinematography by Roger Deakins and atmospheric musical score by Nick Cave. The motion picture is well realized by Andrew Dominik who displays enough off-beat touches to keep things interesting.Adding more details over the largely described on the movie, deeds happened of the following way : Later events led disaster on 6 September 1876 in which Jesse(Brad Pitt) and Frank James(Sam Shepard) with three younger Younger brothers attempted a bank robbery at Northfield , Minnesota, only Jesse and Frank got clean away to live quietly for several years under assumed names , Jesse as J.D. Howard and Frank as B.J. Woodson. In 1879 they robbed a train and another one in 1881, in the latter crime a conductor and a passenger were killed. Governor of Missouri raised rewards of 10.000 dollars each for the James boys, dead or alive. On 3 April 1882 Bob Ford, a new member , treacherously shot Jessse dead in the back of the head in his home at St Joseph, Missouri where Jesse was living along with his wife(Mary Louise Parker) and sons. Frank surrendered six months later , he stood trial and was acquitted. He gave up his criminal ways and lived a respectable life until he died aged seventy-two in 1915. Robert Ford(1861-92) made his mark on the history as the man who killed Jesse James. It was his claim to fame. Bob(Ben Affleck) and his brother Charlie (Sam Rockwell) were new recruits to Jesse's gang in 1881 and when a reward was offered for Jesse and Frank, dead or alive, the brothers Ford made a secret agreement with Governor to assassinate the outlaw. For the rest of his life Ford was reviled for the manner in which he had killed Jesse , whose gravestone bore the words: Murdered by a traitor and a coward whose name is not worthy to appear here. Forced by public opinion to leave Missouri , Bob wandered through the old West , taunted by the words of the popular song : The dirty little coward, who was shot Mr Howard, has laid poor Jesse in his grave .Others films about this legendary outlaw are : The classic version (1939) titled Jesse James(1939) with Tyrone Power and Henry Fonda, The return of Frank james(1950) by Fritz Lang with Henry Fonda ; I shot Jesse Jamesby Samuel Fuller with John Ireland as Bob Ford ; Jesse James vs the Dalton(1954) by William Castle with John Ireland, The true story of Jesse James by Nicholas Ray with Robert Wagner and Jeffrey Hunter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A somewhat long and self indulged view of the last days of Jesse James. If you enjoy looking at clouds and out farmhouse windows then this is the film for you.If you require some entertainment and a shadow of a plot give this one a wide berth. I am sure that there is a reason for the film lasting close to 3 hours other than some bizarre infatuation with extremely slow horse riding scenes.I should have guessed with the unfeasible amount of words in the title that this would be a film best avoiding, wondering how they manage to fit all the title on one poster is probably a better way to spend ones evening.

		<fullReview>Anticipated realism.Beautiful cinematography and direction. Some people say the storyline is misguided and sometimes dull, but I say with good reason. They are building something here. We all know the story. The American lure. Even though it's history and could be no other way, I didn't see it coming. I never expected the actual assassination to be so forth carried out.It was interesting to find that Pitt wasn't the focus of this film, instead we find Affleck deviling deep into the depths of desire and madness. The tension building with each disappointment or insult. How he did not win Oscar gold for this performance is beyond me. Instead it went to the methodic killer in "No Country for Old Men" and not the reluctant one in Jesse James.Pitt gives one of his finest performances in one of his most challenging films. He didn't really need to say much. His presence captured all. Pitt may very well be remembered for this film, even with an ever-growing impressive category of work. The supporting cast also did a great job, with an outstanding showing by Sam Rockwell as the sometimes not so evident meeker Ford brother.In short, a psychological thriller that never fails to conspire.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is truly amazing how a first rate cast and wonderful cinematography can combine to provide two and a half hours of absolute boredom, and contribute nothing to one's knowledge of the story which it is purportedly about. Not a moment of enjoyment exists in this film! First, none of the characters are discernible from each other, except for Jesse and Bob. This includes the women, who are easily confused with each other. Casey Affleck's Bob Ford is a sniveling dolt, with no redeeming qualities. Perhaps that is how it should be, but it makes for dull cinema. Affleck's annoying voice and lack of acting ability make it painful whenever he is on screen.We are never informed why anyone is doing anything or what that anything might be. We don't know why they are shooting each other, or why they are not shooting each other. It is the director who should be shot.Brad Pitt turns in the only performance of note, with Sam Shepard also making a brief attempt to help the movie with his taciturn presence. Neither Brad or Sam can save this moldering turkey. The movie is at least a half hour too long, maybe an hour (or maybe two and a half hours!).All I was thinking for the whole time I watched it was, Gee, I'm glad I didn't pay $10 to see this crap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Legend Born and a Coward Ignored</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford" says it all, but it has even more than meets the eye. Not only is the title a spoiler, but it sums up the two main characters. JESSE JAMES is in BIG BOLD letters like the legend he is while Robert Ford is hardly noticed underneath his name with the publicly attached "coward" in front it. The title allows us to sit back and enjoy the journey of Robert Ford in his quest to become famous, and Jesse James' journey into infamy and legendary myth. The film stars Brad Pitt as the notorious Jesse James. Brad Pitt delivers an incredible performance. This may be his crowing achievement along with the character, Tyler Durden, which he played to perfection in "Fight Club." He plays Jesse James like he's bipolar so we never know what he's thinking, or what he's capable of doing at any given minute under any given circumstance. One minute he's jovial, and the next he's ripping at Robert Ford's head as he presses a knife to his throat with a demented look in his eyes just screaming of a homicidal maniac. Brad Pitt doesn't play him perfectly and some will notice the infamous Tyler Durden laugh peeking through, but it's a great performance that is thoroughly layered with deep, dark and buried emotions. It is worthy of a nomination at the very least. Jesse James' past and his actions seem to haunt him. Pitt plays a man suffering from a deep and very dark depression as he tries to hide his inner demons with good nature and laughter. Jesse James always knows what's going on. He's very cerebral in his actions. He's like a homicide detective with his carefully intimidating probing of terrified subjects as he looks for answers, but finds nothing but lies. James finds himself all alone surrounded by people that are looking to get paid off by giving him up to the law. He is always on the run and we gradually see him become tired of running and tired of living the way he is. His insomnia keeps him up at all hours as he lives in fear and paranoia. The assassination scene, one of the best scenes in the film, is incredible and shockingly suspenseful, as well as chilling. The pacing in that scene is deliberate and thought provoking, which will leave you thinking about it long after you see it.Casey Affleck plays the "coward," Robert Ford. He is surly Oscar worthy here and undoubtedly gives the performance of his lifetime in a career year - "Gone Baby Gone". He plays Robert Ford as a weird, meticulous, well intentioned admirer of Jesse James thrust into his inner circle. He's the youngest brother of five boys. He's the weak one. He's the one always made fun of. He's always overlooked or looked down upon. Robert Ford is an uncomfortable person to be around, and Affleck plays him perfectly as a very odd young man with an obsession of Jesse James + the James gang that cross over boundaries of more than just admiration. He wants to be so much apart of that gang that, that's all he has ever wanted since he was a young child reading the fascinating stories of the James gang, and his legendary idol, Jesse James. He wants the fame and the respect that Jesse has, and he wants to be apart of something grand. He wants to know what it feels like to be Jesse James; in his shoes. As he joins the gang he starts to feel the pressure of Jesse James, and his feelings of the man start to change. When Robert Ford is sent to capture and arrest Jesse James that is when Jesse James becomes haunting as he watches his every move, and death seems immanent to both Robert Ford and his brother, Charley (Sam Rockwell). Robert Ford becomes every bit as famous after the murder as James was, then the people stop caring and they start hating. The final act of the film may be the most impressive since we see the kind of backfire stardom can have on you in a celebrity obsessed culture - even in the late 19th century. The journey leading to the assassination and the incredible acting is something to truly admire and become utterly fascinated to watch unfold. The acting was just incredible even with some of the smaller parts, especially, with the lying and conniving, Charley Ford, or the funny, smart and very creepy, Dick Liddil (Paul Schneider). The acting on a whole was fantastic and no one upstaged anyone. The four main characters are all fantastic and all very different. The cinematography was absolutely beautiful and mesmerizing; this is some of the greatest film has to offer. The scenery is vast and breathtaking. The way some of the images are shot with blurred and distorted edges gives the audience the same feelings of the blurred perceptions between myth and fact. There are several shots through distorted windows giving a blurred outlook on this folklore world that Dominik creates. We never really are sure if something happened this way since the truth has been lost in myth and legend. The set and costume designs were fantastic along with the argot. It feels as if you have been transported back to the late 1880s. It's a slow character study and wonderful cinematic piece of art. The score is both beautiful and haunting matching the tone of the film to perfection. This is one of the decades best films. Andrew Dominik deserves a lot of credit for this masterpiece.</fullReview>

Shiitake mushrooms have more presence and are considerably less annoying than Casey Affleck. The cinematography is anti-Malick - instead of sweeping, beautifully exposed wide angles there are mid ranges with vignetting added to give it some artsy look and to make up for the bad exposure of many of the shots. It doesn't work. I can't remember when I saw a more pretentious piece of boring film.What happens when you give a bad film student with a Terence Malick obsession a bunch of money?

		<fullReview>I'm all for an oater. Huge fan of John Wayne, John Ford, Gary Cooper. And I'm all for a movie on Jesse James. I've got family from Missouri and relatives inappropriately named for him during the reconstruction.But movie gods, how long are we expected to watch one mentally unstable man wander around tormenting half wits? Here's how I think it's supposed to work: the movie is shorter than the book, and, when it comes to biographies and histories, the book is shorter than the actual event itself. And, since it's live action (this is the most important thing), we're supposed to be entertained. Compared to this, Lawrence of Arabia was a stroll, and Dr. Zhivago a short story. This movie was endless and DULLER than third-generation nylon stockings.All credit to Brad Pitt for successfully making this character thoroughly unlikable, since we know from Devil's Own he can make the bad guys look somewhat charming with a bad accent. And James' character here is the closest to reality - best since The Long Riders (and that was the best until now, far better than some of the laughable depictions seen in The Outlaw and the like).But with Jesse as one endlessly scary dude, I spent most of the movie waiting for the promised old west justice and wishing I had brought my own six shooter so I could put an end to my misery. No nice daffodils or tulips, no sand dunes - nothing to distract me while I'm waiting. And waiting. And waiting. Oh, and since there was nothing to wax lyrical about, I admired everyone's full mouth of beautiful clean teeth (there's historical accuracy for you).Since we all know what happened to Jesse, the only surprise is why I sat through the whole damn film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Beautifully Textured Masterwork</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a really amazing film. All the pieces - props, costume, camera-work, script, and acting - fit together as well as the finely crafted parts of a nickel-plated revolver. I was surprised I'd not heard more about it.The film tells the story of the James Gang and specifically the fatal relationship of Jesse James and Robert Ford. During the course of the action we see darkness and light in everyone, even the "coward." Care is taken to finely pare into the psyches of these Outlaws and the cold world they walk in. I think I saw just about every emotion there is to have in these men and we can almost understand, even if we can't accept, what moves them in their deadly paths.Pitt is both iconic and vulnerable - beautiful and frightening as Jesse James, a robber and killer who hoists up a reputation of fearless boss on one shoulder and charming folk hero on another. His character's movement through peril and praise reminds one of the great gangster characters from Scorsese's work, with an added rawness that only Pitt and a few others can genuinely summon. His fatalism is also quite entrancing and subtly masterful.Affleck is truly mesmerizing as a born misfit who is so uncomfortable in this world around him, that his neuroses, if they can be called that, really get into your skin. I was reminded of Joaquin Phoenix's role as Comodus, but it's even more intense and yet so very believable. As the audience, I was torn between pitying the character, being utterly disappointed in him, and just wanting him to somehow be better. And the script's maturity really comes into play with this character. No one is beyond reproach, understanding, or grim fate.I'd say that's the main theme here: fate.There's no easy formula. No one simply "gets what's coming to them." There are no simple villains or heroes. There's just life and the actions taken and the echoes of those actions and eventually, an end. It transcends any petty ideas of justice or even legend. It takes a full snapshot of a beautiful and grim reality and lets us just take it in, like a corpse on ice. Profound by presentation alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Artistic western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the films that isn't for everyone because it's a slow and yet realistic film, with a lot more talking and drama than action. It just very beautiful to watch though and the realistic approach is done very well. Some audience might be turned off by this film because for a movie about one of the most famous outlaw, there is hardly any action in it or robberies. The film is about the last days of Jesse James before his assassination and everything from the acting to the cinematography is done very well. Brad Pitt does what he does best and his acting is top notch, he was excellent in portraying Jesse James in a complex and yet charismatic manner. Casey Affleck was perfect for this role in portraying Robert Ford, his acting was very believable when trying to act all annoying and cowardly. If your one of those types that don't care for stuff blowing up every minute or constant action, you might enjoy this film. It's artistic western with great acting and amazing cinematography, showing the ending of Jesse James's career. With that said, this film is not for everyone. Most teens will probably be bored by this movie, I personally liked this film enough to give it a 8/10.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heavyweight take on historical events</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Until last night I had struggled to find the right opportunity to watch this movie. Sometimes I find a movie that I know I will have to be prepared for, to be completely attentive in order to fully appreciate it. This was one of those movies for me. I had been put off by the fact that it was going to be quite a long film which, essentially, I knew the outcome of before even watching. If you don't know the history behind the real life character of Jesse James before then the title is a real giveaway as to what to expect in terms of its ending - but this is in no way a bad thing. I began to watch this in bed while feeling quite sleepy. I half expected to switch it off halfway through and watch the rest another time. Impossible. Historically, the accounts of Jesse James's murder allowed Jesse an immortality through legend. Robert Ford was portrayed as the coward who shot an unarmed man in the back. This movie does not take sides however which allows the viewer a much more open experience. However, it does allow the Ford brothers a fairer representation than they have had before. Essentially the movie portrays James and Ford as the characters they were - flawed human beings whose lives were shaped by how they reacted to circumstances around them. Pitt gives an incredible performance as Jesse the man, not the legend. He steals and he murders. He does what he deems is necessary. As Ford, Affleck is unforgettable. Watching him twist through a range of emotions as he journeys with his hero is intriguing. He is fragile, yet vicious; torn between feelings of adulation and disgust towards Jesse the man, not the legend he envisaged. The cinematography and musical score capture the mood of the movie perfectly. Silence is often preferred to the masculine speeches and action expected of western movies. This gives us time to assess what life would have been like back then. Far more ruralised, lonely and silent. But also a ruthless world where your own survival could come at the cost of killing another man. We get to witness cold acts of murder as they are - necessary to the person committing them. This movie is highly engaging from start to finish. The intriguing relationship between James and Ford is a seriously fresh take on actual events. The two and half hours flew by for me which is often the sign of a great movie. The only thing that annoyed me while watching was in the bar scene when Ford has been mocked in a song and announces to a silenced bar who he is. After this he falls on the floor drunk then leaves silently. I think there was serious potential here for a legendary speech to be made by Affleck. It would have given more weight to the argument that Ford's role in the saga has been unfairly misrepresented over time. Perhaps this wasn't done so that the movie could remain neutral to interpretation where a rousing speech may have caused the viewer to sympathise with Ford. Overall I have given the movie 9 out of 10 because it is an unforgettable story and arguably the best western this century. The actual assassination scene remains wide open to interpretation. Do I think James wanted to die? No. But in the moment he dropped his guns I think that he embraced and accepted death.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sublime Filmmaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title of the film "Assassination of Jesse James by Coward Robert Ford" says almost everything about the film, almost. But what it doesn't say is that Jesse James gets assassinated or murdered more than once. Jesse James embodied this larger than life Robinhood figure who was a criminal by the very definition of it and a cold blooded killer when he had to be one, but also by some accounts a committed family man who generously distributed the usurped wealth to the needy. Now, this perception may or may not be tenable, but it certainly appeals to a primal aspect of most human beings who strive for that contradiction of winning, ruthlessness, courage and fame, yet want this image of kindness, generosity and some inherent sense of righteousness. All this becomes even more aspirational when the state has failed for the people. James's folklore image could be a product of some of these factors. Robert Ford ( Casey Affleck ) was a product of the times, a young 20 year old smitten by the image of James, collects every possible piece of literature mystifying the glamorous outlaw as he and his brother join the gang. His "fascination" with Jesse is akin to comic book fanatic idolizing his super hero, except maybe Ford had a certain innate infatuation which maybe not all would share. You want to believe that the ideal you idolize is real. There is something pure about it, not obscured by the ambiguous ideas of morality or decency. But the image is castigated when it confronts reality. This is where Jesse James gets murdered many times over in Ford's mind. As he watches, James sit alone and awkward as his brother leaves, as he sees James despondent with the failed train robbery, as James becomes increasingly paranoid, insecure and moody during his final days. But more importantly, Ford feels neglected by Jesse or not appreciated enough. Maybe all those conversation he had in his mind with Jesse as he explains to him the 12 things he had in common with him did not go according to plan when it actually materializes.Every encounter with Jesse probably killed some part of him in Ford's mind, which by his own confession "he lost some curiosity over the years" and as he conveys to his brother of his motive to kill James "He is just a human being". I bet part of Ford also died during this time since all he wanted to do or be was Jesse James "You want to be like me or you want to be me". All the players in this dance of death were doomed from the beginning. Jesse James was in his final few days reviewing his life, trying to protect his family or cut off the possible trails but losing his peace of mind. By the end, he just wanted to be put out of his misery. Better to die as a mystical hero betrayed by one of his own which will only enhance the legacy than be caught and reduced to a trial of an average Joe. Ford had committed the act even before he pulled the trigger, Jesse was no longer the same for him. However, what he probably did not foresee, was that people still held James as the Robinhood figure and he would antagonizing them all, leading to his own end. Probably, he too wanted to end his misery, since he would only be the guy who killed Jesse James, nothing more. I feel for for him.Andrew Dominik is one of the great talents of modern cinema who exploded on the scene with "Chopper", another story of a glamorous criminal although told in completely different tone. By his own admission he wanted to make the film, in a Terrence Mallick narrative with greater focus on tone, on images, on time and space. The film is contemplative and meditative. You can see the characters journey to the point they have to they were meant to. I shudder to think that there has been over evocative and sublime cinematography in recent years as one by Roger Deakins here. The Train Robbery sequence, as the light strikes through the dark frame reflecting from the surrounding trees will be the legacy of this great film. And lastly the score is haunting and evocative like the images almost transporting you in time amidst the snow clad mountains.One of my all time favorites.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unusual and fascinating reinterpretation of a legend: THE ASSASSINATION OF JASSE JAMES BY THE COWARD ROBERT FORD</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The young Robert Ford had a morbid veneration for the outlaw Jesse James. From an early age because he collected anything with him. One day he finally manages to make space in his band and hitting behind him, kill him. Presented at the Venice Film Festival 2007, the second movie directed by New Zealander Andrew Dominik with Brad Pitt did win the Coppa Volpi for best actor prize deserved, considering the extraordinary performance offered by this actor, universally recognized as a pretty face relegated only to petty traders, but instead be able to grapple with expertise in roles far released, and "The Assassination of Jasse James by the Coward Robert Ford" is proof beyond question. A sign that looks can be deceiving and that, behind a sex symbol, contrary to what one may say or think, there is a hidden talent not indifferent. Certainly, in the career of Brad Pitt There are other valid interpretations, but it certainly surpasses them all. Andrew Dominik courageous "extrapolates" an American myth, projecting it into a reality "current". Eluding any stereotypical gender make a wonderful western twilight, unconventional, focused more on the psychology of the characters in the historical context: in fact there is no mention whatsoever in the past the dreaded bandit, nor do we try to draw a profile social / political than years . Dominik dig deep. It offers an unusual and fascinating reinterpretation of a legend. Set the narrative pace calm and reflective, light years away from the hectic standards of contemporary cinema. Directs without any particular virtuosity: fields, reverse shot, long shots. Immense and beautiful landscapes that emerge in all their splendor, which inevitably leads to overt reminiscent of the style of Mallick, pausing so the viewer's attention on the contrasting relationship between man and nature. Sequences that are echoed in the cinema of Michael Cimino, impossible not to find similarities with "Heaven's Gate", or more generally to his way of making a movie: the same stretches of green, endless open spaces. Commendable Roger Deakins, who cleverly exploits the photographic effects of fading in the contours of the image, thus channeling the movie in a sort of dreamlike dimension. Avoiding the kind of a show, choosing instead a style Dominik disillusioned, finding Jasse James the embodiment of the end of Western, approachable in some ways to "Unforgiven" of Eastwood, both movies leave out many differences, are anchored to a certain realism, far from dazzling epic western detectable in most movies. "The assassination of Jasse James by the Coward Robert Ford" is in fact entirely devoid of action sequences, excluding the one, that of the train robbery. Robert Ford did not intend merely to resemble his idol. Knowing he could never emulate correctly decides to shoot him. The same thing will happen to that one hundred years after the fans of John Lennon. Ford portrays perfectly the emblem of unbridled ambition, but you will understand very quickly that a myth can neither kill nor replace. The boy will remain a prisoner of himself relentlessly, sharing the same fate of his hero, in a mocking juxtaposition of roles: the person who first became famous from nothing and then pay high price for glory. Dominik's movie is striking for introspection and careful definition of the protagonists: the expression of Jasse James/ Brad Pitt is ambiguous and painful, measured and intense, making infer in his eyes a deep existential angst: constant research, perpetually in motion, distrustful and unable to forge human relationships (the size is so high on him as to his throat to many), paranoid and violent, narcissistic universe in which it is confined and in which everyone thinks to safeguard their own safety, just wait the hour of his death. Followed by the commodification of the body in an impressive and realistic ritual, where the corpse raised as a triumph to be photographed and sponsor, will become gods and the gods will be consecrated forever. And where Jasse James was the slave of his fame and glory of his victim, Robert Ford remained prisoner of the fatal gesture, forced to recite it constantly before the crowd of theaters. On the wings of an unforgivable mistake but never not find the strength to expiate their sins. Coward, in fact. If the interpretation of Brad Pitt is outstanding, even more priceless is that Casey / Robert Ford / Affleck, who infuses his character a dose of humanity unsettling to leave you breathless. Work created with impeccable craftsmanship. Single, gigantic, transcendental.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>a long winded title for a long winded film, that thinks its characters are truly wonderful people. they are not, from jesse downwards we are dealing with thieves and murderers, and nothing more, the dialogue is trite, the endless shots of nothing, the interminable scenes that go no where. i have to say this, the majority of IMDb users seem to be people who are intent on showing of by posting comments that are as pretentious and long winded as the films they like. this story warrants a film of no more than 90 minutes long, that's how long it should have taken the makers to tell their story and make their point, which how adulation turns to bitterness and then revenge, i suppose this style owes a great deal to that other long winded film maker sergio leone, who started of well and as his popularity increased his films got longer and longer till they really started to get boring almost from the beginning, i know there is a generation of film goers that think his films are masterpieces, these are people who do not know about economy of story telling or how to keep whats in the frame interesting, clint eastwood went on to become a brilliant filmmaker by taking the good and then being able to tell a story simply, directly and with great emotion, the outlaw josey wales, is worth a thousand jesse james, and can be viewed again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ghost of a Legend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Assassination of Jesse James is an elegy of futility, an exquisite scorched earth of a movie. Its themes creep up on you and seep into your bones. A tale of friendship and betrayal, it's also a portrait of rootlessness, of violent men who kill because they don't know what else men are supposed to do, and it has some of the grizzled, melancholic grandeur of Sam Peckinpah's Westerns. Yet there's nothing generic about this film, and nothing melodramatic either; it's closer to lyric realism. Written and directed by Andrew Dominik (Chopper) from a novel by Ron Hansen, the film is an epic poem, a primordial vision. With its dreamlike landscapes and its delicate piano and violin score, The Assassination of Jesse James owes a clear debt to the early films of Terence Malick (Badlands, Days of Heaven), and there are images here that are among the most beautiful and haunting I have ever seen in a movie. Yet the visuals are never made to compensate for a lack of story (as with Malick's later films), and they aren't hypnotic for their own sake. Dominik uses them sparingly, poetically, like a master painter. The film is almost three hours long, but it doesn't meander and it never seems indulgent. Dominik shows a loving attention to detail, a sense of the ebb and flow of his scenes, that is reminiscent of Coppola's first two Godfather films. Assassination isn't quite on that level (its characters aren't that rich or alive, and the story, though poignant, isn't full-blown tragedy), but how many films can be compared to The Godfather? I think it's the finest Western film since McCabe and Mrs. Miller (it has a similar delicate pathos and poetic intensity), and never mind the Oscars: it's easily the best film of 2007.At first, Brad Pitt might seem somewhat lacking in the central role. Pitt is a problematic actor: when he has a role that allows him to get out of himself and let rip (such as Twelve Monkeys or Fight Club), he can be a riveting, electrifying presence; but like Jack Nicholson, he can also be lazy and coast on star appeal. But Pitt's Jesse grows on you. Pitt makes Jesse both menacing and oddly affecting, lost and almost childlike, a figure of pathos. There are moments when Pitt suggests that Jesse is an enigma even to himself.The outstanding performance comes from Casey Affleck, whose creepy Bob Ford is one of the most original characters ever created for the screen. Bob's worship of Jesse prefigures the slavish, faintly psychotic devotion of modern-day celebrity hounds; when Bob smiles, he sets his small teeth on edge and we can feel the hostility lurking inside him, waiting to come out. (It may be buried so deep even he is unaware of it.) In the end, the film is as much about Bob as it is about Jesse (who is never quite real to us), and maybe more so. The amorphous spell of melancholy which the film casts upon us comes as much from our feelings for Bob as for Jesse.It may be facile to say that The Assassination of Jesse James is about lost souls and false heroes; the film is so deftly, instinctively made, so light of touch, that it never pushes its meanings. But they are there, and the exquisite beauty of the film, the ghostlike images, the long silences, the open spaces it allows to exist both inside and between the scenes, combine to create a haunted, otherworldly quality, and a sense of unglimpsed depths. There's a moment, towards the end of the film, when the Ford brothers leave the James house where they are staying (and where Bob will assassinate Jesse), and we are allowed to see the surrounding countryside, and the skeletal town that is growing up in it. The image comes as a shock, because until now the intimacy of the film has kept our focus closely bound to the characters; despite its epic scope, there seemed no need to recreate the greater world in which they exist (or for the film's budget to include such elaborate sets). The image is all the more breathtaking for coming so unexpected, and we may be struck by how much care has gone into creating this world, seemingly for its own sake, independent of the story. At such a late stage, letting us see the fruit of this work seems almost an afterthought. Dominik may be so intensely inside his vision that he is indifferent to whether or not we experience it?the process of creation is enough. He has the focus and immersion of a true alchemist.This is an almost perfect film, yet it's an elusive work, and definitely not for everyone. A lot of people will miss its ineffable, alchemical grace, and mistake it for a rather long, lugubrious Western. Like Altman's McCabe and Mrs. Miller, Dominik is not interested in genre conventions, not even enough to subvert them. He's inventing a whole new genre in order for this one work to be exactly what it needs to be. (There's very little action in the film, yet it's full of suspense; and the occasional violence is never what we expect, it's never not disturbing.) At times, the effects Dominik gets are so unique, so inspired, that they seem faintly mysterious. He's a major, major talent. The Assassination of Jesse James is both an epic about the process by which legends are made and a tender, intimate love story between two antagonists so utterly dissimilar they might come from two different worlds. Yet they do have one thing in common: both men are so lost to themselves that at times the film seems almost like a ghost story. In a way, that's what it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mind-Numbingly Awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been a member of this site for quite a while, but not since 'Avatar', have I felt such strong hatred for a film that I could bother to write a scathing review of it. Firstly, as an Australian, I haven't read the book, and don't know the story at all. Hence, I spent the first 100 minutes of the film wondering what the hell was going on and trying to convince myself that the storyline would come together in the end.Here's my understanding of the plot. ****SPOILERS**** Jesse James and his brother run a gang of outlaws who rob trains. The movie starts with Robert Ford asking to help Jesse's brother, who threatens him with a gun because he doesn't like his tone of voice. Then they rob a train. For the next 80 minutes I noticed no progression in the narrative. Then Jesse goes and kills one of his friends, all his friends start killing each other, and he nearly slits Robert Ford's throat for some reason. Then the Ford brothers kill Jesse and everybody hates Robert Ford. Then he dies too.Quite honestly, that story should have taken about 15 minutes to show in a short film and would still be less interesting that watching grass grow. I spent half of the movie wondering what Robert did do deserve all the hate, why everyone liked Jesse so much, why I was even bothering to watch it, and how much time was left. Mary-Louise Parker's contribution of a few ear-splittingly annoying fake screams made me want to beat her to death with a baseball bat.In summary, this movie should be prescribed as the cure for insomnia, and the director strung up for a few weeks for wasting so much money and my time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Dirge for the death of two outlaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ana, my wife, hit the nail on the head as we discussed this film on the way home. Speaking of the length and the pacing of the film she said, "Of course it was long and built slowly. It was a dirge, a stately funeral march toward the inevitable ending." Dead on, dear. Ana is not a fan of westerns, for the most part. She's been dragged into the whole western thing by me, who has loved them from his childhood. I especially like ones that have the aura of authenticity, costuming, sets, weapons, the look of the people and so on. This movie has that all.It also has fine portrayals of the main characters -- the two outlaws, Jesse James (Brad Pitt) and Bob Ford (Casey Affleck) -- who are linked in the title and in life. All the supporting cast, including the often quirky choices for cameos -- like James Carville as the governor -- work well. Some, like Mary Louise Parker's Zee James seem underused, but the film was cut to its theatrical length so their full performances may be awaiting the DVD.Brad Pitt resembles, to a great degree, photos of James, especially at rest. He makes the character something more than a deranged killer. The motivations of Jesse, his brother, Frank (Sam Shepard)and the rest of their kith and kin from Clay County, Missouri can be argued, but they felt that they had reasons for what they did both in the War and after. For the most part, they stole from entities that they considered part of the Union and the Eastern Yankee machine that had defeated them, humiliating the South into the bargain. Reconstruction was ugly and the border warfare before, during and after the war was some of the worst most mean-spirited fighting there was.At one point the question is asked -- did Bob Ford want to be like Jesse or to be him? The hero worship at the beginning turns rancid -- as it often does in stalker cases (and that's what this is in modern terms) and eventually the fan -- Ford -- kills his idol. Of course, there was also a reward involved and the chance to be the man who shot Jesse James and the fame that went with it. All that makes for an irresistible package. Affleck certainly takes us on that journey with him and allows us to see the younger Ford brother make his way from one point on the arc to the other, ending his life with no fanfare, no ballads, stories, books or much interest in him except as "the dirty little coward who shot Mr. Howard and laid poor Jesse in his grave." The film is beautiful but it is also almost disturbingly violent, with the violence coming with little or no warning. I'm not unused to violence or gunshots and I jumped a few times sitting in the theater. And the gun-play was also believable. In the scene where Bob Ford kills for the first time, the exchange of gunfire between Charlie and Wood Hite at point blank range resulted in only minor wounds. Some will find that hard to believe but I nodded and smiled. Despite all the dime novels and B-movie westerns depicting everyone as a dead shot, most people in those days weren't great shots, even across a room.A case can be made that Jesse James put himself in front of the gun that Ford wielded so hesitantly. Perhaps he realized that his time was nearly over, that he had no more places to run and huge opposition from the railroad, the Pinkertons who worked for them and a government interested in settling the area and putting the war and violence behind it That was, as I recall, the thrust of the novel from which the film took its major premise and much of the narration.When this film comes to DVD I will own it. I will recommend it to anyone with an interest in western history, in complex characters and in beautiful cinematography -- although you can't really make Canada look and act like Missouri -- but with a caveat that you need to bring something to this movie and that includes the patience to allow the story to unfold at its own funereal pace. I felt rewarded for having done so as did Ana. Money and time well spent, for sure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An epic masterpiece. Thoughtful, philosophical and profoundly existential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a title almost as long as the 160-movie it names, regular movie-goers might be forgiven for thinking that The Assassination of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford is worth a miss. Too, even, that a title basically giving away the central hub of the film's plot makes it hard for studio execs to sell the film as a sassy, gun-toting western with shlocky shoot-em-ups and angel eyes Brad Pitt darling it up in the lead role. This was all many were expecting after several re-edits, one being a but-numbing 3? hour cut, were made to a film that actually wrapped up filming in 2005. But what Chopper director Andrew Dominik has delivered, in only his second film, is an beautiful, epic, meditative poem of a western, that once again transforms the genre, once such a stable for conservative normality, by dissecting the myths that created it.Brad Pitt is uber-outlaw Jesse James, co-founder of the James-Younger gang, primarily specialising in train robberies. Casey Affleck is Robert Ford, a clumsy, awkward upstart, who is entranced by Jesse James to the point of obsession. He views him like a celebrity, studying his life, his robberies, his voice and even his mannerisms. He is so entranced that at one point whilst attempting to engage his idol in a conversation during one of James' tin bath sessions, James very coldly utters to Ford "Do you want to be like me? Or do you wanna be me?".Ford is constantly teased by his fellow thieves and gunmen, taunted for his love and idolisation of the gang ringleader. As the title suggests (or rather gives away), it leads to a tragic conclusion, a conclusion revealed so that the whole film may operate on a level far more complex than mere formulaic convention. Since we know the fate of the hero, it is not about where the journey ends, or indeed how it ends. But rather what the journey is, and how the characters deal with it. James seems to flirt with the idea of death, having been rendered a stalinesque paranoia-case after losing faith in all of his gang members. Towards the end of the film, he relies only on the help of the Ford brothers Charlie and Robert, not being able to trust any one else. He would be proved right, when Robert is the one to pull the trigger.The Assassination of Jesse James is a majestic western. It is beautifully shot in a way that doesn't just please the eye, but utterly renders both the icy mood and bitterly cold temperature of the film it colours. The acting is first rate, with Brad Pitt playing the cold psychopath that is Jesse James with a subtle viciousness beneath his icy blue eyes. But Casey Affleck is the man who walks away with the film. Every scene he is in, he steals. His Robert Ford is brilliantly balanced between the enthusiastically enthralled and gawkish pathos. His obsession with James is understandable, given the legend of the outlaw that has spun a million myths in its wake, but it is reminiscent, at least to a modern audience, of a Mark Chapman ? the man who shot John Lennon. In fact one of the many themes running throughout Andrew Dominik's film is that of the obsession with a myth. He is known as the "coward" but is it to be a coward? Ford idolises James like many people do modern celebrities. When James reveals his spiteful and altogether psychotic edge to Ford, the myth is dispelled, and everything Ford had invested in him becomes crushed. All Ford could do to redeem himself, he felt, would be to kill James, and end the charade. But alas, all that did was strengthen the legend further.Perhaps in another world, it would be pleasant to know that The Assassination of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford gets all the credit it deserves, but it appears to have split many people up the middle. Some people think it is pretentious, and write sniffy articles about the film's languidness. Others think it is too long and obscure. I am at the point now when it really doesn't matter when dealing with a film of this magnitude, because it was a profoundly affecting experience, one reminiscent of the beautiful epics Terrence Malick used to make. If you find a better film this year, I would very surprised.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>bad boring movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess hiring Brad Pitt had to save the quality of the movie. In my opinion, my comic books are 10 times better than the movie. This movie is a waste of time to watch. Even fast forwarding becomes boring. Who ever wrote this movie, has no feeling for the Wild West.Believe me I am not going to watch it again. This movie was way to romantic, too much into the sky. My god ever seen a bunch of wild guys preparing a train robbery, totally clean shaved? Movies like Gunsmoke, Bonanza are even better. Even the guns they carry are way to clean. Take a look at their clothes, way tooo cleanSmoking Gun</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film isn't about Jesse James and the James gang. Nor is it an action Packed western about train robberies. The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is a film about how admiration can fester into resentment, and eventually hate. It's a film about love. It's a film about a time and place. And mostly, it's a film about life.The film begins with narration, then we meet Robert Ford (Casey Affleck). Ford idolizes Jesse James and wishes to join the James gang. Robert Ford is a peculiar young man who aspires to be idolized and admired the same way he, and a lot of the country views Jesse James. Affleck exudes desperation, loneliness, and almost a creepy Innocence. Despite his brother's disliking of Ford, Jesse (Brad Pitt) let's Ford tag along. From there we get a brilliant slow burner. Pitt is at his absolute best here. Gone is his pretty boy persona, and nice guy charm. Here he is unpredictable, despicable, and often horrifying. Throughout the film we see Robert Ford's blind worship of Jess deteriorate into resentment and hate. We see Jesse murder and injure others with very little motivation. Sam Rockwell excels as Robert Ford's brother Charlie, bringing a more preserved and mature approach to the life than Affleck's Robert Ford. He's especially remarkable during the brothers' stage performances. After the film's namesake, we are treated to a beautiful and moving final act, which showcases what the film is really about.The film is written/directed by Andrew Dominik, adapted from the novel by Roy Hansen. Dominik's other work includes Chopper, which contains a fine job from Eric Bana, and Dominik handles the story, tone, and character well. His most recent film, Killing Them Softly, re-teams Dominik with Brad Pitt, and also contains fine acting, and it's very stylish, albeit a little heavy handed. This film was photographed by Roger Deakins, mostly known for his frequent collaborations with Joel and Ethan Coen. Deakins perfectly captures and evokes the cold, unsettling feeling of the old West. There's a nice blur effect used during some of the narration at the opening of scenes. The moody and evocative score by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis also enhances the experience.The final minutes of The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford are reflective, thought provoking, and poetic. It sums up the entire film, and the oddities of life in less than 5 minutes. In a way, Robert Ford represents 99% of us, flawed human beings seeking a legacy, something to be remembered by, filled with regret, and eventually forgotten. This film reaches for a level of profundity seldomly seen in mainstream American films today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Picturesque, Slowly-Paced, Art Western with a 160 Minute Running Time may be Your Thing but After Sitting on the Shelf for Two Years, Someone Took Notice and Said, "Doesn't that picture look dusty." Surely it did, not only because it just lied there but maybe because it was Shelved because the Movie just lies there. It lies there begging you to Watch, Slowing Down so You can't Miss It. Smearing the Edges so it Looks Old and with a Malick like Voice Over that is Embarrassing, it also Mimics Malick in other ways.It is a Haunting Film with a Number of Set Pieces that Draw You in and are Nicely New in Presentation and Tone. But it can be Meditative and Contemplative to the Point of Tedium and Boredom and Much Happens that is Meaningless.Casey Affleck again Mumbles and Smirks His way through all of this and since He is a Title Character there is quite a bit of Mumbling and Smirking. Brad Pitt is Stern and Determined to Keep His Band of Misfits from Ambushing Him or Collecting the Reward Until the End when Jesse just seems to Give In to it all. There are some Rewards for those who Stick with This Doting Display of Hero Worship (or today called Celebrity), but those Moviegoers of Today (especially Western Fans) may be Tuned just a Little too Fine for this Type of Slow-Go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great film telling the lives of two similar yet, very different men</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERSThe Assassination of Jesse James By the Coward Robert Ford is a film that may be off-putting because of it's lengthy title. But none the less this is a film that must be seen. The name Jesse James has been one that has always been known, people may not know exactly who he is but rest assured they've heard of his name that demands people's attention.SPOILERS BEGIN HERE: This film however is in my opinion not about Jesse James and more about Robert Ford. A character that I find very interesting. Casey Affleck portrays the character as soft spoken and very figity. When I first saw the character I couldn't stand him, but I deeply enjoyed Jesse James, as time progressed however their roles flipped, I was rooting for Robert as I saw Jesse become the wild west's "Robin Hood" and turn into a common gang leader. Robert began in the movie as Jesse's #1 fan and as it progressed he was pushed into developing a deep and complicated resent for him.After a series of events Robert decides to arrest Jesse James and to do that he must become close to him. There are many who do not know how the legendary figure died, and it is not in the epic way so many western gun slingers meet their end, however for me it was equally intense. Jesse states that he should take his guns off to avoid suspicion in town, then after doing so says that a picture of a horse looks dusty, he walks over stands on to of a chair and sees Robert's reflection in the picture and does nothing, then he is shot. This whole scene (historically accurate) seems out of character for Jesse James and leads me to believe that he wanted Robert to kill him, (he previously gave Robert a gun as a present). The ending of the movie has me sympathizing for Robert, he felt he would have became a legend and instead....nothing. His life was full of remorse and mixed emotions. In 1892 Ford himself was assassinated by Edward O'Kelly.This is not the type of "Western" with epic showdowns one would imagine, it instead trades it for the intensity Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck bring to these two characters. I highly recommend that if you have even the slightest interest in this movie WATCH IT!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arguably The Most Underrated Movie Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The background of every outdoor shot, is incredible, the sky, the crops the grass, the snow !! Every outdoor shot is like a beautiful painting in motion.Its the most vivid and alive cinematography I remember in any movie. Most movies that have great cinematography tend to make things dark and lean towards noir, but in this movie I found the cinematography to be exactly the opposite, and far from making things dark and dull, the screen just seems so alive. This was the first thing that struck me about this movie and drew me in.The movie is one of the most comprehensive studies, of how the fear of a man can paralyse people, and how fear can make a man seem invincible to another, and how that fear will often lead us to greatly over estimate the situation and the danger present, and how that fear will lead us to take drastic steps. Brad Pitt as Jesse James is inspiring, and very believable as the feared Jesse James.Jesse James is a bandit, robber whatever you might wanna call him, that the people are afraid of, who chooses to justify his robberies in the name of the civil war, and is a hero to all those who are on the same side of the war as him. He has a demigod status among his followers and band members, and they say you can never sneak up on Jesse James, and you can, never betray him, for, no one knows how, but Jesse is always wise to every police party that has ever turned up at his door to arrest him, or of any gang member who has even thought of betraying him. There are kids that have grown up reading about his stories. One such kid is Robert Ford, who has a whole collection of things related to Jesse James and is encyclopedia on the man. He is a meek kid, who has been bullied all his life, and who, to use a very clichd line, has been nobody all his life. He has only ever had one dream that of being Jesse James. During one of the conversations, Jesse James in fact clearly asks him "Do you want to be LIKE me, or do you want to BE me." One day, with the help of his elder brother, gets to join Jesse James' gang and rob a train, and after the job is done, Jesse James, whose main crew has either retired or in jail, takes Robert Ford in his gang. Robert Ford is of course delighted, and tries to impress Jesse James all the time including with flattery. Jesse James realises that he has some kind of control over Robert Ford, and he uses him for rather unconventional chores, like carrying his stuff while shifting house, among other things. Jesse James at times finds Robert Ford to be queer and well weird. Robert Ford is subject to ridicule constantly from every member of the gang, and at times from Jesse James himself.Jesse James being one of the most, renowned criminals of his time has a huge bounty on his, and so some gang members are plotting to turn him in, and take the bounty himself. Then comes the moment, when the hero, who has been worshiped for so long falls from grace. Jesse James, at one mission opts to take Robert Ford's brother, instead of Robert Ford with him, and Robert Ford can't take it anymore. In his fury, and desire for fame, a desire for renown which ever bullied kid has in him, he does something drastic, and that forces him to live in constant fear of Jesse James, and he is worried, that if Jesse James finds out what he has done he will be killed, and a part of him tells him that Jesse James already knows.This fear paralyses him. Jesse asks Robert Ford and Robert Ford's brother, to join him on a trip to rob a bank, and they stay at Jesse's House for a day or two. It is here that things reach a boiling point, and it is a great study in human nature and drama, of how fear can drive someone to take drastic steps out of imagined danger.Brad Pitt as Jesse James, is exactly what the character should be, and in every scene he is in, you know he is in control of the situation. It is however, Cassey Affleck, who steals the show as the lost, self doubting, scared, self confidence lacking Robert Ford. His performance deserved more recognition than just the academy award nomination that he got for the role. I had seen Cassey Affleck in Gone Baby Gone, and found him to be superb, but as Robert Ford, I think it is one of the most memorable performances of the decade by an actor. The rest of the cast also turn in top level performances.The movie is a very deep study in character development, and human drama, and human nature. Some might find the pacing in the movie slow, so its not a movie for everyone. If the pacing in Shawshank Redemption and Schindler's List was alright for you, then you will not find this movie's pacing any problem. Any good story needs time to tell its story, and this movie is no different. Another word of caution is that some may have the misconception that this is a typical spaghetti western, with lots of fast gun drawing action, and shooting. Its not, its nothing like a spaghetti western, and if you into the movie expecting a lot of gunfire on screen then you will be disappointed. This movie has little mindless action, and focuses entirely on the human aspects, and is a great study in human nature.All in all, I think without doubt that this is one of the most underrated movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A haunting elegy for the Old West</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford", written and directed by Andrew Dominik, and starring Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck, is one of the most striking and memorable films I've seen lately. I'd heard about the film before ? heard that it had been a commercial flop, but was widely regarded as an underrated masterpiece, and one of the greatest westerns of our time. So I finally gave it a go, and boy, I heard it right! It's hard to pin down what it is that makes this film so great. I mean, sure, the acting, cinematography, music, etc. all play a big role. But there's something else going on here, some kind of cinematic alchemy at work that you don't see everyday. The film is haunting, beautiful, dreamlike yet piercingly real. There's something incredibly elemental about it. You can feel the coldness of the wind against your cheek, the warmth of the fire on your feet. You can feel the dirt underneath its nails, the water as it runs down its face.The story, based on an (especially then) obscure novel by Rob Hanson, concerns the relationship between the two titular characters: Jesse James (Brad Pitt) and Bob Ford (Casey Affleck). The title pretty much gives away the central event, but the film also covers the time leading up the big event, as well as its aftermath. Just in terms of period detail, it's probably one of the most realistic and historically accurate westerns I've ever seen.On its visual merits alone, it's an incredible watch, one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen. This should come as little surprise to those familiar with the cinematographer, Roger Deakins, but even so, this film is one of the jewels in his already illustrious crown. The look of the film is like old photographs of the era, or artwork from the likes of Andrew Wyeth. It is at once gritty and beautiful, realistic and otherworldly. Its use of light and shadow, natural scenery, and blurring effects at the edges of the screen also stand out. There are only a handful of filmmakers whose work you can mute and simply enjoy as visual experiences, among them Stanley Kubrick, Andrei Tarkovsky, and Terry Malick, to name three. This film easily qualifies in this category.The acting is also excellent, though generally understated. Brad Pitt, who can often be a hit-or-miss actor, hits here with a vengeance. It's easily one of the most subtle performances I've ever seen from him, and his screen presence alone would've made an Oscar nod warranted. Casey Affleck is also great, sometimes even stealing the scene from Pitt, and his ability to make us feel several things about a character at one time is impressive. The supporting roles, played by notable actors such as Sam Rockwell, Mary-Louise Parker, Jeremy Renner, Sam Shepard, Zooey Deschanel, and Michael Parks, round out the cast beautifully.The music, by Australian artists Nick Cave and Warren Ellis (both of them new to film scores) is incredibly beautiful, capturing the folk music spirit of the Old West, and compliments the tone and atmosphere of the film remarkably well.If one forced me to find one criticism of the film, it would be that it's a little too long. But I don't like making that claim, because I can't help thinking of the Emperor Joseph II, who criticized one of Mozart's operas for having "too many notes". Mozart reportedly replied, "Which notes would you like me to remove, your highness?" Though I have the subtle feeling that the film is longer than it strictly needs to be, I can't think of any one scene or sequence that could be removed without diminishing the film somehow.All in all, it's a wonderful film, and it's a crime that it isn't more well known than it is. I cannot recommend it highly enough. It will burn itself into your memory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is far from your typical western. Don't watch it with the expectation of dramatic gunfights - there are none. Still, there is an incredible feeling of tension throughout, because the story is simply superb. If you can tolerate a slower pace, and an absence of action scenes, see this movie. Perfect cinematography, and excellent acting by all performers. It's difficult to compare it to anything else, because the plot is completely different from any wild-west flick I've seen. From the very beginning, the narrator lets you know what's coming, and yet this still doesn't weaken the emotional effect of anything on screen.I know this sounds like your typical snobbish film review, but this really is an absolute must see. The first hour can be a bit confusing (I had trouble keeping track of the names) and sluggish, but the conclusion makes it all worthwhile. Give it a chance, and I promise you'll be hanging on every word. This is the kind of movie that sticks with you long after the end credits.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER RIGHT OFF THE BAT-------------------------I hope it's not a spoiler to say that Ford does shoot James somewhere near the end of the movie. I thought it would never get to that point, though.The cinematography is very good. I enjoyed looking at many of the scenes. But the parts of the movie I liked best were the voice overs. And when you like the voice overs better than when the characters are characterizing and expositioning, there's a problem. I understand the movie was cut originally to four hours, and then it was trimmed down to the two and a half hours it was released in. I'd suggest cutting another hour out.The part of the movie after Ford shot James was the best, so I'd leave that as is. I'd figure so many feet per minute. Then I'd just take a scissor to the parts in front of the assassination until I'd cut an hour's worth of feet out. Snip here, snip there, then see what I'd left in. I'd be satisfied with whatever was left.I understand Casey Affleck got rave reviews for his complex portrayal of Bob Ford. I think Brad Pitt was playing Warren Oates. I really liked Paul Schneider as Dick Liddil and Kailin See as Sarah Hite. The problem I have is that the movie was a series of scenes, some connected with each other, some not. Sort of like portraits of people. Long portraits. Like you're sitting there watching the portrait process as the paint dries. Great cinematography, lots of pretty scenes. But the only thing that got the movie going was the voice overs where we're being told what happens in between the static portraits and landscapes.Until the end, when we see Bob Ford and his brother Charley spiral into self-parody and death. The life of Jesse James was made less interesting than the unraveling of the life of Ford.Roger Deakins was cinematographer for this film, and he's been involved as cinematographer or director of photography for a few score others, including "Sid and Nancy," "Barton Fink," "The Hudsucker Proxy," "The Shawshank Redemption," "Fargo," "The Big Lebowski," "O Brother, Where Art Thou," "Intolerable Cruelty," "The Lady Killers" (you can't win 'em all), "Jarhead," and "No Country for Old Men."Andrew Dominik is credited as director and writer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very slow paced which is perfectly suited to its mood and story. Intensely involving with tremendous cinematography. One of the very best films. A true work of art obviously born of passion. I admire the courage and determination of the film-makers to persevere with such a project that obviously defies box-office formulas and would have difficulty making a profit. Looking forward to more by this director. It must be extremely challenging to put in the energy required to push a project such as this one through the many hurdles imposed by the movie industry but I certainly hope that great film-makers continue following this example. Highly recommended to anyone with the patience and interest in experiencing original and challenging (not in ideas for in form) cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why Didn't Anyone See This?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's unbelievable that a film starring the likes of Brad Pitt, Casey Affleck, Mary-Louise Parker and Sam Rockwell didn't have a bigger audience when it was released over a year ago. The cast alone should, in theory, bring people to see it, but on top of that the movie itself is great. Roger Deakins' cinematography, along with a beautiful somber score have all the makings of an instant Hollywood classic.Despite the fact that the film was nominated for best supporting actor and it's photography, The Assassination of Jesse James...tanked at the box office. That may be because it was marketed as a western when it most clearly is not...at least not in the sense that we know a western. The gun fights are short, few and very far between. What we are given instead is a psychological profile of two men destined to become some of the most infamous people in American history and mythology. It provides a historical context as well as a character driven narrative that combines for a fascinating look at this country's "glory days" of the old west.Affleck plays the young man (from the title we know what he will do) who is obsessed with his childhood idol Jesse James. As the youngest of three, Robert Ford joins the James gang in order to hang with the big boys and prove something to his brothers, and more importantly, to Jesse James. Ford is taunted by other members of the gang when they find old pulp novels about the gang's adventures. The books are something that Ford keeps hidden in a cigar box under bed, almost as a treasure that he keeps all for himself. These books have helped forge his perception of the gang, and are the basis of the myth surrounding the gang's young dynamic leader. Ford is clearly a character representing all of us: children who believe the myths told to us as fact. Unfortunately, Bob comes to find that there isn't much to those stories and that the James Gang is a group of men concerned with making money, killing, and backstabbing each other. The relationship between Pitt's character and his young future assassin is what drives the story not to a satisfying climax in which hero triumphs over villain, but an ending that negates everything we've been told about the old west and about America. The film is extremely subtle with how it does this. Too often in other films (Oliver Stone's, for example) is the American Dream chewed up and spit back at the viewer while the director sits with a hammer, ready to pound the point home. Not in this movie. True, the film makes it's point obvious that there is nothing romantic about the old west, but the motivations behind the assassination are blurred. It's not enough to say that Ford killed Jesse because he wanted to do the right thing: he didn't. It would be too easy to say that Ford killed Jesse because he wanted to prove himself (it's possible, but that's not what the film believes). The motivations become a mix of Ford wanting, not merely to be like Jesse James, but to be him. When the last frame finally fades out, one walks away from it, not merely commenting on the fact that these men are not the heroes of the old west that we heard about (besides any person with half a brain knows that). The film leaves you satisfied, not because you've seen a great movie, but because nothing was left out (at almost three hours, it shouldn't). You come to understand these men, to be invested in them, and that taken with the overall disillusionment of the old west culminates to one of the best films of 2007.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strangely enough, one of the most poetic Westerns to ever be made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Assassination Of Jesse James is possibly not only one of the finest films to have come out in 2007, but also one of the best westerns ever made. Yes, I agree with some of the views in here that you don't necessarily expect a western to quite turn out to be the way this one does and thats something I found myself immensely attracted to. This film has layers westerns have rarely achieved (the exception being Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven) and you could almost find yourself falling in love with the pain that some of the characters are hoping to come away from, in an almost poetic sort of way.Be it in the characterization (an excellent adaptation I must say) or the way the music, dialogues, and the cinematography have been used to bring to life a book onto the big screen, every single thing falls into place and How! Couldn't quite have been possible without the stellar cast lead by the two protagonists Jesse James (Brad Pitt) and Robert Ford (Casey Affleck). An exuberant portrayal of Jesse by Brad would surely count as one of his best so far (Along with Snatch and Babel) and a brilliantly effortless debut by the younger brother of an almost spent force (almost, if it wasn't for Gone Baby Gone) - Casey Affleck are without a doubt the greatest highlights of this film. Together as well as individually their's is a performance that has the power of almost bringing tears to your eyes and a heaviness into your heart you may have seldom felt before. Kudos to the director Andrew Dominik for bringing onto the cinematic world a brilliant gentlemen for whom the word 'sink' could only be in reference to a role, with his teeth thrown in.Do yourselves a favour folks, watch the Assassination of Jesse James today, and wait even after 'the moment' is over for another 20-30 odd minutes of drama so riveting, you could hardly blame yourselves for believing that the title was a dead giveaway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure that I can offer much more about how almost all of the characters are less than two-dimensional, and more forgettable than the faces of other people in line at a grocery store.I found myself wondering how this Jesse James got his name in the title without actually doing anything in the film. Saying that this film is about the legacy and death of such an infamous gangster/gun-slinger is like saying that Forrest Gump highlighted the failure that was the Vietnam war.Basically, 3:10 to Yuma exemplified the energy, valor, and excitement that The Assassination... needed. I'll grant that the scenery is kind of nice, but it's lost amid the clutter of bodies and plot pieces that are littered through the film.In my experiences, many of the finer films do require a second or third viewing before much of the nuances can be appreciated. Eraserhead, Dogville, Full Metal Jacket, they're loaded with symbolism and messages. This film left me reaching for meanings, trying to find some hint of an idea, but I was completely baffled and disappointed.By giving this collection of scenes such a low review, I find myself wondering if everyone who gives it a high review has just convinced themselves that they liked it; sort of a way of dealing with a severe trauma.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even if one is not versed in history, the title gives away the ending so there's no suspense here. The point of the movie is the journey, but this one is so mind-numbingly boring that one has to repeatedly ask, "Are we there yet?" About 13 hours into the movie, Robert finally shoots Jesse (hurray!). However, the film goes on for another three hours after that! In fact, it may still be playing. There are too many talking heads blabbering on and on about uninteresting things and much of the dialog is either slurred or mumbled (especially Afleck). The pompous narration adds to the misery. And what's with the repeated usage of the lens with blurry edges? Epic failure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too self-important to truly shine but definitely worth a rental</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This artsy, extended western does feel somewhat over-labored, indulging heavily in subplot and lengthy, actorly pauses without having enough backbone to do so, before finally finding it's footing over halfway through. Andrew Dominik is someone to look out for in the future with his noticeable sophomore release, offering a contemplative, slow-burning alternative to most westerns, guided by some impressive cinematography and airtight production.While much has been made of Casey Affleck's performance as Robert Ford, it really seems to be more about him simply stepping up to play a larger role in general. He hangs around with an admirable supporting cast and does not appear too out of place, but I really couldn't call his, or any of the chief performances outstanding. Brad Pitt continues to refine the obviousness of what made him successful, but even as the rugged and roughed up centerpiece he feels awfully lightweight in certain instances.If viewers are patient enough to sit through the less-involving first half of this lengthy piece with some curiosity then it just might transition from this pseudo-authentic, slightly homoerotic shoot into something a tad deeper on the nature of celebrity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't that picture look dusty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An elegiac Western with a strong Terrence Malick flavour, Dominik's movie is thoughtful, slow-paced, as it follows the last year of life of outlaw Jesse James (Brad Pitt) through the eyes of Robert Ford (Casey Affleck), the young and initially starstruck gang member who eventually shot him.Pitt is excellent as James - mournful, dangerous, enigmatic, a man of long silences who is just as likely to ponder over his own mortality as to hold a knife at your throat and study your reaction. Affleck, with his squeaky voice and averting eyes, is also great as the uncharismatic rookie planning betrayal: his Ford is a cunning, duplicitous boy who is *almost* able to sell himself as loyal, but not quite - his answers a little too calculated, his pauses a little too tense, as you almost hear the wheels spinning in his head. The supporting cast is strong, with a typically stellar turn by Sam Rockwell as Robert's brother Charley.James' death scene is superb - the sad, weary Jesse essentially commits suicide-by-traitor - but what follows is even more interesting; having acquired ephemeral celebrity, Ford starts to re-enact the killing in theaters, at first uncannily oblivious to the growing contempt towards him. As his brother Charley (playing James for their farce) glares at him from the stage, and the audience boos him from the darkness, Ford recoils with anger and horror, realizing the price he paid for his fifteen minutes of fame.A remarkable movie - and Roger Deakins' cinematography is something to behold - although anyone expecting a brisk, action-heavy, classic Western will be bitterly disappointed: this is a drama and a character study on themes like envy, mediocrity and deception, more "Amadeus meets Badlands" than Rio Bravo.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS.It is extremely hard to find a movie that succeeds on every level, where each character,costume, quote, scene, soundtrack plays huge role in creating perfectly balanced plot and directing. The Assassination of Jesse James by Coward Robert Ford is a movie about how veneration can turn in anger, and eventually in abhorrence. It's a movie about violence, respect, love and hate. It's a movie about a time and place. And first of all, it's a movie about life that everyone should see.The fantastic scenes(Robert killing Jesse, Railroad train robbery) and shots (wheat fields that Pitt elegantly moves through) of Roger Deakins along with intricate and stunning performances from Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck make the movie real and feel the audience engaged. Nick Cave and Warren Ellis deliver one of the soundtracks ever made ("Rather Lovely thing") that create the tensed and melancholic atmosphere. The costumes and elaborated dialogs make the plot flow easily. Andrew Dominik's direction is unique and flawless. He uses the camera in way that you never miss anything that happens and eventually keeps you riveted for almost 3 hours.As the plot develops, we see more and more depths of the characters. Robert Ford's unique obsession and craving to become like Jesse James leads to his inferiority complex. He starts to really consider himself a vagrant, an outlaw, a Hero. But he's the only one who thinks so. Robert spends his life proving that he is really what he wants to be, and eventually fails. Jesse James, on contrary, doesn't think of himself as a hero. He dies by his own choice, and becomes an icon of the society. All attempts of Robert to prove his bravery and heroism is futile and pointless. Robert Ford dies and becomes forgetful while Jesse James continues living as a famous icon even after his death.For those who believe that a movie is an art form that can make you think, this one is a masterpiece. And those who seek instant pleasures and use movies as a tool to kill time, you better find another one to watch. The Assassination of Jesse James by Coward Robert Ford is a philosophical, poetic, profound and limitlessly beautiful movie that is definitely worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How do you even begin to describe a movie like this?The fact that this movie is a true story only serves to benefit it. Most biopic films are held back by the reins of reality, like they're obligated to stick to the real-life formula. However, for this film, it works. It wears the inevitability of its history and its title like a badge of honor. It serves to be the journey, and it arrives at the destination with confidence. It knows that the audience knows what's going to happen, hell its based off of an American legend in the form of Jesse James, but its the last 25 minutes that holds the weight of the film. It still happened, but it relies on the fact that we don't know the fate of poor Robert Ford.Technically speaking, this film is an absolute marvel. Cinematographer Roger Deakins puts forth some of his absolute best work, even making his own lenses for parts of the film. The landscapes are large and barren, making the characters inside them seem mythic. Notably, that of Jesse James. Every performance in this film is pitch perfect, but Brad Pitt as Jesse James may be one of the best casting decisions in recent memory. Jesse James is a legend, but he is no God. He's a volatile, paranoid, angry man, who shows moments of being kind, funny, fatherly, and overall shows a glimpse of a good man. But he's a human being. A deeply flawed man who murdered people.But everyone loves him. And people to this day still do.The film is a critique about the way we see fame. Or infamy. The titular Jesse James is a man impossible to form a solid opinion on. Robert Ford on the other hand is different. He's just a kid, that idolizes Jesse more than anyone. But he discovers that his legendary hero, is nothing more than a man. The film chronicles the last year of Jesse's life with his gang, and ends with Ford shooting him, and the rest of Ford's life. The rest is something you have to experience. This movie has one issue, its a half an hour too long, and that would've been solved if Dominik was able to give his directors cut. I can say the last 25 minutes of this movie hit me like a sledgehammer. The score, the camera-work, the acting, even the story, it all feels so incredibly mythic, but the kicker is, that its real. Its a film that paints an accurate portrait of what we know. And by the end, made me never look at this story, history, or fame, ever again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This isn't your Father's type of Western, and that's a Good Thing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You might think the title of the movie spoils the entire ride with its spoil heavy title, well I'm here to tell you you'd be dead wrong. The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is one of the most thought-provoking films I've seen in a very long time. Not because the story is puzzling or complex, but rather because it gives us a different perspective than one might think based off the title. This is not a movie about Jesse James, instead, it is a drama that explores Robert Ford's relationship with Jesse before the assassination and the fallout that comes from it.One thing is for certain, this isn't your fathers type of western. There are no wild shootouts, horse chases, elaborate bank robberies, or even a hero for that matter. This is a tale of one character's rise to infamy through another character's downfall. Put bluntly, the movie is more of an epilogue than anything else. The movie is primarily told from Robert Ford's perspective which only makes things that much more poignant about the entire situation. We see the impact meeting the real Jesse James has on him and how his ideas of him become warped over time and what that means for the fate of both men. From Robert idolizing Jesse, to him thinking he is 'just a human being'.It's not easy to see who is a hero and who isn't, those lines are intentionally blurred. The beginning of the film clearly makes the case for Robert Ford being an over the top obsessive fan of Jesse James, which points him out to be the 'bad guy' as the title suggests. But as time goes by the director moves away from this notion and starts to build up the idea that Robert Ford as acting not out of pure cowardice, but perhaps out of self-defense, or so Jesse will have him believe. It's this vague line that makes the movie so intriguing, who truly was playing who? But at the same time, there is also the idea of self-promotion at play. This is an opportunity for Robert to achieve the stardom he has always wanted. Finally, Robert Ford has been given his chance at fame, but certainly not the type of fame he was looking for.The beauty comes at the end of the film when we are shown the final years of Robert's life now having to live with the fateful decision. He is given fame but at the cost of torment and public ridicule for killing a beloved figure. Interesting enough is that we don't truly see what the public thinks of Jesse James till he is gone. He is seen as a celebrity by many, but the entire movie leading up to this point keeps this aspect hidden from the viewer. As if Robert Ford himself simply believed he could replace the man himself, simply take his fame and make it his own and no one would know. It's beautifully structured so that as the movie progresses you start to actually sympathize with Robert more and more right up to the bitter end. Yes, he may have been a creepy sociopath to begin with but as his suffering unfolds before our eyes it's hard not to pity the man. The brilliance truly stems from focusing on Robert over Jesse.And as for the soundtrack, it's spectacular and more importantly moving. It helps paint the 'wild west' as a slow moving and sorrowful place, where heroes are born but also where they will eventually die. This score mixed with the stunning cinematography, which at times obscures the image, create a perfect dreamlike tone (as if the whole movie is some sort of fantasy of Roberts').I can easily say this is one of my favorite western movies ever made. It's subtle, beautiful, and moving. And as I said above, the movie is rather slow (especially the first half) but the ending is more than rewarding. It leaves you emotionally conflicted, feeling sorrow for the so-called 'coward' of the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A flawed movie but it makes up for it by having great direction techniques</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though long, this movie contains some pretty moving scenes and it's a great effort which retells the final months of Jesse James life. It's about a younger member of the notorious James Gang who becomes drawn to him but he soon fears him killing him and he thinks about doing the unthinkable. The soundtracks are moving and they're emotional and powerful. For a western, the actual gun-slinging is kept to a minimum as the movie focuses on the characters themselves. Dominik's direction is near flawless. He lingers long on shots and he captures the characters expressions and uneasiness. By using this style, he allows the characters to give near perfect performances. However, the film doesn't explore these concepts thoroughly and leaves it a bit too ambiguous. I don't like it when films spell everything out for me. Another feature the film lacks detail in is the female cast. They are insignificant and are reduced to mere cameos. When this played at the Venice film festival, it was 4 hours long. It was cut shorter since then but my issues with the length would probably be more bigger had it not been cut down. I don't think this movie is a masterpiece like many other people think but it's very close to one and it is rather underrated. If you like slower paced movies then this is for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am, to be honest, technically illiterate in the art of film. I have no real knowledge of blocking or mise-en-scene, I couldn't write a screenplay to save myself and I am a poor actor at the best of times. Despite this, I find myself fascinated by film. The medium is one that captures the contemporary imaginative landscape like no other, whether it be Breaking Bad or Toy Story 3.Despite having seen this film 8 years too late, I can honestly say I cannot recall a film that demanded my attention as assuredly as this. It is certainly a slow film. It does not grab your attention through aural assault nor does it manipulate you or demand emotional investment. What it does do is grab your attention through it's sheer command of the medium. Whether it be Roger Deakin's breathtaking cinematography, Nick Cave's mesmerising score (composed without even a frame to reference) or Brad Pitt's zeitgeist-defying performance, this is a film that by it's very existence defies expectation. If you enjoy artists at the peak of their powers, Andrew Dominik's The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is a film you MUST see.</fullReview>

Settings and costumes are historically accurate in the finest detail. The frozen landscapes and vast, moody skyscapes are breathtaking. Admittedly, there is a relative dearth of stage blood and the gunshots sound like the real thing, but it still amazes me that anyone could find this film boring.

From the summary to the previews and trailers, It all seemed about "just right" at the beginning, nothing to add on, nothing breakthrough about it... Just when the first closed ups and narration started I was totally immerse. The film got me, and it got me good; from the shots to the script and scenery, passing through the costume design and soundtrack, the amount of almost flawless things about the film just keep getting higher and higher. But, what really put the seal at the end of the envelop and make me realize what a master piece this film was, was Cassey Affleck's performance. ABSOLUTELY ASTONISHING. Nothing else. His eyes, his voice, his movements, the way he walks... Everything sold me, it was amazing, something I will always relate to.Recommended to a 100%.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert Ford, who's idolized Jesse James since childhood, tries hard to join the reforming gang of the Missouri outlaw, but gradually becomes resentful of the bandit leader. The last months of Jesse James's life, from meeting Robert Ford, a 19-year-old who idolizes Jesse, to the day Ford shoots him. Jesse's a wanted man, living under a pseudonym, carrying out a train robbery, disappearing to Kentucky, and reappearing to plan a bank holdup with Robert and Robert's brother as his team. The rest of the gang is dead, arrested, or gone from Missouri. Whenever Jesse's around, there's tension: he's murderous, quixotic, depressed, and cautious. Ford wants to be somebody and wants the reward. On April 3, 1882, things come to a head: Jesse is 34, Robert 20. Ford becomes famous, reenacting the shooting on stage, facing down the label "coward," shot dead in 1892. Roger Ebert wrote: "Few things have earned me more grief from readers than my recent suggestion that in the sport of sex, Capt. Renault of "Casablanca" plays for both teams. I think I will get less disagreement when I focus on the homosexual undertones of "The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford." Jesse (Brad Pitt) is certainly not gay, but the Coward (Casey Affleck) is so powerfully mesmerized by him that hero worship shades into lust. Since sex between them is out of the question, their relationship turns into a curiously erotic dance of death; it is clear to both of them (and to anyone reading the title) what must happen at the end, and they move together toward that event with almost trancelike inevitability. Yes, it is long, at 160 minutes. There is a sense that an epic must have duration to have importance. The time reaching ahead of us must be as generous as the landscape unfolding before us. On this canvas Dominik portrays his hero at a time when most men were so powerless, they envied Jesse James even for imposing his will on such as they." The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. Andrew Dominik's The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, is a deliberately paced, stunningly visualized, and emotionally charged exploration of the early development of mass media celebrity in America.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brooding and moody western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There has been countless stories on the notorious Old West outlaw and his many escapades during his time as well as in cinema. In films like Henry King's Jesse James, the folk icon is romanticized as a righteous bandit comparable to Robin Hood. With Andrew Dominik's adaptation, the charismatic rogue is portrayed in a less flattering light as a temperamental and tormented killer played by the reliable Brad Pitt. Casey Affleck in an Oscar-nominated turn plays the noted coward in the ridiculously long title. Affleck's depiction exhibits feelings of inadequacy, childlike wonder and envy towards his hero Jesse. Similar in ways to Tom Ripley in The Talented Mr. Ripley, the character is a sneaky loser with entitlement issues. Like Dominik's previous fictionalized biopic Chopper, he presents a challenging effort about a legendary crime figure but employs the western with a more somber and poetic tone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A modern masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After going through a recent obsession of classic westerns, something odd nowadays for a teenager apparently, I bought The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford thinking it would be a nostalgic homage to western films of old like the brilliant Unforgiven. Instead, I was treated to a tense drama profiling the final days of America's famous train robber. I'm glad I made the mistake of picking up this film because it is one of the best films I have seen in a long time. Casey Affleck defies his brother's reputation for abysmal acting talent (sorry but it's true) by pulling off a stellar performance as the creepy but likable character Robert Ford and Brad Pitt has one of his best performances as the troubled Jesse James. Both actors manage to cloud the audience's opinion subtly and slowly almost without you noticing until the film's over. A solid supporting cast of Sam Rockwell and Jeremy Renner manage good performances in the background without taking the attention away from the two leads. The only flaw I can find is that Casey Affleck can at times be too slimy for my liking but that's me personally more than anything else. Anyone who enjoys films and wants to see some career best performances should definitely make the time to watch this brilliant movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unusually Contemplative Western, Vivid Cinematography, Thoughtful Performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This often startling and frequently beautiful film is not a simple Western, definitely not a bang-bang shoot-em-up where good guy beats bad guy and everything is hunky-dory in about 90 minutes.This film is a curious sort of history lesson, a deliberate and artfully conceived look at the Cult of Celebrity, not too different from the way fame is concocted today; neither of the lead characters are particularly admirable men, as James the Outlaw has robbed and slain innocents, often merely because he finds them suspicious or annoying. The man who stalks James and ultimately shoots him (no spoiler here--check out the title!) is nervous, craven and unsettled; he projects fame and riches from the accomplishment of a craven act and must deal with unexpected consequences.There are some vivid recreations of the Old West, many contemplative shots in the snow and ice or blowing fields of wheat--the director expects the viewer's immersion in atmosphere and character--this is not an easy film to enjoy, especially if you are used to traditional Western action--but its a deeply thoughtful meditation on a culture that rolls out heroes regardless of consequence and its loaded with startling performances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As this film already has more than a hundred reviews, I will not expound much about it. I would rather share with you my experience and my perception regarding the story.True, this film is a work of art, as many here has already exclaimed. The cinematography alone would move a sensitive soul. As with all works of art, even the most beautiful and revered masterpiece will not appeal to everyone. Watching a movie, like looking at an art piece, is all a matter of taste. This film is no different.The story is not fast-paced, it's not action-packed, nor would bullets be flying around in every scene. Jesse James will not show any fancy gun moves nor will he kill a thousand men. What you will see isn't about Jesse Jame's "exciting" life. It's about his death and how it came about in the hands of Robert Ford.I believe this story would appeal more to the person who can appreciate a slow building up of a plot, and who won't yawn at the absence of death and destruction. Kind of like the person who wants to know how a thing came to be, rather than what it can do. If you're like this, then you will be able to appreciate the movie for what it is. If not, it would be best if you skip it. An appreciation of a finished work is not solely about intelligence, it's a sensitivity for such things.If you can see the beauty of this film, however, it is a nice experience. Not mind-blowing, no. I doubt it would move you to tears, but it will be enough to make you sigh in the end.Movie is recommended, but not for everyone.</fullReview>

Admittedly I was marvelling at how fantastic it looked playing the blu-ray on my new TV, but even so there was very little not to like.I know nothing about the actual history of these events, or the book upon which the film is based, so I cannot comment on it's accuracy or otherwise. But it drew me in completely. It is suspenseful in a fairly understated way, Pitt is menacing but human; his idoliser, Robert Ford, is complex and tragic. The supporting cast all put in strong performances.Despite the fact that the (near) ending is already known, when it comes, it is mesmeric.Some reviewers have commented that it is too long, perhaps I can see that the section immediately after Jesse's death which briefly covers the rest of Robert Ford's life could have been omitted, but actually the film is about him as much as it is about Jesse, and I wanted to know his fate. I am glad it was there.The camera work and direction are stunning.See it! And if you have access to HD then you'll really appreciate it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2007 has been a very good year for very good Western films. There was No Country for Old Men, There Will Be Blood, and now this film. The Assassination of Jesse James By the Coward Robert Ford is a great film that tells a story of friendship and rivalry between Robert Ford and Jesse James. Robert glorifies Jesse and finds him as his idol even though James is clearly not portrayed as an idol.The acting is very good. Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck steals the show with their mesmerizing performance. However, it is not often I'll say that another actor is better than Brad Pitt. But in this film, Casey Affleck is better than Brad Pitt and deserves that Academy Award nomination.Overall, this is a fun movie to watch.

		<fullReview>Since the review I've read talks only about the technical aspects of the movie, I feel like dropping by my feelings while I was watching the movie.I was expecting to watch a movie with some good ol'shooting going around, but I was terrible wrong, but surprisely not disappointed. This movie tells history, what comes packed together is a story of a man and a boy, both trying to survive in an hostile environment which was in the turmoil of change, they are somehow uncertain of their future as they swung between manhood, confidence, trust, fear and love. Brad Pitt was never a pretty face and he shows it to us at every single movie, and Casey stands out in the screen, we could have had another in his role, but I'm glad we didn't.To cut out the chase here, I think this movie tells the story of death through life and vice-versa, both at the same time. It shows how many weight a killer carries in his back and how many you have to carry to become one. Their decisions shape their future so perfectly, as the fall of one predicts the rise of another. The question is: Is he prepared to take his place in the world?So the movie answer this question and gives us a bitter taste of what you have to do to get anywhere in life. You have to take a step, you need to be patient, you have to be in the right place at the right time, you need luck and them life might give you a shot. Once you get there, sometimes it might pop out another question: Is that what you are really looking for? All of this is given to you just with glances, stares and imagery. I'm happy to say, I like the way they carried out this.I'll give it a 9/10, why? I really don't know because I was really into the characters, they can give you so much with bare silence. Maybe I was missing some CGI-action shooting? Who knows? A must see...</fullReview>

An earlier reviewer called it "a hard sell" and I must admit my first thought at the end of this film was "how the hell did they get the financiers to sign off on this?". It's a gunfight movie with barely a gunfight in it, and yet it well never cease to grab you from the first moment to the last. Every scene in this movie is compelling. Each scene could almost stand on its own as an exemplar of the art of cinematography, screen writing, direction and acting. I've seen reviews that say this movie was too long. No, it's not quite long enough, and if you watch it at home the first thing you'll do after losing yourself in Nick Cave's haunting soundtrack that rolls with the credits is to replay it all over again (BTW, Cave cameos in the movie as saloon bar singer, so watch out for that!).What is there to say about the plot that hasn't already been said? Each and every character is a study in the personal, moral, and opportunistic pitfalls of a life that is knocked from pillar to post by the winds of fate. You can't help but empathise with every one in the movie and their fate, even (perhaps especially...) Robert Ford. If you like movies that move you, you'll love this one. Guaranteed.</fullReview>

An eager recruit into James' notorious gang, Robert Ford eventually grows jealous of the famed outlaw. This is an adaptation of Ron Hansen's 1983 novel of the same name, the film dramatizes the relationship between James and Ford. This is Pitt's and Affleck's first collaboration outside of the Ocean's trilogy.A narrator introduces many facts and legends about the American Old West outlaw Jesse James and tells the story of Bob Ford, an insecure, unpopular young man who has grown up idolizing Jesse.Bob seeks out Jesse when the James gang is planning a train robbery, and makes petty attempts to join the gang with his brother Charley's help, who had been recently recruited. Jesse kills him and goes on a hunt for Jim, bringing Dick along.At the farm, Dick and Jesse are greeted by Albert Ford, Bill's young son. Although Albert does not know where Jim is, Jesse beats him. Later Jesse weeps and rides away. Dick decides to apologize to the Fords by traveling back to Martha's farm. Wood returns from Kentucky to the Bolton farmhouse during Dick's visit and rushes up the staircase to the closed bedroom door, and Bob and Dick prepare themselves for the imminent gunfight. After a short gun battle, Bob shoots Wood in the back of his head. Fords dumps his body in the woods and hatch a plan to conceal this event from Jesse. Jesse re-emerges one night to pay a visit to the Fords. During dinner, Jesse notices Bob's anxiety and forces Bob to tell a story. Bob then reluctantly recites a long list of similarities he has with Jesse. At his home in St. Joseph, Jesse learns of Wood's disappearance.Bob loses respect for Jesse as he realizes the nickel books he had read little resemble the man. Bob talks with Kansas City police commissioner Henry Craig, saying that he has information regarding Jesse James's whereabouts. To prove his allegiance with the James gang, Bob urges Craig to arrest Dick Liddil, who has been staying at the Bolton farm.Days after Dick's arrest, Bob attends a party held by the Governor of Missouri, Thomas T. Crittenden, celebrating Henry Craig's efforts to finally rid Jackson County of the James Gang. To Bob's surprise, Dick Liddil has been released from jail and is now meeting with the governor. It is revealed that authorities aren't particularly interested in prosecuting Liddil; they're really after Jesse James. To save himself, Liddil has disclosed information about the James gang's robberies in his confession. Bob is brought into a meeting with the governor, and subsequently strikes up a deal with him. Bob is given 10 days to capture or assassinate Jesse James for a bounty of $10,000, and is given further instructions by Craig's partner, Sheriff James Timberlake. Meanwhile, on the way back from St. Joseph, Jesse talks to Charley about suicide. Charley then convinces Jesse to take Bob under his wing. The brothers move in with Jesse to his home in St. Joseph, where they stay with Jesse's wife Zee and their two children. One night in the living room, Jesse invites the Fords to take part in the robbery of the Platte City bank. He enacts the way he'll cut the cashier's throat, and demonstrates this by holding a knife to Bob's neck. Convinced that Jesse will eventually kill them, Bob decides to kill him first. As a way to apologize for his actions, Jesse gives Bob a brand new pistol on April Fools' Day, and tells him that he fears for his own sanity. On a day soon thereafter, Jesse goes out to retrieve the latest newspaper. As it contains a story about Liddil's arrest and confession,a terrified Bob had slipped the front section of the newspaper under a shawl, then strapped on his gun holster before sitting down in the kitchen for breakfast.Jesse walks back to the sitting-room and discovers the hidden section of the newspaper, learning of Dick's confession. Jesse glares at Bob, and asks why this matter hadn't been reported to him. Panicked, Bob excuses himself and retreats to the sitting-room rocking chair, and Charley soon follows him to put on his holster. Jesse walks in to see if the two are ready for the trip to Platte City. After some silent contemplation, Jesse takes off his gun belt and lays it on the couch. Jesse sets up a chair under a dusty portrait and climbs on top of it with a feather duster in one hand. The Fords draw their guns, and Bob shoots Jesse in the back of the head, killing him instantly. When Zee tearfully questions Bob, he denies doing or knowing anything before Charley pulls him out of the house, declaring it an "accident". The Fords run to the telegraph office to wire the governor with the news. A brief montage then follows, describing what is to happen to the body of Jesse James.On the strength of its two lead performances of Pitt and Affleck,Assassination is an expertly crafted period piece, and and insightful look at one of the enduring figures of American lore.Writer- director Andrew Dominik takes his time with the story, but his languorous pacing allows tension to build -- and permits the actors, Affleck in particular, to add nuance and depth to characters who'll seem familiar only at first glance.What's worse,it's a view of the West beyond the myth that's worth enduring, if not relishing.That is why did not become a commercial success.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is certainly a well-crafted film. The cinematography by Roger Deakins is beautiful, as is Nick Cave's score. Brad Pitt captivates as always, and the other main performances (Casey Affleck, Sam Rockwell, Jeremy Renner, Paul Schneider) are all quite accomplished as well. The personalities of James (charming but dangerous) and Ford (hero-worshipping, meek, eager for recognition) make a compelling contrast. The movie engages your attention despite its slow pace, and is a fairly interesting deconstruction of Western mythology. But I had a couple of problems with it. The narration is delivered poorly, and often insults the audience by spelling things out too plainly. More troublesome is the air of self-importance that hangs over everything. Dominik strives for a Malick-ian aesthetic but lacks the emotional and philosophical content to back it up. I tend to appreciate an elegiac tone, but I often wondered what purpose it was serving. It felt overdone to me, as if I was being cajoled into recognizing a profundity that wasn't there. It needed to back off just a bit. I did generally enjoy the experience, however.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A complex and engrossing story about friendship, idolatry and obsession</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"He's just a human being," the 'coward' Robert Ford at one point says about Jesse James. There is of course little doubt about that, but this is a film where the lines between man and legend, idolatry and obsession, and coward and hero are as blurry as the images through which the events unfold. There is another quote by Ford that nicely symbolizes the central conflict of the film: "I've been a nobody all my life. I was the baby; I was the one they made promises to that they never kept. And ever since I can recall it, Jesse James has been as big as a tree." Because in the centre of the film, we find these two characters, played by two wonderful actors.Jesse James is naturally the hero. Already in the film's first lines, his mythical nature is established; Jesse James had two bullet holes in his chest, a severed middle finger, and a condition that made him blink more than usual. When he entered a room, the temperature rose, the time slowed and the sounds were amplified. And he had allegedly killed seventeen people. Throughout the film, this myth is in equal parts deconstructed and reinforced. In the end, it is probably quite clear that he is not the legend that he is made out to be, but the public are never made aware of this, and somewhat ironically keep worshipping him. He is played by a fantastic, rather understated Brad Pitt, who never takes up more space than the role requires. Pitt does have his moments to shine though. There is one scene that stands out to me, in which he first beats a child and then breaks apart, perhaps showing his first signs of weakness.The other character is Robert Ford ? a young and frail man, but with "an appetite for greater things," which ultimately leads to the film's tragic conclusion. Ford's search for glory where none is to be found is truly heartbreaking. We learn that he is more than a coward, or perhaps not a coward at all, but people in contrast do not know this, and in the end, no one worships him. While Brad Pitt is absolutely brilliant, he is actually outshone by Casey Affleck in one of the best performances I have seen.These characters and their complex, fascinating relationship is backed by one of the most technically accomplished films of the year. First, there is the cinematography that I hinted at earlier, which actually captures the feeling of warmth and slowing time, when it is not focusing on stunning landscapes. Then there is the score by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis, which is fabulous as well; there is a feeling of sadness and regret running through many of the songs, such as "Rather Lovely Thing", that suits the film perfectly.Finally, director Andrew Dominik takes his time to tell the story. Some have criticised the film for being slow, but I think the slow journey towards the inevitable assassination only increases the emotional impact. Of course, we know what will happen, but the old adage about removing the element of surprise and getting the element of suspense has never been more true.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great recent film about friendship, betrayal and the Wild West</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard great things about this film, decided to see it, and was not disappointed. What had taken me so long was never having seen anything from Dominik before, and a difficulty with both Westerns in general and in taking Brad Pitt's acting seriously, although the allure and the mystique of the Jesse James mythology was certainly enough of a pull for me to eventually give this film a chance, and I was certainly glad in retrospect that I had the courage to watch it. I cannot overemphasize how great was the cast, the music, the direction, and the cinematography. Specifically I would recommend the film to those who like me would nary the thought of watching either a Western or a Brad Pitt-featured film. More films have to be made, not of action and special effects but, like TAOJJBTCRF, that get into the hearts, minds, and souls--the humanity, if you will--of the people with the holsters, guns and horses. Many kudos to Dominik, and I actively look forward to seeing more of his work in future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm totally confused why this movie has not been rated the score it has. It is one of my favorite movies of all times. I absorb it so much more because, of the history, you also see into the psyche of Jesse James, and with the unsatisfaction of a good part of the Unites Sates after the Civil War, and the government taking their lands for development is not so different than today. People were struggling to survive. After 30 some odd years the Civil War, the impact that the war between the states made was apparent. I truly wish that this movie could be relaunched, I think with the dissatisfaction that the current state of the Union, foreclosures, layoffs, politics can me more retaliative today more than 4 years ago. I can't agree with someone killing, but I can see what your environment creates , and the need of survival weighs out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be honest, I think this movie is great. When I start to watch, I feel it exciting. However, as a foreigner, sometimes their behavior and language is little difficult to me to understand because of the culture and background.First, the actors in the movie are very good. Because in the movie, there are many inner scenes, so it's hard for the actor to show their emotion, to let us feel and believe what they are faced. But they really made me feel nervous or exciting or upset. I do think their performance very delicate. And due to this point, the story looks very smooth. So I will recommend it to the people who like some types of western movies but not too much action. Second, I do like the music and the way how to capture the scenes. Especially in some horrific scenes, the music and the light coop in a wonderful way so that make me focus in the film. After the show, I will still think about it. How that scene looks like, dramatic and wonderful feeling. Last but not least, the story can represent the American's life in that period and some unique spirits of American. Jesse James look as a hero in that time, and his life is really dramatic. I can image that period's life in America. So although I am not American, I will still like this kind of story. Generally, I like this film because its' story, actor, music. Not like the other western films, it's not always full of shooting scenes or fighting scenes, it make you understand and think more about that time in US. To me, it has deeper meaning.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Calling the Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford beautiful would be an understatement. Calling the acting superb would be an understatement. Calling it a perfect film... would be an understatement. This is the powerful story about what it means to truly be a hero, and every aspect of it left me in awe once I was finished. But, this movie isn't for everyone. The story follows Robert Ford (Casey Afflick),a man whose obsession with Jesse James (Brad Pitt) goes back to his childhood, as he tries to join Jesse and his slowly deteriorating gang. Robert's idolization of Jesse slowly begins to change as the movie goes on as he realizes who Jesse James truly is. We watch as Jesse's sanity plummets, becoming paranoid of everyone around him and dancing on the edge of insanity. Before long, Robert loathes Jesse. Finally, fearing that Jesse's paranoia will lead to his own death, Robert assassinates Jesse (BIG spoiler...). Most people would sigh when they hear it's a film that clocks in at almost 2 hours and 40 minutes long. I will admit, it is a very long movie. Also, many people will watch this thinking that it's your classic western shoot em up, only to be horribly disappointed. It's true, there are very intense scenes of Jesse and his gang in the movie, but they are few and short. But the people who think the movie is too long and boring are missing the entire point of the film. The movie is about what it really means to be a hero. Robert's love for Jesse completely changes once he discovers what kind of man he really is. The people who say there are "too many boring scenes" fail to see what's REALLY going on. In each scene, we watch Jesse push himself farther and farther away from Robert, playing around with his emotions as if they were a toy. We feel empathy toward Robert's character, a man who only wants to be recognized by someone who he believes is almost like a god. The film reveals who we all truly are. The acting in the movie might be the best I've ever seen. Every action, down to facial expression, that Casey Afflick does makes us understand all the pain he goes through. We can almost feel the depression he goes through, and I'm amazed Casey didn't receive more recognition for the most powerful performance I've ever seen in a movie. Brad Pitt makes us hate Jesse through his performance, which is probably the best I've ever seen him do. Brad expresses Jesse's insanity perfectly, creating one of the best 'villains' out there. Sam Rockwell and Jeremy Renner are perfection, helping to shape the movie into a masterpiece. Some people will hate this movie. It's not full of action and it's long, but it still packs a punch. Most likely the best film I've ever seen, I recommend watching it to anyone who wants to watch more than just a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie as long as its title but beautifully made and acted out!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I can understand some people not liking this movie. It's pace and style is not just for everybody but having said that, I personally absolutely loved it! Most important thing to know is that this is not a western at all. At least not in the classic sense of the word. It just happens to be a movie that is set in the old west but features none of the typical genre clichs and familiar ingredients. This movie can be more looked upon as a history lesson, being told by some skillful film-makers, both in front and behind the camera's.And that's basically what this movie is; an historical retelling of the Jesse James story, or even a biopic, if you will. And it at all times remains a very authentic feeling and looking one. This means that nothing ever gets exaggerated or glorified. No heroic shootouts or brave characters without fear in this movie. It instead features very real human characters of flesh and blood, with all of their emotions and imperfections. It's not a movie that is in love with its subject but it only, again, tries to tell a true story about true people and where needed, gives its own interpretations on how certain things probably would had transpired, about 120 years ago.And here lies the movie's greatest strength; its authentic look and feeling. And thankfully this also all can be seen back in the movie its characters. I just loved how it showed the good and bad sides of both Jesse James and Robert Ford and how the movie was never picking sides for any of them. It instead tried to create some understanding and sympathy for both of the characters and the movie really succeeded beautifully with this. But this all is also obviously thanks to its actors, who portray all of the movie its most important characters. Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck are both really perfect in their roles. Casey Affleck even got nominated for an Oscar and when you see this movie it's not so hard to see why really. He plays a pretty complex and hard character with much conviction. But with all this talk about Affleck and Pitt, people tend to forget all about Sam Rockwell, who I aways think deserves far more credit than he's ever receiving.It's no spoiler of course that in the end Jesse James is getting killed by Robert Ford. After all, this is in the movie its title! But I must say that the entire execution of it (no pun intended) and the build up to it is done incredibly. It's both really tense and powerful and you're literally holding your breath when it's 'finally' happening. I was absolutely loving the movie its final 30 minutes or so but by saying that I'm not saying that I was bored or not as happy with the movie its first 2 hours.Even though it's a really slowly told movie and doesn't feature much action in it, I can't say that it ever felt like a boring or overlong movie. It was always an interesting movie to watch, thanks to the dynamics between the characters and the way the entire movie got shot and told by director Andrew Dominik, who only makes movies once every few years.And lets not forget about Roger Deakins' cinematography, that gives the movie an even more authentic look and feeling to it. It was a great move to hire him for this movie, since his visual style is perfect for this movie. The main audience will know Deakins' work for basically all of the Coen brothers movies, that often have a sort of similar authentic look and feeling to them.Perhaps you have to be a real lover of cinema or one of the more old school style of film-making to fully enjoy and appreciate this movie but for me it was an absolutely great one to watch!8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's a lot of great things about this movie and the characters are played pretty much flawlessly. Great acting. The only thing is the length of the movie sometimes swayed my concentration a tad...not much though. I am really glad this movie turned out good because i love westerns and all things wild west related. Jesse James, being probably one of the biggest names of the times. Great insight to the times leading up to Jesse's demise and a very intriguing insight into Jesse as a person by true accounts. A must see for movie lovers. If you like westerns, historical or down right great movies then i highly recommend this movie. I'm giving it a 8 because of 2 reasons.1-the lenght and 2-i never give any movie a 10. you can always be disappointed at some part.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually stunning, emotionally charged and film art in its purest form</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where do I start? Andrew Dominik's camera moves beautifully along throughout the entire movie and the cinematography by Roger Deakens is absolutely stunning, similar to Terrence Malick.I fell in love with this movie the first time I saw it and insisted I show it to everyone that I knew and for the most part, all felt the way I did and upon further viewings, I have become more fascinated by this beautiful film.Brad Pitt is at the top of his game and should have received at least a nomination for his portrayal of the famed outlaw. The entire cast is superb; including Shepard, Affleck, Renner, Rockwell and all bring their A games to this beautiful movie.I say beautiful over and over because it is the best way to describe it; the lighting, the camera angles, the pace of the movie, the acting, the directing, the score, the cinematography all leave you breathless. The movie is over 2.5 hours long but I could've had watched it for another 5.If you appreciate art, talent, form, vision, life, exceptional acting, amazingly paced story telling, fitting narrative and understand what film as an art form is, then you will appreciate this movie for what it's worth.The gloom of death hovers over Pitt the entire movie and it's as if by the end, he is inviting death, wishing, hoping, praying for it. This gloom is not only in his mind, because due to wonderful directing and tone, we feel this impending and imminent death as well. Affleck and Rockwell almost feel compelled to end Pitt's suffering and it is Affleck who administers the final shot.This movie will move you; it will make you chuckle, it will make you cry, it will give you goosebumps and it will blow you away. Rarely do films like this come along and I can understand now why Pitt would not be involved had they shortened the length of the title; this is a near perfect movie and nothing should be changed about it. The title itself is as epic as the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The films of Jesse James</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There have been numerous films about Jesse James, most notably Sam Fuller's "I Shot Jesse James", Nick Ray's "The True Story of Jesse James", Kaufman's "The Great Northfield Minnesota Raid", Hill's "The Long Riders" and Dominik's "The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford".Being the most recent, Dominik's film gets all the attention, but Kaufman's and Hill's deserve just as much notice. Though released in the 1970s, Kaufman's film must be watched through the lens of his astronaut epic, "The Right Stuff", both films offering an absurdist take on progress and frontier pushing. Here, Jesse is a confused charlatan and the gang's criminality is seen as being outdated in the face of banking cartels, protection rackets and business scams. In this new world, the business man is the new criminal, violence now taking the form of organised sports, rail barons and profit margins. "How much you think that'll fetch?" one man remarks, as he tries to figure out whether he can make more profits selling earrings in pairs or singles. Stuffed dolls are similarly traded for money, whilst steam engines and horseless buggies are treated as, not a form of technological progress, but a form of capitalist spectacle which pushes Jesse and his gang further and further into extinction. Indeed, it is a steam piano constructed to attract people to a bank, which ultimately gets Jesse's gang killed.The gang itself is split into two groups. Those who follow Cole Younger and those who follow Jesse James. Jesse embodies a kind of no-nonsense criminal psychopathy, stealing and killing and forever unable to live up to his romantic myth (he pretends to receive messages from God, but nobody believes him). Cole, in contrast, tries to play the game by the banks' rules, using guile, cunning and elaborate schemes. Significantly, Cole's plan backfires and he dies, whilst the lawless Jesse, a product of a different age, rides comically off into the sunset. Like Altman's "Thieves Like Us", the film subversively portrays its gangs, not as noble Robin Hoods stealing from corporate fat cats, but part of the same all inclusive racket.Walter Hill's "The Long Riders" is a different sort of beast altogether. This is a fast paced action movie, the "legendary moments" in the life of Jesse James downplayed in favour for ambiance and texture. Town dances, chirping crickets, women being pushed on swings, touching romantic relationships with whores...this is film which serves up a certain air of melancholy, before launching into a series of staggeringly violent action set pieces. Hill's gangsters are not wild-eyed maniacs but disenfranchised criminals looking to score easy cash so that they can retire to some country paradise. In other words, it's a Michael Mann macho poem with the violence of Walter Hill's mentor, Sam Peckinpah, grafted on.Hill's film also revolves around a cat and mouse feud between Jesse and the Pinkerton Detective Agency, a group of lawmen working for the banks and railroads. In an effort to humanise the gang, the film paints these lawmen as murderous brutes who kill innocents and set homes ablaze. These, of course, are narrative tactics used to convince us that Jesse and his boys are innocent of any wrong doings and that they were merely provoked by violent authorities. Andrew Dominik's "The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford", in contrast, is implicitly about celebrity. Here, Jesse's gang are mythologized through legend and media exposure, and it is this which curses them. Jesse himself is killed, not by Robert Ford, but by celebrity itself. The film is thus about, not only looking, but being looked down upon, looked up at, and having perceptions projected upon you. Jesse's death, in which looking at a picture literally kills him, encapsulates all these themes. It is Jesse's own gaze, his aloof attitude toward Ford, which causes Ford's worshipful stare to be corrupted, but more importantly, co-oped by Pinkerton. Here, celebrity and mythology bulldoze truths, and court death by assuming a kind of superiority. Of course death, rather than debunking myths, tends to reinforce them further.But while all three films go off on their own interesting tangents, they make a mistake which has been around since Henry Fonda's 1939 film, "Jesse James". These films ignore history and turn Jesse in a superstar, a Robin Hood, a pretty boy rogue, when this image was wholly invented by John Edwards, a racist and pro Confederate journalist who wanted to create a heroic figure to help rally people against the Union.At the time, the state of Missouri belonged to the Confederates, whereas the state of Kansas was held by the Union. The two states fought each other fiercely, killing civilians, burning houses and committing various other war crimes. Jesse James, following in his brother's footsteps, joined the Confederates, fought with them for several years and then left the army to form a robbery gang with several soldiers. They hit trains and banks and kept the loot, but because banks and railroads were symbols of the Union States (who were forcing farmers, civilians etc to buy Federal dollars), it became easy for Confederate supporters to turn Jesse into a kind of rebel figure.Jesse then began to milk this image, selling himself as an altruistic warrior who fought evil Yankee rail barons for Southern honour. In reality, far from being the last hurrah of the Confederate cause, Jesse was a cold hearted guy who fought for the preservation of slavery, robbed trains dressed as the KKK and kept all the loot for him and his gang. Of course none of the Jesse James films deal with this, even Dominik's, which is specifically about the allure and falsity of celebrity.8/10 - Pitt is amazing, but this is Malick lite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An elegaic, poetic and sorely underrated masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is a film for the ages. It's a film that breaks Hollywood convention, breaks film convention and simply astounds me. I find it one of, if not the, best film of the last five years and yet was criminally overlooked by the Oscars and by the public.The films cinematography echoes Terrence Mallick, Roger Deakins masterfully encapsulates the times it's set. It oozes beauty yet has an underlying sense of mystery, myth and legend. Jesse James has perhaps one of the greatest train robberies ever committed to celluloid, with Brad Pitt brooding around the steam, moving in and out of the shadows, Colt in hand. The director, Andrew Dominik, clearly understands he is dealing with a character who has passed into American folk law and the sepia tint throughout reflects this, shots of rooms with blurred edges give the effect of Civil War photographs, as if we're looking at a film made in 1882. The script is heavily influenced by the synonymous book upon which this film is based; with poetic narration littered throughout the two hours thirty three minutes running time. The third-person narration, becoming so rare in contemporary films, gives the effect of the audience observing the real goings on of Jesse James and Robert Ford. Delivered in melancholy tones by Hugh Ross it works beautifully, matching with the cinematography to create a seamless illusion for the audience.The audience are also blessed with perhaps the best cast of modern times; Brad Pitt's brooding, enigmatic Jesse James is one for the ages and won him the prestigious Best Actor award in Venice. No such luck from the reluctant Acadamy who are keen to ignore all of Pitt's best turns (see Se7en) despite his increasing prowess. Portraying such a myth-like character was a risk for a man so associated with blockbusters and action-packed thrill-rides, Pitt can no longer hide behind his good looks and instead of shying away from this challenge he rises to it and surpassed all expectations. If Pitt is indeed the new Paul Newman then this surely is his Butch Cassidy, a film to finally get him recognised as not only a good actor, but a great one. Despite this the film is undoubtedly Casey Affleck's; his Robert Ford is sly, cowardly and arrogant. He admires and worships Jesse at the beginning, his trepidation at the first meeting is palpable and the tension at a certain dinner scene is eerie. The chemistry, or should it be un-chemistry?, between the two leads helps propel this film from great to masterpiece, you can sense the awkwardness between the two and understand Jesse's suspicions. Yet towards the end, thanks to Affleck, we pity the character and the shell of a man he as become. The supporting cast also does a stand-up job with Sam Rockwell playing the once-jovial Charley Ford with the brilliance we now expect from him.This is not a film about Jesse James as much as it is a study of fame, infamy and the fickleness of the common public. The title makes you believe that James is the hero and Ford the villain but by the end a much different picture was painted. In traditional books and films there's a victim, a villain and a hero. The beauty of this film is you could argue each character as any of these three it depends upon your own interpretation of the films events, the final answer isn't given to us on a platter, we are left to make up our own minds. This bravery on such a risky film makes it evident of Dominik's courage and fearlessness. The film deserves a better reputation than it has, it deserved a better box-office run than it got and more so than that it deserves your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Man, is this an ambitious movie. It's long and punctuated only at lengthy intervals by any kind of gunplay. There is a narration in the style of a turn-of-the-century pulp Western novel. "His moodiness modeled him. It dungeoned him." Such a style beggars all description in a familiar Western story about the shooting of Jesse James, a crumb bum of the first order.Except that this is only barely a Western. They ride horses, naturally, and carry pistols, but it takes place in locations ranging from Kansas through Missouri to Kentucky. Nobody is a cowboy. You don't hear nothing' about nobody a-squattin' on the range or holdin' up stagecoaches. No, nor anything about Indians neither. Which, if you're prompted to think about it, is a little loopy since the Battle of Little Bighorn was only twelve years old when James was shot in the back while adjusting a picture on the wall of his home in 1888. For that matter, Lizzie Borden at the time was building up steam enough in Massachussetts to chop up her father, and Sherlock Holmes was in pursuit of Professor Moriarty in London. Exciting times.It won't be necessary, I hope, to detail the story. For one thing, pretty much everyone already has some grasp of the mythos. For another, the plot, as presented here, is pretty complicated. The film may be only barely a Western but it's certainly a period drama full of intrigue, shifting allegiances, and obscure motives, with a barely concealed but constant undercurrent of betrayal leading to violence.We only see one railroad robbery and that's at the very start, the only scene in which Sam Shepard makes an appearance as Frank James. The hold up takes place at night. It's very impressively done. The artful photography of Roger Deakins captures the approaching train, seemingly an unstoppable mass of iron, in an almost spooky fashion. The score is by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis and it's distinctively current -- no folksy violins or other clichs.Following this lone hold up, though, we must then follow the plot. I couldn't do it. I was lost among the dozen or so gang members and their kinship bonds. I don't know why Brad Pitt, as Jesse James, shot a man in the back after asking him to take a ride in the darkness. I could unravel the reasoning behind the killing of Wood Hite, or at least part of it. Another man was boffing Hite's old uncle's young wife and Hite initiated a gun fight to punish the guilty. Why Bob Ford, Casey Affleck, decided to shoot Hite eluded my understanding, since Bob Ford had no dog in that hunt, as they say.Brad Pitt is pretty good in the role of James. In some of his movies I thought he might be another heart throb who began to fade the moment he appeared in the public consciousness. When he showed up, all bulked up, in things like "Troy," I was almost sure of it. But he has greater range than that and evidently more endurance. Casey Affleck is Bob Ford and he's equally fine. His face is a little askew. His eyes look in slightly different direction, his high voice is cracked, and the actor adopts a slyly innocent, open-mouthed, slack-smiled demeanor that is as appropriate as it is misleading.The script is overblown but not dumb. Compared to the early Twentieth-Century Fox version, it's a masterpiece of maturity. In 1939, Tyrone Power and his friends were unambiguously good, except for the cowards Bob and Charlie Ford, who were unambiguously treacherous. Not to put down the enjoyable 1939 tale. I'm sure there are liberties taken with the historical facts in this version too, but it doesn't leave the viewer feeling that he's just watched a fairy tale with a sad ending -- "The Little Match Murderer" or "Hansel, Gretl, and Jesse".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good things, it has...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't be kind with this film; it's been a very disappointing experience. As the world may know (or can find out with this and other movies), Robert Ford killed Jesse James, the famous outlaw from the West. Well, Andrew Dominik's "The Assassination of Jesse James by the coward Robert Ford" (already a bit pretentious, even if it comes from Ron Hansen novel's original title) is a long journey to the 'how', 'when' and 'why' of the fact, giving that we know the who. I'm sorry if I'm being a little repetitive; sometimes movie characteristics stick with me for a while after watching them. The music of "The Assassination?" is repetitive, as its structure and its beautifully shot sequences, sceneries, lights and use of colors, empty rooms, fast- moving clouds: the movie is just marvelously shot. Dominik's adapted script starts the film off with the kindness of telling us who the main character (played by Brad Pitt) is, as we witness a blurry screen. That's the set-up for the structure, with a pleasant narration that not only becomes unpleasant with duration time, but at times also unnecessary. What are images for if someone's telling you everything you're watching? What good does a complete description provide for an actor if the viewer will be carefully watching if the character behaves exactly as what he or she heard? Brad Pitt suffers from this in this film that Dominik wants to be a focused study on two people, but gets distracted with the 'bigger picture' and worn down by the narration and an excessive exercise of style. Roger Deakins' photography is undoubtedly the movie's highest point, but it looks like the director never knew when to say "stop", and Deakins, an expert on camera tricks (here greatly helped by Curtiss Clayton and Dylan Tichenor's classic and well chosen cuts to black; which work every time and are not excessive, so they create a balance), kept going. I don't want you to misinterpret me about Pitt, though. His work here is very good; patient and contemplative, however unexpectedly confident and threatening in the stronger scenes. Even when his Jesse is the one who speaks the less, his speaking becomes meaningful. This is not Russell Crowe's elaborated study of silence in "3:10 to Yuma". Actually, "The Assassination?" is nothing like "3:10 to Yuma": in Mangold's film there's a redemption that's understood by the viewer after witnessing a series of events; here the movie tries to redeem a character leaving no space for the viewer's personal judgment. In a similar way, we sense the feelings and personalities of "3:10 to Yuma's" characters in one specific scene; while Dominik's movie almost obligates us to comprehend its two main creatures before, during and after the main events, when the truth is that we may not have figured it out. Luckily, Casey Affleck's best performance to date helps us a lot, because the actor worries about creating someone we can empathize with. He presents a contradiction in his Robert Ford, who used to worship and love someone he ends up killing. The best scenes in the film are the little ones; the ones where you don't think anything relevant can happen. When Robert is watching Jesse's wife Zee (Mary-Louise Parker, one of the many underused actors in the film) through the window, he turns around and realizes Jesse's been watching him for some time. "You'll break many hearts", he tells Robert. Try to unveil the whole meaning of that phrase. Of course there's plenty of good things in "The Assassination". Like Sam Rockwell's interpretation who, away from Pitt's stillness and Affleck's constant ticks, constructs a normal human being who worries about his family and friends, and does it with the naturalness that's characterized him even in his most eccentric roles. He's better than the other two and, seriously, he should be working more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brad Pitt as Jesse James.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Friendship turns into betrayal in this lumbering tale that puts focus on the assassination of Jesse James. In the late 1800s Jesse James(Brad Pitt)was one of the most well known men in America. Reputation, folklore and dime store novels are credited with making the Missouri outlaw a Robin Hood type hero to some, including a young Robert Ford(Casey Affleck), who thought he knew more about James than James himself. Begging to join the last James gang, Ford went from being a pain in the ass to a very guarded friend. That friendship would grow into something dark as Ford still had the grand idea of being famous himself. He will look at his hero as a stepping stone to greatness. Well photographed, well acted, but still you get the feeling that the hype made you expect more. It is doubtful this will become a classic. Both Pitt and Affleck are outstanding. You would image more action. What there is is ruthless. Also starring are: Sam Shepard, Garret Dillahunt, Paul Schnideider, Mary-Louise Parker and Sam Rockwell.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Total Waste of Time! Possibly The Worst Film I Have EVER Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read a lot of the reviews of this film, some praised it and some hated it and I'am wondering if we all watched the same film. Its a total waste of 2 hours &amp; 40 Minutes!I'am a big fan of westerns, and I was expecting this to be one of the best, having a great actor like Brad Pitt play such a strong character like Jesse James and it just didn't work at all. The acting, setting, story telling and everything right down to the costumes were rubbish, I mean bowler hats! Really? With a western I expect drama, action and lots of thrills, strong characters that you can love and hate and maybe a little humour and you get nothing from this apart from just boredom and the feeling of wasted time (and in some cases, money). I'am a massive film fan and this is possibly the worst film I have EVER seen! If it was an option, I wouldn't even give it 1 star.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Glowing Jewel in a Sea of Cinematic Darkness...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Assassination of Jesse James was very well produced and executed but the overlaying narration by Hugh Ross of the masterfully written prose of Ron Hansen makes watching the movie a truly unique experience.The movie adapted to screen and directed by Andrew Dominik stands out in several aspects. From the wonderfully interwoven soundtrack to the magnificently picturesque cinematography to the superbly method performances by Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck (who turned out to be a pleasant surprise for me). It is a slow moving film but you barely notice the time passing by when you become entranced in the story, that is, a story of the more genuine and believable type of the American "West" and the infamous American outlaw gangs. This movie does little to romanticize the genre (not typical of Westerns - although I wouldn't even call it a "Western") but, rather, presents a much more human side to the gun-slinging, horse-riding, train-robbing part of our country's history.In today's big-business "fast-food era" Hollywood, when all that can satisfy the appetite of the masses is 20 scenes per second special effects one after the other, you can't help but notice an eroding taste for culture and cinematic delicacy. That is why it is so refreshing that a movie like this comes along every once in a while, through which we realize that all is not lost.As of recently, I would put this movie in a category with three other movies that share this special quality of genuineness. Three glowing jewels in a sea of cinematic darkness: The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford; The Namesake; and Into the Wild.Bon Appetit!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful, tedious and self-regarding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All right, all right, enough of the glowing reviews! three pages in, and almost every single review I've read is burning with praise for what many seem to consider a 'perfect' film. So of course I'm going to come off like a total philistine, but I don't care. I sat down to seriously absorb this film. After a very short while I was staring at the ceiling with my mouth open to catch flies, making tea, making more tea, fidgeting, picking my nails clean - anything was more tempting than sitting still and watching as the decade's most overlong and tedious 'art' film unfolded itself on the screen.I love the American Story - particularly westerns, of most types, and of which I think this film is one: something of Budd Boetticher's with a barrel-chested Randolph Scott; black and white shoot-em-ups on high speed film accompanied by stirring strings or some warbling tenor; Joan Crawford glorious in Nicholas Ray's "Johnny Guitar"; revisionist life-with-the-Indians westerns; westerns made by Europeans (such as the VERY interesting "Eagle's Wing"); "Brokeback Mountain"; soul-searching 70s offerings such as "McCabe &amp; Mrs Miller", "Jeremiah Johnson" and "The Outlaw Josey Wales"; and, the crowning glory, Sergio Leone's "Once Upon a Time in the West". So I have, I think, an open mind, happy to give an unusual film a go. But so little happens in this film! - not just the lack of physical action - there's no inner life in these characters! They just look out of windows a lot! That's not an inner life! I couldn't wait for the end, and was relieved, and entirely unmoved, when it finally came. Despite being self-important and sententious, I didn't read into the film some crucial message about America's present sense of self. I think these kinds of films, taken from books (see also "There Will be Blood"), are the triumph of a director's hubris over experience. The magic of a book may be said to lie in being able to explore the psychological drama in the minds of the protagonists over hundreds of pages. In the immediacy of visual media, cenic shots and men looking thoughtful/vain/foolish just isn't a good enough transcription. I don't doubt that Casey Affleck, and perhaps even Brad Pitt, are doing a very good job; but I would never recommend this film, as art, history, psychodrama, western or entertainment. Does that make me shamefully lowbrow? Oh well. For the ultimate slow-burner art film I'd watch Tartovsky's extraordinary "Nostalgia" or "Andrei Rublov", either of which knock the socks off this. Right now I'm off to watch some terrible TV movie or maybe scoff at some art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Legend of Bob Ford</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007) A newspaper man in an old John Ford film once proclaimed that when legend becomes fact, you oughta print the legend. Well, they've been printing the legend of Jesse James now for over a hundred years. He's been a Robin Hood at times, a cold blooded killer others. It's the old wild west conundrum: for every tale of outlaw heroism is a tale for outlaw ruthlessness.And now here's a tale that is as decidedly conflicted as the legends themselves. In Andrew Dominic's The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, Jesse James is no hero, even shown to kill a man in the same manner that supposedly made Ford a coward. But at the same time, James is also shown to be a doting and loving husband and father. His paranoia has made him ruthless. Though he does now have his reasons to be to be paranoid, its that very paranoia which has alienated those around him.The picture seeks to dissect the legend, not necessarily to get to the facts, but the essence of reality. In a way, it's striving for what Werner Herzog calls ecstatic truth. Though that's not necessarily aimed at James himself, but his assassin, Bob Ford. Yes, that is the legend that is most steeped in hyperbole.Was Ford a coward? The title would lead you to be believe such, but that's the irony. If there has ever been a more matter of fact title, I've not heard it. Some of said the title says it all in this case, but nothing could be further from the truth.Casey Affleck steals the show in his portrayal of Robert Ford, the young man who idolized, then feared, and finally assassinated Jesse James. He gives a mannered but electrifying performance. Brad Pitt portrays Jesse James as a contemplative but quietly menacing man, troubled by his increasing ruthlessness. Sam Rockwell plays close James friend, and brother to Bob, Charlie Ford. Elsewhere, in one of my favourite performances of the film, Paul Schneider plays the outlaw and notorious womanizer Dick Liddel. It's a film full of excellent performances, though none match that of Affleck's.The plot is lingering and lyrical. When the film debuted it played in a four hour version (there have been rumblings about a future release of this version, but other than a few select screenings there have been no solid leads). The picture goes off in different directions, with the ultimate aim of eventually coming back together, but without force or haste.The film opens with a train robbery, the last of older brother Frank James (Sam Shepard) who is weary of Bob. But Jesse takes him along, not so much because he trusts him, but perhaps because he enjoys the flattery of Bob's idolization. Eventually Jesse begins knocking off those who he suspects of going against him. Dick Liddel has been teamed up with another team member working on their own scores. Although he is close with the Fords, he reminds Bob at bullet proof not to betray him.Wood Hite (Jeremy Renner), Jesse's cousin, shows up at the Ford home one snowy winter day. Hite has it out for Liddel, who's living there, after he slept with his father's young new wife. Hite storms the bedroom and he and Dick shoot it out. Just as Hite has Liddel in his sights, Bob pulls the trigger. They must hide that Wood has been killed, knowing that Jesse would kill them for sure now. Slowly, fearfully, and regretfully, the Ford's are enlisted to conspire Jesse's arrest. Only after they it absolutely dire does Bob commit his infamous deed. Though we know it's coming before we even enter the theatre, the assassination scene's grace and poignancy are unexpected. And the way Jesse meets his end prods existential queries. Throughout the film action is frequently narrated in a calm manner by Hugh Ross, often simply telling us in words what is happening in screen. Where in many films that may seem trite, here it feels uniquely transcendental.Director Dominic is not satisfied to simply dissect the legend. The film is, quite frankly, one of the most stunningly beautiful films in recent years. Dominic and Roger Deakens capture the action with an unabashedly artistic eye. Chilling sky blues blend with the golden wheat of Alberta, evoking the aesthetic qualities of Days of Heaven. That film was admittedly a huge influence on the visual style of the picture. Dominic not only shot the film in the same fields, but hired the same costume designer (Patricia Norris). To top off the stunning look and mood of the film is Nick Cave and Warren Ellis' beautiful score. Cave is proving himself not only an immensely talented singer-songwriter, but a wonderful composer as well.If there is one word to describe The Assassination of Jesse James, it is undoubtedly beautiful. Which is not to say that it's all look: the substance is also quite remarkable. The film held me in its grip for every minute of its length. Though I have not read the source material, the storyline and approach to the legends of Jesse James and Bob Ford I suspect owes much to the book. Much of the narration sounds like it may have been taken verbatim from the book.This is a highly ambitious film, and one that I will unreservedly stand behind. There are usually only a few films that hint at a lasting reputation for greatness. I think this is one of them, and that will be recognized in time. And I'll stand by that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dark, bleak, gritty biography that some how captivates and pulls you in</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't sure what to make of The Assassination of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford when I was first watching it. Was it nothing more than a Brad Pitt vehicle looking to score some artistic points? It had this ominous narration that felt like an elongated episode of A&amp;E's Biography. And as it continued all the pieces began to fall into place and I was pulled into this dark, paranoid, gritty, dust ridden world of Jesse James and his descent into his own destruction. I'm not one to call out the artistic greats of a film unless it entertains as well and I'm not sure that this film would appeal to everyone certainly but I'm an enormous history fan, and love Westerns and this one just felt real from beginning to end and the actors in the film really knocked this one out of the park with some really powerful performances. They are very subtle and it really starts to sink in on you about half way through. You feel like you're being drawn into everything that they are and you wait and wait for the moment you know is coming right from the minute you see the title of the film. And when it happens...it doesn't disappoint. The Assassination is shocking and violent and so sudden that you will reel back and...if you're a little morose like me...watch it again...in slow motion...because it's brilliantly done. Everything in the film is so subtle right up to the Assassination and then you're just rocked.Brad Pitt is Jesse James and gives one of the more subtle performances. I like Pitt, he's an amazing Hollywood star but he also has some incredible talent proved in such amazing roles as 12 Monkeys, Meet Joe Black, and the amazing Se7en. This role is so quiet at first and you can't believe that this family man is the cold blooded killer but that is the whole idea. No one had any idea and throughout the film he has a descent into almost complete madness. This film takes the liberty that he set up his own death ultimately not being able to live with himself and his paranoia. Pitt is excellent. I really wasn't sure about the Oscar nominated performance of Casey Affleck who plays the coward himself Robert Ford but once again he really grew on me. Ford has all these very distinct personality traits and almost tics as he lives and idolizes Jesse but essentially trades his passion for glory as they say. He'll do anything for number one which is him. You go through so many emotions with his character...you despise him, pity him, relish him, hate him, and feel his own self loathing. It really is quite the performance and Pitt and Affleck play off each other brilliantly. Paul Schneider is a deliciously slimy character Dick Liddil. He's just a real scum bag and you love to hate him all the way through. Sam Rockwell is good as the nervous brother to Affleck's Ford. His character has a lot of emotional moments in the film and he does well. Jeremy Renner is also good as rough around the edges cowboy and Jesse's cousin. And Mary-Louise Parker has a small role as Jesse's wife but it's a good role although she's barely recognizable in it. One of the truly terrific roles in the film is that of the Narrator Hugh Ross who has an amazing voice and it really did make an impact having him narrate certain aspects of Jesse James' life. It felt like a biography and yet you were living it with them.If anything this is the furthest from a typical Hollywood Western and yet still holds some of the elements from that genre. There isn't any distinct bad guys or good guys, white hats or black hats, dusty towns with an angry sheriff. This feels like the real thing with brilliantly bleak landscape and gray clouds all around and tiny hand built cabins where they live. Train robberies, and gun shoot outs and horse riding are plenty but it all feels like it could have happened and was happening right in front of you. There were actually several scenes that were so brilliantly filmed (the film was also nominated for an Oscar in cinematography) that will literally make you want to pause the film and just look at it. Simplicity and yet completely moving. I would call The Assassination of Jesse James a historical epic at it's finest but in the most subtle of ways. I keep using that word because it is exactly what the film is all about subtly that will jump up and turn into a very powerful film when you least expect it. Rather than ending the film with James' assassination we get to see the following events surrounding his death including a very excellent re-creation of the infamous photos of his body. We also get to follow Robert Ford in his life following his infamous Assassination on James right up to his own death which I think was very clever of the film makers. If you love history, or really do appreciate a beautifully shot, well acted, powerful film you won't be disappointed with this one. Two and a half hours feels like an hour. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Total Film gave it five stars, calling it "a masterpiece". Empire: the same, whilst commenting on how "extraordinary and visionary" it is. And The Daily Telegraph say is it "magnificent, one of the year's best". The bar has been set high for humble reviewer such as myself to write something different and worthy of reading.Where to start is a hard task. The cinematography is on such a level of extraordinary exquisiteness and diversity that it deserves its own review by itself. Beautifully shot, the film travels along old dusty roads, smoke filled towns, solitary rail roads with engulfing steam and the endlessly stretching hillsides of the old West which alternate in their splendour from snow covered to fruitful. The violence, although tame and sparse throughout the two and half hour run time, is unforgiving in its depiction and the dialogue, of both the actors and the omnipresent voice-over, is beautiful, poetic and lyrical ("insomnia stained his eyes like soot") and weaves a story so detached from Hollywood, you'd have trouble believing this was indeed of the American cinematic machinery.As for the acting. Well, wow. Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck take the eponymous title roles respectively. The young, stammering Ford, who is all nerves around his idol, holds a sinister look in his eyes and when he says he knows he is fated to do great things the tone of the film is reset time and again, growing darker and more edgy as the titular event draws nearer. Pitt, in possibly his finest role since "Fight Club" or "Twelve Monkeys", is absolutely fantastic but no amount of praise could truly capture how well he embodies a man fallen from the top of his game, knowing where his enemies are, to the untrusting, suspecting paranoid wreck he eventually becomes.Despite the title of the film, the build up to James' death is still tense through out. And when it does happen, a wave of hatred and depression hits the viewer at how coldly and cowardly it is done. Pitt's performance not only draws out our sympathy with a scalpel with the depiction of a man broken but Ford's cowardice helps to do nothing but exaggerate it. The man who dies is not just Brad Pitt: The Actor, but moreover Brad Pitt: Jesse James mark II.Everything about this film is perfect. Those that do hack it out can rejoice, however, in having just witnessed one of the greatest films of the year and one which will no doubt live on for years and become an undisputed classic.Read the full review and more at www.wrawreviews.co.uk</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie would seem to have everything going for it; a top cast that delivers uniformly fine acting, excellent writing and direction, all combined with stunning cinematography. So, why doesn't it work? That is the question I've been asking myself ever since the first viewing. ( A second look proved no more enlightening. ) It can't be the slow pace, as I have seen many films paced at least as leisurely as this one - ( "Eyes Wide Shut" springs to mind ) - that I have found spellbinding. The music doesn't help. Slow and lugubrious, it helps to create an oppressive atmosphere that never lets up. No, I believe the answer lies somewhere in the combination of these two elements; what I call the Ken Burns factor.Simply put, "The Assassination of Jesse James" - fine as it is on many levels - is an ultimately depressing experience. Add to the mix the fact that Casey Affleck mumbles much of the time and key lines of dialogue are often unintelligible, and you are left with a major disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully filmed and haunting film that is classy, deliberate and engaging</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Ford is an unremarkable and unmemorable young man who has long held a fascination with the outlaw Jesse James. When his attempts to join the James gang are rejected, Ford persists and is taken in by Jesse ? perhaps because the latter welcomes the non-threatening adoration of the former. However as time goes on two things occur within both men ? Ford becomes disillusioned and less in awe of Jesse, while Jesse becomes suspicious of his gang members and fearful of betrayal.It is best to get the common complaint out of the way and acknowledge that, in some vocabularies, this film is "slow" but this is not the same as me agreeing with those that label it such. Rather I prefer to see it as "deliberate" or "gradual" because these describe the quality of pace in the same way but doesn't suggest that it is a detrimental or negative thing. So the film does move with a patient pace that is in no rush to go anywhere quickly. But yet it manages to engage and hold the attention with surprising ease. The reason is the quality in the tale ? the narrative, the characters and the themes all come together to produce a film of quiet interest.I am not doing it justice in my description but the main story, taken at face value is an engaging story of the later life and fate of Jesse James, in particular his interactions with Robert Ford. It is a fascinating portrayal mainly because of the strength of the characters more than the specifics of the plot. James is as charming as he is violent and it this uneasy balance that makes him engaging. Meanwhile Ford goes from being starry-eyed to being bitter; both men are interesting individually and together. As many have said, the modern subject of fame is run through the film. The wonderful title alludes to it as it presents the story in the headline of spin (history may side with the celebrity against the "coward" but we can see that the title is not necessarily true). Mostly it is in the background but in retrospect it is more important than I first thought ? it just took the final twenty minutes to bring it all into focus for me in regards significance.Bringing the best from the characters are a couple of great performances, supported by good performances. The celebrity undercurrent very much suits the casting of Pitt but it is not just this that he brings to the role. Rather his performance is really impressive, mixing his usual charisma and charm with a convincing undercurrent of menace. Affleck was more of a surprise to me because he does come out with a nicely understated and powerful character that rightly never gets close to holding a scene in the way Pitt's James has to, but does all his work in smaller ways. The support has good work from Parker, Rockwell, Shepard and others. Dominik directs the camera and the cast with a steady and understanding hand but for me the real star is Roger Deakin, who's main misfortune appears to have been having two great products in the same Oscars season ? essentially splitting his votes.The cinematography is breath-taking. The most obvious touches of style get the mentions of course, but across the whole film it looks great, with attention paid to the stark colours, strong use of lighting and focal points within the shots. Like everyone else though it is the wonderfully creative visual moments that make the film and stick with the viewer. The striking use of light and darkness in the early train robbery is one but the general design of the narrator-led sequences with clever use of focus, framing and colour. It is a breath-taking work and although I cannot comment on its worthiness versus "There Will Be Blood" (I have not yet seen it), it is a triumph. It is rare that I would watch a film again just for the beauty of it, but this is one of those films that could have frames and sequences hung in a gallery.Like its title this film is longer than the norm, but it is also better than the norm as well. The pace is slow, but not in a way that is dull but rather a way that is patience and rewarding. The story and characters hold the attention easily and the thematic comment on fame only serves to add. Topping off the performances and direction is a wonderful piece of work from the cinematographer that greatly adds to the sense of importance of the film by making each scene a visual beauty that is a joy to watch. I get that it will not be to everyone's tastes but it deserves to be seen anyway ? but moaning that it doesn't have the pace of Young Guns says more about you than the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Serious, poetic and beautifully shot western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simply put, I thought that "The Assassination Of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford" was a cracking piece of work. Serious, poetic and a beautifully shot western, built on excellent central performances by Brad Pitt as Jesse James and Casey Affleck as Robert Ford respectively.Brad Pitt's Jesse James is hardly an American folk hero. He is a nasty piece of work. Unstable, unpredictable, tormented and ruthless. A dominant personality. People are afraid of Jesse James and rightly so. It is one of the best performances of Pitt's career. Forget Pitt as A-lister and tabloid fodder and think about Pitt as the great character actor that he undoubtedly is.As good as Pitt is, the true revelation here is the performance of Casey Affleck. I have only ever been aware of Affleck as Ben's brother and as the comic relief in "Ocean's Eleven", "Ocean's Twelve" and "Ocean's Thirteen". There is nothing in those films that could prepare you for his work in "The Assassination Of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford". Just outstanding. If he does not get a Supporting Actor nod at the Oscars next month, I will be very much surprised.Casey Affleck's Robert Ford is a slightly creepy, slightly dislikeable man who is trying way too hard. He is very much a small man trying to be a big man and in the process manages to get in way over his head. His initial hero worship of Jesse James turns into something disappointing, destructive and tragic."The Assassination Of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford" is a great film. Quite a long film, but engrossing throughout. The hours just shot by. It is early days yet, but I think it is my film of the year so far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great title, great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just had to see this movie, because I love that title ? labeling one of the two lead characters as a "Coward" before one even sees the film. (Although they don't show the title until the end, which is a trend now that REALLY annoys me. Everyone thinks they're remaking "Apocalypse Now", evidently.) Yes, it's long and slowly paced, but I was never bored; the languid pace helped to draw me into the details of the acting, the dialogue, the production design. It was nice to see a period film that paid attention to the natural rhythms of the time, and not filled with fast cuts and in-your-face editing to keep fanboys and teenyboppers with short attention spans interested. Reminded me of another long, slow, gorgeous masterpiece: Stanley Kubrick's "Barry Lyndon." Brad Pitt is creepily intense as Jesse James, the best performance I've ever seen from him, but he is outshone by Casey Affleck, who is mesmerizing with every twitch of his eyes and every quiver in his voice. He deserves a Best Actor nomination more than Pitt. Sam Rockwell is also outstanding, as is the cinematography by the always awesome Roger Deakins, and the haunting score by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis. (Loved Cave's cameo as the saloon singer, too.) And though some may carp about the voice-over narration, I thought it was excellent, just the right amount throughout. My only other minor carp is with the Canadian locations, some of which were way too far from real Missouri landscapes. (In the scene with Pitt and Rockwell at the frozen lake, snow-capped Rockies behind them, I heard someone near me say, "Which part of Missouri is that?" The narration mentions Colorado in passing at the end of the scene, but it sounded like a quick justification for the backdrop.) Also, I loved the ending, Robert Ford's character needed to be played to its conclusion, and NOT end at the killing of Jesse James, as others have suggested.Overall, well worth my time and money, and I can't wait to own the DVD. And for those who wanted to see more of Jesse James's robbin' and killin' life prior to the events of this film, check out Walter Hill's "The Long Riders".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most critically underrated movie of the year....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is as close to perfection as it gets. I'm completely baffled by those who do not get it. But then again, they are probably baffled by why I don't understand how movies like "National Treasure" sell more than twelve tickets.I read a review about how only "cinemaphiles" will get this movie. Uhhh, well, uhhhh, yes I agree.First of all, the cinematography is breathtaking. And the acting is outstanding. And you don't get all this without amazing direction. Brad Pitt delivers his best, by far, performance to date. I wish he would stick to meatier roles like this and stop than Oceans 11 (12, 13, 245) nonsense. And Casey Affleck actually gave me the chills, his performance is so dead-on. As terrific as Brad Pitt is, this is Casey Affleck's movie. His performance is chilling - and haunting. And he nails this character. If he does not get an Oscar nomination, I will take a hostage. In addition, Sam Rockwell gives one of the most likable and entertaining performances I've seen in a while. His timing is impeccable. (That scene on the ice where Jesse keeps firing his gun and Rockwell keeps continuing the conversation made me laugh out loud.) All the supporting characters are amazing. And we have the bonus of Sam Shephard. If you like good acting, this film is like the motherload. Too bad they didn't let Mary Louise Parker speak more than 3 words.One thing I haven't heard too many people comment on is the dark humor in this film. I laughed out loud several times. Luckily, I wasn't the only one. Usually I'm getting the "something is wrong with that woman" look as I'm laughing at the dark, hidden humor in films such as "Sling Blade" and The Assassination of Jesse James. Maybe its a southern thing.The ONLY criticism I have of this movie is the somewhat distracting voice-over narration. This kind of bugged me. Sounded like someone narrating a children's fable. With this kind of acting, we don't need someone telling us what is taking place.I hope Brad Pitt gets an Oscar nomination for Lead Actor (although he is not the actual lead, Casey Affleck is but Brad Pitt is considered the Lead). And I not only hope that Casey Affleck gets an Oscar nomination for supporting actor, I hope he takes the gold fellow home.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excruciatingly dull</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I dunno, maybe the fault is with me; I'm open to that possibility. But I just couldn't sit all the way through this one. I gave it about 2 hours (of its 160 minute running time) but it felt more like four. THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY is one minute longer than this film but it's highly watchable from beginning to end.I realize the movie was perhaps more character-driven than plot-driven, but that's still no excuse for a film to be this lugubriously paced. Check that, there is no pacing in this film. It just sort of rolls along like the clouds that are frequently and lovingly focused on in this movie. As with rolling clouds, it's hard to get a sense of movement in the movie.To be fair, the cinematography and the photography is gorgeous but it doesn't make up for the lack of anything interesting going on. Characters sit around and talk a lot and there are a lot of what I think are supposed to be menacing and enigmatic looks from Jesse James but which only really added to the overall tedium.And here I thought ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST was slow. And it was, but it has absolutely nothing on THE ASSASSINATION OF JESSE JAMES (and at least the former film had Claudia Cardinale to look at). WEST is actually 15 minutes longer than this film but I wouldn't be able to notice the the difference.On a different note, it says on the Trivia page that "When casting for the role of Robert Ford it came down to Casey Affleck and Shia LaBeouf. Affleck eventually got the role, because LaBeouf was felt to be too young." Weird, since Robert Ford was 20 and LeBeouf was 21 at the time of the film's release, while Casey Affleck was 32.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So Many Things You Can Say About This Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Do you notice how long many of the reviews are in here about this movie? That's because there is so much one could say. This is an unusual movie, especially for a modern-day-filmed western.Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck are the "stars" of this movie but the biggest star to me was Roger Deakins, the man who photographed this film. Wow, this is beautiful! It's so stunning to look at in so many spots that there were many times I was more involved in the visuals than the story. In that sense, it reminded me of the marvelously-photographed films of Terrence Malick. Kudos to Andrew Dominik for a similar style directorial performance here.Regarding the story, here's a warning to those who are expecting the normal western fare and want to see the usual amount of gun battles and related action scenes. This film is 2 hour and 40 minutes and there are not many "action" scenes. If you are hoping to see another "3:10 To Yuma" re-make, you will be very disappointed. This story is slow. It's a character study of Jesse James and the man who killed him, Robert Ford. That said, I still found it a memorable film. The photography, the great acting and the uniqueness of the story were all good enough to keep me interested throughout. For once, I was glad to see James portrayed more realistically. Despite what you've seen on film in the past, this man was not a hero, folks. Sure he was a likable guy at times, and a nice father at times, too, but he was a thief and, much worse, a cold-blooded killer. You see that in this film.I have to say I can't remember a film I've seen in recent years in which the two lead characters (James and R. Ford) were so strange and unpredictable. For that, I have to really compliment the work of Pitt and Affleck. They were amazing and kept me guessing throughout the movie. They played very complex people.Another facet that I found unusual were the numerous scenes in which a person's eyes told the story better than any dialog could. The tension in this drama was almost unbearable in many instances. Except for "Once Upon A Time In The West," I can't recall a film with so many tense scenes with long pauses depicting shots of people's eyes relaying their either their fears or suspicions. Pitt, as "Jesse James," does a fantastic job in this department. He made us go inside his James' brain, assuming we were knowing what he's thinking about Robert Ford, and wondering what he would say or do next. James is shown in this film to be a twisted and (justifiably) paranoid criminal who doesn't trust anyone. For example, he's constantly moving his family.On the other side of the coin, you have the Ford brothers and other members of James' gang who are constantly terrified of their boss, knowing he could snap and shoot them any minute. The terrified looks in their eyes were, to me, frightening to watch. This movie is filled with scenes depicting jittery people. Affleck, as "Robert Ford," the man with the nervous smile, and stuttering-like speech, was one of the strangest characters I've seen on film. Sam Rockwell, as Ford's brother, "Charley," has a big role in this movie, too, and doesn't really get the billing he should. I thought he was right up there with Pitt and Affleck.I might be in the minority with this opinion, but I found the best part of the film to be the last 20 minutes, depicting how America reacted to the killing of Jesse James and what happened to the Ford brothers. All that was fascinating to me.Overall, once I realized this wasn't a "shoot-em-up" western, and just sat back and appreciated the storytelling, wonderful visuals, low-key narration, fabulous sets, scenery and acting....I ended up being very impressed. So, a key is to know what to expect before you see this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful, but Slow Paced, Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those expecting a shoot 'em up Jesse James story like American Outlaws you are bound to be disappointed. The film is a long and slow journey through the world of two men, the choices they make, and how their destinies become intertwined even after they both are dead.The narration is a strong point of the film and I have no doubt that the book written by Ron Hansen is superior to the film. The movie does drag in places and even though it has been cut down from its original run time it is still too long.The film's greatest asset is the look which is simply amazing. Terrence Malick fans should enjoy the look and feel to the world and the several different ways director Andrew Dominik and cinematographer Roger Deakins use to present it to the audience.It's never as good as it should be, but it's still a darn good, if slow-moving, film that will satisfy more of the art house crowd than the general populace.

		<fullReview>The last months of Jesse James's life, from meeting Robert Ford, a 19-year-old boy who idolizes Jesse, to the day Ford shoots and kills Jesse. The plot is basically that.I was very anxious to watch this movie, specially being a big Brad Pitt's fan and enjoying the Crime/Drama type of Genre. But what a big disappointment! This movie was so dull, so boring, that I actually slept while watching it! My boyfriend was watching the movie with me, and he couldn't stand much longer as well. We watched 1 hour and a half of this movie, and we were trying our best to focus on this monotonous story, who should be full of action, since it tells the story of Jesse James, a very famous American outlaw. Since the movie continued to be far from interesting, and the title of the movie already implies what is going to happen in the end, we decided to go watch something else to spend better our afternoon.The movie itself has a good production and photography, but this doesn't help in making it good, in fact, I would only recommend it for people who suffers from insomnia, because it will probably help the treatment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst films I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is so bad it made me sign up to this site to warn others to stay clear.After about an hour or so I was checking the DVD display every 10 minutes, hoping it would be near the end. By the time the film ended this had become more entertaining than the film itself. I can recall flicking aimlessly through my mobile phone.I can barely remember anything that happened in it, except for the train scene, the murder scene and the last 20 mins or so of the film. Some of the cinematography is excellent, but I expect more than that from a film.Jesse James seems to posses zero charisma. God knows how he managed to lead a motley crew for so long with about as much life in him as plank of wood. If I was holding a dinner party I'd be sure not invite Jesse, not because he's a psycho, but because he'd probably bore everyone to death.I would say though, that the film picks up after the death of Jesse James. I suddenly found myself gripped and enjoying it. Such a shame the rest of the film didn't have this effect.I'm not even an all action film man. in fact one of my favorite films this year is The Good Shepherd.I've seen a good few hundred films in my life and this easily comes in the bottom 10. Complete boredom. Struggling to think of many more films that have bored me to a similar extent.I'd like to know what the people who gave it 10/10 were on. I'd sure as hell like some.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While everyone seems to have been thrilled to see that movie, i'll help the people who haven't seen it yet and are about to, by telling them not to. The 3 out of 10 grade that i gave is justified by : 1 point for the director of photography (except the lens-baby shots), 1 point for the acting (except brad Pitt who once again plays "brad Pitt"), and one point for ... some scenes that weren't so bad after all. Now don't get me wrong, i'm not the type of person who exclusively likes action movies, one of my favorite films is 2001 space odyssey after all ;)."The assassination of Jesse James etc" is probably the film which title corresponds the most to the content. It is long. There is no surprise. And never during the movie i cared one inch about any of the characters. Jesse James ... he loves his wife and children, he, as the (dispensable) narrator says, is not in good health, he cries after hitting boys, he's human. OK... now that's a potential for good drama. except... except not, all i can see is brad Pitt being brad Pitt, overacting, and i never related to the character. Robert ford... well. You know during the whole movie that he's gonna kill him in the end and all you do is wait for that. I wish that the movie had had the decency to stop when he actually killed him, but it didn't, it went on, and on, and on. yawn. the music. you're not supposed to notice music in a movie. music is there to add character, color to the images. it goes in the subconscious. the music here is... well. the 3 same notes over an over, so recurrent that it annoyed me whenever it came. the rhythm. first scene, the train thing, bore at first, then exciting when it actually happens, very well filmed.. you think "yey, here we go, it's gonna keep on with great dialogs and the narrator will just stop talking"... but nothing of that happens, you keep going up and down on the yawn scale. the scenario. it's the scenario of a short movie. and the "plot" is accessible by a 1 year old kid. actually it's one of the first independent movie made for people who don't want to think. the film is simple, there is nothing to discover (which is really annoying, imho), nothing exciting, sometimes irritating, sometimes kitsch, sometimes "please don't use that lens effect", and sometimes "wow i paid for that thing"the director tried to do Asian-like cinema, a psychological drama, and it just failed. really failed. at least "Brokeback mountain" had a reason to exist. i see none for Jesse James. really, why did they make that movie ? no plot, no story (that can handle 2 hours+). incredible.</fullReview>

It will definitely make you come back for seconds. The scene with the eponymous assassination is worth watching just on its own! I had never heard of the Andrew Dominik before but this certainly draws one's attention, (Director and Screenwrite!) Also i can't help shake the feeling that this movies is a tribute to Robert Ford ('there would be no eulogies for Bob'). I would also like to add that Sam Rockwell does not receive the credit he deserves (he) puts in a stellar performance alongside Casey Affleck. As for Brad Pitt, we see the early signs of his whatchamacallit southern accent of Inglorious Basterds and Django Unchained fame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Review of The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford by the pseudo-Intellectual Me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Andrew Dominik's "...Jesse James..." is one of the best films I have seen in years. I know movie goers expected this to be an action western romp when it first came out, but that's not what the film ever intended to be.The film is about fame, obsession and how we'll be remembered. It excels as a woeful character study of the "assassin", Robert Ford, despite what the title would have you believe. And the title is important. This is the first time I've actively studied the title of a film to extract meaning from the story, as it's significance is important to understanding what Dominik is trying to imply. Casey Affleck is oddly sympathetic, once again despite the fact that I'm 'meant' to be repulsed by or hostile toward him. This is by in large, due to the framing of the story which shifts far more focus on his character than the supposed titular character, Jesse James. The assassination itself is ultimately ancillary to the story of a man forgotten and vilified by not only his contemporaries but it's implied that history also looks at him unfavourably.It is shot beautifully by Roger Deakins. This certainly helps you get through 2 hours before one of the best endings, you'll feast your eyes on, affirming everything you think and know about the characters and their placement in the world. It's certainly worth a watch, hopefully you can draw just as much meaning out of it as I did because there is so much more I want to say about it.I forgot to mention all the acting is great, and there's a great cameo at the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Historical and yet relevant to today.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you can get past the gorgeous and artistic cinematography you may be able to behold the tremendous depth in "The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford." Even though the title's too long, this film stands out as one of the best of 2007 and one of the best of the 21st century. Writer/Director Andrew Dominik brings the historical tale of outlaw Jesse James to life. He examines this legendary killer through the eyes of Robert Ford, a young man who worships this figure and ends up being a part of his group before resenting him. Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck playing these two men is a match made in heaven. Both men, specifically Affleck, deliver spot-on performances who nail every aspect of their multi-layered characters, bringing this excellent story to life. Taking place in rural America during the 1800s, one would expect opportunities for good visual and production elements. Make no mistake, Dominik embraces every opportunity he gets. Few films create production designs and costumes that feel so authentic and don't appear as if made for the screen. The true eye-opener is the cinematography, capturing the American West and Midwest like no other film has done before. What you get with this film is a story and a portrait. History and the present. Idolization and criminalization are still major occurrences in today's society, as it was when outlaws who could steal the most trains roamed the earth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was a good movie, and not as "western" as i'd expected. The main problem with the movie is the narrator. Sometimes it was fine, I get that you couldn't include everything in the movie. But sometimes the narrator was stating the complete obvious. Describing what is happening while we are actually seeing it ourselves. It treats the viewer as a child, because the narrator doesn't think we can see what is going on inside of the persons he is describing. But aside from that, it is a very well-written movie with fantastic actors, and a kick-ass scene with Nick Cave, who also wrote the soundtrack. Check it out if you want see a western that is a bit different from others.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a well-made period piece which uses some creative cinematic techniques, some more successfully than others. It is very successful and crating a world which draws the viewer in and seems believable. Jesse James, then and now, was a superstar criminal with a larger-than-life persona. This film is not really about James, though. Rather, it is about Bob Ford and how he transforms from a James groupie into an assassin. Casey Affleck's performance as Ford is an unsettling balance of naivety and creepiness. One always feels that the wheels are turning in Bob's head, thanks to the impressive non-verbal skills of Affleck. He's the under-rated brother and a much better actor than many people realize.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This western might be slow and boring to some, but for me, this film was alright. At least, it ends with an evocative bang.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adapted from Ron Hansen's 1983 novel of the same name, and based on true events, this western dramatizes the relationship between fame outlaw, Jesse James (Brad Pitt) and his would be assassin, Robert Ford (Casey Affleck), during the events that leaded up to James's murder. While the movie might seem long and predictable to some critics, it was a unique watch for me. Directed by Andrew Dominik, the movie is full of great acting for both of the main cast. Brad Pitt has this eerily with his use of body language that makes his character so edgy, like you don't know, if he's going to strike you down or not. He was very sinister in this film. The same with Casey Affleck, whom seem like he was born to play the part, of the odd-lonely little man, whom scare for his life, but also do whatever, it takes to survive in this harsh world. I love how Bob's obsession is never explosive with fandom; rather, the movie adopts a near quiet, melancholy tone, creepy love for Jesse as his hero. It's even more tragic, when he is paralyzed by his prominent persona and ignominious actions toward other fans of Jesse James, until he finally falls victim to a society that couldn't stand him. I love how history can spin perceptions of people and the public so easily. Another person that seem to stand out in this film, is Sam Rockwell as Ford's slightly less-enamored brother, Charlie. He was probably, the best of the supporting actors. Don't get me wrong, Sam Shepard, Jeremy Renner, and Michael Parks are easily as memorable, but their scenes are far too short, compare to Rockwell. It's also, the same with the female leads. Although Mary-Louise Parker, and Zooey Deschanel are billed near the top, neither one has more than a brief cameo. Despite that, one of the best things in this film is the narrative by Hugh Ross. He really sets the mood of the film, very well with his tones of his voice without going too far into pervasive and perspective driven. Whenever, he describing things about the factual plot, I felt like I had to listen, as if a very good historical lecture. There is no bigger success of his skills than the "No Eulogies" Ending. He's so good at reading, that he makes reading the phone book, seem interesting. I know, some people might not like this narration style, due to some instances of unreliable dry text book heavy-handed read, throughout the film, but I found the read, sophistical. Yet, I do believe that voice overs in movies like this, do needs to be used more sparingly, so to allow the camera to tell the story, not the words. Even with the large amount of narrative, this movie does have amazing cinematography to tell the story throughout the film. Roger Deakins' cinematography is heartbreakingly beautiful, alternately blurred and precise, the colors autumnal, the dark shadows long and evocative as if looking at an old tintype. All of this makes for an environment that reflects the inner lives of both Jesse and Bob, neither able to shake the other, off from each other. I love the sullen, near-resigned look that the final shot lingers on: superbly poignant and terrifically chosen. It really carries. Yet, I know, some of the critics found this movie to be boring or sad, due to the lack of action and its depressing brooding tone. However, it's somewhat good that way, because it's makes the film more, historical accuracy. The film completely destroys the hero myth of Jesse James and replaces it with a lot of sinister characters behaving selfishly, beset by squabbling, petty violence and disintegration is exactly what happened to Jesse James' gang. It's true, that the James Gang has more or less fizzled out by the time the film begins. So, there wouldn't be, a lot of action, if the gang is trying to hide from the public eye. One of the reason, why this movie wasn't released until 2007, despite being shot in 2005, was because of the conflict, Director Andrew Dominik had with Warner Bros. As you see in this film, Dominik wanted an impressionistic, Terrence Malick-esque approach; while executives at Warner Bros. who wanted a more action-packed movie. Eventually Brad Pitt, producer Ridley Scott and editors Dylan Tichenor, Curtis Clayton and Michael Kahn made and tested various recuts. It's currently unknown who's cut was picked for general release. I would love to one day, see the other versions of this film. Because of things like that, we never really got to know, what happen to certain characters, because how many scenes with them, were cut. Hopefully, those other versions, solve those plot-holes. No matter, what film version, you see; the music, throughout this film, by Australian composers, Nick Cave and Warren Ellis is superb. It was very beautiful. The movie's soundtrack has made me cry more than once. Overall: For me, this movie is a must watch. At least, once. This was a haunting, well-crafted masterpiece.

		<shortDescription>Excellent movie, but misleading title?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. Excellent acting and cinematography. My only complaint is: why Robert Ford was labeled a coward? Jesse came off as more of a coward to me. He shot more people in the back of the head and beats on a teenager, so why couldn't the title have been: The Assassination of the Cowardly Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford? Just wondering? Hasn't anyone else thought this. None of Jesse's victims actually saw the shot coming, even though they probably knew it was about to happen. That is why they were afraid when he showed up at their home. But, Jesse felt it was about to happen and portrayed in the movie saw that it was about to happen. Bob Ford did actually own the action that he took. Other than that, I really do enjoy the movie. It would be on my list to watch over and over again. The lack of a normal shoot em up western movie is made up for by the cinematography, acting and the interaction of the characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Assassination of Jesse James by the "Coward" Robert Ford</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford" should hold no surprises. I mean, the end of the movie is spoiled for you in the title... right? Well, if that's what you thought then you would be dead wrong, because this film is thought- provoking, sad, beautiful, and thoroughly tense from beginning to end, even though there is not much shooting in this long film.Robert Ford has grown up reading books and hearing stories about the courageous Robert Ford and has grown incredibly obsessed with him, even though he has never met him. When Rob goes with his brother Charlie to finally meet Jesse, he is understandably excited. However, as we, and Rob, come to find out, Jesse is only a human, like the rest of us. And he is not exactly the courageous outlaw he has heard about. Jesse is temperamental, depressed, and even sadistic, and he feels pain just like the rest of us. He is a man that hates himself even though everyone else idolizes him. Robert himself is not perfect either. He is insecure, young, and unbelievably obsessed with Jesse James, to the point where he wants to be him. In fact, the connections Robert tries to make with him about the facts of both their lives are so arbitrary that it's genuinely unsettling. Robert assassinates Jesse for many reasons (in possibly the best scene in the film), one unspoken one being that Jesse actually wants to be killed, but after the assassination, Robert finds himself hoping for glory for what he's done. He even makes a play about the assassination, starring him and his brother, to glorify it. However, what he gets is far from glory. As Jesse's body is toured around the U.S.A., Robert begins to be chastised as a coward, and Robert is more alone, angry, and confused in his whole life than he has ever been.This whole film wouldn't work without the fantastic performances from everyone in the cast (especially Brad Pitt, in his best role yet) and by the fantastic direction that combine to make even a simple conversation incredibly tense. Also, the beautiful cinematography by Roger Deakins makes this something special, showing the wild west in a more dark and gloomy manner than we're used to. It also highlights the way we view history, with the edges of the frame blurred, through a rather subjective point of view.On top of all of that, this film is important because it exposes how our society views famous people. We don't exactly view them as people. We idolize them and strive to be like them, when truthfully we don't know the first thing about them or who they are. We label Jesse James as a courageous man and Robert Ford as a coward, when really both are just humans. Jesse James may seem like a good man but he has genuine flaws likethe rest of us, and Robert Ford may seem like a coward, but he has good qualities that we never even bother to try and see. Even though Robert makes a reenactment of the assassination on Broadway and thousands of people see it, we could never put ourselves into the actual situation. We could get together and put a man to death without the man ever being given a chance to be understood. We may tell ourselves that he is a "coward", but what we don't realize is that "Robert Ford could only lay on the floor and look at the ceiling. The light going out of his eyes, before he could find the right words."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wasn't 2007 a great year for movies? Zodiac, There Will Be Blood, No Country for Old Men, how about this lesser celebrated classic?A long, brooding western. Yet it is a treasure chest of acting. Casey Affleck gives his best performance as Robert Ford. Ruthlessly envious, and yes, a coward. Brad Pitt is equally amazing as Jesse James. Deakins is one of the very best cinematographers out there, and this is some of his best work. Even when he's not with the Coen bros. he's killing it elsewhere. Storytelling style was very well done, which included a great narration that reminded me of Ricky Jay's from Magnolia. What is even more interesting than the story leading up to the assassination. is what happens after, and the guilt, or lack thereof, from Rob Ford. He wanted to become a hero, and instead, became a loser, for all the people he thought hated Jesse James, had idolized him. Tragic irony, and karma is the main theme of this film, much like Amadeus. This was a great watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is one of those works of art that betray their plot details in their own title. It's a tricky thing to pull off, but in this instance it is an integral element in viewing the film. The title itself, and the words of the source material have become legend, and legend is often mistaken for fact. The narrator speaks with an air of authority as if he were talking in a documentary, recording history as it happened with an eye for objectivity. Roger Deakins stacks lenses on top of each other and blurs the edges of the frame in crucial moments, mimicking the deterioration of older photographs taken with the collodion process, or if you want to go further back, a scrap of parchment, its edges being burnt away along with the story it tells. It creates the feeling of a faded, aged narrative that is being passed down in history - and like so many stories, it has been shaped and morphed by each mouth and each stroke of the pen, until it becomes an entirely different account. So to call what occurs an assassination would be an exaggeration to say the least; that implies a meticulous and calculated affair rather than the sudden gunshot that shocks the housewife in the other room. It certainly has a tinge of romanticism to it, and feels like something that Jesse James has concocted in his slow descent into paranoia and madness - to feel so mighty of himself that he must not merely be shot in the head, but accounted and taken care of via a precise assassination. Why else would he attempt to desperately stage something so dramatic and theatrical in his last moments, as he stares into the reflection of his soon to be killer? This is Pitt at his best; increasingly ragged and spent, like a powerful lion past its prime and mane and muscles fading. His bursts of anger and obsession only thinly disguise what everyone knows; that sooner or later his notoriety will get the better of him, and even loyalty or admiration (from his biggest fan, no less) will not be an obstacle on that day. And through his efforts, that killer is branded a coward. His name is Robert Ford, and he has idolised the legend ever since he was a kid. Casey Affleck is more than competent; in a moment of starstruck admiration, James admits that the stories are embellished at best and lies at worst, and his world is momentarily shattered - but of course to win his affection he composes himself and hastily laughs it off. But it is a crucial blow, because he slowly discovers the myths surrounding figures such as James, and how they can be much more invincible than the person themselves. In another vulnerable moment, he is jeered at and threatened by senior members of the gang, and attempts to establish his own aura of intimidation, but instead his voice just slightly cracks, betraying his youth. This is just as false as his later cockiness and new-found confidence after what is presumably his first ever kill. Meanwhile, he resumes his obsession with the outlaw Jesse James, and tries to construct his own legend...ah, but these forces are beyond his control. Deakins' work has been praised again and again - his vignetted frames force a focus unlike any other. A conversation between a man and Jesse James becomes fiercely surveyed by Robert, in dead centre. A weathered outlaw, once the brightest of lights, is silhouetted by a fading sunset. He makes the landscapes barren and harsh, rivalling the very power of Malick's Days of Heaven. A key scene involving the robbery of a train is often mentioned. It is a short but chilling sequence, heightened by the lack of light but for the one swinging lamp of Jesse James and the beam of the train itself, unknowingly casting strands of light among the trees where the haunting, ghostly figures lie. It would be nothing without Ellis and Cave's score; the mournful strings slowly but surely ushering the innocents into the gang's out-stretched hands. They return again and again to that thudding baseline, like a heartbeat painfully reaching for another moment of life, and that fairytale-like piece in 'Song for Jesse' with its twinkling xylophone that together with the narration makes it feel as if a storybook was being unveiled to us, page by page. As he drowns his face in cold water and prepares to kill his idol, a shrill, siren-like sound effect permeates Robert's mind, and he can barely focus on the conversation (she asks him his portion size, but almost anything feels like an accusation at this point, as his guilt builds) at hand.And yet, it doesn't feel complete. For all the thematic focus on the morphing of myth and the twisting of tales by word of mouth and legend, in the end it is the narrator who does most of this heavy lifting as he elaborates on the coward's subsequent downfall. Eloquent as it is, it often takes whole paragraphs out of Hansen's novel, and this has an overpowering effect. The few scenes post-assassination flicker past the branding of his shame, when they should linger. Eight hundred performances, once agonising, as the ghost of Jesse James taunts Robert at failing in becoming his successor, flashes by in a single moment, ironically taming its emotional potency. A cameo from Zooey Deschanel attempts to uncover new ground, but is futile. This area is curiously unexplored, almost like a tacked on denouement. But then again, don't all rumours and legends originate from a blurred, indistinct source?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jesse James allows James-worshiper Robert Ford into his life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford" (2007) has a long title and is a long movie, but it held my attention, primarily because the role of Jesse James was made for Brad Pitt and he carried it off terrifically. I also liked the story's originality. It's different than the James movies of the past in being far more psychological. It really shows a mercurial and ruthless side to James that's missing in the famous version with Tyrone Power. Pitt can show murder in his eyes fantastically. It focuses on the time period very near his "retirement", and that's unusual. It goes in some depth into the character of Robert Ford and shows what happened to him. The cinematography is beautiful. So, in a number of ways, this film is both innovative and well-done.There are negatives, however. This is not a perfect film. It is very long and plods along, giving the impression that it's trying to be a classic like "Lawrence of Arabia" or "Doctor Zhivago", but the story is not that elaborate to bear the weight of such length. The story has weighty and downbeat narration, and this makes the movie at times feel like a novel. There's too much narration. The film looks consciously arty at some points, too much so.There is perhaps just a little too much mystery surrounding Jesse's relationship to Ford, or why he let him get so close and even assassinate him. There is an allusion made by Jesse that he's seen "the other side" and that death is welcome, one not wanting to come back into an earthly body after having experienced this other side. But it's a sole allusion rather out of the blue in the story. Was vanity a fault of Jesse? This is not developed either as a reason why he kept Ford around.It's good to see the western surviving and making a comeback. It never really died, but it did go into eclipse for awhile. Westerns are very easy to watch. This one is a more than respectable member of the genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jesse James (Brad Pitt) is a mystery to his own kids living a secret life under a different name in Kansas City. He's 34 and it's 1881. The remaining members of his gang include Robert Ford (Casey Affleck), Charley Ford (Sam Rockwell), Frank James (Sam Shepard), Wood Hite (Jeremy Renner), Ed Miller (Garret Dillahunt) and Dick Liddil (Paul Schneider). Frank and Jesse are the last two remaining original members.Andrew Dominik films a beautiful looking movie but his script runs on and on. Roger Deakins's cinematography is a thing of beauty. The first train robbery at night is haunting. The dialog is a long rambling affair. As always, I don't particularly like narrations. One would expect a Jesse James movie to be exciting and a great thrill ride. In this movie, even the action scenes are moody and stylish. What starts out as a fascinating beautiful hypnotic watch turns into more of an endurance test at over two and a half hour. Brad Pitt plays Jesse James as a mercurial calm commanding presence. Affleck has an unstable edginess. The cast is filled with wonderful actors. Nevertheless, the movie could use a little trimming.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredibly detailed, beautifully filmed masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always had an interest in the Old West from a young child and this is the story of the build up to and death of the infamous Jesse James and also the story behind his killer Robert Ford. It isn't a film for those who want action but for those who are interested in the background and aftermath of his death this is just about as good as it gets. The casting is excellent, Brad Pitt is an excellent actor and it's obvious he has a strong affection for Jesse James. His is an understated and brilliant performance backed up by an equally impressive performance by Casey Affleck as Robert Ford who idolises Jesse James but eventually turns into his killer. A strong supporting cast which includes Sam Rockwell means you are never going to be disappointed with the acting. The cinematography is outstanding and the best I've seen in any film. It's almost like watching a photograph come to life at times. In addition the narration of the film is a good idea, excellently done. This is a film that strongly led by the characters and dialogue and therefore won't appeal to everyone especially as it's also a bum numbing 2 hours 40 minutes. However for those with an appreciation of the subject and fine acting this is a real treat. I have seen this film three times now and have enjoyed it more each time i've seen it. This was obviously a labour of love to the director Andrew Dominik and to Brad Pitt and it shows. To me this is the finest western ever made and one of the best films ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't need to do much explanation of what this film is about as it's in the title. To make that huge title larger and fill in all the of the film's exploits it would go something like this: "The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford? and the preceding build-up of a few robberies, James relationship with his fellow robbers (especially Ford) and a slight look into the aftermath". I'm not sure if this was a considered title, though I should add that there is a 4 hour version of this film with which Mr Pitt won the Venice Film Festival's best lead for, so perhaps it was an idea. 2007. Starring Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck. Directed by Andrew Dominik.I'm sure this film wouldn't be half as good as it was if it wasn't for one man: Casey Affleck. He received an Oscar Nomination for Best Supporting Actor and he steals the show from right under Brad Pitt's feet. He lost out to Javier Bardem in No Country for Old Men, which I will begrudgingly say is fair as it was top notch, but in my awards it goes down as Affleck in my awards. I'll start by saying that while he tops the list it is not to say that everyone else is poor. All the cast are on top form here including Sam Rockwell. I'd say Brad Pitt does a fantastic job portraying James' paranoia, outlandishness and pure cool grit. But Affleck is just too good here; every single one of his scenes is played perfectly. Every aspect of Ford's character is played out stunningly: his admiration of James, his slyness, his boyish tendencies while trying to look like James. The message is just thrown out of the screen at you that this is a boy in a man's body looking for a name for himself. The last few scenes do not allow for much acting to be done by Affleck in terms of screen time but his change of character is outstanding. He completely removes that boyish dreamer and replaces it with a man filled with deep regret and hatred.The other Oscar nomination was for Best Achievement in Cinematography. Put simply it looks good. Even from the poster you can see that the setup is great. Its outdoor shots are very panoramic with the great sweeping Wild West backdrop all trod along by horseback with Pitt swanning around looking cool as can be. The film proceeds over a large time scale and goes through the seasons, each looking remarkable when caught on camera, with my favourite being the snowy mountain background as Pitt's character becomes more paranoid and restless. It lost that Oscar to one of my favourite films "There Will Be Blood"Now I have to say for all these good points there are quite a few bad that weigh it down a fair bit. The first thing that frustrated me a lot was the dialogue. The language in the film was obviously going to be a difficult issue with it being set in the late 1800's, but not this much. A lot of the lines seem to not be vocalised well (I watched a DVD version) and some of the language was just gibberish to me, so every now and then I lost the plot and had to go back and use subtitles.This is not my biggest annoyance with this though. That comes down to a rather simple thing used 2 or 3 times in the film. Right at the start a narrator speaks a bit about the previous goings on of James and his gang. I don't mind this as the film is already quite long and can understand why producers feel the need to trim. The issue comes when the narrator starts to describe a few of Fords ideas and feelings. Only for a few seconds or perhaps a minute at a time but this still infuriates me. The idea of a film, and why a film can work better than a book, is that you see a characters emotions there in front of, you see what it feels and you can connect with the character while putting yourself in its place. This use of a narrator seems lazy to me, as the writer of the film cannot find a situation for the actor to express himself he/she just sticks in a bit of dialogue and Affleck looking sad. If you can't find a scene just have the character do a monologue or express his feelings to another character in a big chunk.The only way a film can be any good at all is with some underlying depth or an idea or concept that the viewer must understand and take a meaning from; I enjoyed Prometheus because of how it makes us think about ourselves in terms of our real nature and what shows us to be human. This is what makes or kills a film for me and this film, while not having a real depth, has a good idea in it. "How can a man kill his hero". That is what this film is mainly all about. It gives you Ford's world and shows his life. It puts you in his shoes and shows you how a man goes from idolisation of a man-myth, to realising the only way to be him is to kill him and fall finally into a pit of regret over youthful stupidity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this case, important is the final taste. The mixture of dust, small gestures and few words. The bread crust from a lost kitchen, pages of old book, nature as special character, Casey Affleck in a great role and Brad Pitt in the skin of a seductive shadow. So, a strange western. The ingredients and the recipes are same. But the fire and water are more different. Crumbs of Russian movies and drops of melancholic circles. A world. In the search of its sense. Or soul. Or past. In fact, a story behind the camp fire. The hero is gray. The evil is insignificant. The fear is only ant. The moral is a testimony with Muslim nuances. A beautiful film.

		<fullReview>Once you get past the first 35 minutes or so this film is amazing. All the actors do a fantastic job and Dominik really takes the viewer back to an age when people measured their trips in days. The intensity of the acting and the tension is incredible right up until the inevitable confrontation between Ford and James. And the ending tells a poignant story about Ford. The motives of the characters are complex and we're never fully certain of Jame's motives when he died. The way the director ties in the contrast between the myth of Jesse James with the reality of the man (as portrayed in the film) is superb. There's not only the narration and Robert Ford's adoration for the James' of his childhood yarns contrasted with his awkward, fumbling attempts to win James' affection, but also the juxtaposition between an American public who scorned Ford for being "a coward" contrasted with the experiences of Ford and the other gang members around James who was a cold blooded murderer around whom many were nervous, never sure as to whether he might shoot them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent but historical flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many claim that "The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford " of 2007 contains a historic accurate account of the story and aftermath of the Jessie James assassination. But there is plenty evidence that there are some flaws inside Andrew Dominik's screenplay and Ron Hansen's novel.In 1940 Fritz Lang directed "The Return of Frank James" where Frank is getting acquitted by the State Court of Missouri after being in jail a year awaiting trial. On Monday August 27th, 1883, the court-case of the State of Missouri v. of Frank James was resumed, which was the third day of his trial. On Monday September 3rd, 1883 Frank James was acquitted. During the trial Frank Woodson James learned about the real facts surrounding the assassination of his brother Jessie, and no doubt went on his own bounty hunt to get Charles and Robert Ford, using the name Ben J. Woodson. Today it is apparently "universal evident" that Frank James never went after the Ford Brothers. I have my sincere doubts .In 1939, a year before producing "The Return of Frank James", Fritz Lang became a naturalized citizen of the United States, after arriving in Hollywood in 1936. Would Fritz Lang create a movie with inaccurate historic facts surrounding Jessie James and the Ford brothers, having just received citizen ship and making his large screen arrival with Henry Fonda in the leading actor role as Frank James ? In recent years a Dog and Pony show entitled "Outlaws of Missouri" has been annotated to Robert Ford, which according legendsofamerica.com was used by Bob Ford to obfuscate the real facts surrounding the murder : "Night after night, Ford retold his story, carefully omitting that he had shot James in the back. " Inside "The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford" of 2007 we see Robert Ford in his theater show "Outlaws of Missouri" clearly shoot Jessie James from behind. So there is something very fishy there, as director Andrew Dominik also here clearly missed the motive for the Robert Ford theater play.After knowing all this, this movie is indeed a must watch for anyone interested in the story behind the James gang.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't think I can add to what has been said so well already about how amazing this film is. It is a movie that both entranced and haunted me, and alongside the likes of Brokeback Mountain, There will be Blood and Pan's Labyrinth, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is one of my favourites of the decade.The film is quite glacial in its pace, but I do not consider that a problem in any way, as I think the slow pacing was done deliberately. And even if it was slow in pace, I don't think I would have cared, because everything about this film is so good.The Assassination of Jesse James... has some of the most sweeping and at the same time most beautiful images I have seen on film in recent memory. The whole film is exquisitely shot, and the landscapes and scenery are stunning. Nick Cave and Warren Ellis' score fits beautifully too.The film is also rich in characterisation, has a thoughtful and well-textured script, has a beautiful and haunting atmosphere and a story that despite the pace and the long running time drew me in and never let go. The direction is sensitive and never heavy-handed, and there are some truly excellent performances. Both Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck are wonderful in very powerful and understated performances, and out of the supporting cast Sam Rockwell stands out.In conclusion, a fine film and one of the best of the decade in my opinion. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard about this film because of the genre and two of the leading actors starring, and obviously it is mostly based on fact from the 19th Century, from director Andrew Dominik (Chopper). Basically this sees the last months in the life of Jesse James (Brad Pitt), the wanted man carrying out train robberies under a fake name with his small gang of criminals. One man who idolises James and all his crimes, collecting newspaper clippings, wanted posters, toys and much more memorabilia, is nineteen year old Robert Ford (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Casey Affleck). With Jesse constantly under tension, murdering, depressed and cautious, Robert does get to meet him in the flesh, and what starts out rather well slowly becomes sour as the criminal dismisses his existence almost entirely. Ford and his brother join the gang in Kentucky, and help a little with a planned bank robbery, but while he and Jesse get away the rest of the gang are arrested, fleeing to Missouri or dead. Robert obviously wants to be somebody some day soon, and with James becoming increasingly hard to be around, he decides to claim the reward money for his capture or death, shooting Jesse in the back of the head, but his fame as the man who killed him doesn't last long enough for anyone to take notice. Also starring Sam Shepard as Frank James, Mary-Louise Parker as Zee James, Paul Schneider as Dick Liddil, Jeremy Renner as Wood Hite, Zooey Deschanel as Dorothy Evans, Sam Rockwell as Charley Ford, Garret Dillahunt as Ed Miller, Dustin Bollinger as Tim James, Lauren Calvert as Ida and Ted Levine as Sheriff Timberlake. Pitt is pretty good as the infamous train and bank robber, and I can see why Affleck was nominated his awards for an equally good supporting performance, I did drift off a little in parts, especially with it being twenty minutes short of three hours long, but there are some moments that were good watching, and I guess it is a should see western drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Cinematography. Good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, the first thing of this movie which will capture your fascination is the cinematography of this movie (Thanks to Roger Deakins). The landscapes, set upon Eighteenth Century are shown brilliantly in the movie. The movie depicts the life of legendary American gang-leader and robber Jesse James(Brad Pitt) . It also tells the story of Jesse James' killer Robert Ford (Casey Affleck) parallelly. More than showing the robberies, that had been pulled off by James gang, the movie shows more of the life of Jesse James and his gang members too which includes Robert Ford too.Brad Pitt is great as Jesse James. As I have started to watch more of his movies, I am finding the versatility in his acting. At first, he doesn't speak much but he says all with his eyes. He portrayed Jesse James to the character's fullest aspects, so that sometimes one really hates the character, and sometimes feels for Jesse and loves him. Now, Casey Affleck is the one to watch out for, in this movie. He was in one word "Superb" as the 'Coward' Robert Ford. One cannot help but appreciate and applause the way he portryed the "Cowardice". Sam Rockwell, Jeremy Renner and Paul Schneider does justice to their respective characters too.Nick Cave's music is great. Specially the main theme, "Ballad for Jesse James" is really soulful and melancholic at the same time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Andrew Dominik's 'The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford' is a slow paced, insightful and visually stunning exploration on obsession with celebrity during the 19th century. I had expected to be one of those typical western action type movies but the film is more subtle, complex, nuanced and layered. It also provides some interesting historical insight. I'm not saying that it's entirely accurate as it's no unknown fact that filmmakers alter facts for the sake of 'artistic liberty' but certain facts are well presented. The detailed art direction, costumes and makeup, coupled with the language of the dialogue bring out a feel of what the 1800s might have been like.There's a whimsical touch but it is done with subtlety. Dominik's direction and writing are fluid. The dialogues have a lyrical ring to them and many of them are loaded with riddles. The pace might be a little slow at times but I never felt bored. The visual effects department have done a marvelous job because the raw American landscape looks stunning. In addition Deakin's cinematography is mesmerizing. Nick Cave's score is outstanding.Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck are competent as the leads. It couldn't have been easy yo play such complex characters but both actors do a very good job. Yet, it is their co-actors who own the scenes they have done together. This includes, Sam Rockwell as the good-hearted and goofy Charley, Mary Louise Parker as the quiet but loving Zee, Garret Dillahunt as the terrified Ed, Paul Schneider as the mischievous Dick and Jeremy Renner as the ruthless Wood who have done a first rate job.'The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford' is an engaging human story about a legend. Don't see it expecting some knockout western action. Not to say that it's devoid of action (because it isn't) but there's less of instant gratification and more of the study of a culture in history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A story of the last days of the notorious Jesse James, and the man who came to regret killing him.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I'm saying his sins will soon find him out. I'm saying his cup of iniquity is full. I'm saying Jesse James is a desperate case and may require a desperate remedy."The Assassination of Jesse James is about as far from your usual shoot 'em up, bang bang, western yarn, as you can get. It's actually a character study. A particularly measured and slowly paced character study. But it works on the strength of it's great cast and solid writing.Casey Affleck is wonderful as the unsettling, perpetually nervous, shifty man whose unnerving obsession with Jesse James is uncomfortably obvious. And Brad Pitt continues to impress, as he presents James as a charismatic, dangerous, and paranoid man (though his accent was a little iffy, at times). The supporting cast of talented actors like Sam Rockwell, Paul Schneider, Garret Dillahunt, Mary-Louise Parker, and Zooey Deschanel, are all favorites of mine, and all perfectly suited for their roles.Some people may find the pace to be a little TOO glacial, but it would be a crime for a movie with cinematography this beautiful to be rushed. Some of the backdrops and settings are almost breathtaking, with snow-covered roads and fields of grain featuring colors that seem almost too vivid to be natural. I'm a big fan of striking scenery in my movies, and this one certainly gets my seal of approval in that regard.&nbsp;The Assassination of Jesse James is not a short movie, and it's value is in the interactions of the characters, not in the robberies (which we see only one of) and romanticized-western action that we would normally associate with the near-legendary story of the James Gang. I found it to be worthwhile. It raises questions about what makes a man a hero or a villain in the public's eyes, and by the end of the film, we find out that those questions have interesting answers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oddly enough, the movie line that came to me as I watched the closing of The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is, "I am haunted by waters." I assume the Brad Pitt connection made that inevitable, perhaps with my subconscious seeing Pitt's Paul Maclean as the type boy who under the same circumstances could become a Jesse James.Those who know the James family saga and do not judge it by the standards of post-Civil War/Reconstruction clichs, and perhaps especially those who also know the story of Australia's Iron Outlaw Ned Kelly, will understand.Because of the era and west of the Mississippi setting, most viewers will come to this film expecting a Western. The vast majority of those will also expect more action than this film delivers. But to its great merit, The Assassination of Jesse James is not what most would label a 'typical' Western. It is finely etched character study of three men: Jesse, Bob Ford, and his older brother Charlie. Each of the three actors is stunning in his portrayal, with Pitt so disciplined that his performance will strike most viewers as almost innocuous. I easily can make a case for Affleck as having deserved an Oscar and another for Rockwell having deserved a nomination.Like Unforgiven, this film shows us the problems that come from media created and endlessly vomited celebrity by making the nickel/dime novels central to the action. Those products of mass produced reading material utterly falsifying the West, romanticizing both outlaws and the lawmen and privately hired killers sent after bank and train robbers, have forged the young Bob Ford into a hero worshiper who, somewhat like the later Mark David Chapman, will kill the object of his romanticized adoration.The Assassination of Jesse James fails to genuflect before any clichs or political platitudes. Jesse is ruthless to protect himself and his identity, and he is shown being needlessly violent in the train robbery. But he also appears to be a man who would shuck it all to become something of a homebody (riding off on real cattle buying trips with Frank) if he were not caught in the trap of his own past and celebrity. Jesse, like a Greek tragic hero, seem to welcome, Even encourage, his death from behind.Bob is the ridiculously worshipful boy, teased by the older men, who comes to resent the object of his adoration, perhaps when he realizes that Jesse is indeed just a man, a complex, flawed man. Then the threats and rewards from the powers of government and big business are snares he will not evade. Bob then becomes the celebrity, playing himself on stage killing Jesse James: the absurd world of the dime Western brought to life for Monet city folk back east. Bob Ford, who had become the dancing bear for the rich folks who paid for Jesse's death, dies much as did Jesse: essentially a tragic figure, that which made him great inevitably marring his final days and striking him down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fatal Gravitation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Less the title doesn't make it clear, the voice over narration explicitly states the direction this movie is turning from frame one, so here is a movie nigh impossible to discuss in terms of spoilers. Nevertheless, the awareness of the direction the movie is going is, sincerely, the movie's greatest gift. Using Roger Deakon's amazing cinematography, Nick Cave and Warren Ellis' gorgeous music, and the acting talents of Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck, director Dominick makes his mark with a singularly meditative film that pulls the audience along like gravity at ground zero--possibly not noticed, maybe even taken for granted, but a sure and constant force.For me, the thing I liked about it the most was Jesse James' death AS the process of the whole movie; Brad Pitt blankly, almost fatalistically, gets on the chair like a man at the hanging, and this surreal sense of acknowledgement is foreshadowed in the the structure of the movie as the narrator starts it out with an obituary and Robert Ford blesses Jesse for his birthday: within five minutes the movie itself sets the length of Jesse's life. He knows when his time is up as assuredly as the audience, and we all participate.Which is why the idea of Ford as "The Coward Robert Ford" is so interesting. This movie could almost be called "Sympathy for Robert Ford", except that as Frank James says so early on in the movie, there's something not quite right about him. Contrasting Jesse James and Robert Ford as described in this movie, both of them are nearly sociopathic--except James because he lacks shame and remorse, and Ford because he suffers from an abundance of it. Whereas the world is populated by so many Western genre types, Robert and Jesse as portrayed by Affleck and Pitt stand out for a singular awareness of what their characters mean--but this is not a bad performance choice, it is an uncanny clairvoyance within the characters that makes this movie tug the suspense along when the ending is already known and the scenes slowly unfold at a contemplative pace.The only thing I didn't like about it was it suffered malignantly from Too Many Endings Syndrome, a particular affliction of many a contemporary director. The movie should have faded out on the famous still of James and the rest of the information given in an intertitle, if at all. I do not honestly believe Ford's confession, two song and dance routines, and another assassination really did anything the movie had not fully explored and expressed by the time the aforementioned still was shown on-screen. I also think that in almost sympathizing with Ford, the ending removes some of the ambiguity that truly makes the character more heroic and interesting, which is what the narrator tries to do.I did not know about the four hour cut until after I saw the movie, and by all means I would be very interested in seeing it, though I really hope (and am probably not far off) that most of that material is before, not after, the assassination proper.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Drawbacks that Ruin a Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A slow pace, art house, western. Like No Country for Old Men, the film explores the theme of the illogical notion of idealizing the past. Both films end up attacking the "idealization" by showing the past, like the present, as being a bleak, secular world. For those people looking for an action western-- look for another film; the film is structure mostly on conversations between characters. It is a very, slow pace film. On the positive aspects, Casey Affleck and Sam Rockwell,as well as most of the supporting cast is superb... Affleck ( not Ben) and Rockwell should be cast in more films. Roger Deakins' cinematography is done in an unique, old photograph style, manner. Personally, not a fan of the look, but many people are. Also, the wardrobe and set design appear realistic. The film fails to become a pleasant experience, since there are too many drawbacks. First of all, Brad Pitt is miscast; he is completely overshadow by the rest of the cast. Normally, this would not be a problem, but the film depends on the legend and stage presence of Jesse James(Pitt's character). Though ambitious, the fails to deliver the book, documentary mood. Many directorial decisions, such as the use of narration, hurts the impact of many scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If only seen a few movies that have left me completely silent and amazed when they ended. I have only seen one where I wanted to replay it straight away. But people I was with that night where not interested in seeing one movie twice. "But the music was awesome! And there's so much I want to see again!" I kept saying how amazing it was for about a month to everyone I knew. We rented the DVD at a library and the next day it had to be returned. The same day I actually bought the DVD for 10 well spent euro's. I tried to ask all my friends to watch it but when they saw the runtime and the title they where somehow repelled by it. With or without people I had to see that movie again. But when I watched it again, to my own surprise, I noticed that I was watching a movie that was perfect. I didn't notice the camera angles and art-design as much as the first time or even the silences that revealed more about the characters then any words could. I was amazed once again. Acting, location, art, camera, music, storyline and everything else just feels right. Thats why this movie is (to my opinion) perfect.This movie should be on the very top of the IMDb top 250. Jesse James beats Shawshank Redemption any day. Skeptical? Yes of course, you should be! If someone tells you that a movie is amazing you should always check it yourself. So go watch it! and when you watched it, watch it again! And maybe watch it once more when your all alone. But just watch it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007)Genre: Drama Runtime: 159 minutesHere's the thing, when the title of the movie is this long and the subject to the matter is told in the title, there is no element of surprise left in it then.Yes the movie is about assassination of the outlaw named Jesse James who was killed by of his admirers Bob (don't worry folks it's not a spoiler) However, the movie is so beautifully shot that every scene of the movie is worth watching over and over again, the cinematic style blended with lime sepia containing slight mixture of candle light takes and through the glass shots reflect that this movie is nothing short of a modern masterpiece and don't even get me started on the cinematography because that was just "SHEER BRILLIANCE" hats off to Andrew Dominik the director and screen writer of the movie, a big round of applause for Roger Deakins for his marvelous efforts in cinematography. The best thing director did in the making of this movie is he didn't miss any little things, every scene represents details of its own The cast and crew was picture perfect and the acting was spot on. Brad Pitt as Jesse James was the most real then real characters as if he was born to play the role and Casey Affleck's (Bob Ford) performance was unbelievably second to none. Equally brilliant performances by Sam Shepard as Frank James, Garret Dillahunt as Ed Miller, Paul Schneider as Dick Liddil, Jeremy Renner as Wood Hite, Mary-Louise Parker as Zee James and of course last but not the least Sam Rockwell as Charley Ford. The last thing that any action junkie would be wanting is to make this particular movie another shoot-out, commercial money grubbing flick for their entertainment (which is by the way a curse)"A complete movie after a very long time""A perfect blend of drama, storytelling, emotions and art"10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Cast of Characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this film simply for the cast. Casey Affleck (who I always say never gets the credit he deserves) is perfect for the role of Robert Ford as is Sam Rockwell as his brother Charlie. The locations for filming (Canada I believe) were and the score is hauntingly beautiful beautiful. The only thing I didn't like about the film is the title. Personally, I don't think of Robert Ford as a coward when you look at all the things Jesse James had done; honoring the bad guy has always puzzled me. In any case, it's still intriguing and well worth the 160 minutes. It does have some sexual reference, but tastefully done and there isn't much in the way of cursing, but there is some graphic violence. I thought the narration (by Scottish actor Hugh Ross), throughout the film was a pleasant addition to the film as it explains a lot of what the viewer doesn't really see; the history of some of the characters and what they're thinking. This is still one of my favorite films and I recommend it if you like quality filming.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best recent westerns.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford' is arguably one of the best westerns that came out recently, and undoubtedly its a good watch. As you can see, it has an unconventional title, spoiling the greatest event in the film, and also the way the film is told, with a narrator always telling the story, and always ahead of the happenings in the scenes. It's pretty original, if you analyze the film as a 'whole'.Robert Ford wasn't more coward than James, but his infamous reputation created after killing a man, a man which was notoriously known for being a 'brave' man, started the folks that lead him to a fast fame and a even fastest decadency. He wasn't nowhere near as important as James were, so his name fell into oblivion after his death.But is sad, because he was very young and just wanted to be as recognized and famous as James, his childhood idol. Actually, this is also the why he made a plan with the government.But perhaps, when you commit a big mistake, even if you are moved by the fuel of the youngness, it will earns serious consequences for the rest of your life. In Ford's case, he was rejected by society and received an inevitable revenge. Treason.As you see, this film is beautifully shot, but what really drew me attention was the music: It's great, and his melancholic's undertones totally fits the dense atmosphere of this film. The film is also pretty stylized, and well made, due the good work of the edition. The acting was also indeed good, notably by Sam Rockwell and Casey Affleck, which interpreted respectively the undecided Charlie Ford and the 'young' in all the senses of the word Robert Ford.It's a good film, shame it bombed on the box office. 8.1/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A slow burn but worth it in the end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is a movie with a title that is much too long but fitting. Considered one of the most accurate portrays of the event that I knew nothing about before watching the film, this movie is a slow burn. It follows the last few months of Jesse James (Brad Pitt) life as he meets Robert Ford (Casey Affleck), does his last robbery, and goes through his own self- suffering. It is truly about the psychology of Jesse James and Robert Ford. Jesse James, who seems to be questioning himself and what he has done as he suffers through his own depression. Robert Ford, who has always been obsessed with the life of Jesse James even as a kid and the trauma he suffers through from killing his own idol. The film runs for 2 hours and 40 minutes which is both bad and good. It allows for a great build-up to the fantastic last 40 minutes that are easily the best part of the film but it makes going through the first 2 hours rough at times. Some things definitely could have been cut out. I sometimes felt they spent too much time on other characters when in the end, it really own focuses on three characters. Jesse James, Robert Ford, and Charley Ford (Sam Rockwell). Also, much of the film is told through narration, not by any of the characters, but just a random narrator (Hugh Ross). Sometimes this narration feels incredibly forced and not needed. In some instances, I can tell what the characters are doing through visuals and don't need a narrator telling me. It just feels like I'm being spoon fed information. Occasionally, the narration is needed, but I also felt they could have simply had some more character interaction instead to tell the story. The performances by the entire cast truly are incredible though. Every actor is giving a top notch performance and doing fantastic things in this movie. Brad Pitt manages to handle being the dynamic character of Jesse James while displaying his depression and his criminal persona. Casey Affleck perfectly portrays the betrayal the character of Robert Ford has to suffer through perfectly. If anything, these performances make the characters feel real and human, rarely does Jesse James feel like a completely cold person even if he is a criminal. The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous with beautiful imagery of fields, the sun, and snow and I'm not entirely surprised when we have a cinematographer like Roger Deakins who has been involved in nearly all of the Coen Brothers films and most recently did the cinematography for Skyfall. This film is truly worth watching even if the pacing could have been improved, it's worth it for the last 40 minutes alone which truly delves into Robert Ford and his suffering at the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Assassination of the Myth?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd always resisted this film, due to its title, namely the 'coward' part. More a case of a slanderous slur, rather than a criminal charge.After succumbing, I was swallowed in and was swept through this almost poetic tale of psychological slow-burning. The so-natural dialogue, the paced narrative that was near hypnotic. The colouring - the sparse, sympathetic music. The brilliant cinematography. The narration that was perfection; intelligent and lurid - counteracting the often bitty, scatological dialogue. On this, my second viewing, I was glad that I used the subtitles on the DVD. Casey Afleck's mumbled drawl is certainly in keeping with his character traits but not for following the dialogue. In any case, here in the U.K, we hear of subtitles sometimes being added in the U.S as a matter of course to tell the world what our regional actors are saying. The acting is, of course, absolutely first-rate and Brad Pitt, Sam Shepard (who I could watch forever) and all are totally mesmerising and believable.Yes, it is too long, only that I get restless, not disinterested. What to me is the icing on the cake was the prologue. The counteraction, the irony, the outcome. Which in some way goes somewhere toward addressing my initial concerns.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. It one of those films that pulls you in right at the start . The cinematography is just beautiful with so many unforgettable and iconic shots that you could hang each and everyone of them up on your walls as a piece of art. I've never been a massive fan of Brad Pitt , only when he working with Fincher do i enjoy him. But now, I just can't get his portrayal of Jesse James out of my head. he doesn't talk a lot but you know what he thinking , he forces you to dive deep into his mind , into his daunting world . This is thanks to the brilliant acting and writing. When it comes to his assassination, the suspense almost becomes unbearable and truly upsetting . We all know it going to happen but we never prepare ourselves for it.Cassey Affleck steals the film for me. When as Robert Ford , some will either hate him or sympathised for him. There every reason to call him a coward , In the law of the American citizens , shooting someone behind their back was proved to be act of cowardice. This is from a guy who Had to endure being laughed at due to his obsession with the James boys , being the the third child in which he states as the forgotten child . He may not become famous as a outlaw but he sure will become iconic when he is known as the guy who killed the almighty famous Jesse James. This is what he believe. When he sends a telegram informing the authorities that he has carried out the assassination with that grin of his face , you just can't prepare your self for the raw powerfulness of the final 20 minutes that is about to come.The last minutes of the film pulls out every emotion from you . There one thing that ties this film together and that is the poetic narration. His voice is calm yet daunting. It adds that extra depth of emotion into the film . Without it then this film wouldn't of been as good. There no such thing as a perfect film but this one comes mighty close. The art design the choice of camera shots, dialogue, costumes, every scene, every word, nothing is out of place. There not one scene which you will dislike . The soundtrack is another vital aspect of the film. The lighting , just to end the list, every single person who worked on this succeeded at using every bit of their ability into making this fine film. One of the best films from the last decade</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With this, No Country For Old Men, and There Will Be Blood, we've recently been given a formidable apocalyptic Western triumvirate - you wait fifteen years (Unforgiven was released in 1992) and suddenly three bleak classics come along at once! Watching Andrew "Chopper" Dominik's second feature, you'll quickly realise it has as much to say about modern Western society as it has about its 1880s setting. Here are people - REAL people - who are so obsessed by the elusive nature of celebrity that they risk forgetting who they are. When James says to Ford, "Can't figure it out: do you want to be like me or do you want to BE me?", it could be that he is really asking, "Who am I?". James has spent his life building his own myth; perhaps the reason he wishes to keep Ford so close is because no one knows more about Jesse James than his biggest fan. By the end of it all, Ford's actions serve only to enhance the celebrity of James; heck, Ford needn't have existed at all - after all, the suggestion here is that James effectively killed himself.Nick Cave and Warren Ellis' score at once twinkles like a fairy tale, but gradually descends through a kind of dark, apocalyptic malaise, and finally into tragedy, as James' steely facade is stripped away to reveal the depressive underneath. It's a new world for Pitt - a different kind of manic, miles away from his twitchy turn in Twelve Monkeys. His puppy dog eyes capture the madness and the sadness perfectly. He is upstaged, though, by Casey Affleck as the coward himself, and also by Roger Deakins' camera, which prowls the plains like a lonesome wolf.The pacing is slow. But slow never meant the same thing as boring - just ask Terrence Malick, or Stanley Kubrick, or Michael Cimino. Sometimes, they really DO make them like they used to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow and lengthy is the one obstacle in the way of masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Somewhere in the four plus hours of film that New Zealand director Andrew Dominik shot for "The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford" has to be a cut fully capable of winning an Oscar for Best Picture. This version, however, is not it, but it's beautifully filmed and supported by incredible acting. Length (157 minutes) and a few scenes that wander off just enough to deflate the plot's naturally thriving tension are the only hurdles too high for this underrated ensemble to jump.Based on Ron Hansen's book of the same title, "Jesse James" is a historical fiction account of the great American outlaw: the man, the myth, the legend (literally) -- Jesse James. It tells the story of how the young man Bob Ford, who would eventually come to kill him, joined the famous gang of bandits and how he came to commit the "cowardly" act that forever lived in infamy.Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck as the two titular characters form one of the more intriguing relationships on the screen. As the one huge name in the cast, Pitt is perfectly cast as James, a cold outlaw that creates tension by utilizing the fear of everyone around him. Affleck is the socially awkward Ford, who used to idolize James growing up. Now that he's become part of the gang, Ford's ideal image of his hero has been shattered. The transformation he goes through from being naive to pulling the trigger on James gives Affleck an incredible range to work with. He's simply under-appreciated in Hollywood or he's really selective.That's not to diminish, however, the talent around him. Sam Rockwell, Paul Schneider and Jeremy Renner have impressive chemistry as part of the James' brothers gang. The script provides great subtext for their characters, but each is capable of so many levels. One minute they're joking around and the next they're bullies or even killers.Lastly, cinematographer Roger Deakins does absolutely gorgeous things with the lighting of this film. From the onset there's the scene of the James gang waiting in the woods for a train they've obstructed to stop so they can loot it. The train's headlight shines through the trees as it moves and ripples over their hooded faces, elevating the anticipation of the first action sequence of the film. On the whole, "Assassination" has the look of a great cinematic tragedy. The assassination scene in particular is so visually memorable. All the deaths in the film, in fact, have that traumatic effect on the audience.Then there's length. Scenes just kind of get lost. The excellent ending really pulls you back in to the film and leaves a favorable impression, but many middle sections are too quiet despite the ever-growing tension caused by the inevitability of the film's conclusion. It's hard to believe there wasn't a way to edit this film to make it of both tolerable length and a bit more streamlined through the middle because this cast, crew and story is clearly worthy of more recognition for this first-class effort.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are perhaps few films in which the basic synopsis of the script can be summed up in the title. One thinks of lesser fare than this, certainly ("Zack And Miri Make A Porno", for example) or rather interesting Spanish translations of titles (classic "Family Guy" joke here, top prize for whoever gets the reference first). With this film, the title does just that - it is about the assassination of the notorious Western criminal by one of his associates, Robert Ford, who ends up being defamed in the history books as a coward, and the time line leading up to the aforementioned event. Simple.But not quite, for, as with most great films, there is always something more, another message that the film is trying to say. And this is a great film. A really great film.Visually, it's stunning. The bleak Western landscape perfectly captures the mood of the story, with slight out of focus shots beautifully helping to add to the unhinged portrayal of the anti-hero James by Brad Pitt. This is one of those films where you suddenly remember that Pitt, the second half of 'Brangelina', can act occasionally. It's a fantastic performance, showing James as an out of control beast, but also with some very quiet melancholic foreboding, as if he knows he's living on borrowed time. It's matched, and perhaps even bettered, by a superb performance by Casey Affleck as Ford; Affleck is a dreamer, a man refusing to grow up, whose fantasies of riding with the James gang and being the criminal's best buddy seem to have corrupted his naive innocence. When the cold-blooded reality sinks in of the true nature of Jesse's work and Jesse's character, it becomes unbearable.There are other terrific performances in the film, not least from Sam Rockwell as Ford's older brother, whose own gullibility is soon swallowed up by fear, and a short but mesmerising turn from Garret Dillahunt as Ed Miller, whose paranoia costs him his life and lights the fuse for James' own fragile sense of trust to be shattered.The script is well paced, exploring the story like a history documentary with Hugh Ross' calm narration. There's no point in hiding the ending - the title's given it away already. Instead, the script is full of explanations, showing why Ford did what he did, and leaving it up to us to determine whether or not it was a good thing and whether or not he really was a 'coward', as suggested in the ballad sung by one of the film's co-composers, Nick Cave. He and Warren Ellis do a fine job with the score, leaving it subtle and calm, and adding to the quiet life out in the wilderness.Overall, the film is about fame and the hunger for fame. James is famous for his notoriety, a man who, like the characters played by Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis in "Natural Born Killers", becomes famous for all the wrong reasons. Ford wants the same kind of fame, but when he gets it in the aftermath of his role in James' death, he finds it stifling and unsatisfying, and over far too quickly; the fame of a coward does not last as long as the fame of a 'hero'. And so the film speaks volumes for us today, in this age where we've lived through the last decade as the Decade of 15 Minutes, the decade where anyone and everyone can be famous for as long as Ford was, and can still find it as he does.A fantastic film.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sublime atmosphere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm almost reluctant to want to review this film at all; it is both mesmerizing and languid. I'm convinced audiences will fall into either camp, though after the first hour it is nothing short of magnificent. Brad Pitt, who produces, said his preferred cut was 4.5 hours; let's hope it becomes available, though at 2.5 hours for the big screen, its half an hour too slow in its inception.Casey Affleck is exceptional as the lead character, Ford, though accolades have so far been directed more at Pitt for playing against type, which he has done brilliantly in the past in films like Twelve Monkeys, (True Romance anyone?). Performances aside, this is really a study on the pitfalls of celebrity, the folly of youth and perhaps reiterating the cry that last Born's do really want to change the world.The soundtrack by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis is exquisite, marrying with photography and tone perfectly, unlike some of the grating soundscapes they created, perhaps appropriately, for The Proposition.Kudos must go to Ron Hansen for his introspective novel, though Aussie Andrew Dominick in only his second feature as Director creates a sublime atmosphere, hanging on nuance, savoring tension though sometimes guilty of not cutting when he should. Let's hope his efforts don't go unnoticed while the media scramble around Pitt, imitating art, imitating the demise of Jesse James.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We may know how it ends, but perhaps the biggest achievement of the piece is the manner in which director Dominik makes us forget how it does with a stunning study.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is an underlying and quite eerie sense of substance in Andrew Dominik's 2007 film The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, the kind that is linked to the fact it is a study of an individual's obsession with a celebrity; a lust to be like a certain other, no matter how infamous or hated they may be. Here is a film with a central idea; a central study that is executed wonderfully well, with a slow burning and alluring approach which compliments the slow and steady delving into obsession. Simply put, it's great to look at; wonderful to watch and by the end, rather frightening.The film, whose central study is got across in one brilliant scene, looks at what is an unhealthy fondness of someone who has got to a relative pinnacle of a career by way of murder; robbery and bullying. In what might be the film's best scene, we encounter the outlaw Jesse James (Pitt) in a bath tub ? at his most raw, at his most vulnerable and at his most revealing. At the entrance to the bathroom stands the proclaimed 'coward', Robert Ford (Affleck), and they exchange words before James poses him the question around which the study revolves: "Do you want to be like me, or actually BE me?" Here is an exchange in which James, in his rawest of forms, challenges Ford's ideologies to do with an unnatural fondness and makes us aware, that he himself is aware, that he might carry a certain aura about him.The film documents James from 1881 to 1882, while incorporating any feats, robberies and murders that unfolded at that time on a twin parallel with Ford's gradual coming to terms with the fact this idolisation exists within him. The entire piece is narrated by a certain Hugh Ross, adding an interesting ingredient on top of an already interesting study. The inclusion of a narrator initially felt, at least to me, unwarranted or perhaps un-needed. Whatever tale or recalling of events that needed to play out didn't necessarily strike me as the sort that required narration from an agent uninvolved. But I think the inclusion is merited when you link it to the overall picture; that fact the film might be seen as a lecture, or a warning of sorts, of this sort of intrigue and obsession with violence in the media and aspiration to become someone, or someone of similar ilk, whom isn't a particularly good role model.But that's not to say the film talks down to us. It very cleverly distances us from unfolding the film from either of one of the two lead's points of view. We see this from a third person perspective; someone not directly involved in the text which feeds off two people, one of which is a hardened and rather nasty outlaw while the other is a young man whom comes complete with stalker-like tendencies and an unnatural fondness for a national villain. During one scene set around a dinner table in Ford's home, James sits amidst the rest of the family as tensions flair. But the film additionally seems to like the notion that Jesse James might act as an alter-ego to the rest of Ford's family, as well as the American Dream in general. He sits there, almost as some sort of a visualisation of an amoral manner in which to garner attention, money, fame and, ultimately, admirers. This, twinned with whatever conflict going on between James and Ford, adds a certain extra layer of antagonism between James and the Fords.As the film nears its conclusion and the inevitable nears, certain flashbacks see Jesse refer to himself in the third person sense as some kind of overwhelming anxiety and an aspect of suicidal ideation begins to overcome him. We are given his point of view, a rarity up to this point as the film provides us with a blurred and wide angled lens as he stares out of a window giving off a very uncanny sense of dread and a delicate mindset coming close to crumbling down. The film finishes what it starts in a true and engaging manner. The epilogue and Ford's supposedly newfound celebrity status following the shooting of James brings him nothing but misery, and he never, ever ? as the voice over states, comes anywhere near replicating the aura nor fame James had when he was at his peak of 'celebrity' status. What was an unhealthy obsession, quickly turned into a realisation and then into an unhealthy groove of trivialisation and guilt. Ford gave himself the big build up, latched onto the wrong beliefs and paid for it, and this film is an impressive documentation of that process.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine Western Revisionism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since the release of Clint Eastwood's excellent Unforgiven back in 1990, the Western has slowly been making a comeback, especially in the 2000s, with films like the 3:10 to Yuma, the brilliant TV Series Deadwood to even foreign entries like Australia's the Proposition and South Korea's The Good, the Bad and the Weird. The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is the closest out of the modern Western to come need Eastwood's masterpiece.As the title of the film suggests, this film is about Jesse James' assassination. It focuses on the end of Jesse James' (Brad Pitt) career and life and his relationship with Robert 'Bob' Ford (Casey Affleck). Jesse James was an outlaw in Missouri, with a reputation as a Robin Hood like figure. It starts out in a forest where Jesse James was with his gang. This is 19-year-old Bob Ford's first encounter with the man. He gets involved with a train robbery with the gang. Jesse James takes a liking to Ford, but Frank James (Sam Shepard) doesn't trust the kid. Bob Ford quickly becomes a member of Jesse James' gang, rising up the ranks and just happy to be with his idol. The gang act like as an extended family to James, even living with his wife and family. Sometimes Jesse James goes off on his own, and leave the gang with his family. But within the gang there are problems, Bob Ford doesn't get on with other members and some of the member even planned to capture James and give him over to the authorities for money. The gang take the mick out of Bob for his hero worship and this leads to him threaten them. The gang splits up and James derides Bob, forcing him to leave. Bob leaves the gang and plans his revenge. He sees that James wasn't a hero and ends up going to the authorities and works with them. With his brother Charley (Sam Rockwell), plan to kill Jesse James.This is a wonderfully acted, beautifully shot film. Brad Pitt is a great actor most of the time and this film offers one of his strongest performances. This is a rare performance as a villain and shows Jesse James as a psychotic thug. Casey Affleck is also excellent as the creepy Bob Ford. The film also has excellent performances from by Rockwell, Paul Schneider, Jeremy Renner and Mary-Louise Parker (an actress I really like). It also has a surprising performance by the Raging Cagan James Carville who is famous for being Bill Clinton's election adviser.The director of the film was Andrew Dominik, an New Zealand born Australian. This is his first film since the excellent Chopper. With his cinematographer Roger Deakins shot the film with a slightly wash-out look that gives the film a beautiful, but bleak view of the Old-West. A scene which shots Jesse James hand going along with grain blowing in the wind reminded me a little of Gladiator, which isn't surprising seeing Ridley Scott was a producer.The Assassination of Jesse James takes a psychological approach, and looks at the relationship within the group and between the character. It was an extended family. There is no glamour in their criminal lives and Jesse James slowly melt's down as a character. It also looks at the theme of hero worship and how meeting your heroes may not be that rewarding. It takes to take a realistic approach to the Old West. If you want an action-packed film then you are going to be disappointed.Unforuanately the film does have some problems. It is slow at times which makes the film drag. It also reminded me too much of Unforgiven, which was a classic. It was also easy to get lost with the amount of characters and the deals that were made.It's a fine 4 out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Best This Historian Has Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being an historian sometimes makes it hard for me to watch a film and just enjoy it without finding faults with this and that. This film is one with which I can find no fault.More than that, it is "elegiac" -- poetry in scudding clouds and stunning sunsets, acting that ranges from raw to reserved. The cast is excellent. Unlike other films on Jesse James, this one does not glorify him nor does it focus on the exploits that made him famous. The movie picks up after the end of the James-Younger Gang in the twilight years as a harsh post-war world crashed down on the old time outlaws.This is more the story of Robert Ford and how hero-worship turned to bitterness. He was the Mark Chapman of his day, driven to kill the man he idolized in order to take his place.From all I can tell this film is historically accurate and well worth watching.</fullReview>

One of the saddest movie one can watch however. Irony really makes this film what it is. Brad Pitt does an amazing job yet again, but from my point of view Casey Afflack is stunningly brilliant. His character is played so perfectly that you cannot fathom the greatness of this role. By my opinion, and you can disagree, Casey is a far better actor than his brother Ben. I love Ben Afflack, but this role proves Casey's undeniable talent. What will drive you even more insane is that fact that it all is a true story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Shooting of an Olde Worlde Epic by a New World Filmmaker.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This classical western draws us into 1800s Americana so richly that we feel our teeth rotting from lack of dentistry not invented yet.Written and directed by Andrew Dominik (from a book by Ron Hansen), THE ASSASSINATION OF JESSE JAMES BY THE COWARD ROBERT FORD is a study in authenticity; the set dressing, weaponry, music, the arcane vernacular of the characters, even the wordy title itself transports us back to grainy film and honky-tonk pianos, thrusting us bodily into the grimy, wild, paranoid frontier that was romanticized beyond its harsh reality.Dominik's photoplay is a deconstruction and a rambling paean to a bygone era. And way too long for the iPod generation...Jesse James (foreboding Brad Pitt) is already a legend when we meet him. Nineteen year old, Robert Ford (whining Casey Affleck) is obsessed with everything Jesse, collecting and poring over every dimestore paperback featuring the outlaw, now starstruck that he rides with the man himself. Vouched for by his brother Charley (Sam Rockwell), Robert comes onboard a ragtag new James Gang assembled for one last job by Jesse and brother Frank (mighty Sam Shepard).Even Jesse senses there is something peculiar about Robert's hero worship: "I can't figure it out: Do you wanna be like me - or do you wanna be me?" A tragic, insecure, yet dangerously ambitious runt, Robert Ford wants the fame that riding alongside the infamous Jesse James will bring. When the gang fragments and Robert finds himself still a nobody, he sees one last stab at fame in being Jesse James's assassin.A narrator lifts passages directly from the Ron Hansen book that inspired the film. Not only is there an ancient poetry in the words: "...and the omens promised bad luck which moated and dungeoned him," the accompanying scenes look like 1800s photographs, with anamorphic lenses blurring the edges of the screen. There is so much detailed thought that has gone into making this movie experience an ancient wonder that-- --it is almost a pain to watch! You heard me, Movie Aficionado. ASSASSINATION OF JESSE JAMES seems to come at us through a time warp from the 1800s, as every aspect that elevates it also detracts from its "modern" enjoyment. It might be called "controlled direction" but we can also say that events unfold in this movie with the rapidity of swimming through tar; we can call it challenging to listen to the olde worlde vernacular, but most of the time, it is ear-strain, and I had to turn on the English subtitles ("for the hearing impaired" ? that always gets me!) if I was ever to decipher their jargon: "I'll say, How come an off-scouring of creation like you is still sucking air when so many of mine are in coffins? I'll say, How did you get to reach your 20th birthday without leaking out all over your clothes? And if I don't like his attitude, I will slit that phildoodle so deep he will flop on the floor like a fish!" Without subtitles, you ask yourself, "Did he just say what I thought he said?"ASSASSINATION OF JESSE JAMES is very successful at creating the paranoia of Jesse and all those around him, Jesse unceremoniously killing ex-gang members if he caught a whiff of betrayal in the air. He may have been the prettiest of the gang, but he was also the most unbalanced, prone to mood swings that would make a high maintenance girlfriend look almost sane.Though the film's title suggests Jesse James was an honorable man betrayed, we realize its irony in the film's depiction of Jesse as a wary coward himself, so paranoid that he would stoop to any lengths to stay one step ahead of the law or the people who might betray him, not averse to torturing young boys for information or shooting friends in the back.This is not a shoot-em-up western, yet all the violence is sudden and unflinching, therefore more dreadful than the glamorized violence we've grown inured to. The realism of the guns sounding like cap pistols and head-smacks sounding like bone on meat makes us realize how much fantasy we've been listening to all these years, from the cannon reports of FISTFUL OF DOLLARS to the wet-towel punches of any John Wayne west-fest.On April 3, 1882, Robert Ford shot Jesse James in the back of the head. Jesse was not wearing his guns.For a while, Robert Ford seemed to get what he wanted, as he became more recognizable than the president, touring with a stage play recreating Jesse's final moments, with his brother Charley playing Jesse and Robert reprising his own ignominious role.Only after Jesse's death do we realize this tale is Ford's point of view, as the movie continues for another half hour in a world where Jesses James is dead. Robert's star would rise in the aftermath of the killing, only to plummet as the Legend of Jesse James grew into romanticized pulp.By the time Robert Ford was shot down himself for being the "coward who shot Jesse James" - by a nobody named Edward O'Kelly - his spirit was at such a low ebb that he welcomed it.An ambitious movie, with power names on the production credits: David Valdes (UNFORGIVEN), Brad Grey (THE DEPARTED), Ridley Scott (AMERICAN GANGSTER), and Brad Pitt himself; DP Roger Deakins (NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN); music by Nick Cave - even a cameo by Clinton dogsbody, James Carville, playing an iron-fisted governor, of all things. Andrew Dominik brings back epic, emotional film-making to this world stunted with Transformers and Iron Men.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jesse James is the mot well known outlaw in America. He's a wanted man who lives under a pseudonym and never stays for too long in one place. There's not a single soul that hasn't heard about his courage and bravery or the stories of his robberies.Robert Ford idolizes Jesse James since his childhood collecting everything related to Jesse and dreaming about being more like him or even being him someday.Robert finally meets Jesse but keeps getting teased and even tough he wants to join Jesse's gang he's never taken seriously.Robert gradually becomes resentful of Jesse and when he finally joins the gang he ends up killing Jesse(with Jesse's consent as I see it)... The Assassination Of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford tries to humanize and de-mythologize Jesse James and at the same time show who Robert Ford truly was. Jesse was not really a hero and Ford was not an evil person.Both are often perceived as something they were not. This is a beautiful movie. The musical score was perfect and matched the overall atmosphere of the film.Both Oscar nominations were well deserved, the film is hauntingly beautiful and Casey Affleck performance was truly fantastic.Obviously Brad Pitt was amazing as well and you should know he co-produced the film.A great film. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excited about the most notorious outlaw</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE ASSASSINATION OF JESSE JAMES BY COWARD ROBERT FORD This is a movie based on true story. The movie was made in 2007. The director is Andrew Dominik. Brad Pitt plays as Jesse James, and Casey Affleck plays as Robbert Ford. Jesse James is the first person who is famous as a outlaw in the end of 19c in the U.S. He is called legend. He is not only a offender, but a hero. He lived by his own rule. He is a object of awe and admiration. Robert Ford, who adores Jesse James joins Jesse James, the most notorious gang in the West. However, he is gradually afraid of Jesse James. He has two emotions, yearning and terror. The film is based the novel by Ron Hansen. There are lots of books written and tales about Jesse James, but those never strike to the heart of him. The Assassination of Jesse James delves for the private of Jesse James and what may have happened in the months before the shooting. In Japan, it didn't get into a news. However, I really like it! The actors are wonderful! Brad Pitt is so cool. Everyone must know it already but, honestly I was not interested in him so much before watching this movie. Now, I am crazy about him. He doesn't have much lines, but he plays faithfully as Jesse James who is a great presence. Moreover, Casey Afleck is also a great actor. He won lots of awards for a supporting actor. I was surprised that he was good to play as Robert Ford who had rip current. The movie is long, but it isn't boring. There aren't so much lines but I enjoy reading those characters' feelings. But, only bad thing is the Japanese title, "The Assassination of Jesse James." I think "By Coward Robert Ford" is also important part, because the fact that Robert Ford kills Jesse James is premise, so its highlight is what may have happened in the months before the shooting. I wanted to know its premise before watching the movie.Anyway, the story is very interesting. You also had better know about the most notorious out law in the U.S. ever.</fullReview>

In the course of the film it manages to make you feel for Jesse and above all quite unexpectedly Robert though they are all in all not very likable characters. Here Jesse James is not a hero and Robert Ford is not coward ? How the movie makes you realize that in an almost slinking, Robert-Ford-kind-of way, is the wonder of this film about, well yes, just two mortal human beings like we all are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Time capsule (or closet) from a bygone age</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is a slow-moving western. This in itself is unusual ? westerns tend to be action pieces. The denouement is given away in the title, so there is no waiting to see how it will end. Instead, we are invited to spend over two and half hours examining the whys and wherefores. These are fairly involved but not inscrutable: Jesse James is hero-worshipped (almost homoerotically) by the rather limp wristed Robert Ford. Robbie joins the big man's band of bad guys, eventually gets fed up, and ends up shooting him in the back. End of story.It is one of those films billed as 'a psychological study'. Indeed, apart from some very nice photography, there is little else to study. Fortunately, Casey Affleck is up to the job and managed to make me squirm with every softly-delivered phrase. Jesse (Brad Pitt), on the other hand is macho, tough and straight (at least as low-down dirty, thievin', murderin' crooks go). And Jesse is brave. Robbie isn't. But Robbie would like the fame and adulation that goes with being brave.It is films like this that make Warhol's Lonesome Cowboys so hilarious. What do men, with strong sexual urges, no women, and cooped up with each other for hours and months in the wild west, do? Well, they discover their inner gay and have sex. Simple. So write a love story where sex just isn't gonna happen and you get enough psychoses to spin a nice yarn, some highly dysfunctional lives (it's based on a true story), or nearly three hours in the cinema.Pitt calls the film an 'anatomy of an assassination.' On that level, it is quite effective and recalls many a film noir where we have to work out why the victim was really killed. It's also a good example of how a common criminal can get to be portrayed as a dashing rogue ? a persona many murderers, from serial killers to perpetrators of high-school massacres, possibly buy into. If this is a plus point of the film, the documentary-like way it is shot adds much. Great effort has gone into making even small details as authentic as possible and we genuinely feel as if we are glimpsing through a window into history. But I suspect that not everyone will have the patience to sit at this particular window that long.I have been at pains to point out that there is much to admire in this movie. Great acting, wonderful cinematography, and an eye for realism. But frankly, I'm pleased he shot him. Another hour and I would want to shoot them both.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superior film will not be popular</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After leaving the theater and wondering how much I really liked (or disliked) what I had just seen, I came to the conclusion I would have to sleep on it first.After 24 hours, I couldn't get the images out of my mind as I replayed some of the scenes over and over again.One sure sign of a superior movie, in my opinion, is whether or not it makes you think, and then, think some more.The problem with most movie-goers is that they'd rather be extravagantly entertained than encouraged to think. And so, this will not be a popular movie. It will though, engender a strong group of loyal fans and will probably hit cult status in short time.Familiarity with the Jesse James story is not a necessity to enjoy the beautiful craftsmanship that was put into making this film, but it may help with understanding some of the motives behind the lawlessness that was the James gang, and their hatred for the railroads and why they were (at least at first) looked upon as a sort of modern day Robin Hood and his merry men.Yes, the movie is tad long (the only reason I didn't give it a 10), but it is deliberately paced punctuated by short bursts of disturbing violence, accompanied by a brilliant film score.The cinematography and sound editing are top notch all the way. Highly recommended for those who like to think.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fair on history; sloppy on characterization</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not brilliant, but a decent watch. It takes a docu-drama approach, so don't expect a scintillating shoot 'em up western. Neither is it a very accurate analysis in its historic character portrayals. Jesse James was an infamous outlaw, not the Messiah. Robert Ford was a traitorous outlaw, not a Poindexter computer nerd type with too much mousse in his hair. The other Ford was also an outlaw, not Mickey Mouse.Other than character development, this period piece is constructed with superior attention to detail of the era. The chronology of historical events is correct. The acting is mixed: some expert, others lazy. Mary Louise Parker is best, in a powerfully emotional yet minor role. Unfortunately, it makes it even more obvious some of the performances were walk-throughs. Casey Affleck (Robert Ford) renders his many colliding emotions well, but Brad Pitt pretty much plays himself. Never did he become Jesse James in this film. In one scene, he does a psychotic laugh that sounds forced and lame.The narration is garbled and inaudible, to anyone except a bat, maybe. You'll need to enable the sub titles to find out what is being mumbled, to avoid missing significant information. Also, the film runs longer than necessary; a lot of stuff we see in the developmental stage is worthless padding.On the up side, the atmosphere is appropriately somber throughout. The choreography is imbued with deep colors that properly maintain the theme. The tension of the Ford/James "friendship" plays out well on the screen. The music supports the mood and objective, and even someone who knows nothing about Jesse James will learn some facts about him.More a docu-drama than a western or a history piece, the film has its share of strengths and weaknesses. Overall, worth a rental when you have nothing else to do.</fullReview>

Affleck more than deserved his Academy Award nomination, and I believe he would have won if the film had been more successful. I can only surmise that those disappointed with this film expected an action-oriented shoot'em up Western, and not a brooding character piece. The films slow pace may bore some viewers, but I enjoyed it. I compare it to a cross between a Terrence Malick film and Deadwood. The film doesn't glorify the west, instead it shows it as dirty and brutal. This is definitely one of Pitt's top performances. For those interested, I also recommend Bruce Springsteen's version of the classic song (title of the film).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a profound cinematic masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a profound cinematic masterpiece. To me, it is best seen as social commentary, a critique of a democracy/free society star system. In a democracy, the way people distinguish themselves is by attempting to become a star, a hero, a celebrity.Jesse James was a celebrity, played by Brad Pitt, a star. Robert Ford was a non-entity, a confused youth, played by Casey Affleck, a fine actor but not a star (yet). The movie focuses on the star's inability to live a real life--he doesn't know what's real and what isn't. Is he a star? Do the people around him believe he's really a star? Can he trust anybody around him? Is he forced into paranoia? The movie portrays Jesse James as a victim of his own stardom. His doubt and distrust of the people around him are equivalent to doubting his own worth. He has become so distrustful of what is real that he is paranoid, depressed, and at least borderline suicidal. His death is shown as in part a suicide, but more importantly as an attempt to find the reality of his life. Is he a genuine hero--that is, does the confused Robert Ford really worship him? or is Jesse a fraud--that is, is Robert Ford so filled with envy that he's willing to murder Jesse? For Jesse, there's only one way to find out.Jesse James's predicament is depicted in the movie as a central paradox of free and open democratic societies. What's real? Who are the heroes? Doesn't the implied but nevertheless real hierarchy of the star system twist and destroy democracy in a profound way, so that it becomes very difficult for citizens in a democracy to distinguish the true and the false, or to uphold real values? Do democracies self-destruct as they morph into a star system? Movie stars and other celebrities (Lady Di? John Dillinger?) would love this movie for its depiction of their predicament, and their society's predicament.These profound themes make the movie heavy, but they also make it a classic thinking person's movie. It's an epic, and a great one. Cinematography, acting, and screenplay are all great. Directing was very good but flawed--the movie could have been faster paced, and with less mumbling. But it's nit-picking to point out flaws in a movie as great as this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gorgeous, complex western with wonderful acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally, I watched one of the movies I've always wanted to see, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. This film, directed by Andrew Dominik, is a poetic, beautifully shot masterpiece of a Western, with great psychological depth -- and one of my new all-time favorites. The characters feel real, not black and white, heroes or villains, but like actual people. Brad Pitt's (at last) excellent as Jesse James, the legendary outlaw who's losing his grip, health and skill (and perhaps mind, too), and sees an opportunity for an escape and an honorary way out in his young, unbalanced admirer, Robert Ford (always wonderful Casey Affleck). Jesse manipulates him skillfully and when Bob Ford, disillusioned and abandoned, walks away, only to return later (as the movie's title suggests), are all his moves and emotions orchestrated by Jesse. This is a film with quite a few surprises, with spellbinding cinematography, and with a very ironic title... as in the end, it's not Bob Ford who's the coward at all. At the same time, it's also a chilling tale of hero worship and its dangers -- something that Pitt himself must have had a brush with, in the form of stalkers.All in all, one can't but feel pity for the young Robert Ford who longs to be with Jesse, and when that fails, hopes to be him. Just seeing the calculating looks Jesse gives him send chills down one's spine. Bob Ford is, quite simply, corrupted by the older man, and along the way, he loses his innocence and his soul, while granting Jesse James immortality and the heroic death he always wanted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One great movie...Simply great!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, when i watched this movie I knew nothing about Jesse James or Robert Ford and to tell you the truth I was a bit hesitating to see it for some reasons...Well i was totally wrong! The result: I was amazed!!!The movie is great, beautiful soundtrack and a breathtaking cinematography to start with...The direction is very original and Brad Pitt is just superb for the role of Jesse James!By the way, i really think he deserved at least a nomination for this one..On the other hand Mr Casey Affleck is also great too!he does a brilliant job as Robert Ford.This movie might not be for everyone but if you want to see something interesting and different or explore new things this is your chance!Even those who know the story of Jesse James and watch the movie I think they will too find it great! The reason..? Simply the movie has many levels and from my point of view it accomplishes a lot. The emotions evolve beautifully during the movie and the characters give you so much to explore and wonder about..It is a very artistic film and if you give it a chance you're gonna love it! 10/10 simply great!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lovingly Made But Frankly Rather Tedious ? for a Theatre Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rent The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford when you have a whole evening to spare and an entire bottle of wine to drink. I'm not saying it's a bad movie ? it's not, it's pretty good ? but it doesn't have a great deal of action and it's overly long, for a theatre movie. I understand it has been lovingly gleaned from the pages of a biography of James by Robert Hansen, but somewhere along the line the director and producers lost sight of what makes the difference between a good read and a good view. Or perhaps it's just that this would have worked better as a 3 episode TV mini series than as an almost three hour movie? It's the medium which is at fault here, not the message.First, let's consider the positives; the cinematography is superb, there's no doubt about that. The whole enterprise is wonderfully filmed. The sets look authentic, the cold winter scenes look genuinely chilly, the houses are Spartan, the outdoor shots absolutely stunning. Ten out of ten for cinematography. Then there are the period details; the costumes and the accents look and sound spot on. In fact the latter are so good that occasionally I was straining to catch the dialog and had to hit the 'back' button on the DVD player to listen again to a line of speech. The performances are all very good, and the script is fine ? or perhaps it's more accurate to say that it would be fine if this were a 3 episode mini series. Given that it was released to be seen in theatres, the script could have done with some pruning and tightening. This is very close to being that personal bete noir of mine - the 'Depends' movie (and you'll have to read some of my other reviews to find out what a 'Depends' movie is.) And that brings us to the negatives; the movie is too long and too slow for all but the most dedicated fans. It's also almost exclusively a Boys Club, with the women playing very small bit parts on the periphery. That may well be an accurate representation of how women lived back then, on the periphery of the men's world, but to keep the interest of a mixed age, modern audience in a 21st century movie theatre, some effort could have been made to make the women slightly more visible, even on a domestic level. I tend to get tired pretty quickly of watching taciturn men doing manly things, even when well acted and basically factual.The actual story, of the killing of James (Brad Pitt) by Ford (Casey Affleck), is interesting and well presented, we get the full psychological picture of the younger man, an over confident under achiever if ever there was one, smitten with his hero then, after the ultimate betrayal and shooting, sliding into a life of parody and gutlessness before being shot himself - in an act of poetic justice perhaps? The James Brothers were described as Confederate guerrillas during the Civil War. After the war they took to plain old fashioned robbery; Robin Hood they were not. The movie follows the last few months of James' life from meeting Ford until the killing. We see James living life on the edge, a family man trying to blend into polite society when not out bank robbing and holding up trains, but being chased by the Pinkerton Agency, and becoming increasingly ruthless, paranoid and depressed, killing in cold blood, but constantly watching his back ? literally ? waiting to see which of his gang would turn him in, and picking them off one by one as the Feds move in.It's a good story and it's well made. It's just not a theatre experience ? it's a TV mini series. But of course if it had been made as a TV mini series, we wouldn't have seen Brad Pitt in the starring role, would we?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>epic stories need not be painfully long</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hope that director Dominik takes this advice. The 2 hours and 40 minutes length is the principal problem of this 'Jesse James' screen story. It is not difficult to imagine a shorter version of this film and you get a much better one.The very good news are Casey Affleck. Dare I say he is a better actor than his elder and more famous brother? Yes, I dare. I could not identify for a long time Ben Affleck in the crowd. Casey is both resembling physically to Ben, but also has a personality that strikes at first sight. His acting as Robert Ford, the young, fascinated and treacherous killer of outlaw Jesse James is deep and emotional. He matches the much more experienced Brad Pitt, who is giving himself an outstanding performance as the charismatic and suspicious Jesse James at the end of his criminal career and life.It is really a pity that the director having created the good acting and beautiful cinematography of the film seems to have become so much in love with his own creation that he did not want to leave out anything. What resulted is a full two hours which are becoming repetitive, a lot of characters that look and behave too much of the same just to come down under the bullets of a Jesse who understands he cannot trust anybody any longer. Surprisingly it is the last 20 minutes which avoid the film from becoming a more complete bore with the story of what happened to the killer after the assassination. The too long elegy until that point is balanced with a condensed and expressive epilogue. In most other films this post-ending would occupy just one scene of half minute. Here it saves the dayIt is interesting to see a non-American director in charge with such an American film and story. Dominik brings the fresh view that takes out of routine a genre as the Western. If only he could have resisted the temptation of making the film long as an American screen saga.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jesse James - Hero or Outlaw?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What you have to first realise is that I am an avid movie fan - I have watched thousands of movies in my lifetime and as time works I have developed an astute sense of films - Whats good and simply whats bad. It is for this reason that I found myself utterly shocked after my first viewing of Jesse James. This is a film, not merely created as a cowboy similar to that of a fistfull of dollars or any of the new, more modern western flicks, this is a film of utter poetry.What works best for the film is its drama; make no mistakes, there are moments where you find yourself immersed in the film, to the extent in which you feel you are witnessing events as they take place - Another element, that of unpredictability is capitulated in Pitt's performance of Jesse and also Ford and the moment when he hopes to transcend the typical twenty year old stereotype - essentially, when is he going to kill Jesse? Moreover, the lighting and setting of this movie combined with the perfectly appropriate soundtrack and narrative are simply awe inspiring - this is a film truly made for cinema, coming with aces in all respects.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is amazing.It radiates with excellent performances and it's own unique geniousity.There is no flaw in this movie.The screenplay is great,acting is great,direction is great,acting is great,production is great,....I really can't find the flaw in it.All i can think of writing is what's good in it so i'll just say what's the best thing in my opinion...It's character developing.The character developing is masterfully written in screenplay and masterfully portraited by actor's,especially by Brad Pitt and Casey Afleck!The entire movie actually follow's the story of Robert Ford and his fear respectful obsession with Jesse James.Now as we can see at the beginning of the movie it's clearly that Jese is his personal hero.He believes that Jese is the best gunfighter ever and that frightens him since he asumes that Jese is gonna kill him and the rest of the gang so they couldn't turn him in.The same opinion the other's share.Anyway,Jesse takes him under his wing and that's when the real trouble start's because pretty soon Jesse start's to believe that they might try to kill him even though he still hold's on to his cold blooded look.To short the story...This movie is not a regular western movie like bam,bam everyones dead.No,this is as i already said a piece of art.Which means that it goes really,really slow.It's mostly based on the mental condition of Robert and the rest of the gang since they assume that the best gunman ever is planing on killing them.They start to panic,they can't sleep,they always threat each other's,...and so on....Another great thing is that you don't really know,until the end is Jesse really trying to kill them all or not.That's one of the many thing's that will keep you on the chair through this movie.I watched this movie for like thousand times already and it's a masterpiece if you ask me.However it's not for everyone.Just like There Will Be Blood for example.It's the same kind of movie.If you like one of them,you like both of them.Anyway to end with my comment on this movie i will just say that i think that it's a movie that has to be watched,if not for the movie it self then because of the cast!Enjoy!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robert Ford, One of the Most Loathed Men in all of American Folklore?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the film a little while ago, so some of my memories are foggy. What I do remember is that the movie was interesting enough that I started doing research on the internet after watching the film. Sure, I've heard of Jesse James, but not many solid facts were floating up in my noggin.Brad Pitt plays a solid Jesse James: frightening, off kilter, somewhat mentally unbalanced, and terrified of losing his power. His strategy is to keep those under him unsure of what he will do next. He thrives on having men around him who fear him. He keeps Robert Ford around him longer than others because Ford fears him and also idol worships him.Casey Affleck as Robert Ford is amazing. Casey is Ben's younger brother and usually plays the village idiot. His first role I recall is playing the underling to Matt Damon and Ben Affleck in Good Will Hunting. And he reprises this type of character as one of the two getaway drivers in the Ocean's 11, 12, and 13 movies. In this film, although he still plays someone's doormat, he is underestimated by those around him.At the beginning, we see the last big hurrah of the James brothers. The older brother seems to sense that his retirement is well advised at this time. After a disaster of a robbery (Jesse hesitates before killing a man), the older brother decides to live out a law abiding life. Jesse feels somewhat abandoned until he spots Robert Ford, who begs to be allowed to join his band. Jesse doesn't exactly take a liking to the kid, but he seems to need him for this time. He senses Ford's obsession with him with a patient, but distant, disdain.Several mini-plots come up, which are all well done, but the film is really about Ford's transition from almost in love with James to becoming his murderer. The transition is slow but complete. Ford plays a Judas type killer. He knows it has to be done, but he's guilty about it.SPOILERS*** I found the last part of the film to be the most intriguing. After the death, Ford experiences a brief time of being a hero. He is photographed by the dead corpse. He is even asked to repeat the incident on stage in a play. Although the law had been after Jesse James for years, he was an icon. You will have to decide for yourself why Ford becomes one of the most loathed characters in all of American history. Was it that fact that he killed James in a coward's way by shooting him in the back? Was it because America considered James to be a hero and not a villain? Was it because James was smooth, suave and handsome and Ford was awkward and clumsy? I found myself feeling sorry for Ford.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will keep this short, but for the people who dislike this movie its OK because you probably have ADHD. This movie is not a fast pace shoot 'em up western. It is truly for people who love the meaning of cinema, the art of cinema. Its a gripping story that captivates you from its performances; that are Oscar worthy, to its beautiful soundtrack, to its beautiful cinematography which is also notably Oscar worthy. This is what the true meaning of film making is about. The only thing that disappointed me about the film was the lack of attention it received. If you bore easily or have the attention span of a 5 year old then this movie isn't for you. If not I strongly advise you to give this film a chance, stay open minded and try to appreciate it for what it is and that is art, not an all to often seen piece of mainstream Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very fine piece of art.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is such a welcome break from the usual that I had to pause and give praise. The lengthy title of the movie essentially explains the plot, a synopsis of events leading up to the assassination of Jesse James. The title character at this point has become somewhat of a tragic Shakespearean hero, full of doubt and fear, and his mind full of questions as to the loyalty of his minions. Pitt's performance is admirable, probably his best yet and I have much admiration as well for Casey Affleck as Robert Ford, who effectively conveys a young man who loses respect for his idol as he grows closer to him.The real star of the movie in my mind, is the cinematographer, Roger Deakins, who use of subtle lighting, panoramic views of the Canadian prairies and the occasional blurred filters to convey a dreamlike quality when necessary. If I had one fault with the movie it would be that the poetic musings of these romanticized outlaws can be sometimes hard to make out clearly, but it is a small fault and it gives me good reason to watch it again, which I will very soon. Brad Pitt and Ridley Scott are to be commended for taking a hand in producing this lovely bit of cinema, it is not going to be a big money maker but certainly a work that all who were involved with must be very proud of. I always wonder if the western will ever become a genre that will run out of steam due to a sense of it's all been done now. After watching this, I can say that the western may never die as a genre. Absolutely beautiful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A breakthrough in western film-making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An absolute masterpiece, and a breakthrough in western film-making that creates a unique experience as it captures the story of Jesse James poetically and intricately. Every single shot in the film is gorgeous in it's own way, providing the audience with intriguing dream-like images throughout the entire film, and truly capturing the raw and natural beauty of western civilization.Although the narration seems to be criticized by some, and is believed to tell the audience what they can already see, I believe it does an excellent job of creating a story-like atmosphere which is entirely necessary in the context of the film. We are watching a movie that is presenting the life of Jesse James in the format of a past-tense story, although the narration is not boring and does not have a Discovery Network blandness to it. It rather suits the content and is full of depth.Every scene is given the perfect amount of time that allows the audience to study all of the characters thoughts and emotions, it allows every single stare to be taken into account and examined fully. Andrew Dominik has complete faith in his actors to explore the characters intently with silence and gestures. Every single performance is impressive, beginning with Brad Pitt's complete embodiment of a mysterious, terrifying man and Pitt's every single small mannerism communicates to the audience more than any dialog. Casey Affleck's portrayal of a neurotic and obsessive coward is entirely natural and subtly creepy. Every single small role is played perfectly as well, with honorable mentions to Paul Schneider, Sam Rockwell, Jeremy Renner and Mary-Louise Parker.A perfect western that rises above the generally action-packed genre and studies a complex man on a quiet yet epic scale. A truly brilliant film that allowed every detail necessary to explore the tale in its fullness and stylistically portrays the story as a true piece of art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Assassination Of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford currently ranks as my #3 of 2007.A film that has many things to admire. The acting, the direction, the cinematography, the score.Brad Pitt is very good playing Jesse James. Not my favorite performance of his, but a strong performance.Casey Affleck absolutely shines in this film. Not only he gave the best performance in the film, he gave one of the best performances in the history of cinema. His portrayal of Robert Ford is nothing short of brilliant. The subtlety, the facial expressions, the mannerisms, the cracking of the voice. A performance that was rightfully praised and received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor (and should have won, in my opinion).The rest of the cast does a very good job. I'll highlight Sam Rockwell, who was amazing in the supporting role of Charley Ford.The direction is impeccable, and the beautiful and astounding cinematography becomes another character in the film.The score is, along with the score of Atonement, my favorite of 2007. Absolutely beautiful and haunting music that fits perfectly with the visual style of the film.Overall, one of the most important films of the 21st century. An amazing display of acting and visual style.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lyrical, crushingly atmospheric revisionist western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Few films of the calibre of The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford emerge within the cinema these days - after all, it is difficult to envision a slow, thoughtful western with a running time as ponderously lengthy as its title being an easy sell to studios who it would seem have primarily lost interest in the genre in the first place - a fact the film's continual failure to pick up a distributor despite the presence of mega-star Brad Pitt is a testament to. But at the same time it is difficult to imagine a more compelling justification for the re-emergence of dusty trails and six-shooters than this one - an astonishingly powerful, engrossing and impeccably crafted modern masterpiece, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is a breath of cinematic fresh air, and one of the most impacting films released in recent memory. Director/screenwriter Andrew Dominik has crafted a modern day epic of near unparalleled mood, the sparse script providing a lyrical, crushingly atmospheric revisionist western, musing on fatalism, celebrity worship, madness and the construction of a legend in a truly gripping, inescapably thought provoking fashion. While the film's staggering running time and slow pacing will be enough to deter many viewers unaccustomed to such genre conventions, the film's consistently claustrophobic fatalistic overtones, like a steadily tightening glove, and sporadic, casual bursts of visceral violence make for a taught and engrossing watch throughout its lengthy duration. The film is hardly intended to boast an M. Night Shyamalan style twist, its most impacting plot point revealed within the title, but is instead a treatise on fatalism, and the overpowering, inescapable mood continually palpable throughout is truly crushing and stunning simultaneously. As Roger Deakins' exquisitely composed cinematography haunts the viewer with desolate visions of a withering west (the sequence of the last ever train robbery by James' gang is a moodily beautiful masterpiece in itself), Nick Cave and Warren Ellis' eerily affecting score craft a mood like none other, fully immersing the viewer within the nihilistic realm of the film and wrenching their emotions while flooring them with the impeccable craftsmanship of the work on display. Staunchly driving home the resonance of the film is its powerful cast, each giving a masterfully heartfelt performance simultaneously making the material ring with realism and simmer with incendiary intensity. Brad Pitt inhabits the fragile, world weary psyche of the legendary titular character with pitch perfect muted ferocious charisma, impeccably essaying a character inevitably on the decline while feebly grasping at trace elements of his previous infamy. Behind Pitt's glimmering blue eyes lies the haunted glint of madness, and a single moment, where James lets escape a delirious cackle of a maddened laugh is the film's single most gripping and devastating moment - one of the most full bodied, masterful performances the genre has ever generated. As astonishing as Pitt's performance is, Casey Affleck manages to match him on almost every occasion as the similarly psychologically fragile Robert Ford, toeing the perfect balance between unnerving fanaticism and eerie resentment towards his idol James. However, Affleck refuses to let the audience dismiss Ford as an imbalanced mental case, and bestows enough fractured humanity after a life of rejection within the character to make his performance ring frighteningly sympathetic, a testament to the incredible talent of the rising star. Sam Rockwell also stands out, giving a subtle but powerfully resonant performance as Ford's older brother, Charley, shining in what might have dissipated into a non-existent supporting role in the hands of a less talented performer. Paul Schneider similarly impresses as an oddly verbose outlaw attempting to escape James' gang, and Sam Shepard is a powerful presence as James' older brother, radiating calm fury and muted power ever second on screen. Haunting, resonant and tremendously moving, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford sticks with the viewer for quite some time after its initial viewing. While those unaccustomed with the western genre may find the same faults here as with the majority of its contemporaries, the sheer emotional resonance, muted technical beauty and astonishing performances are enough to buoy the film into the realm of the most powerful and affecting modern westerns, and one of the strongest films of many years past, easily worth pursuing for those seeking a numbingly powerful modern masterpiece. -9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A heartbreaking study of hero worship and it's consequences</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been a long time since a film brought tears to my eyes, not just for the emotional finish (which it has), but rather for the sheer joy of watching a true work of art. From the first frame to the last, I was spellbound by the sheer beauty of this study of two men, one a sociopath outlaw, the other a naive young man who worships him. Under the sure hand of director Andrew Dominck, the film takes it's time to tell it's story and this may be a problem for those who like fast cuts (I'd be surprised if the release on DVD contains more that a thousand shots). It is best to just surrender yourself to the film and be taken into it's beautifully photographed world.The music is haunting and deserved a nomination and if awards were handed out for voice overs and narration this would be the winner.The acting is top notch, with Brad Pitt as Jesse James notching a career high, in a performance that is both poetic and frighteningly cold. But it's Casey Affleck to whom the film belongs to. He may have been a best supporting actor in the eyes of the Academy Awards but it's really a best actor performance. Where other films have gotten it wrong in the depiction of Robert Ford is that they have made him a cartoon, while here we have a human being with all the failings and yearnings of someone who gets what he wants only to have it all fall apart. It is for this reason that the ending is, without giving anything away, emotionally wrenching.In years to come it is this very film that will stand out as the best film released in 2007. I look forward to the day it will be given the Criterion treatment on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The beautifulest film in the West</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, nothing I write here will be considered a spoiler, as the film does this itself. Unusually, even the title sums up the entire film, and the narration explains the forthcoming actions before they happen. So why bother with a film you know what's going to happen in? The Devil is in the details. The title does not convey the arc of Robert Ford's naive attempts to impress his childhood hero that sour into betrayal. The narration cannot show the strength of acting ability, emotions, tensions or sumptuous cinematography present in every scene. It's ponderous, certainly, but majestic and inexorable with it. The running time seems to melt away as the viewer is absorbed into the world of the charismatic but unstable outlaw and the ambivalent teenager trying to connect with him, until before you know it the arc has reached the conclusion of the stories.The cinematography really does merit special mention, it's no surprise the amount of awards this film has garnered. The landscapes are lush, the scenes are all beautiful and authentic, and there is such an eye for art that it will take your breath away. Possibly the most stunning is the arrival of the train near the beginning of the film, it's one of the finest shots that I've seen in the past year. It's a big film, it's a worthy film, but it's haunting and brilliantly realised, one that I'd hesitate without question to anyone willing to spend their time on it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought that The Assassination Of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford was one of the best movies that Brad Pitt has been in since Seven. This particular film showed off the acting ability that Brad Pitt does possess, portraying one of the most notorious gunfighters in American History: Jesse James. The film showed some of the soft sides of Jesse James that was rarely written about in the newspapers. Jesse James was a family man with two children and had a wife that loved him very much. James was very cautious and would not let people get very close to him. In my book, a true coward would shoot another man in the back. It would be best to have a fair fight and have the better man win the gunfight. Plainly, if you lose, you lose. If you win, you win. Things have a way of coming back around when you have forgotten about the wrongs committed. It is like Clint Eastwood's character said in Unforgiven, "We all got it coming, kid."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes this movie is overlong and ponderous. I am not unsympathetic to the commenter's herein that the movie bored them. But the finer points of Assn. of Jesse James ultimately overcome such. While I can appreciate the observations that this movie intended to show the beginnings of American hero worship, I think this was merely a beneficial side effect. The Oedipal, homo-erotic undertones of the film were so palpable you could almost see them floating on the screen. I didn't read the book and don't know if such was fiction or nonfiction. Accordingly I don't know who to thank but the director and choreographer deserve considerable praise, as do Affleck and Pitt. Not a single actor overdid his/her role. In effect the tone of the movie was perfect. A good example is the various characters' reaction to the shooting death of Jesse's cousin, which was maybe unlike any movie death scene you have ever witnessed. Rather than callous indifference or emotional venting, the survivors remain poised and dignified and behave like people who recognize death as an ordinary aspect of life. As Robert Ford therein remarks, "Lets wish him well on his journey". Personally, I enjoyed the use of the English language, which appeared very carefully crafted to reflect the words, patterns and content circa 1880; e.g., delivered best by Afflect and Sheppard by the railroad at the beginning of the movie. Given the limited commercial viability of Assn. of Jesse James..., we should be grateful the film got made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If "The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford" is to be believed, then surely hell hath no fury like an idol worshipper scorned. And if it isn't, well heck, a little yarn-spinning might not be entirely out of order in a movie that is, by its very nature, a lyrical, haunting and visually stunning elegy to the fabled Old West and the larger-than-life figures who inhabited it.The "idol," in this case, is Jesse James, the notorious outlaw who, even before his death in 1882 at the age of 34, had become a legend in his own time, famous the world over for the many highly publicized robberies and killings he committed all across the American heartland. Indeed, an entire cottage industry of highly romanticized literature (a sensationalized mixture of fact and fiction) had already sprung up around him and the other members of his gang (including his nearly-as-famous brother, Frank). One of those who not only gobbled up the mythology but absorbed it into his soul was a young, self-described "nobody" by the name of Robert Ford, who, at the age of nineteen, finally got the chance to not only meet his childhood hero in person, but to join up with him in what would turn out to be the bandit's final great train robbery. However, disillusionment can come mighty quickly when an idol is revealed to have feet of clay, and when Jesse didn't accord Robert the respect he felt he was entitled to, the one-time sycophant became the gunman's most dangerous nemesis - and the man who would eventually take his life."The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford" is not a traditional shoot-'em-up action picture, but rather a long, deliberative and contemplative mood piece focused on the burdens of "celebrity" and on the need to be a "somebody" in the eyes of the public. In a beautifully understated performance, Brad Pitt portrays James as part ruthless killer and part raving paranoiac, a mentally unbalanced sadist who spends much of his time waging physical as well as psychological warfare on the men he feels have betrayed him (with good reason in some cases). Yet, Pitt allows moments of humanity and tenderness to seep through his otherwise buttoned-down, stoic demeanor. As Ford, Casey Affleck is the true revelation in this film, finding the root of this pipsqueak's incessant need for braggadocio in his low self-esteem and obsessive need for recognition from others. The irony is that Ford's version of "celebrity," when he finally achieves it, is quite different from that of Mr. James - even if their fates take eerily similar paths in the end. These two superb actors are matched in performance by Sam Rockwell, Jeremy Renner and Sam Sheperd, all of whom are excellent in their roles.Using Ron Hansen's novel as his source, writer/director Andrew Dominik has crafted a work that, aesthetically speaking, is nothing short of a cinematic masterpiece, a film in which virtually every shot can stand as its own work of art. Roger Deakins' brilliantly lit, softly filtered cinematography (reminiscent of the work in the similarly themed "The Grey Fox") lends an otherworldly quality to the film, perfect for bringing out the legendary nature of the material. And Nick Cave and Warren Ellis' beautiful and haunting score goes a long ways towards achieving that end as well.From first frame to last, "The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Brown" draws the audience into its beautifully lit world of history and legend - and makes us a part of that world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Majestic Sadness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a lot to be said of a movie whose title dares spoil the punch right from the get go, since in a way in doesn't really. Of course Jesse James ends up assassinated by Robert Ford - just as we knew the Titanic sinks, Marty gets back to the future and Fredo Corleone is a wuss. What it truly spoils though is the irony; History remembers Robert Ford as a sniveling weasel who killed his friend to get famous and rich while Jesse was a Jolly-Golly great guy who loved everyone and never had an evil bone in his body. But the truth, although probably truncated a bit in the film for dramatic purposes, was much more complex, sad and dark.The story picks up Jesse James during his last big job with brother Frank, and a bunch of hired tugs to help out since the original gang members were all either dead or in jail. One of them, Robert Ford, initially tries to become a sidekick to his childhood idol Jesse, only to realize that the myth was much larger and sunnier than the man. As health leaves Jesse while paranoia gains him, both men will lock themselves in crash course with an inevitability that plagues whatever is left or their lives.Many naysayers and critics of the film denounce its length -2 and a half hours- for making it a boring montage of depressing tableaux. Lucky for them the original 4-hour cut was trimmed down for theatrical release, but that's besides the point. Their real beef is that most movie goers were expecting a western, an epic with lush action sequences and great moments of emotional roller coasters. The absence of which is what actually makes it such a piece of art.The very melancholic (and striking) music brings forth and carries a sense of doom and sadness throughout the film, adding to the forbearing narration which puts the viewer on a path to feeling heartbreak for all of its protagonists. With the "mystery" out of the equation, the viewer is allowed to experience the true surprise and discovery - knowing who exactly was Jesse James as a man, what could go through the mind of his killer, what influence did they both have living and dead. Truly majestic editing allows such discoveries and appreciation, even beyond the titular event which isn't the end of the line.All of it would mean nothing without outstanding performances, by all involved. Of course Brad Pitt is Brad Pitt, with all of his usual ticks and mannerism, but the man also carries tremendous charisma which is a trait everyone seems to agree on for the famous outlaw. The true acclaim however goes to his cast-mates, none of them stars or A-listers but each and everyone respected and admirable thespians, bringing much grounded credibility to the project. To be noted among them are Paul Schneider (previously noticed in "Elizabethtown" and "The Family Stone"), Micheal Parks, the always lovely Zooey Deschanel in a blink-and-you'll-miss appearance and even left-wing commentator James Carville as a self-righteous state governor.All of them are however overshadowed by the increasingly amazing Casey Affleck, who brings such a mixed bag of mystery, emotions and empathy to his character or Robert Ford that along with "Gone Baby Gone", little-bro Casey has managed to completely shatter the perception of being nothing else than Big Ben's sibling.A piece of advice - WATCH the movie, in peace and tranquility, without interruption. It is truly one of those epics that deserve such attention to be fully digested and understood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Andrew Dominik's 2007-western is easily one of the most haunting and beautiful western-movies made. Casting Brad Pitt as Jesse James was an inspired choice; he is a haunted man, and Pitt nails his performance with maturity as his underpinned emotions makes it one of his finest performances so far - but even more impressive is Casey Affleck's Robert Ford, a performance worth an Academy Award. THE ASSASSINATION OF JESSE JAMES BY THE COWARD ROBERT FORD is a movie so beautifully shot that every scene is a jaw-drop; carefully structured scenes carries the movie with enormous inspiration as the slow-paced story creates a astonishing craft from the narrated opening to the brilliantly pulled-off ending. The cinematography and Dominik's eye for art makes this a poetic and beautiful western-movie.This is a movie utterly focused on the beauty and romantic aspects of the Wild West, as it in the same time keeps its hands perfectly on its cold, gritty story. Eye-candy doesn't seem as the right word; but this is surely one of the best-looking westerns Hollywood has ever laid their eyes on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very cool, very stylish, a new approach towards the western cowboy movie welcomed back. Those slow train coming scenes just before the symbolically ghostlike gang hop on to what is going to be their last train robbery together by night, those scenes are so marvelously shot and definitely going to remain engrained in my mind as top classic in cinema. Brad Pitt pulls off the role of Jesse James very convincingly predictably and so does the rest of the cast do a great job to give this film an all round quality. I love the color and I love how all throughout the film there is this echoing poetry. The story itself, a sad one, at least here were we seem to be witnessing what appears to be the end of a long Saga between the members of the Jesse James gang. Everybody seems to be splitting. I think Jesse James actually lets Robert Ford hand on out of a sense of nostalgia, due to Ford's youthful thirst for adventure, excitement, all things expiring in Jesse himself. The times they are changing. The Assassination itself does indeed recall those last scenes in the movie "Road to Perdition", the likes of which I think are brilliant to say the least, they are sublime. Then Nick Cave just had to butt in there with the famous song, did he not? This is a great movie, I definitely recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant character study on hero worship.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the novel by Ron Hansen, The Assassination Of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford is a thoughtful, and intelligent movie, looking in the celebrity and hero worship in the so-called Wild West.Robert Ford, played brilliantly by Casey Affleck becomes a member of the gang run by Jesse James (a mesmerizing performance from Brad Pitt) and his brother Frank. As time goes by, Ford becomes a friend of Jesse, who seems to enjoy the worship given to him by Ford. However as time passes, Ford sees the changes in Jesse who is becoming unstable, and has apparently being gunning down members of his own gang. When offered a deal by the law, Ford sees a way out, but has he the courage to do what needs to be done?Directed and written for the screen by Andrew Dominik, the movie takes it's time telling it's story. Although western set, it's not a proper western, in that there is virtually no gunfights and set pieces in the movie. Instead this movie is all about character, and what drives them.Although the main plot detail is giving away within the title, it's also a clever touch. On the face of it, that is what happens. However, as the movie shows, there is much more to the story than simply the gunning down (or assassination) of Jesse James. In fact one of the things the movie shows is what happens after this event, in relation to Robert Ford, and the effect it has on him.The performances from the entire cast are superb, but as mentioned this movie belongs to both Pitt and Affleck. Pitt has shown over the years he can be good with the right material and he's brilliant here.But this is Affleck's movie.Better known, to me anyway, for supporting turns in the likes of the Ocean's 11/12/13 trilogy, here he shows just how good an actor he can be given the right material. With this movie, I think he's perhaps moved his career onto great things.The movie is brilliantly shot by Roger Deakins, showing here, as he did in No Country For Old Men that he is one of the best, if not the best cinematographer working in movies today.Andrew Dominik directs well, allowing the characters and story to breathe. If I had a criticism, then I'd say it is perhaps slightly too long.But that is a minor flaw. This is a fantastic movie, and along with No Country For Old Men has got 2008 off to a fantastic year at the movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Andrew Dominik's film is a poetic and haunting masterpiece. It doesn't matter how big your plasma screen is, you have to see this film in a real theater to truly appreciate it. Visually, it's an amazing sight to behold.I think the entire film could be read as a metaphor for the collective American psyche, both in 1881 and the present day. Like it or not, the US is a nation that was built upon spilt blood and this film embodies that history. It's a film that is both beautiful and brutal at the same time.All of the performances are strong, but Casey Affleck's performance in this film is truly remarkable. He certainly deserves all of the award nominations that he has garnered for this performance.My rating: 10/10 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good acting with a beautiful background</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is contemplative, poetic and not for impatient people. The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford takes its time with every scene. It concentrates on words, images and expressions of the characters. There are lots of long close-ups but the actors manage them well as they also do with their roles in general. The film is full of beautiful sceneries from the American nature and the scenes look like video strips shot in the late 19th century because of their multiple details. The soundtrack fits in nicely. Excellent work altogether. The characters aren't introduced too well in the beginning so if the viewer wishes to keep up with the plot and the characters from the start, I recommend studying the history sources concerning Jesse James and Robert Ford before seeing the picture. This film isn't about twists and turns in the plot but the characters and the atmosphere. It's a historical movie so one can assume many viewers are familiar with the events beforehand. Because of the title, at least the outcome shouldn't be a secret to anyone.The film starts slowly but builds up the suspense towards the end. The last scenes are very intense and worth waiting for. I recommend The Assassination of Jesse James as a "one-view" movie, meaning that it is a good film but maybe seeing it once is enough. It's the kind of film that offers you everything it has on a single view. I enjoyed this film but I'm afraid watching it second time would get me bored.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An analysis of one of the most beautiful, mysterious and compelling films ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some have complained that the title of the film renders the film pointless. It is not a matter of what, but why. Why would Ford take the life of his, and the entire nations, personal hero?The first shots show Jesse wandering through the fields, the burning sky framing his mystery, the endless fields showcasing his isolation; it's clear why he's so iconic. Jesse James is Pitts career best performance. Pitt pulls off the many aspects of Jesse's complex personality, dark scenes of lying smiles, interrogative glares and even tender moments with his children, but he also reserves true emotion behind a blank and tired face. The thoughts going through Jesse's mind during his final days, and indeed, final moments are left entirely up to the viewer to decide; Pitt gives nothing away.The immense psychological detail of the two main characters gives the impression that we have seen them all their lives, I can imagine a young Robert Ford gazing at a picture of Jesse James, just as I can imagine Jesse James committing his first murder. The characterisation is so deep that two fully formed lives are mapped out; we see hints of each character's history that will inevitably lead to their downfall. In one of the most beautiful shot and lit scenes I've ever seen a night train is plundered by Jesse James and his gang, Jesse stands up on a blockade as the train slows down in front of him, his silhouette formed in fog and glowing light through the darkness; it's images like this that were passed down and travelled across the world to form his legend.To call Jesse James an enigma is false; because he cannot be solved. Not by his wife, not by his gang of thieves, not by himself. Towards and including the third act of the film he is lost in his mind, relentlessly trying to level himself, gazing out at the world he has conquered; it is impossible for him to ever return from his self caused paranoia and existential turmoil. In one scene Jesse ruthlessly beats a young boy for information. In the next shot we see him crying into his horse, he looks up and around, then carries on crying. He doesn't understand his own actions; he can't comprehend his own instinctual nature.In the best shot of the film Jesse and Fords brother Charley approach an iced over lake, Charley hesitates with the horses, an empty faced Jesse walks on and wearily crouches down on the ice, a huge mountain behind him aligned perfectly with his huge coat covered body; the truth in a shot, the world sees him as an omnipotent force of nature, a mountain who cannot be moved, when in actuality he is just a man filled with regret, fear and aggression. One man who hopelessly believes he understands Jesse is Robert Ford. Played to perfection by Casey Affleck, his childlike smile and lazy eyes add more innocence and misunderstanding to the pathetic loner, just as Pitts piercing blue eyes elevate the criminal to a demonic presence. Ford's sinister, nervous voice hides a character that should be pitied, he's a child following his dream, uncontrollable and reckless, and out of his depth.It is obvious that Ford is in love with Jesse. He is obsessed with Jesse's character, so it is only natural that an obsessive admiration would turn into a longing and desire. For those who still doubt the homosexual undertones, consider the scene in which Ford creeps towards a bathing Jesse, always alert Jesse senses him and they converse. Eventually Ford begins to leave, but he lingers a moment longer and stares at Jesse from behind, his face softens and his hands wander up and caress the door frame. This scene works as a confirmation of Ford's deeper desire for Jesse, but also as a foreshadowing of the true reason behind Jesse's death.Minutes before his death Jesse removes his guns from around his waist, in a life defined by violence, the removal of his guns is him at his most free; he is ready for death; his soul is at peace for the first time in his life. James wanted to die, he and Ford were connected in that final moment, and Jesse knew that Ford loved him enough to pull the trigger.The title isn't as it is to brand Ford a coward, it is there to show the power of popular opinion. The celebrity image of Jesse is formed by half truths and lies. On a basic level, Ford did the world a favour by killing Jesse James, he was on the edge of insanity, and even a sane Jesse James is the most dangerous man in the world, if he had gone over the edge who knows what he may have done. But that is the nature of celebrity. Never hearing the full story, never seeing the full picture and only being told what you want to hear. The world saw Ford as a coward, a man who shot the greatest man out of a desire for fame and fortune (which is the story he self destructively sticks to) but we can see plainly that he was just an impressionable, naive young outcast who delved too deep into what he wanted. He expected Jesse to take him under his wing, polish him into the next great criminal of his generation, to become the next Jesse James. In a sick twist of fate Ford got what he wanted, he did become Jesse James, only he became the real, spiritually scarred and emotionally distraught man, not the public's gun-toting hero. Unfortunately, the tragic cycle continued. The mythology surrounding James killed him, as it did for Ford. Another Jesse obsessed fan only saw in him the Coward Robert Ford. Ford was a celebrity, but he was not celebrated, so he was assassinated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is really a great movie, one of the best of the year. Not much of a typical western, its more like a psychological thriller with some moments of drama. A very interesting story about Jesse James, his last year alive, about Robert Ford, His obsession with Jesse James and his reasons to kill him. A very convincing and well developed plot. Beautiful photography, the landscapes shown in the movie are simply amazing. The music is also very good, every score fits to the perfection to the mood of every scene. The direction by Andrew Dominik is incredible, he delivers a slow rhythm yet enjoyable movie. It has a cast of wonderful actors beginning with Casey Affleck that is constantly evolving in his performances, Brad Pitt that is already a custom to watch him in perfect acting roles, Sam Rockwell excellent in his supporting role and Sam Sheppard with a brief but convincing appearance. To conclude, this is a great masterpiece, a must see movie and an Oscar nomination worthy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Patient, beautiful storytelling sets the scene for the unlikely glimpse into the life of Jesse James less colored by infamy and vilification. We're offered instead a movie that revolves around the depth of the characters close to James prior to his death, namely Robert Ford and his obsession with celebrity.Pitt pulls off James' character with subtlety, cunning and a chaotic sort of charisma. The depth and detail of his mind are intricately explored in the silence between words and the way he seems to quietly look through the people around him. Casey Affleck's account of Robert Ford is also very well performed as an envious and emotionally unstable boy who covets the life and fame of Jesse James so hauntingly its almost uncomfortable to watch.The direction and screenplay are deep and thoughtful, building on a surprisingly rich history. The narrative and camera work are poetic and melancholy, using artistic lenses and beautiful scenery to vividly paint a background befitting the cadence of the story.Nick Cave and Warren Ellis compose a sad, quiet original score for this film that I am, of course, enamored with. There were several moments I was touched by the movie and hearing Ellis' lonely violin, I could feel emotion well up within me I could hardly suppress. I'm also a huge Nick Cave fan (which is actually how the movie came to my attention) and was very happy to see him make a cameo appearance.I'm surprised to see anything come out of Hollywood that isn't a brainless action flick and wish there were more films like this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has been hell of a movie... in a wonderful and great sense of the word!All right, it was incredibly slow paced, very true. But "slow" doesn't mean "boring" at all! When you are a passenger in a car that flies over the road at 200kmh/130mph, you don't see jack of your surrounding, you only have the rush of speed. On a bike, at 20kmh/13mph, you are able to enjoy your environment, the air you breath, the slight wind in your hair and the rays of the summer sun caressing your very face.Same goes with movies. Fast paced action thingies give you a rush of adrenaline and an exciting experience. But this one, "The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford" isn't like that! If you like "action movies" and "westerns", you probably will be snoring in 30 minutes indeed. There is nearly no action in this motion picture, and it is not meant to! It is a document... the description of two men, struggling against life. The older one struggles with despair and paranoia, the younger one against his urge to become famous. None of them (and really no one in the entire movie) carries away your sympathy. Why not? Because this movie isn't about sympathetic people. This movie isn't about heroes or helpful men who endanger their lives for others. Every single character in this movie is a regular human being in some ways: focused on their own gain in one way or another. Not even the lawmen are depicted as being nice people. Why? Well, wake up! Jesse and his gang are outlaws! And not the Robin Hood like outlaws as they are sometimes depicted like, but ruthless highwaymen and even killers. Well, face it... they WERE ruthless killers and robbers! And the coppers? Well, most of them were recruited from the bad guys at those times. Former gunslingers who were offered to stand up against other gunslingers to either kill or arrest them.Women play an subordinated part in the movie. Why? Because this movie is the work of a women hater and sexist? No, not by far! Back in the late nineteenth century, women WERE supposed to be good for housekeeping and bearing children, and nothing else... even though that is FAR from true, of course. In that sense, the women in the movie aren't really "there". They have little screen time and if they are shown, they take background roles and are mostly at home, as it is quite expectable.Brad Pitt's Jesse James was a man to get the creeps by. You cannot grasp him. You never know what is brewing beneath his scalp. You cannot predict him, cannot understand him. Pitt switches between the different aspects of a troubled mind neatly and convinces in his part as the neurotic or even psychotic gunslinger.Casey Affleck does a tremendous job too. His Robert Ford has all the marks of another troubled mind. When talking, he cannot hold eye contact for a long time. He hides his malfunctioning understanding of the idea of "conscience" behind a dreamy look in his eyes and a shy smile. Sam Rockwell... well yeah... Sam Rockwell... The man who played the bad guy in "Charlie's Angels 1", and who starred in "Confessions of a dangerous Mind". He seemed to be a chameleon before and he has proved he is in this very special movie. While he gave Charlie's Angels a bit of a level, he really was a bang in CoadM. In tAoJJbtCRF he plays the not so smart brother of Robert Ford who has quite some wisdom and life experience though, even if nobody gives him that credit.The camera work was magnificent. The opening scenes with the train robbery, phew... it really straightened the very hair on my arms. The goose bumps went away a quarter of an hour after the movie only. One tremendous camera shot after the other. Magnificent!Without the slightest doubt, this would have been the most impressive movie I have seen in quite some while if I hadn't seen "Ben X" a short time ago.I can completely understand though, if many people did not like this movie. It is no Con Air or Ichi The Killer. If you are into relaxing and exciting entertainment, please do yourself a favour and skip this very movie. Here you will be obligated to sniff the atmosphere and to think all of the time.</fullReview>

The director took the approach of draining the colour from the entire film, as well as other visual devices to convey a sense of seriousness, depression, and a stew of other slightly negative emotions. This also enhances the starkness of the characters, setting them in more extremes. As my friend stated, by the end of the movie you feel sorry for *everyone*.It was an amazing film that I recommend anyone to see, but please be aware that it is a violent and serious film that will leave you feeling somber.

		<shortDescription>A New Western Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What LOST IN TRANSLATION did for Japanese culture, THE ASSASSINATION OF JESSE JAMES BY COWARD ROBERT FORD does for the Western. In one of the best visceral presentations of the West, its feel, its depiction of bare, spartan rooms, the ambiance sounds of rustling wind and creaky floors, this movie reels with authenticity, a rawness, grittiness even to how shooting scenes are played out. People die harshly. Men talk trash, like real men talk about women sometimes. There are amazing scenes of silent acting that communicate brilliant the mood, the feelings, the senses of the scene. Both Brad Pitt and Casey Afflect easily award nominations bring to the screen a real subtle and intimate, disquieting, and complex characters, . This perhaps overly long, sometimes difficult to follow where even eventually even Sam Sheppard's character just seems to disappear, remains nevertheless an intimate epic movie brings both a fantastic cinematography to the audience with the color, lighting, the shots of both bright sunshine and complete darkness of the nights of the old West. The narrative-voice over is riveting in its also documentary style presentation that adds authenticity to the acting on the screen, a richness and depth of really experiencing each scene. One of the most mesmerizing, layered, and rich film of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Near perfection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I confess, I've been slow getting round to this. I was given it on DVD for Christmas and what a gift because this is one masterpiece of a movie. As it progressed it became clearer and clearer to me that the brooding and grumbling soundtrack (all instrumental) sounded distinctly like Nick Cave and so it transpired; written as it was by him and his Bad Seed partner Warren Ellis (the Big Beardy one). The soundtrack is only one of the great perfections of this movie, because like everything in it it sticks like Araldite together in perfect symmetry.Let's turn to the cinematography by Roger Deakins. This is photography at its very finest and he won an Oscar this year (but not for this which was surely the runner up). He won it for No Country For Old Men which I have raved about elsewhere. What sets the photography apart here is that he introduces a strange stressing of the picture at certain points (when the narrator speaks mainly I think) and my guess is that this is to reflect Jesse James' failing eyesight which is referred to early in the movie.Now the casting. You will surely never see a greater Brad Pitt performance and Casey Affleck as the Coward Robert Ford who first idolises and then vilifies James is quite outstanding and rightly was Oscar nominated for the performance.The story is a little tricky to follow because a lot of characters are referred to in contexts that one might not understand if not a student of Jesse James; which I'm not. Anyway, it hangs around James' final days in which he's taking more risks than he should. His gang is breaking up and his loyal recruits ain't as loyal as they used to be. James knows this (or at least senses it) and you see him become increasingly paranoid in a way that Daniel Day Lewis totally over-blew in There will be Blood (for my money this a far better movie with a far subtler exposition of madness and the pursuit of a different kind of power).As the film progresses the young (19) Thomson becomes completely dis-enamoured of his erstwhile childhood hero (for many, James was the Robin Hood of America) and sees instead only James' self driven anger and thirst for revenge. To gain the ?100,000 bounty on his head Ford and his brother Charlie (also brilliantly played by Sam Rockwell) plot to overthrow him.In the end the moment of execution is an anticlimax for the pair (but not the viewer) in that James seemingly surrenders and takes a bullet to the back of the head.At first lauded (mildly) Ford soon sees the backlash as America proclaims him not a hero but a coward for killing an unarmed man by shooting him in the back of the head. Ford's life is ended in a further revenge killing and the whole futility of it all becomes apparent.I cannot recommend this film highly enough. Long it may be (2h 40min) but it's all the better for that because we never really wanted it to end.Bravo 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, just watched this movie so I thought why not to recommend it to other people because it's an amazing movie. One of the best I ever saw, but lets start first with the acting. Every actor was cut out for his role. The way Affleck brings the "confused" boy effect is amazing same as Pitt enlightens the movie with his brilliant performance. This is not a typical western shot-em-up, this movie is a historical epic drama which tells you the tale of a American bandit and the life he was going and the way he was assassinated. The way the story ends is of course very stunning and the narrating just fits perfectly.I can just recommend you to watch this one.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic film making!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone who calls this long and boring must love movies like Transformers and GI Joe and Watchmen. This film is beautiful to the last drop. Great and interesting story, Awesome and interesting characters, Beautiful cinematography and some of the best dialogue I've heard in a movie in a long time; not to mention the breakthrough acting by all of the actors, Brad pitt should have been nominated for an Oscar, Casey Affleck pounded his skill into this movie, Sam Rockwell is intriguing, Renner is awesome.. the list goes on. Great from start to finish, if you think it's slow AT All than you must not like a western kind of movie or simply don't like an interesting and compelling story. The cinematography by Deakins alone makes this a good film, not to mention everything else I've already listed. Watch it, if your not impressed than it's not for you but neither is anything about great film making. Best of 07' and 07' was a great year in American film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A meditative take on one of the legends of the Old West</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Andrew Dominik's film "The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford" meditates on the hero cult, and the complicity between the obsessive and its object of obsession. Yes, the right word to describe this odd Western is *meditative*, for it ruminates on its subject, in slow takes that settles on minute gestures, in lyrical narration that seems to pause than to advance the narrative, in dirge-like music with the rhythm of slowly melting snow, and the impeccable photography of landscapes of desaturated palettes like an Andrew Wyeth canvas.Critics were split over this movie. Some found its pace (at 152 min) too much of an ordeal, faulting the writer/director for the waste of time on this meandering and self-indulgent 'doily' of a Western (The Hollywood Reporter, Salon). What else can be added to the story of Jesse James and Robert Ford that hasn't been told, that would merit such long-winded treatment? The answer: the protracted anguish of both characters, deftly portrayed by Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck. Pitt is back in form since "A River Runs Through It", infusing the screen with both menace and sympathy with his Jesse James. In contrast Affleck's Ford squeaks in a feeble voice, gazes like a pained animal, and is both pitiful and creepy. Contrary to complaints, both characters are obsessively watchable, and the movie does hook you in its lilting rhythm; the small details do build up and accrue, and resolve into a final clarity. And here, I agree with Variety: "But any sense of viewer impatience is soon overtaken by the film's accumulation of detail on every front--narrative, historical, folkloric, behavioral and psychological. Pitching the dialogue in a way that neatly injects prairie twang with a literary lyricism, Dominik settles into an expansive narrative strategy of the sort often found in novels and longform series, wherein the story skips and meanders among events whose relevance and meaning may be initially unclear, but which are all there for good reasons." (Variety, 31 Aug 2007) You need the stamina from reading 19th century novels, or watching a Kurosawa take with the camera planted on the tripod whilst actors play out the scene, to earn the rewards of this film. And it is finally rewarding.(A long version of this review appears in: stickslip.wordpress.com as "That Dirty Little Coward That Shot Mr. Howard")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>psychological study/ poetic docudrama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As other admirers of this film have noted, the majority of those voicing complaint against this film are blaming it for being a bad Western, when in fact it isn't a Western at all. It is an elegiac domestic tragedy, a folk-narrative, a 'docudrama,'a psychological study of rural petty criminals and the myths they would like to perpetuate about themselves to avoid the pettiness of their lives. But it is not a Western. It has more in common with the old Robert Mitchum film about post-WWII moonshiners, "Thunder Road," than with "I shot Jesse James." But of course, unlike "Thunder Road," intended to appeal to younger drive-in theater audiences, the present Jesse James film is a straight drama intended for a mature audience. So the other complaint against the film, that it is very slow, is somewhat justified, but misses the point. This is not an action/ adventure film. I have no problem with those who do not like elegiac drams, but those who express disappointment that this is not a Western or an action film are simply off base. Why not complain that "The Dark Knight" is not a successful romantic comedy? This would make as much sense.Taken on its own terms, the film, despite its length, is sometimes painfully suspenseful, even knowing the story ahead of time, because what we are really watching are convolutions of character, where every real action, every word spoken or misspoken reveals a little more of the psychology and personalities of the characters. Also, there's no doubt the off-screen narration repeatedly hints that there might be a moral center to be found in the world of James and Bob Ford - but none exists. We certainly have some sense of what is wrong when we see it happen, but no real guide as to what is right.The narration of the film frequently achieves real poetry. The dialog is at once folksy and crisp. The acting is uniformly brilliant, even from Mr. Pitt, of whom I am no fan. The editing could be tighter in spots, but is frequently on target, given the quirky pacing of the story. The cinematography includes some of the most beautiful outdoor cinematography I've seen in many years. It's a sad story, but worthy of attention and praise. And no it's not a Western. But its a dam' good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The expectations...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I said that I wanted to see this movie,many advised me not to! they said they've heard that it ain't good and that I will probably not like it! but now that I've seen it,I really want to know why they said that?! What I had heard about the movie, made me expect to fall asleep during watching it. but surprisingly I found myself not wanting it to end. And when it did end, I couldn't stop thinking why I liked it so much? I really don't know the exact reason!! I was expecting more scenes of robbery and murder and... The narration was really good. It made it some what poetic and made me like it more! Something else that surprised me was the sympathy that I had with Robert Ford. I thought I could feel how he did every second. From the time he was so glad to just chat with Jesse to the time he said he "expected applause"... And I have to say, I also expected applause. Finally, I think this movie was great in any way one might expect. And Brad Pitt was truly unforgettable, so is the movie!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A strongly acted, beautiful Cinematic Masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To start of with, I will talk about the film itself. It is not just original, and different than what we usually see, but it had hidden meanings to each scene. A lot of people first talk about how it is so 'slow paced', but I, for one, think it is one of the best paced films ever. It's pace allows us to dig deeper into the story, and to have more feelings and thoughts, and also to allow us to see the characters developing. The screenplay is very effective, and if I had to pick the most realistically talked film of 2007, this would be it. As the title says, the screenplay does take it's time to gather into more and more complex issues, and until the 'bang' finale.The screenplay is also helped by the strong acting in this film. As you can see in the awards page, Casey Affleck got an Oscar nomination for his supporting role. Well, let me tell you, when you are watching him, you cannot really tell if his performance is Oscar-worthy or not. The reason is not because he wasn't good enough, but because it is so realistic, it almost doesn't seem like acting. His performance is so subtle, and I can see he took brave decisions too. I am glad he got the attention he deserved, and I also think he deserved to win the Oscar. Another performance that was just as effective in it's own way was Brad Pitt's. His performance as a bandit leader is also so well done, it is hard to really ungrasp from it. I believe he was underrated, and he did not get the attention he deserved(especially since he has never acted like this before). Sam Rockwell, who plays Charley Ford, also stays on top.The reason this film is so beautiful is not only because of it's screenplay and acting, but because of its absolutely gorgeous cinematography. I believe it should have won the Oscar(even though another magnificent film, There Will Be Blood won). It's cinematographer,Roger Deakins, really knows how to keep an impact. This film is probably the first to open my eyes to cinematography. It is probably the best I have ever seen. It is that effective. Not only was the cinematography great, but the Original Music Score was just as great. This is an aspect that I thought it was also greatly ignored at in the Academy Awards. The reason it could not get an Oscar nomination, or even be in the running, was because it had two composers. That is a real big shame, because I thought that all the music pieces done are absolutely beautiful and mesmerizing, and only support the tone of the film.This film is not only a masterpiece of this time, but I think that when it came out, it never got the attention it deserved. The director, Andrew Dominik, must be one of the smartest I have seen. He made the film what it was overall, and I think that in 50 years, the Academy Awards will be looking upon it as their 'one big miss'. Not only will they look at it, but other critics and fans will look upon it too. It is a film that gets better with repeated viewings, and one that deserves enormous praise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Joy to all the Senses we Bring to Cinema. 2007's Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a paltry two Oscar nominations (for Cinematography and Supporting Actor) the Assassination of Jesse James joins the ranks of cinematic achievements (most recently A History of Violence) that get annually short-changed by the Academy.At 2 hours and 45 minutes, with a title that stretches to a daunting ten words (not to mention one that gives away the final plot), and with the complex idiom of the American west (the colloquial complexities, arcane geographies, making it harder for an international audience), and you have a film that could end up being a trying, if not exasperating, experience.But the Assassination of Jesse James emerges from all this as one of the great triumphs of the year, leaving in its languorous brilliance a story of destructive mythification, paranoia and, above all, sickening fear.Director Andrew Dominick chronicles the story of the famous outlaw Jesse James (Brad Pitt) who, at the age of 34, is celebrated and mythified in dime-comics and legends, but is filled with self-loath and despair within. Robert Ford (Casey Affleck), who grew up with a comic book idealization of James, meets his idol as he plans his last train robbery. Rebuked by James, Ford begins to turn resentful and pursues the path foretold by the title.Ford's eventual detachment from his childhood myths becomes critical in enabling him to kill James with cold-blooded planning, acquiring in the process a large bounty and the perhaps expected goodwill and heroism from killing an outlaw. But soon after, tables turn as Jesse James continues to live as a legend in popular memory, leaving Ford to confront the devastating implications of his act that question his moral compass.No doubt, the film moves slowly, but it does so exquisitely, exposing the nuances of its characters in slow meditative shots and conversations. There is a powerful dramatic tension that undergirds this film, and indeed heightens as it proceeds to its raw and thrilling climax. This languor, coupled with a deep visual sense and rich moods makes Jesse James an almost hypnotic literary experience.The acting performances are superlative. Garret Dillahunt as Ed Miller and Sam Rockwell as Charlie Ford give sublime performances as men sickened in fear for their lives.Casey Affleck brilliantly creates a character as irritating and annoying as Ford, while slowly and persuasively exposing his instabilities and vulnerabilities in confronting his idol, and subsequently, his own life.Without an Oscar nomination, but as deserving, is Brad Pitt who lends the film an enigmatic and sensual presence, with a performance that ranges from moments of poignant despair to those of destructive paranoia. Unlike Affleck, Pitt's performance is deeply understated and is as languorous and rich as the film itself. The best actor award at the Venice Film Festival was highly deserving.Cinematographer Roger Deakin (Shawshank Redemption, Fargo) captures the marvelous palette of colours and shades that make Westerns to notoriously seductive, and is a frontrunner for an Oscar this year.Moody, visually transporting, and melancholic, the Assassination of Jesse James is a far cry from the romantic bravado of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, and is as gritty and compelling as the very best in the Western genre. It is this year's Masterpiece. -----------------Deepak Nair</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Utterly brilliant.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Went into this movie with a bit of apprehension considering it's length, but I was completely spellbound for it's entirety. The cinematography and haunting music by Nick Cave could've actually carried the movie by themselves, but it was the acting that really set it apart from so many other marathon performance pieces. To say that Affleck and Pitt were stunning in their portrayals would be an understatement, the rest of the cast also top notch. I can't find a single thing I didn't like about this movie, except perhaps the short amount of screen time given to Mary-Louise Parker. It left me totally gobsmacked, brilliant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning photography raises this to the level of a near classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the past few weeks I have viewed a number of films that contain some stunning sequences and photography, most notably 'No Country For Old Men' and 'There Will Be Blood' (the opening twenty minutes of which is film-making at its peak). Amongst these is this film, a eulogy to a past way of life and a lament for the passing of heroes.Near the beginning of this film there is a night-time train robbery, and of all the sequences and photography throughout the rest of the film it is this that has lingered longest in my mind. The use of the lights from the lamps of the outlaws in the dark woods gives the sequence a sinister edge, an edge that is built upon as the train comes around the bend in the tracks, its headlights catching the hooded figures of the outlaws in its beam, making them look like ghosts. As the train approaches the tree trunks and other large wooden items laid on the tracks, upon which Jesse James himself stands, the camera is pointed right at the cattle-catch. This is not only a frightening sight, but also a direct reference to one of the earliest films of a train arriving at a station (Lumiere Brothers 1895). This fear is increased when the train than actually starts to push the camera along, giving the impression that the train is roaring into the cinema! Once this sequence is over the film settles down into its stride, very stately and, at times, painfully slow. This is not to detract from the film, these slow periods are needed, I believe, in order to emphasise the pasting of an age that was first coming to an end during the time in which the film is set. All the faces - and what faces they are! - show a world-weariness and ageing that comes from living a life of such hardness, and the constant hiding from both the law and Jesse himself - who is also on the run from his own past - all serve to reinforce the notion of a life without reward. The performances are universally excellent, Brad Pitt is superb as Jesse, and Casey Affleck is all slime and charm as Robert Ford.The final sequences, in which Robert Ford plays upon his new found fame, coupled with his own earlier worshipping of Jesse James as a legendary figure, prove that even then the cult of celebrity was something to be weary off.If the film has a fault it is that it is about 20 minutes too long, a little bit of trimming here and there could have easily been carried out without losing the force of its emotional or philosophical appeal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Western-ish movie of this century</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It took me nearly six hours to finish watching this movie. Yes, I saw it twice. It's not too complicated to catch up or anything. But personally, I think this film is...a landmark. It deserved to see twice in a roll. It's very poetic and visually striking. This is, by far, the best Western-ish movie in this young century.As I said, it's Western-ish. Because it is characters study film disguised in Western genre. There is no such think called "action" to be seen (except some very violent scenes). The film is, to me, possessed by Terrence Malick-like kind of touch (cue, blowing grasses scene!). I really wonder what took Andrew Dominik (of critically acclaimed, "Chopper") seven years hiatus before direct this amazing second feature.If you want to look for any surprises, please look elsewhere. Because its title says it all (duh). It's about legendary outlaw Jesse James (Brad Pitt) who eventually got killed by coward Robert Ford (Casey Affleck). The film opened with the last "job" of James's gang after almost two decades of all kinds of robbery. Jesse's brother, Frank James (Sam Shepard) decided to retire and live in peace. Jesse, on the other hand, decided not to quit (one can assumed that he didn't know how). He recruits Ford brother, Charley (Sam Rockwell) and his younger brother, Robert.Even though Charley is just another ordinary low-life criminal who didn't have any motivation in his own future, Robert has. Robert is a 19-years-old boy who idolizes Jesse since he remembered. He learned to be like Jesse in every single motion (at one point, Jesse asked "You want to be like me, or you want to be me?). But the more Jesse shows his vulnerability like a normal human being, the more Robert questioned himself whether he might be able to step over Jesse's reputation and make a legend on his own name.One of the great things about this film is, they're able to make a full human being from two titular characters. Jesse is very bleak character who has two completely different personalities. He's a gentleman and family man who kept his secret identity well enough to not get caught. He's also paranoid madman and plain cold-blooded killer who is about to losing his damn mind. Only the other hand, Robert is simply...a child. He is a scared young man pretend to act tough. But when opportunity is knocking on his door, he over did it that it actually ruined his life.I've gotta say, Casey Affleck is a lead in this film (Academy Award nominated him in supporting role really made no sense). I heard there's a 4 hours+ version of this film which Brad Pitt has a lot more things to do. Well, I hope I will have a chance to see it. Anyway, both actors are absolutely perfect for the role. For Brad, this is probably the best role to date. For Casey, 2007 is the best year for him (with the lead in Gone Baby Gone and...this).I can see it why there's only a handful of people went to see this film (in America, of course). They expected for something but, in the end, they've got some completely different thing instead. I know, maybe you don't want to experience another "Dances with Wolves" (remember when was the last time you see this one?) I know it is decent movie. But that movie is boring as hell. "The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford" will prove you wrong that a long movie doesn't always have to be boring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The old west was a complicated time?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am willing to bet that the end of the movie is given away in the title in large part because the relationship between Jesse James and the coward Robert Ford is so complex, and James himself so unpredictable, that there is still tension on the way to an ending that we know is coming. Then again, it's also true that not only is the assassination not the end of the movie, and the tension created by violence that we can see coming is, in most ways, more real and more satisfying than even realistic violence, such as can be scene in one particular scene in the recent Collateral when (note a possible spoiler here for that movie) when Mark Ruffalo's character Fanny is so unexpectedly shot.The first thing that struck me about this film was that it is much more stylized than the westerns that I have seen. It's difficult to make wide expanses of empty frontier look anything less than beautiful in an almost mythic way, but the time lapse photography and occasional textured shots of a brooding Jesse James (sort of like a film version of the movie's cover) give the film an almost futuristic feel, which is an odd but pleasing sensation to have in a movie that takes place in the late 1800s. We meet the infamous James gang as they are planning to get out of the criminal world at the height of their game. It strikes me as a time when the mostly agrarian American society was so in need of a hero that they, in many ways, accepted a man who was famous for robbing the very people that deified him. He did seem to have some of the characteristics of Robin Hood, but not many. Mostly, we can identify with him because he is clearly a good father who loves his kids, and for some reason even a brutal killer can gain sympathy from modern audiences for being good to his kids. He is also shown as a loving husband, but one can only speculate on how far his loyalty to his wife goes when he is away from his family for so long.Enter Robert Ford, played with striking effectiveness by Casey Affleck, who has appeared in an impressive list of films in his relatively short career, and now is credited above Brad Pitt. Not a bad career move! He has a fascinating story, not the least part of which is that his wife is the sister of the legendary River Phoenix and the also legendary Joaquin Phoenix. Casey has never been much of a leading man, and it is exactly that fact that makes him a perfect Robert Ford.Some have suggested a homo-erotic lust towards James from Ford, and while I wouldn't go so far as to call it lust, his hero-worship of James certainly permeates his life completely, and the assassination strikes me not as the most intimate that Ford can be with Jesse without sex, but rather, as a sort of If I can't have you, no one will. Although still, I don't see anything sexual at all in their relationship, but rather a lashing out of Ford, who so desperately wants to be accepted by Jesse that, after consistently failing, he resorts to killing him, the less painful of his two remaining options (the other being acceptance of his inherent inferiority and subsequent expulsion from the gang or permanent subservience). The other way that the story presents a surprising level of complexity is after the assassination, where Ford receives the fame that he always wanted and, for some expected and some unexpected reasons, becomes truly miserable. It is a strange exploration of the media's and the public's glorification of violence, as a man who terrorized the public is seen as a fallen icon and the man who killed him is branded a murderer. It seems that Ford's mistake is in so publicly glorifying himself, reenacting the killing in front of live audiences, eventually being heckled by the crowds for being a coward. The problem that he doesn't realize is that the public doesn't understand the relationship between James and Ford, which was always uncomfortable, even as Ford tried so hard to sidle up to James and be accepted as his "sidekick." When the assassination happens, James knows it, and so does Ford and so do we. The audiences watching the reenactment only saw Ford shoot James from behind, not really knowing that James knew it was going to happen and allowed it. Maybe even welcomed it. At just under 3 hours the movie is a bit long, but it is also a modern western epic, and there aren't very many of those. This movie will invariably be compared to other recent westerns, such as the astonishingly good 3:10 to Yuma, one of the best and most redeeming westerns I've seen in years. Like that movie, this one also has a spectacular cast who inhabit their roles and give us a look at the old west in a way that I didn't know was possible anymore. It seems that the western genre is coming back to life?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A soulful, character-driven western.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow?this movie is a true work of art. The main story was rather straightforward, but the characterization, the intensely poetic visuals, the soulful score and the brilliant direction made it one of the most hauntingly unique cinematic experiences I've ever had.First of all, the performances were all top-notch. Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck obviously dominated the screen most of the time, but quite a few secondary actors (Sam Rockwell, for instance) stood out as well. Casey Affleck's performance was widely acclaimed, and I was very impressed with him as well but personally I thought that Brad Pitt stole the show, especially in the last hour of the movie. The character of Jesse James was just as complex and layered as Robert Ford, and Pitt pulled off this multi-faceted personality very nicely in my opinion. It's a real shame he wasn't nominated for the Oscars.Another major victim of an Oscar snub was Roger Deakins. I had liked his work in The Shawshank Redemption and Fargo (it had been one of the few redeeming features of the latter), but this time he really outdid himself. His style was strongly reminiscent of the cinematography in Terrence Malick's films, with the wonderful landscapes and the most interesting camera angles. Moreover the visuals blended effortlessly with the background score?every technical aspect of this movie seemed to fit right in place.As far as the actual assassination of Jesse James is concerned, I thought it was brilliantly portrayed. The fact that the title itself was throwing such a huge spoiler at the audience even before they had seen the movie, must have made it very tough for the director/screenwriter to maintain the significance of that particular scene. However, the spoiler was very cleverly used by Andrew Dominik to provide some strong dramatic irony to the plot, and this made the assassination scene all the more impactful.?There are quite a few more themes and interesting aspects that I noticed in the movie (e.g. the possible homosexual tension, the whole "novel-like" atmosphere) but no matter how much I write about it, it would all amount to a single fact ? that I loved every minute of this film. As of now, it is definitely my favourite of the year.My Final Rating: 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie really caught me by surprise; I had no idea what to expect, it was one of my few blind buys on Blu-ray. It was amazing, I feel it was the 2nd best movie of 2007, only behind No Country For Old Men (I'm surprised it did not get Best Picture and Best Actor (for Pitt) nominations). The film was overall excellent: amazing cinematography (color contrast and landscapes), superb acting (I felt Pitt and Affleck were actually James and Ford, Rockwell was good too), story was calm and intense at the same time; the only problem I can see was that the pacing was a little slow, but it never lost my attention; I never really knew what was coming next.Overall a fantastic film; cannot wait to see what Dominik does next (rumor has it it is a work of Cormac McCarthy...

		<shortDescription>Brad is Greatest Actor Alive.... just too pretty to get deserved accolade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never been more disgusted with the academy awards than this year simply because Brad Pitt is among the top 2 actors in the world and never gets any credit. Daniel Day Lewis is a fantastic actor, probably no. 2, but with the exception of Gangs of New York, all his films are boring, boring, boring. I watch them to see the genius of the man which is undeniable, but he gets such good press as he realises the best way to get good press is to starve them of anything to publish about you, so when you show your greatness, and he is great; you get the maximum effect. Brad Pit is better, he makes watchable, exciting , emotive, INTERESTING movies. I enjoyed this film cover to cover. I don't want to say much about this film because the truth is that if you don't watch it, you will miss the only film to recreate "the shawshank effect" in the last 10+ years and as such YOU ARE NOT WORTHY. (the shawshank effect is the feeling of spiritual elation one feels after watching the shawshank redemption the second time, as you can only fully appreciate it on a repeat viewing) The reason Brad is shunned I suspect is people just can't stand how good he is, as well as he is so good looking, and is with one of the most beautiful women on the planet AND he is filthy rich etc etc etc. It is a shame jealousy can interfere with the appreciation of a master at work in his art form. I love Viggo but his performance in Eastern Promises and the film itself are not a patch on the assassination of Jesse.... Also I most add Casey Affleck with his performance, will make you want to end the Affleck family line, but only because his performance as the coward Robert ford is so good. He was exceptional. (Shame his brother put out such ill will into the world prior to his award winning performance)Brad I don't want your babies, but I am a fan for LIFE!</fullReview>

History is a vague affair filled with perceptions tainted with what we know to be true, not the truth, a tunnel with the end in sight not the tangents the provide context of a broader knowledge, But i suppose without a prize what incentive would there be for the winners to write it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a connoseur of cinematic detail. Especially in historical movies that I have a fair knowledge of the times they depict. And I am often absolutely, verbally, anal. I drive my wife nuts on this but to me even a background set filled with accurate prosaic items is cause for a private gasp of wonder for me. Hey--someone conncected with the movie I am watching actually CARED about attempting to render history halfway realistically!Someone once said that the past is another country: "They do things differently there." Kudos to the screenwriter and the others who cooperated on this masterpiece. The dialog and diction (supported by the splendid cinematography!) transported me back to the late 1800s. The film seemed to me to be about as linguistically/historically perfect as it could possibly be. If the speech was not exactly "factually correct," it nevertheless rang profoundly true. These old flesh and blood American characters probably and actually talked like this--a mixture of transplanted British courtliness and low-down--often obscene--countrified slang.The clothing was right there along with everything else. I don't believe I will ever look at Kirk Douglas or John Wayne with their smart and silk perfectly-knotted neckerchiefs below their ostentatious Stepsons the same way again.A word or two on the film's cinematography.... This is the first time I have seen color photography that evoked both the beauty of western landscape, the stark, papered-over gritty poverty of frontier life and the "blurred-at-the-edges" sepia daguerreotyped glass plate images of a century ago.This movie was an outstanding experience for my wife and I.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford - The Best Film of 2007</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every year there's a movie that takes your breath away. Every year there's a movie that you become obsessed with. Every year there comes a movie that sets standards for movies for years to come.Well, I just found that movie."The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford" is a modern day masterpiece. From the very first intriguing moment to the breath-taking end, "Jesse James" will make you come out of the theater feeling a whole rush of mixed-up emotions.Don't let the title fool you; just because the title tells you a very important event and who's involved doesn't mean it gives the entire movie away. In fact, far from it. "Jesse James" is not your typical Western. It delves into the lives of two very misunderstood figures in American history and not only tries to portray them individually, but tries to show the audience their very conflicted relationship.A chain of events is set into motion, that leads Jesse James and Robert Ford to their inevitable destinies.Although the movie is long, and spans 2 hours and 40 minutes, (the original movie was over 4 hours), the time flies by and the movie's over even before you know it. All of the amazing aspects of the film keep you captivated and there is never a dull moment.Brad Pitt stars as Jesse James, the famous or infamous outlaw that leads a double life as an insane, psychotic killer and a kind, always smiling friend. Brad Pitt portrays both of these aspects perfectly, being menacing and dangerous one minute, and kind and paranoid the next. You never know what Jesse James is thinking. Brad Pitt makes his character one to be feared, and yet one to be loved.This is arguably Brad Pitt's best performance, and his Jesse James will be the one remembered despite the fact that the outlaw has been portrayed on film many times.Casey Affleck co-stars as the "coward" Robert Ford, the 19 year old boy who has been obsessed with Jesse James his entire life. This is the performance that will be talked about come Oscar time. His acting is brilliant in this film. Every one of his lines is layered with many subtexts, and Ford's emotions are clearly written on his sleeve. However, Ford feels many emotions at once and they're always conflicted. Throughout the entire movie, you always see Affleck with some kind of emotion in his eyes, whether it be anger, adoration, admiration, respect, love, fear, or courage. He adds a lot of depth to a character that has been greatly ignored in American history, and makes you hate him but love him at the same time. Immediately, the audience greatly dislikes Ford's weak behavior. Then, as the audience's feelings towards Ford changes, so does Ford. He changes from a cowardly, awkward young boy to a man faced with a great destiny that he must accept. He becomes brutally aware of what he is capable of, and is almost scared of what he can do. Yet he embraces his fate, full of ideas of the glory and fame that he's always wanted. Casey Affleck puts his heart and soul into his line delivery and it clearly shows. He is not Casey Affleck, he is not reciting lines, he is not playing Robert Ford, he is Robert Ford.Another aspect of this amazing movie is the incredible cinematography and visual beauty, which we can thank both Roger Deakins and Andrew Dominik for. The movie looks like an old picture; the edges are blurred and every shot of the film looks like a piece of art. There are many shots of the beautiful landscape, which shows that despite the menace and betrayal happening in the film, there is still beauty in the world.The score is brilliant. I have never seen a movie and focused on the music so much. The music was written by Nick Caves (who does a great cameo in the movie as a "saloon singer") and Warren Ellis. The music really enhances the tone of the film. It has Western elements in the score, but has a sympathetic and foreboding mood to it. It's very pleasing to listen to and doesn't distract from the main action. The score symbolizes what's going on in the character's minds and hearts, and it fits perfectly with the dialogue and cinematography.Andrew Dominik, who is relatively new to the directing world despite the critical success of "Chopper", is the mastermind behind this amazing film. By merely watching the film you can feel the director's love for his craft. He wrote the voluminous and fantastic screenplay. He and Roger Deakins were in charge of the masterful cinematography. He gave a lot of insight to Brad and Casey's characters. He thought up the brilliant, visually-stunning "train scene". In short, he is a genius and is one of the main reasons why "Jesse James" is a modern masterpiece.This film is not for everyone, however. You have to go to the theater and be willing to submerge yourself into a fascinating world for almost 3 hours. You have to be willing to delve into Jesse James's and Robert Ford's minds. You have to be willing to appreciate the artistic elements of the film, such as the cinematography, the score, and the incredibly slow, but appropriate pacing. If you're willing to do all of that, then you're in for one of the best movies in recent years. You're in for an experience that you will not soon forget, and an experience that will stay with you long after the final credits roll.I give "The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford" 4/5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes American movie-making reminds us why they are the biggest and most important entertainment industry in the world. This happens when we see movies such as "Assassination...", which is, ironically, the kind of movie that has become more and more rare to be made. Maybe because it's poetic, long, based on details rather than on blockbuster action. The acting (especially Affleck, who saves the family name)and the whole technical part (costume design, art direction, cinematography and score REALLY seem part of a coherent whole), all led by this practically unknown genius-to-be Andrew Dominik build a masterpiece that won't be loved by most people (and the foreign press seems to confirm this). But, hey, how many real masterpieces were loved by the time of their release?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An extraordinary film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After more than 100 years of his death,Jesse James' name,a thief and murderer,is still evoking the rigor and romance of the North American old west,while the guy who killed him(seemingly,for making justice)is practically unknown.The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford explains that thing with a lot of greatness.This is a really great and fascinating film.The Assassination... does not attach to the structure of westerns.I would say it's more a psychological drama.In this spectacular film,every scene has a porpoise.At first,some scenes may seem incoherent but they all have a porpoise because they finish telling us a lot of things about the characters' psychology.So,the slow tone this movie has is completely justified because it makes us perfectly know the characters.The landscapes and the cinematography are also spectacular.Casey Affleck brings an extraordinary performance and he makes credible the transformation his character has:from adoring Jesse James,for then,hating and having fear of him.I had seen Affleck on a lot of supporting roles(like in American Pie 2 or Ocean's Eleven and its sequels)but,this year,he got the consecration with two perfect main roles in Gone Baby Gone and this movie.Brad Pitt also brings an excellent performance.When he has the correct material,he can be a brilliant actor,as we can see on this movie.The Assassination... is a fascinating and extraordinary experience which will stay in my mind for a long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best this century.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"You want to be like me, or you want to be me?" Jesse James to Robert Ford The very long arc of Jesse James's mythic persona has yet to descend, and this 2 hour 40 minute version of his demise, lengthily called The Assassination of Jesse James by that Coward Robert Ford, seems as slow until you remember that verisimilitude takes time?the small details of a life lived very large, represented in finite time on a finite screen. So I slipped into non-action mode, a singularly un-American posture, and enjoyed the little details of this notorious bandit's life writ large on the screen by a mighty contemporary myth producing and playing the titular role, Brad Pitt.The air is authenticity, an unhurried excursion through the faces and fates of the low lives the James brothers hired for their last train heist in 1881 in the titles sequence and then the quotidian incidents in James's life with Robert Ford (Casey Affleck) before he kills James. There are small moments to remind of McCabe and Mrs. Miller and Days of Heaven, but few to replicate the energy of the recent 3:10 to Yuma.However, Assassination has its place, like the equally long Dances with Wolves, in creating an authentic atmosphere while still perpetuating the romance of the West that figuratively speaks to our collective desire for individualism, peppered with the exhilaration of Westward movement and the realities of violence and exploitation. (But if that last statement reads pompous to you and you're turning to Long Riders for the twentieth time, then see Assassination just for political assassin James Carville's cameo as a pompous governor.) When Jesse James berates Ford with the statement, "You want to be like me or you want to be me?" he is commenting on the contemporary cult of celebrity as it plays out in the film. When Frank James (Sam Shepard) advises Ford about his ability to be an outlaw, "You don't have the ingredients, Son," he is implying the hardscrabble life Jesse really had, memorably portrayed in one of the best westerns this century.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An artsy western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While it's easy to name a few spaghetti westerns, artsy westerns are more difficult to come by. The only one that comes to mind is "McCabe and Mrs Miller" (1971) and I'm not even sure if everyone agrees. And to those who think that "3:10 to Yuma" is slow and too long, think again! "The assassination etc" has a runtime of 160 minutes to match its title. Whether this is too long is purely subjective, depending entirely on ones expectations. With a full presence of voice over narration and chapter-like structure, this movie is not unlike a book, on the legendary story of the larger-than-life figure of Jesse James, THE train robber.What strikes me most is actually the cinematography. The movie LOOKS so artsy, if nothing else. Every shot is framed for a photo competition ? low angle with the sun and/or sky in the background, shots reflecting from glass and through glass, wheat fields in the wind, close up shots (shoe in field, water running from tap), snow/ice-clad scenes?.. ? I've hardly even started the list.As the story unfolds, it gradually and eventually becomes clear that the focus is on betrayal, how a "coward" such a Robert Ford (Casey Affleck) gets to kill the most-feared bandit Jesse James (Brad Pitt). Other important characters involved are Robert's brother Charley (Sam Rockwell), James' two right-hand men (one could be left-hand, I suppose) Wood Hite (Jeremy Renner) and Dick Liddil (Paul Schneider), as well as his older brother Frank (Sam Shepard) who sort of faded out of the picture as the movie progressed. The intricate relationship between these figures will play out all through the movie.The acting is just fine. Pitt takes up the challenge of a middle-aged role of a figure that is charismatic to the point of being terrifying. Affleck, often starting a sentence an octave higher than normal, conveys various shades of a somewhat enigmatic figure with a great deal of subtleties underneath the deceptively childlike simplicity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This one's a bit of an odd one for me: is it Art or Fart? It seems to divide opinions up the middle; me, I'm in the middle ? I liked it to a point but much prefer Tyrone Power's admittedly unrealistic take on Jesse James from 1940. Which means I'm probably going to get brickbats thrown at me from both sides of the fence. To me, nearly all modern films aim or pretend to be Art, and you can't argue this has some beautiful photography realistic plotting and natural acting. Life in general usually has no great plot, why should a movie always need a completely cohesive one - refer to the classic Dersu Uzala by Kurosawa for a masterclass of languid plotting. What we're watching is still a fantasy: none of us were there in 1882 to know better. And all people are ordinary people unless they're hyped up into special people by media or gossip, so if James really was a charmless monosyllable psycho well done to the team for trying to portray him that way.Unknown slimy adolescent idolises renowned violent baddie, worms his way into his confidence and eventually becomes Someone by shooting him in the back. Looking into the dusty picture at that momentous moment did James really want someone to put him out of his misery or was that just guesswork? Pitt and Affleck play the duo locked in time and make this tick, Pitt playing Pitt with a cigar this time, and Affleck the uptight Coward speaking like Stepin Fetchit used to, no one else matters much apart from in the tension of wondering who's going to get shot next. There's hardly any crudity, sex or violence which is probably off-putting for a lot of todays audience used to it who maybe can't do it without it anymore, but to me there's still too much because what's there is all gratuitous. Favourite bits: the gang waiting in the woods to rob the train at night; the few times anyone laughed or smiled ? life was tedious sure, but human beings will always find good hearted humour anywhere; nice attention to period detail, manners and speaking idioms, although so cleverly made not over required; the aftermath and taking the Ford show on the road.Why not simply view this as a useful appendix to Ken Burns' still staggering American Civil War TV series? It's the most stunning modern film I've seen for years - then again, I don't get to see many! Imho well made, thoughtful, colourful, cogent, courageous and I didn't look at the clock once to see how much longer I had to go. Based on that yardstick I wouldn't mind seeing the 4 hour version ... only not just yet. But ? give me Tyrone Power any day!</fullReview>

The cinematography &amp; direction transcend average competence to blend seamlessly with the script, adding textures and moods as rich as any novelist's prose.The cast is excellent. Brad Pitt is in familiar territory as the charismatic but treacherous Jesse James. Casey Affleck delivers a very complex and courageous performance in the not so flattering part of the coward Robert Ford. Sam Shepard, Sam Rockwell and Jeremy Renner round out a rock-solid lineup.An action thriller this is not. The plot is very unhurried, but with a bit of patience, you will be rewarded with a complex and fascinating tale.

		<shortDescription>A gorgeous yet gritty post-civil war epic that lays bare the heart and soul of an American outlaw and his killer?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While lesser movies hog the limelight, Andrew Dominik's poetic, 19th century western sits understated yet assured in the shadows, seemingly content with the fact that its subtle pace and content will not appeal to all. Despite exuding a stylish sheen of continuous visual class, professionalism and beauty, in addition to remaining rich in detail and elegiac in tone, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford has a running time, pacing and plot that'll disgruntle many. However, more importantly, it boasts a divine showcase of aesthetic, acoustic and cinematic elegance that's anchored so aptly by the pin-sharp performances of leading actors Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck. The former: yet again displaying his miscellaneous ability as a now experienced performer. The latter: an absolute revelation.Adapted from the novel by Ron Hansen, the ten word title most certainly tells audiences the who and the what, but not the why, nor the how. These underlying questions are, in essence, the heart of Dominik's tale which begins with a melodiously tranquil introductory montage of the tale's forthcoming central character, of his family, of his criminal repertoire, his pen names, mind-set, severed finger and granulated eyelids. According to the omnipresent narration, the tale commences in Kansas City, Missouri shortly after Jesse's (Brad Pitt) 34th birthday. Following this harmonious preface, we're introduced to the outlaw's current crew of no-good petty criminals (including a superb Sam Rockwell) and the impending proverbial coward, Robert "Bob" Ford (Casey Affleck), an ambitious, Jesse-idolising 19 year old nobody yearning to be a somebody. Somebody like Jesse. Over time, as Jesse's caginess regarding his dysfunctional band of gunslingers creep disturbingly into sight, he and Bob develop an estranged friendship forged on reverence and commiseration that gradually decays leaving a pedestal of scepticism, jealousy, fixation and deception. Both men exude a constant air of unpredictability: their emotions bubbling vividly to the surface on numerous occasions. However, their outlooks on life and aspirations for the future couldn't be more apposed. Prone to suicidal bouts of depression, Jesse longs for a form of spiritual respite he knows can only come via one grave route. Bob, on the other hand, craves the long-overdue recognition of his peers and the public and the fame and supposed fortune that comes with it. Clouded as their visions are, though, a series of double-crosses within the band of outlaws involving; infidelity, adulteration, persecution and deceit lead to a fair share of bloodletting which inevitably paves the way for a moving climax which exemplifies the downfall of the legend and the defining of the coward.Despite having one of Hollywood's leading men at the forefront, The Assassination of Jesse James is by no means glorified by the mere presence of its male lead who, allegedly, had it justly printed in his contract that the title of the film was not to changed. In this, Dominik's second feature, we see Pitt in an irregular yet unforgettable role in which his million dollar face is paraded not as a shrewd marketing tool, but a landscape of emotions awash with pain and distress, strife and paranoia, fear and depression. Pitt's deranged, dead-behind-the-eyes look is the unadulterated core of what has to be considered as his finest performance to date. Cold, moody, unsettling: Pitt delivers a multi-layered performance of a man in whom suspicion, grief, insomnia and misery suffer a series of head-on-collisions. Resulting in memorable screen performance that's equalled, if not surpassed, by the young Casey Affleck. Quite simply, Affleck is phenomenal as the unhinged, self-indulgent assassin, Ford. His odious, erratic and sometimes snivelling portrayal of the wanna-be outlaw is as fine-tuned, heartfelt and effective as that of co-star Pitt's, if not so: more. Affleck's performance emerges as one of the film's genuine high-points; excelling far beyond the confines of the expected yet emotional climax; radiating sheer acting impeccability, class and awe throughout; provoking pity, spite, disgust, anger and ultimate sympathy from a compelled audience.Sticking relatively close to the principles aired throughout his debut urban cult-classic Chopper, Dominik is able to present another in-depth dissection of the emotionally complex mind of a murderous criminal renowned with notoriety yet an estranged sense of heroism. Don't expect to see any self-inflicted earlobe hacking or mother-in-law thrashings here, though. Despite preserving similar theses to Chopper such as; mistrust, confusion, obsession, fear of death, fear of life, fear of friend and foe, Dominik has approached The Assassination of Jesse James in a much more patient, less explicit and tantalising manner: integrating a host of prosaic, figurative dialogue that is given clarity, precision and cinematic cohesion by the consistently stunning aesthetics.With Roger Deakins on photography, the visuals couldn't really fail. Bringing a distinct element of experience to the production, Deakins is able to speak to the audience in visual terms using; wheat-fields, sunsets; land, snow and sky scape's as vividly and expressively as writers use words.Nick Cave's harmoniously soft yet menacing score further aids the subtle mood of the tale. How it failed to even be nominated for the Academy Award for best original score remains the bitterest of mysteries. Together with Deakins, though, the atmosphere created by the visual: audio components are as bolstering to Dominik's feature as the polished performances of his leading men. Least I forget Hugh Ross's pitch perfect omniscient narration- a character in its own right- which, quite simply, ties the entire motion-picture together with veritable sincerity and style.IN SHORT: Slow in places, stirring in others. Dominik's epic yarn will most certainly be met by the cold shoulders of many, but by the utmost respect of others. Laden with highly-convincing and even Oscar-worthy performances, The Assassination of Jesse James is as scenic and as a finely-tuned as any film in recent memory. Visually poetic. Lyrically distinct. Melodically immersing. But discreet it looks set to remain for many years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brad Pitt as an Actor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I have to say that this is an incredible story, made into an incredible movie, filled with a credible cast. Personally I have never been disappointed by anything I have seen with Brad Pitt. He is a phenomenal actor, and is the perfect person for an intensely bipolar cowboy. Casey Affleck really supported as the Coward, and I am amazed to this day by his performance. Having not heard of him before I was slightly concerned, but in the end he pulled it out. Enough with the actors, the film itself is beautifully shot, masterfully scripted, and well directed. It doesn't use dramatic music to heighten a scene's intensity, yet you can't help but feel the tension. The train scene with the light coming through the trees is incredibly brilliant. So far this is the best film I have had the pleasure of viewing. I look forward to more like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Don't that picture look dusty?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is beauty to be found everywhere in this world ? in the haunting loneliness of the deep American wilderness; in the glowing, brooding eyes of a man before a fireplace; in the subtle, nervous flicker of the eyelids, a barely discernible inflection of human interaction; even in the murder of a man, the bullet thumping shockingly through the back of the head, his neck slumping forwards into the frame of a polished canvas depicting a nautical vessel. The beauty is to be found in the details, in the magnificent unknown elements that fall between the lines of historical records and glorified parables. 'The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007)' is only the second film from Australian director Andrew Dominik, who spent five years crafting his intricate follow-up to the impressive local production, 'Chopper (2000).' Though originally intended for a 2006 release, the film arrived just in time for the Western genre "revival" that took place in 2007, the finest example from a group that included James Mangold's '3:10 to Yuma (2007)' and the Coen brothers' 'No Country For Old Men (2007)' {which some critics have described as a "modern Western"}.Even if you were to find little else worth mentioning in 'The Assassination of Jesse James?,' most will agree that it is among the most visually-stunning films you'll ever see, with Roger Deakins' sumptuous cinematography capturing the landscapes and moods of Jesse James' tale with breathtaking majesty. Every shot is elegantly and faultlessly composed and executed, offering a visual depth to the film that certainly complements the narrative {unlike Seamus McGarvey's work for 'Atonement (2007),' which was gorgeous but occasionally struck me as superficial}. The slow-burning plot is guided by the brilliance of the photography, but, rather than being overshadowed by the visuals, merges into a single entity that envelopes the viewer, absorbing them into the brooding world of both Jesse James and Robert Ford, the man who would put a bullet into his head. Though, on several occasions, I felt that the plot was deviating slightly from the vital interactions between James and Ford, a little patience convinced me that these elements of the story were nevertheless vital to the plot. The pacing of the 160-minute picture is deliberate, lyrical and contemplative, but never slow ? anybody who suggests otherwise was obviously viewing the film in the wrong mindset.The two characters highlighted in the film's lengthy title are portrayed with impeccable precision by Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck, respectively, who deliver performances equal to anything else they've ever done. In today's Hollywood, Pitt is an under-appreciated talent, too often berated for his "pretty boy" persona and often criticised for playing a version of himself. The latter is an easy mistake to make, however, a closer inspection reveals that Jesse James is like nobody that the star has played before. Though his performance doesn't initially stand out as being particularly notable, Pitt inhabits the infamous outlaw so convincingly that you hardly give him a second thought. Every gesture and movement ? his granulated blue eyes burning with fire and suspicion, his cautious and knowing tone of voice, his confident yet understated stride ? is perfect to the letter. Affleck, who is hopefully steering towards a Best Supporting Actor Oscar at present, portrays a lonely, pathetic sycophant, a seamless performance that is exemplified by the subtle nuances of his character, from the tentative Southern drawl to the frequent downward flicker of his eyes. Also worth mentioning is Sam Rockwell, who has a prominent role as Robert's brother, Charley.In criticising 'The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford,' some have cited the segments of Hugh Ross' narration for distracting from the plot. However, I thought it was very well suited to the tone of the film, highlighting one major theme of the story ? that history, as it is written, fails absolutely in reconstructing the events of April 3, 1882. Ross' narration is dry and professional, which, along with the occasionally cloudy cinematography, seems to be Dominik's way of stressing that the film's events are merely an assumed fictionalisation of real, ultimately unknowable events. The intentional encyclopedia-like tone of the voice-over could perhaps also operate as a critique of itself, a subtle satire that scorns the notion that any historical record could possibly communicate the mood and emotions of Robert Ford's relationship with Jesse James. Both mesmerising and entertaining, Andrew Dominik's memorable motion picture is one of the year's finest offerings, and possibly among the top ten to have been released this decade.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jesse James</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Epoch Movies sometimes fall into a pit, where the mechanics of moving back in time has more to do with showing characters dressed in the days of old and portraying social poses than conveying a genuine epoch feeling. This is of course arguable since the spirit of a time now dead is impossible to show; but maybe it can be emulated, suggested more than defined - and of course, the more vague it gets the more dependent it becomes of the viewer's own predisposition do see it, understand it or "connect" to it. For me "Jesse James..." works at this level portraying with accuracy something both palpable and vague that transcends the curiosities, the costumes, the surface of what we see ? the spirit rather than the materiality; very intimate, passionate and yet strangely detached. These were the men of the days that are gone. The awkwardness of those days bursts in the beginning, as a strange locomotive fills the the dark woods with light, and this synthesizes the overall mood for the picture: the direction, the cutting, the photography, the actors - and their meager lines -, are in a perfect unison.I remember "The Proposition" and the parallels that can be traced between (appart from Nick Cave): both movies use a similar visual technique, with long shots of the wilderness, small lines, subtle score and loose editing. The big difference is perhaps the voice over in "Jesse James...", a narrator that works almost like an historian and brings us closer to the characters and their inner feelings.Brad Pitt has good leading role ? the best in the last years ? looking a matured actor, and Casey Affleck has the first big opportunity to show what he's got ? and he delivers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes actors do their job, images are sometimes great. But that s about it. The story seems empty, the film is boring as hell and you only keep on watching it just because of the average advices : you wait to see what is so great in the movie and then you reach the end of it... Just feeling you loosed your time.There is not much more to say about it. But i have to complete more lines to be able to post this advice. So let s review who is Jesse James, and try to understand how you can turn a legend into a bad movie :Jesse Woodson James (September 5, 1847 ? April 3, 1882) was an American outlaw, gang leader, bank and train robber and murderer from the state of Missouri and the most famous member of the James-Younger Gang.How with such a background can you make a movie where nothing happens... You will discover it soon if you decide to watch it. Already a celebrity when he was alive, he became a legendary figure of the Wild West after his death.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Little Action And Limited Dialogue In A Movie Almost Totally Devoid Of Passion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I sat for almost three hours struggling to make it through this snooze fest I struggled to figure out how so many people can have so many good things to say about this movie. For some inexplicable reason, the longest and most boring movies often seem to be the most highly regarded (almost as if people think that there's some sort of artistic value in being able to put together a movie so long and yet so dull) but come on. For a movie with such a dramatic sounding title, this one is a major disappointment. There's very little action in it, the dialogue is extremely limited and delivered in a passionless monotone most of the way through, the sombre and slow musical score adds to the drudgery and even the narration is offered in a voice reminiscent of an elderly college professor who's gone over the same material year after year for decades and can't wait to retire and finally be rid of it. I thought Brad Pitt would put more energy into the role of the famous outlaw Jesse James, but he comes across as dry as the rest of the movie. Ben Affleck was maybe slightly more intriguing as Robert Ford but not much.The movie begins with the James gang's last major job and documents the beginning of the relationship between Ford and James. From the little I know about Jesse James the movie seems to be fairly accurate, but the focus of the movie is more on Ford and his gradual turning against James, leading up - as the title states - to James' killing. The look at Ford's life after James' killing was a bit interesting, although a lot was left out between the end of the stage show Ford and his brother put together that portrayed the killing and Ford's own demise (mercifully so, given the already excessive length of this production.) Needless to say, I didn't care too much for this movie. 2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The very first thing I noticed at the beginning of the film was the music by Nick Cave. I think he's found a good niche for his music composing for films. His last project, "The Proposition," while certainly different and a little more strange, was still haunting and gorgeous. Here in this film it sounded like Thomas Newman. In fact when I first saw the preview I could have sworn it was. A testament, I think, to the brilliance of his work.The next thing I noticed was the wonderful, dark, and crisp cinematography. The brown grass and black suits and red blood popped off of the screen. The train robbery scene truly did haunt the rest of the film. The lighting and angles movements were dramatic and perfect.I was surprised at Oscar season when Brad Pitt hardly got any attention at all. Maybe it was because of the subtleness of his performance, maybe it's the apparent ease at which he takes on a roll, with the seeming non-chalance he has with his gestures. Regardless, this performance like a few of his others was ambitious and well-done.Casey Affleck, in his break-out role, gave a performance that gave me the feeling that he was extremely uncomfortable in his own skin. And his boyish voice added to the nervousness I felt every time he appeared on screen. His nomination was well-deserved.I've read a lot of comments, here and in other places, about the length of the film. I honestly didn't notice. I was that involved. The editing and performances and the story all contributed to a riveting film. I loved every minute of it.I can't wait to see Andrew Dominik's next film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a snooze fest! I think there are certain actors that should reconsider their choice of a career in acting, the first that comes to mind, anybody with the last name of Affleck, Casey's whiney voice is enough to turn off the film, the second, Colin Ferrel, the third, Brad Pitt. This guy cannot act his way out of a paper bag. He is stoic, he is boring, he delivers his lines without inflection. This stole a great deal from the mood of the film. The film also could have done without the background narration. I thought that was useless and made this already boring movie even more so. All in all, the film, to me, was filled with actors I have no use or need for as actors. This may not make sense to anybody but me, however, if you consider watching this film, do so when there is absolutely positively nothing else to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think I will just come right out and say it from the off, this is a masterpiece, a truly spell binding, mesmerising tour de force that seeps class from every pore. I have often found myself cringing and turning my back on those who use in film debate the tired old defence of "it's not for everyone", but here I find I have no choice because this picture is purely for those enamoured with poetic beauty and precision film making at its highest. Those in search of an all action gun toting western need not apply, in fact those merely after popcorn fodder to while away an evening viewing should steer well clear. Andrew Dominik's second directorial effort is a character and dialogue driven piece of work, its thematic heart swirling with intelligence and elegiac beauty.The story centrers around the final days of notorious outlaw Jesse James, and how one of his young disciples came to murder him on April 3rd 1882. Using Ron Hansen's novel as its source, it also fills in the gaps as to what became of the murderer Robert Ford as regards the subsequent aftermath of killing the infamous Jesse James. The film is dealing with issues all to prevalent in modern day society, we are witnessing perhaps the first instance of celebrity status gone berserker, we see how the press glamorise the nasty piece of work that was Jesse James, turning him into some sort of quintessential noble outlaw. We observe a stalking menace yearning to be like his hero, a young and impressionable fellow who's hurtling towards infamy completely oblivious of the pitfalls and irony of it all.Structually the film is perfect, and to me the film defines the old saying of art on the silver screen. The performances of the lead actors are incredible, Brad Pitt gives a career high as Jesse James, all teetering villainy yet perfectly befitting the prince charming outlaw persona so gleefully built up by the press. Sam Rockwell is Charley Ford, and here he proves that movie big wigs really need to start giving the guy some more dramatic roles to get his teeth in to. Yet as good as Pitt &amp; Rockwell are, both men are left trailing in the wake of Casey Affleck's performance as Robert Ford, childish emotion fused with flecks of dark undercurrents as Affleck layers a perfect show. How the academy chose to ignore this performance should be seen as an act of treason against American cinema.Few films have left me open mouthed in admiration at the quality on show, but shot after shot, frame after frame, this really is as gorgeous as it comes. Roger Deakins photography sublimely pleasing the eyes at every edit, be it lush rolling hills cloaked in snow, or shadowy figures appearing like ghosts from locomotive smoke, with Deakins firmly cementing his reputation as a master of his craft. The score from Nick Cave &amp; Warren Ellis perfectly captures the ambiance and texture of the piece, with Cave himself bagging a cameo performance as a bar room busker. It's incredible to think that this is only director Andrew Dominik's second feature film, following on from the hugely enjoyable Chopper in 2000, it is now evident that New Zealand can lay claim to producing a talent that if all goes to plan, will go on to become a director to rank up with the best of them.As it is, and just right now, The Assassination Of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford should be filed along side Vertigo as a member of that club that only admits the greatest American films of all time, and that be even if it was directed by a Kiwi, wink wink America.Masterpiece 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had some lofty expectations for this film going in, and was not disappointed. I had already prepared myself for the runtime, and personally didn't have much issue with it. Sure, perhaps 15-20 mins could have been cropped, but I was enthralled. This is a brooding picture, the mood is dark and the scenery incredible. Possible awards nods for production design and cinematography are obvious, as well the stand out performances of Affleck and Pitt. This is an excellent character study and one of the best westerns of recent memory. People who are calling out this film for being boring or pretentious are probably the same ones who were calling "Transformers" the best movie of the year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen two modern westerns in close proximity: this and "3:10 to Yuma."The main thing that defines the western is the notion of the western grand spaces on men, always men, purifying certain traits and dynamics. From that you get specialized versions of the usual stories, often about honor and revenge.Within that there are few decisions to be made: which story, how pure, how close to cling to clich (not necessarily bad), and most importantly what balance to put on the man versus the place.Usually the decision is to focus on the man. That's served the Hollywood fame machine well for almost a century now. Its the choice made by the "Yuma" folks, and its pretty ordinary; the only difference is in this guy (Crowe) versus that one, say Wayne.The choice that was made here is far better. Its more abstract than usual. It pretends to be more focused on men than usual, two men as is the case with "Yuma." But in fact the emphasis here is on the place. Its the place, the spaces and visions that define the urges and qualities that these men absorb. It allows for the thing to be visually oriented and Deakins is up to the job. He learned this working for the Coens.The way this emerges is about story, Jesse (like Clyde Barrow) having become a legend through media exposure. The perspective is folded: we see a man who is cursed by what he sees of how others see him. (His undoing even leverages this: the historically accurate scene of him admiring a train picture and exposing his back.)The characters work, and the best we've seen Pitt in eons. But its the presentation of the world through what we see that matters. We enter the story not by getting the world by observing men and deducing the world; we see the world as they do and can see how it shapes them, and the tragedy we see unravel. Both this and "Yuma" celebrate the kernel of honor in an extraordinary thief. But here you are in on the shaping. Its a noir idea, and much more welcome than mugging in chaps.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably the most boring pretentious film I have ever forced myself to watch to the end.The only good part is the acting ability of Casey Affleck, if you would like to see him in a role that is complimented by a good script and fellow actors I would highly recommend "Gone baby, Gone" You will not be bored by this.Getting back to this rubbish, can any of the people giving this rave reviews please let me in on the secret to what they seen in it? It was probably an attempt to make some artistic masterpiece, if so I would recommend that they at least use a state that has dramatic scenery like Colorado or Montana. Also quite sure with all the escapades that the James boys got up to that at least one or two of these could have been thrown in, even if it was just to justify him being a much wanted outlaw. When you think of it apart from the English speaking countries, most people from other parts of the world probably had not even heard of him, he is not exactly a huge figure in world history.I don't normally comment on films but this one drove me to make it an exception.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A poorly directed film forgetting the most essential ingredient of any film, story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford" is a poorly directed film forgetting the most essential ingredient of any film, story. Andrew Dominik tries to develop rich characters, but sadly these portraits fall flat, because they are neither interesting nor consistent and do not develop over the course of the film.Although the actors are all brilliant in their own right, they are not directed in this film at all. In certain scenes they occasionally are overacting or in some cases under acting; yelling, brooding and crying if not earned by the story fail to communicate anything and come across as fake.Dominik doesn't create any emotional connect and/or bond between his audience and his characters. There is no story for us to follow the characters, therefore we are not rooting for them or against them, but merely observing them. Furthermore their reactions to things that would seem to be rather emotional are completely absent.For instance the scene when Robert Ford shoots Wood Hite in the head, everyone, including Ford's sister barely even blinks. There is no question that these are hard times and hard living people, but this very important plot point, the murder of Jesse James's cousin is treated with barely any reaction at all at the time of the shooting.Later in the film Jesse James shows up unannounced at the Ford household and now Dominik would have us believe that they are very nervous about the recent shooting, but whilst it happened no one reacted, except for Robert Ford's crooked smile as if he had done something special.The last twist in this sub-plot is that it never turns out to be anything. It is never discussed again, except for an unusual scene when Jesse James questions Charley Ford, "do you have anything to confess"? To which Charley Ford says "no". After that it is never brought up again and seemingly forgotten in the confusing tapestry of the film. It is all just too inconsistent and in a two-hour plus long film things have to be consistent and motivated if the director would like us to follow and care about the story.The real question is do we the cinema going public care about the characters? No. They do not change nor evolve, but remain the same opportunistic (Robert Ford), morose (Jesse James), and ignorant (the gang) bunch. There is no journey.As for the story itself it is disconnected, jumping around and missing throughout much of the film. Characters like Ed Miller, Dick Liddil and Jim Cummins seem important for a moment, but who are they? Why are they important? What do they add to the intrigue of the story? All these questions remain a mystery. Finally when the story focuses on Robert Ford and Jesse James's relationship (indeed there is a brief moment at the beginning, but it like much of the story is misplaced) the film is over an hour old and everything is so disconnected that barely anything makes sense.Another absolute failure of the film is the narration. The use of narration in the film is case and point of how it is cannot be employed as a substitute for story. The narration tries to fill in the gaps of story, but effectively does nothing except try desperately to sound poetic. Films are meant to be image driven, not by their voice over. If a story cannot be told with images then it should be written down and published not filmed. Worse still is when the narration tells us what we are seeing. In the scene just before Robert Ford kills Jesse James we follow the character through the house and the narration provides us a play by play of what we can already see. It never delves any deeper into the inner thoughts or workings of the characters. It fails completely to provide us any insight into what our characters are thinking. In fact one or two of the rare times when the acting and story are in our harmony and about to earn an emotional moment the narration arrives to spoil the scene. It is surprising how bad the narration in the film is and furthermore how awfully timed it is.As for the cinematography, Roger Deakins has done an excellent job. Of course their is the over use of several gimmicks. Such as the reoccurring distorted focus, but that can hardly be blamed on Deakins as much on the stylistic choices of director. There are several shots in the film where one feels that director is so in love with his shots that he cannot cut them our in spite of the fact that they do nothing for the story. A perfect example of this is the arrival of the train at Blue Cut; smoke, darkness, one light and all. These shots although stunningly photographed, like the acting feel forced and without motivation. It is there because it is beautiful not because it adds anything to the story.Rather than belabor the point about the film's poor direction, I suggest any reader interested in a great character piece, full of hope, story and emotion go and see "The Diving Bell and the Butterfly" (French title, which is the original, "Le Scaphandre et le papillon") directed by Julian Schanbel. This is one of the finest directed films in the past 10 years. It has already been released in France and is slated to be out in the States on November 30th. The first 15 minutes of this film are truly brilliant, because Schanbel masterfully puts us, the audience in the skin of the character Jean-Dominique Bauby. Thus linking our fate as the viewer to that of his main character's. It is a true triumph in film-making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie "The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford" is an indefinable movie creating extreme reactions after being watched. The terms describing it would vary from mesmerizing or deep to plain lackluster. The reactions can be justified if the traits of this iconoclastic work are considered. It's a western lacking the elements of western movies. It's a drama but at the same time includes few features of a comedy. Although the movie can be rightly identified with any of these genres, it's quite perceptible that limiting it to any of the given genres would be unjust.But the astonishing feat achieved by the director is beyond that since the prominence of the movie is revealed to the audience through characterization. The trap in which the movie shrewdly avoided being entangled was delving deep into the psyches of the characters and the transmutation undergone by them. The historical aspect of this depiction is just a faade of the story which is given out to the audience from the outset in the title. The movie succeeds in conflating the characteristics of the characters so as the cowardice of Robert Ford and the courage in Jesse James wouldn't have been comprehended without each other. It seemed as if the glorification granted on James was realized through the pusillanimity depicted by Robert Ford since he stood for the opposite of whatever the other one possessed. History has no way other than being biased on the side of the narrator for it is being told by a person. A person with a general tendency of the mind. This tendency can be modified but never eliminated since the narrator lives in a specific time with specific standards and moral codes. So, to put it in a nutshell, the narrated history can never be the real one because it is conveyed by the people already familiarized not only with the story but also with the idea of other people on the incident. The movie is well-aware of that and its attempt to negate the bias and didacticism implied in the story is twofold. First, the language used in the voice-over narration is literary and book-like unlike the everyday language of the characters. This contrast is an evident effort of the director reminding the audience of the storification of the incident. Second, the dream like scenes provided with blurry margins of the screen added to the elements of the untrustworthy narration since they were represented as memories. Masood Abdollahi</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very, very unwise decision to cast such a familiar star as Brad Pitt in the role of a historical person, specifically Jesse James.In this film, whenever the audience sees the Jesse James character on the screen, they see Brad Pitt, not Jesse James. Consequently, they experience zero immersion in the film.I had a similar problem with Brad Pitt in the film "Inglourious Basterds" (is it just a coincidence that both films have such cheesy titles? "the Coward"? incorrectly spelled "Inglourious" and "Basterds"? Come on!)By contrast, when I watched the films "Inglourious Basterds" and "Django Unchained", I didn't know the characters Col. Hans Landa and Dr. King Schultz respectively are both played by Christoph Waltz. He gets so deeply into his roles that he actually becomes the character, winning a "Best Supporting Actor" Oscar in both cases. What an excellent actor!!! (Maybe that explains Brad Pitt's problem; he has never won an acting Oscar.)</fullReview>

I don't say the actors were not good because they were but you can have the best actors in the world, if the story is lame the movie won't be great. I honestly don't get why so many people think this is the best movie ever. I guess they don't watch a lot of movies.

		<fullReview>There are a few good things I can write about this film. For instance, the cinematography was outstanding! The camera work, especially in regards to the face shots were truly works of art. Another positive part of the film was the narration. Obviously, from the title of the film, it was not a surprise that Robert Ford, who we meet early in the film, would bring about the downfall of Jesse James. What I appreciated about this film is that the Director (Andrew Dominik) didn't attempt to surprise us with the ending either. The narrative style proved a great vehicle for the film as it was told as a story recollecting the fall of a historic figure. One other thing that can be positively stated about the film was its score. Warren Ellis and Nick Cave crafted a beautiful score that highlighted the downfall of the once great power, Jesse James. The needlessly long story chronicles the final months of Jesse James life, and the boy who idolized him. I call Robert Ford, played by Casey Affleck a boy at 19 years old because his hero worship of Jesse James rendered him almost infantile. We meet Jesse James after his heists and notoriety had already consecrated him to the status of legend. Robert Ford, who has followed Jesse's "career" since he was a young boy arranges it for himself to meet Jesse's gang. After some finagling, and hard feelings from the other members of his gang, Jesse James let Robert Ford tag along with them. Each shift closer between the two brings about an increasingly uneasy feeling for the audience. This feeling could be attributed to the title and the well-executed score. We know what will end up of James and Ford, so each awkward interaction between them is even more heightened. Nevertheless, the film feels like an invitation to a star struck stalkers fantasy than a real friendship of any kind. As we watch Jesse's days come to a close, and see Robert's hero worship take over his mind we truly see the downfall of one giant, and one little boy. Even though the film had some great technical work, other aspects of the film overshadowed the technical beauties. For instance, Pitt's performance came off cardboard. I didn't believe him for the legend he was supposed to be, even if it was set in James declining days. Casey Affleck's performance also wasn't right. He mastered the portion of his character that was to be feared and retracted, but the times that he was supposed to have acted with leadership didn't fit at all. Every gunshot scene in this film was tragically overdone. I subscribe to the notion that a good film tells more of a story with what is understood than with what is seen. I am sure that a gunshot wound to the head would lead to a great deal of bloodshed; I don't need to see it, once or 8 times. There are many great westerns, even modern day filmed westerns, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, isn't one of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I keep being amazed how much in the minority I am. There has been universal praise for this movie. It's slowness didn't bother me, not after the first 15 minutes. Why is it that the slowest movies need to go beyond a run time of 2 and a half hours?Brad Pitt got upstaged in the acting department by Casey Affelck. His creepy smile and cowardly climax is part of history, destiny, and folklore. I've never found a modern Western gloriously lit and shot. If you're gonna portray the horses, the landscape as part of the cast, and portray women as things, you should make it a priority, resolution, or memo to pay close attention to the cinematography. Watching a drably shot Western is like watching a 3d film with one eye closed.I don't have any sympathy for either Robert Ford or Jesse James. The film stupidly makes us want to take sides, only to wink to throw the message in our faces that we don't get it. Despite the sheer shine on the surface of the movie, I felt it to be a bunch of footage cavalierly strung together. Each scene where there's tension ongoing feels like an isolated short movie the length of a commercial, surrounded by the narrator giving us info that sometimes is needed, but never is interesting. I'm giving this Western 2 stars. It's far, far away from dethroning the actual masterpieces of the genre. Hope this review has been of help.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never before have I had to watch a film 4 times before I got to the end, it's so boring it just kept sending me asleep. Young Guns, this film isn't.Much of that is to do with Ridley 'Epic' Scott, arguably the most overrated director around. He does the same thing which made other epics like Kingdom of Heaven such a turn off. Talking, plodding, a bit of action here &amp; there, more talking, plodding, repeat. Any film that goes over 2 hours in length better be Pulp Fiction or they end up the Lord of the Rings - slow, plodding, dull movies which take forever to get to the point.Take this film. We know from the stupidly OTT title that Casey Affleck's character is going to shoot the Brad Pitt one before we start viewing. So we wait, &amp; wait, &amp; wait. Finally it happens, 2 hours in &amp; that's it. Or should be, but like the 3rd LOTR movie, it keeps going on, &amp; on, &amp; on. Like the ring in those overrated postcard movies, once Jesse James is gone, it's film over - or should be. The extra half hour or so feels likes an elongated deleted scenes reel &amp; barely relevant to what went on.As for the acting, it's pretty dire too. Brad does his, 'look into my pouty blue eyes, I'm suddenly mad &amp; zany' act for the umpteenth time, whereas Affleck is one-trick wooden pony ('I'm 20, sir' as he tends to remind us enough).All in all, it's a vanilla type film. Pleasant on the eye, adequate to listen to &amp; won't offend anyone. However, it's a really, really bland &amp; boring experience, &amp; if I'm honest, I can't remember how it finished after Bob Ford's on stage breakdown after the 100th showing of his act. I fell asleep by that point so presume that was it. I'm not watching a 5th time as I have things to do &amp; can't afford the additional shut eye.One word review: Yawn.</fullReview>

This is another western that doesn't fit the mold. It is an art film in every sense of the word. From the brilliant cinematography by Roger Deakins, a seven-time Oscar nominee (Fargo, No Country for Old Men, O Brother, Where Art Thou?, The Shawshank Redemption, The Man Who Wasn't There, Kundun, and this film), to the superb acting in an ensemble that provide a thrilling experience for 160 minutes.Yes, Affleck was very good, and probably gave the performance of his career, but Pitt was clearly the star as Jesse James, a man possessed. He could go from friend to unemotional killer in an instant. He possessed an uncanny ability to discern the thoughts of others. He knew his time was over and committed suicide the only way he could. The film was an interesting study of the celebrity cult that we experience today. Ford would have been right at home in People, or Entertainment Weekly, as someone who had style, but no substance.If you are looking for bang, bang, shoot-em-up, look elsewhere. This is a film to be watched and studied.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Epic of American History</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Ford (Casey Affleck), who has idolized Jesse James (Brad Pitt) since childhood, tries hard to join the reforming gang of the Missouri outlaw, but gradually becomes resentful of the bandit leader.This film is a masterpiece of cinematographer Roger Deakins. Sure, Brad Pitt is hailed as a great actor (and he personally loves his work in it). And you have to credit the director, who made one of the most amazing cuts ever (around four hours). But this is Deakins.Getting the right look for a period film is a challenge. Part of it is the costumes and part of it is the language, but I think much of the job falls on the cinematographer to get the right colors, lighting and angles. And this was a success.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE ASSASSINATION OF JESSE JAMES BY THE COWARD ROBERT FORD I was expecting to like this film, but not love it... and that is exactly how it was. It was good, but not great. The story is in the title... it is the story of the outlaw Jesse James as told by the man who killed him. The story is really good, but it was stretched out in places. This film could have been 2 hours long and it would have been just as good... but instead it was on for 3 hours. There were a few bits of the story that I thought didn't need to be in there. It was very interesting to see how Robert Ford killed him... and if he did kill him the way they said in the movie... he is a coward. Back when the film was set, it was the done thing to make sure you are face to face... but Jesse James was shot in the back. The film stars Brad Pitt as Jesse James, Casey Affleck as Robert Ford, Sam Rockwell &amp; Jeremy Renner. The acting was really good... I liked Brad Pitt in this. He did a great job, but the best performance was Casey Affleck. He really played a dodgy character. He was not likable at all throughout the movie. The scenes where someone was killed was really well shot. The camera angles and the effects were really good. I will give this film 6 out of 10. A good story and entertaining, but too long and stretched out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Death Becomes Him</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rather grim and joyless tale from writer / director Andrew Dominik, starring Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck. There are powerful performances from the leads and a talented cast of players, but the real star is Roger Deakins' cinematography, and it is just as well that the film looks and sounds beautiful, because there is little to admire in any of the characters, despite what are clearly skilled performances. No doubt, this can be considered a suitably accurate portrayal, but does it make for rewarding viewing and a positive audience reaction? Setting aside the ability of Hollywood to repeatedly cast gangsters as colourful rogues, or at best, misunderstood or conflicted, rather than the killers and thieves that they are, there is still no-one here to root for, so when this or that character meets his end from time to time, don't be surprised to feel little but an abstract curiosity about the mechanics.As the film rolls on into another hour, even Mr. Deakins' beautiful pictures lose their ability to redeem the unrelieved uniformity of the pacing, and when there is an injection of tension at the promised conclusion, the discovery that this was not the end, but only an end was, for me, a disappointment. It is easy to admire style, but for true enjoyment, there must be substance, conflict, emotion. Where these are attempted by this story, it usually misses the target, and the surfeit of moodiness and brooding disquiet becomes wearing after a while.The script is unremarkable, and few of the cast are given much to do beyond spitting out some western stereotypes in a studied drawl. In the end, it seems reasonable that we take from the piece that the old west was a cruel and dangerous place, with more than its fare share of cruel, dangerous and greedy individuals, unwilling to make their way in the world through honest toil, and unwilling to respect the lives and property of others, but watching them kill each other for 160 minutes, no matter how beautifully filmed, is not an edifying experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I consume many movies and love all types of movies. Here are the warnings to anyone before they watch:Voice over is warning number one. A proper movie needs nothing else. Film noir uses it to entertain us with written source- not explain what is going on. 3 hour length is warning number two. Comedies can be one hour plus; great films can push to 2 hours plus (this is based on biology, not culture). The pacing of this film is inexplicable. It serves no purpose, so earns the adjective, "pretentious". Sam Rockwell/Charly Ford is the most interesting actor/character is warning number three. Brad Pitt is great, but in the end, not the real story. Casey Afflek is overwhelmed. He does some good and interesting things with the character, but they are buried in the 3 hours of footage. If somebody put a camera on my face for 3 hours, I would (accidentally) come up with some pensive/expressive/interested facial expressions/voices. Doesn't make me an actor. This is a great story and a great idea for a screenplay and it has solid professional actors in it. In this case, I would just judge that the director screwed it up. On this site, fans try to diminish the critics. I love westerns, I love art films, I love Brad Pitt, ...... I just don't love this film</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pitt and Affleck's acting pulls this through the second act dip</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1881 Jesse James (Pitt) was an outlaw. He was known to steal and murder. In 1881 he took part in his final train robbery, with his brother Frank (Shepard) and a new crew of his, after the death or arrest of his previous crew members. One of these new members is Charlie Ford (Sam Rockwell). Charlie's brother is Robert Ford (Affleck), a twenty year old in complete awe of Jesse James, being able to cite his stories and his trivia off the top of his head. He asks Jesse to join his gang and when Jesse accepts he does all he can to prove his worth, so much so that after the robbery Jesse asks Robert to stick around with him whilst the other members scatter across the country. Jesse seems to like the attention Robert puts on him. It makes him feel celebrity like. However after a while Robert's infatuation becomes too much and Jesse begins to wander about his new friend. He sends him off to join his brothers as the star struck Ford becomes too much.Over the next few months the Ford brothers live at home with two other gang members who are constantly at each other's throats. So much so that one day it ends in one of their deaths. Meanwhile Jesse scales the country, killing those who are likely to betray him. He finally catches back up with the Ford brothers and asks them to accompany him on a bank heist. They set off to Jesse James house, for refuge until the robbery will take place, where Jesse's brutality, unpredictability and intimidation shine through, turning Ford from one time stalker to a potential killer. Ford's new emotions toward Jesse and a huge reward prize over his head, leave Robert Ford only one option. An option he must take before it is too late.You may think I have given away too much there, but if you read the title you will realise I have not. We all know that the story is about Jesse James murder, and how he was betrayed by one of his most faithful partners, Robert Ford. This just shows you how and why it happened. You may already know if you have researched into this outlaw but if you don't this film is the exact story of his death, including the aftermath where Ford is labelled the coward.The film is really brought to life by the performances. There are other good things about it, but the best aspect is the acting talent. For starters Brad Pitt is fantastic. He plays James with a sense of mystery and fear. The look in his eyes allows you to register what he is thinking without giving too much away. He also starts off as charming and ends up as a man you hate. The performance alone does all of this, even the dignity shown in his death when he either realises that his time is up, or he is testing Robert Ford's bravery. The entire performance is one that shows us so much. One of Pitt's best to date. Sam Rockwell is also very good as the slightly brain-less Charlie Ford. His reactions when lying are realistic, and they make us feel as if he really is hiding something. Jeremy Renner also pops up in a small role and is also very good, except from when he is obviously wearing a fake beard. The surprise breakthrough however comes from Casey Affleck who seems every bit Robert Ford. He begins timid, stuttering through his lines, in awe of Jesse, and as the film continues you can physically see him hide deeper inside himself before plucking up the courage to commit his deed. The events shown after the death are some of Affleck's best work, where he expects applause for shooting his gang leader but is surprised to see himself branded a coward. His slide back into his cave is brilliantly shown by Affleck. He is a great acting talent and here he really shows it. The cinematography is also beautiful showing us some lovely shots in wide open lands to show how isolated these characters really are.The problem with the film then lies in the running time and the dire middle sector. The opening thirty minutes and the final forty five are great but the middle seventy minutes become dull. Too much time is spent away from the two leads, following characters that are not as integral to the plot. Sure they all have reasons for being there but we spend too much time concentrating on them when we really want to see the two leads. During the entire middle sector Pitt and Affleck hardly share a scene and they are the two you are really there to see.The acting of this film pulls it through the middle slump, and I only think that if the film was cut slightly it could have been better. The bookends of the film are riveting but the middle becomes boring and the film becomes a drag, which is a shame considering the positives within this film. People seem to slate Pitt's acting talents and I advise them to all watch this to see how good he actually is. They will also be pleasantly surprised to see a man with the surname Affleck actually can act.3 / 5For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not a bad film but I am one of those guys that just didn't like it at all. This is a good drama film but I was fooled into thinking this was a western. Then you add the time to this oh God three hours of a movie where there is hardly any action at all as a movie where I was expecting at least some shoot outs I got guys that point there guns at each other and nothing happen most of the time.The whole story is how Jesse James (Brad Pitt) was assassinated by Robert Ford (Casey Affleck). That is a true story which is cool how they execute it. The problem for me is I know nothing of Jesse James so when all the other characters are scared of him I have no clue why because I've never seen him do anything cool or ruthless.The acting is really good now saying that I couldn't stand Casey Affleck in this film I wanted him to die more then anyone but Pitt he is good in this I wish I saw more of him and less of Ben Afflecks wannabe actor brother.Overall if you are into dramas and don't mind slow films then this is for you and you will love it but me I can't see this over a rental.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i concur with all the other reviews on this board, this film has been mistreated by the critics, its a tout, fast paced , action packed thriller that pulls all stop, yup, everyone in cast is expandable,the tone of the film is very nihilistic, stark and gritty..it requires a amount of suspension of disbelief, but so does Dhoom 2 or Tashan , SarkarRaj or any other film that has released in past couple of years a lot have been said about the gore and violence in the film- which is true and works in the favor of the feel of the film..the splatter effects by using over inflated squibs are effective..And for the critics information Paul Schneider or Aryan Babbar or Jonathan Erich Drachenberg are not wasted in there small roles, only a idiot will compare a role with the screen time instead of effectiveness..the idea was to make characters out of star and not make stars out of characters...its progressive, but Indian mindset (read critics) still don't seem to be ready for it..maybe thats why, if Steven Segal is dispatched in the middle of "Executive Decision" the element of surprise is applauded but if the similar thing happens in the Old West, critics don't appreciate it..I thought Aaryan Babbar was very effective in a small role without any lines and so was Deepal Shaw..they both made me feel bad when they got shot. Also unlike Sehar..this film also belongs to the little child in Kabir Kaushik who has seen too many Hollywood films (with CIA operative working for the agency as hired assassins)when he was growing up..the bronco busting,the training, usage of terminology like "ETA" , "Locking the Position", "The target is Moving"..but its alright, who really cares..its not based on a true story..is it..yea i do agree..Priyanaka Chopra track was badly needed, but rest of the film is a noteworthy attempt in taking the cinema to the hard boiled action roots that used to be its forte in late 70's and early 80's and then it got lost between all those romcom and brainless comedy..this surely is a boyz film,..thats why i can understand why some panzee's didn't like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Modern fandom complexities &amp; character studies, set in the Old West... have seldom looked so poetic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title says it all. This is the more unheard of "legends" of the man who both idolized and shot the infamous outlaw Jesse James. I'd be reluctant to call it a Western, because foremost, we get a male character study flexing many muscles and nuances, that seems to just happen to be set in the old west. Yes, there is gun-play but that's not what made the filmmakers get this ambitious drama off the ground, for sure. The modern complexity of idol fandom and fame coveting, (which is unnervingly reminiscent of such famous cases as the John Lennon &amp; Ronald Reagan shootings) plus the film's psychological character interplay very much discloses this fact.Told most elaborately and poetically, writer/director Australian Dominik has made sure it almost never gets too boring, though, as every scene is as artistically shot as a wall painting. The West has seldom looked both so rugged, flamboyant and beautiful as here, as those snow scenes will stay long on my retina! And if that doesn't do the trick, pitch-perfect performances are plenty to enjoy, with Affleck delivering a haunting and unforgettable portrait of Ford.A note to the ones watching this who are having trouble with languid pace and atmosphere: stick with it, because those final 20 minutes is a masterful showcase of more trimmed, riveting storytelling underlining the story's double tragedy. Biggest flaw which holds back my higher rating: It IS overlong by at least half an hour and an already fine movie would have been great, if cut down.7 out of 10 from Ozjeppe</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captures all the mood and atmosphere of the good western, but not always engaging</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning In the early days of motion pictures, the western was at the pinnacle of it's game, being the landmark of American cinema and capturing the idyllic image of the 'cowboy' as the fearless hero with a no nonsense attitude and a grizzled image, giving the world the first 'big screen hero' in the shape of John Wayne...and this would last through out the years as those like Lee Marvin and Clint Eastwood would take over the template and keep the legend alive. Nowadays, it's a rarity...although films like the re-make of 3:10 to Yuma and Ed Harris's Appaloosa do come by, in modern times it's a defining genre of cinema that's pretty much been allowed to fall by the wayside. Andrew Dominik's mouthful of a title is an attempt to revive this type of film is a lengthy, ambitious and fairly heavy piece that has all the right ingredients at hand in terms of mood, atmosphere and slow, lingering tension that somehow fixate our eyes on the main characters...but fails to really craft a truly absorbing or coherent story that is a problem when it's demanding your attention for so long.As deep and as dim as it is, it's trying to engage you more in the characters than the plot, and so it befalls the performers to bring the show to life. In the lead role as the main titular character, Brad Pitt has the job of bringing the fire and madness inside James's soul to life, as he displays signs of losing control and going completely over the edge, yet still manages to remain the most elusive outlaw in the United States. As the second titular character, as the young pretender Ford, Casey Affleck shows early signs of promise before his break through role in brother Ben's Gone Baby Gone, as the hopelessly infatuated young man who can't spin a line to any of James's associates and can never prove himself as a true man. Both are well cast, and are complimented by quite a supporting cast including Sam Rockwell, Sam Shepard, Jeremy Renner and female players in the shape of Mary Louise Parker and Brooklyn Proulx.It's a film that opened to great critical acclaim but limited box office success...the reason may be it had all the right elements in place, but couldn't use them in the right way to engage it's audience. In a day and age when this genre has far less gravitas, this is a deadly mistake to make. ***</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is by far one of the best portrayals of a real American icon. Such beautiful acting and cinematography can't be topped for a film of this genre. Countless other films based on historical figures always romanticize their stories making it extremely biased and oftenly provides many inaccurate details. Lets face it, we can never tell a story exactly the way it actually happened and many also fail in capturing our interest through out the entire film. However, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford feels so true to life because is so in touch within our humanity and accurately shows light and darkness within ourselves. You are being reminded that people like Jesse James and Robert Ford are not heroes or villains, they are just human. This film is extremely powerful and I highly recommend it for those who wish to see a true masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Assassination of Jesse James..." is visually stunning but....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The extended title of this film, "The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," gives advance notice to viewers of the long journey yet to come. Although visually stunning and shot with an eye for historical accuracy and detail, the ponderous direction of Andrew Dominik eventually undermines most of the good features and fine acting on display here. Brad Pitt makes for an intriguing and cold-blooded Jesse James and Casey Affleck matches him with a nuanced performance as Robert Ford, the man who kills him. At first obsessed with the outlaw James and guilty of hero-worshiping, Ford's opinion of him gradually evolves into loathing. Too bad it takes Ford over two hours of film time to arrive at that conclusion and finally pull the trigger on him. Along the way, the story plods on and on, leaving most of its audience in a catatonic state. Mary-Louis Parker is also around as Jesse's wife Zee, and she does her best in a role that only requires her to have one pivotal scene near the end. Sam Rockwell also does fine work as Charlie Ford, Bob's somewhat imbecilic brother and reluctant accomplice. James Carville has a nice cameo as Missouri Governor Crittenden and shows off some hidden acting chops. Sam Shepard can be spotted in a few early scenes as Frank James and then is seen no more---to the detriment of the movie."The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford" is one of those films that could've used a first-class editor and a more compact script to get its point across. To add to the tediousness, the film doesn't even end with the murder of Jesse James. Instead, it labors on for another half hour and finishes with Robert Ford's own violent death. Somewhere during this long journey of a movie, director Dominik forgot how to say the word "CUT!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't expect an adventure, thrill ride, get you out of your seat movie when you watch this. This movie is 160 minutes long. It is a bit like watching Jeremiah Johnson. It is set in the backwoods of the plains states (particularly Kansas, Missouri, and Colorado). Nature is very much a part of this film, and much of it is set in dreary winter.The characterizations are very earthy. None of the characters are particularly likable. Frank James is rather dour. Jesse James is not a nice man, especially when he beats up a boy. He is paranoid, arrogant, and dangerous. The antihero, Bob Ford, is probably the most likable of characters. Even he is not heroic, nor likable.I suppose that is the point of this movie. They talk about the Bible (both Bob Ford and Jesse James are children of Baptist ministers), but know that they are not worthy of a seat in Heaven. In fact, they kid each other sarcastically throughout the movie about this (Don't play holy with me, etc.).There is an interesting relationship between the two. They are almost like two sibling rivalry brothers. In fact, I think the Fords and the James were cousins of some sort. The real Jesse James was the son of the wealthiest slave owner in Missouri. The Civil War devastated the James family, and had everything to do with turning them into renegades .Jesse James is arrogant, moody, deadly, and ever watchful. No one feels safe around him, because they know that at any moment he can unearth some secret betrayal/plot. In fact, a Marshall warns Bob Ford to never turn your back on him.Bob Ford is the runt of the litter. He wants to prove his worth, but is dismissed as young, immature, and odd. He changes almost imperceptibly from a naive, loudmouth boy to one who is stoic and resentful of James. Jesse James realizes that he messed up when he beat up one of the Ford clans' young boys. It was a cowardly act by James picking on a boy. I think that Bob Ford never forgives him for picking on his younger brother or cousin (I never figure out which).You feel a little sorry for James, because he is gunned down at the most innocent point in his life (the moment he finally lets down his guard and appears to finally trust the two Ford brothers who are the remnants of his gang. The last twenty minutes of the film are about how Bob Ford profits from his death, and then grows to regret his action.I suppose a big mystery that movie leaves is how much of it had to do with Bob Ford's jealousy, his cowardice, and his need for self-preservation. When James reads a newspaper that George Liddle, a former member of his gang, has collaborated with the police, it is almost a certainty that James knows that Bob Ford was also secretly collaborating with the authorities. Does Bob Ford shoot him, because he knows that James will get him soon, for fame, because he is angry about how James dealt with members of the Ford clan, because he himself hopes to takeover, or because he wants to play good guy. The movie does a decent job of leaving that up in the air.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A visually sumptuous Western bio-myth...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>..."The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford" is Aussie auteur Andrew "Chopper" Dominik's sophomore effort, and a fine one it is thanks to an intelligent, compelling screenplay, strong production values, and top-rank acting all around. Though shot in Canada, the film captures late 19th century America with a painter's vision. The photography by the esteemed Roger "Sid and Nancy" Deakins veers at times into the territory of exquisite, especially in conjunction with the powerful score by Nick "Birthday Party" Cave and Warren "The Road" Ellis. The story centers on the odd relationship of the title characters: the one a charismatic bandit, a family man on the run, the other an idolatrous youth who becomes far more invested in his anti-hero than he ever imagined. Brad "You have to ask?" Pitt portrays James with suitable gravitas and sympathy, while Casey "Soul Survivors" Affleck surmounts the obvious age disparity between himself and the character he plays with a fully nuanced performance that simultaneously attracts and repels, easily earning his Oscar nomination for the role. The supporting cast is strong as well, notably in the persons of Sam "Galaxy Quest" Rockwell as Charlie Ford, Garret "Deadwood" Dillahunt as Ed Miller, and Paul "Elizabethtown" Schneider as Dick Liddil. Sadly, Mary-Louise "Grand Canyon" Parker is mostly wasted as James' wife, and Zooey "Almost Famous" Deschanel likewise as a minor character. Of even greater interest to me was the definite suggestion that James recognized Ford as the agent of his own conflicted suicidal tendencies. Opinions I've read elsewhere of a homo-erotic subtext between the two characters are, I think, unwarranted. Regardless, "...Jesse James..." is cinematic art of a high order, despite its novelistic, episodic nature (c.f. the voice-over and various flashbacks), and highly recommended by this reviewer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford 9-3-08 Don't read the title of the film unless you want to be spoiled...oh wait too late. Yeah that seems to be the point. When people speak of films often the endings are brought up as the tipping point between good or bad. So much is made of having that "good" ending. What constitutes good seems to be a matter of taste. The girl getting the boy or the bad guy getting put away by the square jawed hero. What if when you sit down to view a film you already know exactly how its going to end...that by traditional standards it will end "badly"? Such a film would have to be more about the journey wouldn't it? TAOJJBTCRF is all about the journey to that moment the title prophesied. Its also a film concerned with the dispersity that exists between celebrity/legend and reality. Jesse isn't Robin Hood with a six shooter and Robert isn't the treacherous villain...the truth lies somewhere in between. Casey Affleck gives an incredibly nuanced performance that is quite literally a show stealer. Everyone else is on time as well including Mr. Pitt and Sam Rockwell. Visually the film is contemplative...filled with time elapsed shots of the clouds, lushly photographed western vistas and sets that feel authentic. The pace of the film reminds one of a novel rather than short story. It takes its time and to those with a.d.d. might be labeled "borring"</fullReview>

If that wasn't already true, James's tactics only hasten the end that will come to him by way of Robert Ford (Casey Affleck).The performances are good for the most part but I didn't think much of Brad Pitt as Jesse James. He didn't convince me that James was a character whose fate I should care about in the least. Casey Affleck's Robert Ford, on the other hand, showed an interesting blend of hero worship and spite and was certainly worthy of the Oscar nomination that resulted. Also, the underrated Sam Rockwell gave a noteworthy performance as Charley Ford.The film looks attractive, although some of that imagery is snatched practically verbatim from other films like "The Searchers". I feel that the main detraction from the film's overall appeal is in the storyline. The film performs well as a character study but the plot falls flat until the late stages when some life is finally injected into the proceedings. Nevertheless, the film is undeniably interesting when, at the end, you step back to take a look at the big picture.I recommend this film to fans of the Western genre but those more interested in straight drama will likely get the most out of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heroism Is In the Eye of the Beholder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How sad and painful the story of Robert Ford is and how grimly telling it is of the shallow and insensitive nature of people as a mass. It is a western, yet it's a very patient and ominous western that plays out more like a Terence Malick film than a John Ford or Sam Peckinpah one. Westerns, by the very nature of the backdrop they set for their stories, portray primitive and unwittingly obsolete ways of life confronted modern technological or social changes. This may be depicted by showing conflict between natives and settlers, or by showing ranchers being threatened by the Industrial Revolution. American Westerns of the 1940s and 1950s emphasize honor and sacrifice. Westerns from the 1960s and 1970s have a more negative examination, lionizing a disloyal anti-hero and bringing to light the cynicism, viciousness and discrimination of the American West. The earlier westerns skim the glorious surface of the time and the later ones dig deep into the brutal nature of people in the era, but neither approach is bad. However the typical American-made western uses these elements to tell a simple morality tale that leaves room for barfights, shootouts and the salvage of helpless, entirely dependent damsels in distress. The Assassination of Jesse James By the Coward Robert Ford exceeds this by combining the two views and creating a dark, cruel portrait of a dark, cruel time. When the movie ended, I sat staring at the screen, my thoughts entirely arrested by what I had just watched.The only aggravation of which I can think is the film's narration, which gives away subtext right as we would be absorbing it just as clearly without the narration. Sometimes the narrator is needed, sometimes it appears that the narrator baby-steps us through a scene that might be too hard for our little brains to comprehend. I still dismiss it with the wave of my hands, however, because it is there more for the purpose of setting old storyteller sort of feel of the time, and storytelling is the axis of the lives of both Jesse James and Robert Ford, and how they came to meet.Brad Pitt's portrayal of Jesse James is greatest performance, bar none. He is so chilling, not only because he can alternately appear so convincingly vulnerable and lethally menacing uninterrupted from one moment to the next, but also because he gives you the distinct worrying impression that he could truly live a life completely alone, leaving a thorough variable for the outcomes of anyone in his presence. There are many scenes with James where the most telling things he does are very difficult to script and were likely moments where the actor is given to impulse and improvisation. These happen to be some of his best scenes because Pitt renders him with a very clear and acute understanding of his careful, private, manipulative, sensitive personality. In a moment when someone lies to him, well or not well, Jesse doesn't make a very telling face. Pitt simply wears a blank, expectant expression that opens up a gash in the scene where we feel just as certainly as he does that what's just been said doesn't fit. He radiates a subsequent awkwardness to all around him, including the audience, and he somehow seems untouched by it, the only person still appearing comfortable in the room.There is an almost frighteningly natural chemistry between Casey Affleck, who plays the weak yet eager and ambitious Robert Ford, and his idol, Jesse James. His submissive yet obsessive character, hungry for attention and admiration, and James's calmly dominant and sadistic ambiguity towards him is epitomal of real, searing, almost borderline sexual connection between two people who were almost bound by fate to meet and affect each other.Sam Rockwell, one of the most lovable, natural and underused actors working right now, is always a delight to see, his trademark happy-go-lucky imperviousness creating great spark as Robert Ford's older brother Charley, who laughs along with Robert's tormentors but very slowly reveals a more concerned side when his dense mind begins to realize that it's not all fun and games.Andrew Dominik is an auspiciously promising new filmmaker whose successive efforts will hopefully equal this beautifully shot, giftedly atmospheric, all too real masterpiece, but it's difficult to fathom whether or not they could exceed it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Revisionis Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like all of the great westerns since John Ford this is a film about western films as much as the west itself. Long and leisurely, by the time it starts Jesse James is already part of a mythological west being sold to impressionable young men like Robert Ford. Ford gets close to the myth and becomes part of it himself. Starting brilliantly with a train robbery the film proceeds to deconstruct the myth and in doing so takes it's place alongside "Unforgiven" and "The Wild Bunch". Brad Pitt has never been better than as Jesse James, he remains a mystery somewhere between an outlaw and family man. Acting honours go to Casey Affleck, just as in "Gone Baby Gone" he shows how effective quiet acting can be. Beautifully shot and scored. This is up there with "No Country For Old Men" as the best US cinema had to offer in 2007.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is one of the most touching and beautiful movies I've ever seen. Now... this movie is marked as "western", but don't expect to watch a action - packed classic western with "good, bad and ugly" outlaws with shotguns and revolvers shooting each other. The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is a "elegic western", a story about last living days of notorious robber and murderer Jesse James and his friendly relationship with young and idealistic Robert Ford, who in the end killed Jesse (shot him in the back) and became the most famous "coward" in the history of wild west.About Robert Ford: I don't look at him as a coward. This movie is trying to show the same thing; that Ford was just a confused young man, who adore Jesse James, but on the other hand he discovered his true nature as a paranoid killer, who doesn't have any remorse whatsoever. I'm sure a lot of people would do the same thing in Fords shoes and pull the trigger. And this movie clearly shows that; that Ford killed Jesse, but on the other hand Ford never really wanted to kill him, he regretted his decision to the rest of his life.Everything in this movie is perfect; excellent acting (Affleck is in my opinion much much better than Brad Pitt, who is playing the same guy the same way over and over again), superb photography, excellent script and very touching music. This is not an old fashion western, but very deep, emotional and tragic movie about the last days of an American hero, which Jesse James become after his death.For me,The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is one of the best movies in 2007.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"And the omens promised bad luck, which moated and dungeoned him."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What's incomprehensible to me is why this film didn't gain any traction during it's initial theatrical run. I couldn't even a locate a theater within fifty miles that was showing it and had to wait until this week to get my hands on a library copy. Which points to another problem - I never even saw this picture come out for sale in any of the major retail outlets, and I'm in a Walmart at least four times a week.I just watched "The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford" twice in two days, back to back. It's a stunningly visual film, with cinematography that will take your breath away. Two scenes that stand out for me include the dark of night arrival of the Blue Cut train, and Jesse (Brad Pitt) riding into the sun after the exchange with young Albert Ford. It's apparent that cinematographer Roger Deakins was after a certain look for the film, and the result is poetry in pictures.As for the story, it balances an intense character study of nineteen/twenty year old Robert Ford against the dynamism of one of the nineteenth century's most famous historical figures. That Jesse James was an outlaw is almost besides the point. For Bob Ford (Casey Affleck), Jesse was a larger than life figure who he worshiped from an early age; to meet and ride with him was almost beyond his comprehension. The scene that best conveys Ford's hero worship came when he described the similarities between himself and Jesse at the dinner table of the Ford homestead. That scene among many others convey just how masterfully Casey Affleck portrayed the troubled soul of his character.So I'm watching the scene of Bob Ford in his meeting with Governor Crittenden, and I'm saying to myself - boy, the governor sure looks a lot like James Carville, famed Democratic strategist and loyal Clintonista. Having to satisfy my curiosity, I look up the credits and WAIT!!!, that IS James Carville!! Where in the world did that casting decision come from? And you know what? He wasn't that bad!!Without hesitation, I'd recommend this one to all Western movie fans because of it's treatment of a renowned historical figure, and also to non-Western fans for the intensity of the personal stories on center stage. My second viewing of the movie seemed even quicker than the first, and at two hours, forty minutes, that's no mean feat. What makes the film even more compelling is the follow up to the actual event of the title, as Bob Ford's brush with fame and notoriety is examined right up until his own eventual undoing. Here's hoping that "The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford" experiences it's own revival of sorts so that more film goers can enjoy the complexity and wonder of this stunning picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Do not be put of by its long bloody name its a immense movie! This is just wow! The story is told as if someone is reading a autobiography about Robert Ford, Jesse's killer. The film starts with the James gang getting ready for there last heist. Robert Ford a 19 year old that has idolised Jesse James since he was a child joins the gang for their last heist as the James gang. After the Train robbery the James gang goes there separate but end up movie to Kentucky as they are wanted by the law. Jesse becomes paranoid and creepy as he thinks everyone is out to get him. Robert joins up with Jesse and his own brother with planes to rob banks, murder and just be outlaws well thats what James thinks, but Robert wants the reward on his head for the robbery of the train and the murder of 19 people. The movie shows the first day that Robert meets Jesse James; to the day he is assassinated. The performance from Brad Pitt is amazing but has nothing on Casey Afflicts performance of Robert Ford. In some parts of the film he was so good he scared the hell out of me! That does not happen very offend. This move is brilliant! If you have not seen, it go watch it now! You will not e disappointed! I give it 9.5 out of 10!!! Oh and its got large calibre revolvers in that blow people apart so if that not a reason to go watch it I do not know what is!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gorgeous, rich true-life portrayals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although as long as its title is unwieldy, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is (apparently) true to life and is the beneficiary of a smart, uncharacteristically supporting performance by Brad Pitt as the folk-hero villain and a strong, if a bit mannered, performance by Casey Affleck as his eventual killer.It's the latter days of the James Gang, and weary older brother Frank (Sam Shepard) is calling it quits after one last train robbery. Jesse's not so inclined, though, so he assembles a new crew of cutthroats, including the Ford brothers, Charley (Sam Rockwell) and Bob (Affleck). But all the while, Jesse is always looking over his shoulder, sure that someone's about to cut him down, perhaps even someone from his own gang. It doesn't help that he's written terroristic telegrams to governors and presidents alike, either.The story's told through the eyes of Bob Ford, a stammering young man who strongly idolizes Jesse to the point of carrying around a shoebox of dime novels about the legendary outlaw and knowing all sorts of arcane facts about Jesse. Not surprisingly, to Jesse and the rest of the gang (including Bob's brother Charley), this seems childish and downright pathetic, and consequently they don't give the young Ford much respect.This attitude leads to a strange mixture of resentment and continued idolatry on the part of Robert Ford. Should he continue to try to ingratiate himself with Jesse, or should he turn him in to the authorities? Turning him in might make him a hero - the one man who could fell Jesse James - but then he'd really lose whatever remaining respect Jessie had for Bob. (To Bob's thinking, he's one of Jesse's pals.) Affleck's Oscar-nominated performance is wonderful, walking the fine line between hammy and nuanced. A less-capable actor (or, perhaps, an actor less on top of his game) might have taken Bob's idiosyncrasies and run with them, played them up rather than muting them somewhat, making them feel more natural. You get the sense that although Bob is not a good man by any means, he is human in his actions and reactions; he can be a cold-blooded murderer and thief, but how he deals with each minicrisis is neither insincere nor cartoonish. It might be a testament to Affleck that he's able to make something out of the relatively dull character of Robert Ford.Brad Pitt is simply Brad Pitt. He's come a long way since movies like Legends of the Fall and A River Runs through It; he's now a Good Actor, not just a beefcake model, and he's effectively menacing and confusing as James, who was (the movie says) going a bit off the deep end in his waning years even without having to deal with the specter of betrayal. James is sad, excitable, angry, dissonant, and Pitt is up to the task. Weirdly enough, though, although Jesse James is the nominal subject of the movie, Pitt takes a backseat to Affleck. This isn't about romanticizing the lawless West and the tough fiends who populated it; it's about dreams crushed and comeuppance delivered.At more than two and a half hours, this is not a broad, unsubtle look at real-life events, and it's not always easy to watch. James is not only not presented positively, he's shown as a realistically diabolical criminal, not just some pretty boy with a lot of "cute" facial hair. Multilayered characterizations and sweeping, Oscar-nominated cinematography make this an effective Western.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An epic, sprawling splendor of cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Assassination of Jesse James is an epic, sprawling splendor of cinema, right from its title and through its near-three-hour running time. Dominik and everyone else involved have taken a huge chance with this, as it is a creation that could so easily go wrong, lose its focus, wander off and leave the audience apathetic and bored. Luckily for Dominik, he has the best the cinematic craft has to offer in order to help him along. Starting from perhaps some of the best use of voice-over narration since American Beauty, Dominik manages to capture us and draw us into the whirlwind that is the life and times of Jesse James. Like in Terrence Malick's films, the plot takes backseat to atmosphere, character, and beauty. The film is not about the last robbery of the James brothers, nor is it about the course of their lives after the train robbery that opens the film. Thinking back, I'm finding it increasingly difficult to even recollect any major plot points in the film; certainly not enough to fill its entirety. What interests Dominik are his characters, namely those of Jesse James and Robert Ford but also many others surrounding them, and their ever-changing relationship and dynamics leading up to James' inevitable, title-featured assassination. The film portrays an atmosphere, feelings, musings and character far more than it presents a tangible, developing plot.Extraordinarily for a sophomore film project, especially that of a foreign director, Dominik surrounds himself with the finest cinematic craftsmen Hollywood has to offer. In true Malickian form, Dominik allows these technical, visual aspects to occasionally take center stage and further accentuate the feelings, character emotions, and the atmosphere he is trying to evoke. What particularly stands out is the absolutely stunning cinematography by now-legend Roger Deakins, easily one of the greatest cinematographers working in Hollywood today and second only to Emmanuel Lubezki and Janusz Kaminski in my opinion. Like Malick's two Western masterpieces, Badlands and Days of Heaven, but also featured prominently in his two more recent subsequent features, Dominik embellishes his film with extended shots of the beautiful, wide-open vistas of the rolling fields and wide-open spaces of the 19th century American frontier.Dominik did not only luck out on his technical team, but also with his wonderfully talented acting troupe. His two leading men, one a long-time Hollywood A-lister and the other surely a shoo-in for the same list in the very near future, deliver exquisite, powerful work that is a peak for both of their careers. Brad Pitt, the veteran, observed in a recent interview that he seems to be getting better with each subsequent film role and finds his older work incomparable to his more recent efforts. I have to admit, the man has a point. Although stellar in Twelve Monkeys and Fight Club, Pitt also excelled at delivering bland, single-note performances in films such as Seven Years in Tibet or Meet Joe Black. Recently he has been truly out-doing himself and if his subdued, grayed turn in last year's Babel was the best performance he had delivered up until that point, he manages to even exceed that with his incredible, powerful, dominant role as Jesse James. Pitt nails every little quirk in James; his mannerisms, his ticks, his glances and smirks. His performance is so powerful it dominates the entire film even during extended sequences without his character. But the true stunner is Casey Affleck, who has appeared in smaller background roles in his brother's previous movies but has had two chances this year to truly shine. If Gone Baby Gone seals his abilities as a strong leading man, The Assassination of Jesse James, while not a lead role, certainly seals his undeniable talent as an actor. It is one of those performances that is so exhilarating and entrancing to watch, one can't wait for the character to return to the screen and relishes every moment with him. Another powerful characterization, Affleck absolutely nails the kind of na?ve, wide-eyed wonder of Robert Ford, and his interactions with Jesse James; his sheepish grins, his feeble attempts to impress, his embarrassment. It is an incredible, powerful performance that were it not for Javier Bardem would surely be a lead contender for the best supporting performance of the year. Also worth a mention is the criminally underrated Sam Rockwell, who in movie after movie is able to deliver wonderful, fascinating turns. How his leading turn in Confessions of a Dangerous Mind didn't transform him into one of the most reliable leading men on the scene is way beyond me, and I look forward to all of his work. He manages to inject just enough of himself in all of his roles while still remaining loyal to the source material. I hope his big break is on the way.This year saw a revival and an abundant resurgence in two old-Hollywood film genres; the musical and the Western. Between this, 3:10 to Yuma, and the less traditional There Will Be Blood and No Country for Old Men, one could very easily attribute this year as the year of the Western renaissance. It's no coincidence that these four titles are also among the best of the year. I have not seen his previous effort, Chopper, but The Assassination of Jesse James is enough for me to certify Andrew Dominik as a directorial force to be reckoned with. The film truly stands out in a year abundant in excellent sophomore films (for example, Juno and Atonement, just to name a couple), and although not quite the masterpiece it wants to be, it certainly comes as close to it as possible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jesse James (Pitt) is wary of his new gang since the old gang was either dead or in prison, and he knows something is up. After all there is a large reward on him, dead or alive, and he is retired now?..more or less. I thought the title was too long, and then I saw the movie and the title is exactly right. This is perhaps the most comprehensive story about Jesse James, and Robert Ford. All we ever heard in the past was that James went to fix a picture on the wall and Ford shot him in the back. That's all we ever heard until now.The story is slow, there is narration, and some scenes linger but all are necessary and artfully done. It's like watching a Ken Burns documentary come to life (Burns did excellent documentaries for TV on the Civil War, American Baseball, Jazz, WWII and many more using narration and still pictures that were available for the times) or reading the novel without actually reading the novel, but getting the full flavor of the novel. Say what? Now all of this couldn't have been experienced if it wasn't for the novel by Ron Hansen.There is no language in the movie but the new gang members, in the beginning as they sat around a camp fire, do use code words to describe a woman's parts. It wasn't necessary, not funny and they were probably incorporated to give us a sense of outlaw camp-fire talk, I suppose. Also, when the gang robbed the train (their last), most actors had troubles with keeping their bandanas on over their noses. Kind of funny now that I think about it. Casey Affleck did a great job (an Oscar performance? Maybe) as Robert Ford, but let's face it, he looks so much like brother Ben, that sometimes you see Ben when watching Casey. They look so much alike and have similar facial contortions. Maybe a mustache would help. Mary-Louise Parker was wasted here but maybe she just wanted to be in the movie at any cost. James Carville (political analyst) was good as the governor. Sam Shepard, as Frank James, was in and out so fast you hardly knew he was in here. The performances of the rest of the cast were excellent. As for Brad Pitt, he was Jesse James in every sense of the word that we have come to fantasize about. Can't get better than that. Yes, a great story. Violence:Yes; Sex:NO; Nudity:No; Language:No</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fine acting, brilliant photography, and many simple, truthful moments are undermined by Andrew Dominik's tendency to repeat himself. As in his frequently excellent CHOPPER, he here allows an interesting first act to degenerate into a meandering second and redundant third. Basically he reveals all his cards too soon, leaving nothing really important to happen later. Remember, class: if the audience is ahead of you, you might be moving too slowly.A tone poem can be a fine thing - BADLANDS, RUMBLE FISH, FIVE EASY PIECES, THE PROPOSITION, PAT GARRETT AND BILLY THE KID are fine films, and as much about mood as plot; but then, each of those does have a coherent beginning, middle, and end. All we get in ASSASSINATION is a series of reminders that hero worship is a hollow calling. This is a theme, yes, but not a story. A climax that's a foregone conclusion is, theoretically, perfectly acceptable - see any Greek tragedy - but you've got to give us something to care about in between the prologue and the final chorus. A story is the usual device, and a story never hurts.Instead, we get Roger Deakins' bleak and moving portrait of a melancholy moment in Missouri history. I often feel, watching his work, that Roger Deakins should photograph every movie. But he isn't a writer, and he can't give us a story that's not in the script.Fortunately for all of us, Dominik has cast his movie with profound judgment and taste. Sam Shepard, Garret Dillahunt, Sam Rockwell, Paul Schneider, Michael Parks, Ted Levine - a Western ensemble as good as any since MISSOURI BREAKS. The women are very good, what little we see of them. Casey Affleck is many times the actor his big brother will ever be. Brad Pitt pretty much smirks his way through yet another performance, but once again it mostly fits the character, and to be fair he has his share of subtle, poignant scenes.To be really fair, though, it must be said that many of these scenes are just variations on earlier moments that required no elaboration.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Homage to Western History in a Moody Daguerreotype Style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE ASSASSINATION OF JESSE JAMES BY THE COWARD ROBERT FORD is one of the finer films about the history of the Old West 'heroes' such as Jesse James. It is difficult to describe the degree of high quality of the way in which this film has been created: the script (adapted by Andrew Dominick from Ron Hansen's novel) is as poetic as it is gritty and flows like a Shakespearean tragedy both in narration and in dialog; the exceptionally fine cinematography by Roger Deakins captures the flavor of the times, shot in subtle lighting whether in darkly intimate interiors or on the vast plains at times heightened by snowlight, but always in the feeling of the quality of daguerreotypes; the musical score by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis is strangely apropos without seeming to borrow from any previous source; and the cast of fine actors play the film as a true ensemble work. Director Andrew Dominik has accomplished a masterpiece.The story begins subtly in the last year of the James gang at the final train robbery in 1881. Jesse James (Brad Pitt) and his brother Frank (Sam Shepard) have gathered remnant criminals to bolster their decimated gang - Dick Liddel (Paul Schneider), Ed Miller (Garret Dillahunt), and Wood Hite (Jeremy Renner) among them. The Ford brothers want to ride with Jesse: 19-year old Robert (Casey Affleck) idolizes Jesse and his older brother Charley (Sam Rockwell) enjoys the attention of the gang's fame. Jesse James, at only age 34, is at the end of his career, content to be at home with his wife Zee (Mary Louise Parker) and children. But Robert's adoration results in a chain of events that slowly dissembles the gang and results in Robert's obsessive revenge for Jesse's murder of one of the members fired by the promise of reward for the capture of Jesse James, dead or alive. History and the title of the film tell the plot so there are no surprises here. It is the inevitable unfolding of the drama and the tension of the interplay of the actors that drives the mood of the story. The film does not stop with the killing of Jesse James but instead follows the descent of the lives of Robert (now wealthy and in love a stripper - Zooey Deschanel) and the progressing insanity of Charley to an end that fades like the proverbial sunset on a time in our history we will never forget.Each of the actors is exceptional, and despite the glory of having big name stars associated with the cast, the effect is one of pure ensemble work. The 160 minute running time of the film never seems too long, so well timed is the pacing of the story and the pauses for understanding the interior aspects of each character's mind. This is a haunting film, unusually fine in every detail. It deserves, and demands, attention. Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another good Western to come out in 2007, along with 'Yuma', though this one is slower paced and more of a drama. In any case, the movie has great acting, beautiful direction, and a superb score. Affleck truly deserves the supporting actor nomination...(read more). The year 2007 will always be remembered on his resume' as a career defining one, after performing well in 'Gone Baby Gone'.There are two things that hurt this movie; the length could have been easily reduced and it is probably what hurt it when it came to awards considerations and attracting crowds. Yes a lot of time was taken with expressions and landscape shots, however there was still room to shorten it up considerably. The second drawback of the movie was its long and spoiler of a title. It obviously gives the story away, not just by saying what will happen, but also by who. Had the title been more subtle, simply 'Jesse James' perhaps, the movie would have been unpredictable and more suspenseful.However, this is a solid movie, worth watching for Western fans. This movie probably rates as my 3rd favorite Western after 'The Proposition' and '3:10 to Yuma'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The long title of 10 words strike you initially, and besides having a mouthful of a title, the duration too is at a whopping 160 minutes, of which I can humbly suggest to trim it down to a more manageable 120 minutes.Based on the novel by Ron Hansen, the narrated parts which provided much of the needed background on Jesse Jame coupled with key timelines, were somehow more enjoyable than the rest of the movie itself. For some reason, the voice-over, repetitive (like a one-trick pony, though beautifully haunting) score and soft visual focus provided it with some form of documentary styled legitimacy, only to be hampered by the more clunky delivery on some of the more dramatic aspects. This is not to say that the actors were below par in their fleshing of the characters, but you can sense a deep attempt in trying to emulate styles like Terence Mallick's, in crafting a movie which lingered with still visuals, silence, with unquestionably wonderful cinematography.Our notion of Jesse James is probably one of an outlaw of the wild west who's quick on the draw as well as being a notorious robber/killer molded into the Robin Hood reputation. There are plenty of different interpretations of Jesse James, but none comes so interesting or as intense as Brad Pitt's. Through his confident swagger and suspicious demeanour, here's a man who precedes his reputation, who is clear as crystal in knowing what's he doing, and what the risks are, but nonetheless human prone to err after all.However, the film's focus was presumably put more on Robert Ford (Casey Affleck), the wide eyed recruit who joins Jesse's gang, and that became a dream come true as it presents an opportunity to work with his idol. And his idolization becomes a strange obsession, as he draws physical parallels between Jesse and himself, that makes even Jesse himself edgy and uncomfortable, even questioning at one point if Robert just wants to be like him, or be him. Hence sparks the crazed suspicion and like the adage says, it's better to keep friends close, and your enemies closer.I thought Sam Rockwell stole the show from both Casey Affleck and Brad Pitt in his portrayal of Charley Ford, which reminds me of a Chinese adage of pretending to be a pig to eat the tiger. His Charley is clearly no simpleton, but his depiction of being one probably led to his being able to survive for a long while, when Jesse slowly dispatches the others. But what took the cake, was his spot on impersonation of not only Brad Pitt, but of Pitt's portrayal of Jesse James as well, in a scene so short, but nonetheless quite pivotal leading to the final moments of the movie.There are a few points you must note about the movie. I felt that the full house audience didn't really know what to expect, thinking that it's Pitt on screen, and his presence actually drew in the crowds. And while everyone's waiting for the title incident to happen, they discovered that they're waiting too long. Bear in mind the film runs more than 2.5 hours, and you have to be incredibly patient to get there. I felt a little sorry for the masses who walked out, especially those who did so just before the turn of events, and thereon the pace actually quickened, though covering nothing more than what you can read from encyclopedias under 5 minutes.Those expecting big shoot-em-outs and action sequences like 3:10 to Yuma will also be disappointed, as the action here is never stylized, just presented as a matter of fact for cowboys in that era. Gun fights, if you can call them that, are so extremely ordinary, you'll find yourself more amazed by the intricate weapon design, and the plenty of gunpowder used which explains the plumes of smoke, coupled with the primitive, unsophisticated basic revolver that affects accuracy.Instead, what this movie is, is a well crafted and very measured piece of drama that tells the tale of a legendary outlaw, and his heinous betrayal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The rebirth of a genre?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The science fiction films are going in the same way of the westerns, there is nothing original, we have seen everything". I read this phrase of Ridley Scott (producer of this film) in an article about "The assassination of JJ by the coward RF" before i watch the film.I saw this film yesterday and i was thinking in that phrase because i really like this film so with "3:10 to Yuma" and soon with "No country for old men", Hollywood is trying to rebirth the most American genre in films and at least this film (i haven't seen the others)is a new type of western, not the classic one with heroes and shots everywhere.I mean this film contains all the elements of a classic western but it focus more into the character's minds and that's make it different so i think this the best western since Unforgiven and that is a film of 1992.I mean, there is the classics of the genre with the legendary John Wayne (The Searchers, Rio Bravo, etc.)making team with John Ford and with the great Howard Hawks. My personal favourite of this classics is Rio Bravo which is one of the best westerns ever, but latter there was just clichs in westerns until an Italian re-bird the most American genre: Segio Leone (one of my favourites directors ever) came with his "Spaghetti westerns" like The dollars trilogy with the great Clint Eastwood and of course the mystic "Once Upon A Time In The West". In this films there's my favourite western of all time: The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. After that there were good films but it was until Eastwood's Unforgiven that the westerns were back again.So after a quick resume of the most popular westerns, i most say that the "The assassination....." is one of my favourite films of this year and i'm almost sure that the Academy is going to give some nominations to this film because Hollywood is trying to rebirth a genre that belong to America and to Sergio Leone.Finally,Brad Pitt make his best performance in the last years and the photography is amazing just like the way the story is told and well the plot is already in the title. Highly recommendable. 9.5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Assassination of Jesse James</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this movie because of it had Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck, and it is a western movie with great cinematography.It is a true story is about American legend Jesse James (Brad Pitt) and his new gang member Robert Ford (Casey Affleck), who has idolized Jesse from childhood. There is a sub-plot where Jesse's brother is killed by another gang member and Robert keeps this fact hidden from Jesse, causes doubts and suspicion in the very sharp and neurotic Jesse James ? who sees through Robert's lies. This causes a strange bit of relationship between these two characters. Jesse weirdness and swinging moods has such a hold and control over Robert that Robert is scared to death. In one such moment of fear, Robert shoots Jesse and kills him. Robert is honored by government, enacts stage performances of Jesse's killings. Robert is not able to live this life where people around him hate him for killing Jesse. At the end of the movie, Robert is shot by stranger.Brad Pitt is one of the producers and the movie is directed by Andew Dominik (Chopper fame ? again based on a true story assassin). Roger Deakins is the director of photography and has shot the movie with such a heavenly feel that irrespective of anything; a true movie lover can go and sit in this movie for the sheer magic of the image on the BIG screen canvas.Bard Pitt has acted very well and remains an enigma personified of Jesse James. But I liked Casey Affleck's awkwardness, subtlety, fear psychosis and dilemmas as Robert Ford are superb.The movie is long, 160 minutes; but the time well worth for getting absorbed into the story and characters. It reminded me of Zodiac. Similarly, this is the sixteenth movie made on Jesse James, and I can assure that the treatment of this movie is amazingly different from any other movie you would have seen of Jesse James.(Stars 8 out of 10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ken Burns goes Hollywood!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of this movie felt like a Ken Burns documentary to me (the objective narration, the amazing account of authentic detail).Many viewers might see this movie with hopes of watching a great modern western, but instead we are left with a visually encapsulating narrative that leaves us feeling both sympathy and admiration for both Jesse James and Robert Ford.Casey Affleck is truly stunning as the morally injured Robert Ford.Brad Pitt is like fine wine (keeps getting better with age). His portrayal of Jesse James is something that resembles ancient mythology. He is a heroic character, yet he is so deeply haunted by his ruthlessness that he becomes something entirely different than what is expected on screen.Both Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck are something to behold in this poetic and tragic retelling of history.Although this movie is very long and somewhat slowly paced, it is one of the few movies this year that makes you care for every single character, no matter how insignificant their roles are.The cinematography by Roger Deakins is nothing short of stunning, and the portrayals of Robert Ford and Jesse James by the two lead actors is enough to enthrall you to the very last minute of this epic, new-age western.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>American Culture Hasn't Changed Much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford" has rightly been praised for its superb acting and script. This may be Brad Pitt's finest performance, and Casey Affleck's nuanced, sensitive, courageously profound performance deserves an Oscar. In fact, all the acting is superior.What strikes me most, however, is how dead-on the movie is in its analysis of American culture. We've not changed much in the 125 years since James was shot from behind, just as he had murdered many of his own victims. American culture still lionizes and mythologizes sociopathic murderers (compare this movie with the recently released "American Gangster," which depicts its real-life hero, Frank Lucas, as literally getting away with murder; we are supposed to like the false fact that he's a family man). Lonely, victimized fans still kill their heroes or at least stalk them, and just as Ford and his brother, Charlie, reenact on stage Robert's slaying of the monster/hero Jesse James, so do our TV and movie media rush to cash in on the most horrendous acts of violence. Another parallel is the killing of the assassin (Lee Harvey Oswald is the prominent example).These themes are subtle compared to the brilliant revelation of character by all the main actors, the authentic scenery (apart from one scene in the beautiful Canadian mountains that seems out of place in this story that takes place mainly in Missouri and Kentucky), and the superb direction. The director's subtlety makes the themes all the more powerful and drive home the irony of the title. Killer though he may be, Robert Ford is no coward, at least not as portrayed by Affleck and director Andrew Dominick. He's far too multifaceted for that. Part of his character is his covert homoerotic attraction to James. Homoeroticism is also one facet in the character of the hyper-sexual Dick Liddil, one of the several members of the James gang who escape James's murderous wrath. "The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford" is one of the year's best movies so far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A High Quality Dime Novel of a Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After 15 years as outlaws, Frank and Jesse James were tired, beaten and worried about their futures. Without the experienced Younger Brothers, former Confederate guerrilla raiders, all captured in the Northfield, Minnesota bank robbery fiasco, the outlook for their outlaw future was bleak. Jesse grew suspicious of the uneducated stumble bum 20 year olds who helped on their last train robbery in Glendale, Missouri.The two hour and 40 minute movie is about Jesse and five of the young fellow robbers after the Glendale train holdup. It reminded me a little of a movie of the seventies called Bad Company, which featured a number of young 20 year old men footloose on the late nineteenth century prairie. Frank just walked away from it all, moving with his wife to Virginia, leaving Jesse surrounded by nimcimpoops. One of the young men, Wood Hite, used his position as Jesse's cousin to jockey for position among the other young criminals. Wood and Dick Liddil, another of the gang, visited Wood's father and the older man's young bride in Kentucky. Liddil was already romancing Wood's sister back at a prairie home hideout in Missouri. There was bad blood between the two men. When Liddil romanced the old man's young wife in the privy late the first night after the two of them got to Kentucky, it was the last straw. Liddil went back to Missouri and holed up in an old house on the prairie until Jesse rode in and asked him to ride with him to find another gang member. When they got to the man's house, Jesse started roughing up the subteen brother of Bob and Charley Ford. Liddil stopped him. After that Liddil went to the Missouri hideout run by Wood's sister where Bob and Charley Ford were living. Hite came up the stairs with his gun drawn, to kill Liddil, who jumped out the window. Bob Ford killed Wood with one shot. He and Liddil dumped the naked body in a nearby ravine, drawing a titter from the two 70 year old ladies sitting down in front of me in the audience. The news was kept from Jesse for fear he' d kill Liddil and the two Ford Brothers. Jesse was getting more nervous about his young associates. He went to visit another fellow outlaw, Ed Miller at his lonely farm house on the plain, invited him to go to town for dinner, then shot him in the back of the head. Bob had already been talking with the Governor of Missouri about killing Jesse for a pardon and the $10,000 reward. Brother Charley was reluctantly concluding too that Jesse, ostensibly planning a bank heist for the three of them, intended to kill he and Bob when it was over.Against this backdrop of suspicion, Jesse was telling the Ford Brothers he wanted them in on the holdup. Bob and Charley were running out of time. When Jesse got on a chair to adjust a picture, both Fords reached for their guns. Bob Ford just got his shot off first. Bob high-tailed it to the telegraph office and wired the Governor that he'd shot Jesse dead. The Fords were arrested, tried and convicted of the murder of Jesse. Just before the hanging the Governor of Missouri pardoned them and even gave them some of the $10,000 reward.For two and a half years Bob and Charley re-enacted the killing of Jesse on Broadway, Bob playing himself, and Charley playing Jesse. 800 performances in just under two years. Afterward, Charley, never much for the theater, shot hisself to death in 1884. Bob lit out for the territories, establishing gambling joints in the gold fields of Colorado, making alliances with corrupt lawmen and organized gamblers. After Jesse's death, Bob thought people would consider him a hero. They didn't. He visited the wives of many of the men Jesse had killed, expecting to be thanked. He wasn't. Gradually he realized his dime novel sense of things had been juvenile. He started to grow up some. But a disgruntled old man angry over Ford's traitorous murder of the sainted Jesse, shot Bob to death with a shotgun in the gambling tent Bob had erected temporarily in Creeg, Colorado.There was no dime novels for Bob Ford or Robin Hood legends neither.Frank James turned himself in personally to Governor Crittenden of Missouri not long after Jesse was killed. A deal had been cut to prevent his extradition to Northfield, Minnesota. Frank stood trial in Missouri and Alabama. Due to the Robin Hood legacy of the James Brothers, no jury would convict him. Frank took a job as a shoe salesman and later worked at a St. Louis theater which advertised "come get your ticket punched by Frank James!" He worked as an AT&amp;T Telegraph operator. In 1902, he and Cole Younger, now out of jail, took to the lecture circuit together. Frank lived until 1915, long enough that he could have been a technical adviser on a western film. However, they didn't make the first silent about Jesse and he until 1921.Though Brad Pitt plays Jesse and the much older Sam Shepherd plays Frank in this ensemble movie, the best performance among many very good ones, belongs to Casey Affleck, the second great performance I've seen from him in two weeks. The story is told in dialog much like that in the dime novels. People are perpetually puzzled, joking and weird like they appear in dime novels. The childishness of the younger gang members dominates the screenplay. This artsy film will probably be nominated for Oscars. Affleck will be nominated for a best supporting actor if he's not nominated best actor for Gone Baby Gone. The films 160 minutes glided by without notice because the film was continually interesting. It will certainly be nominated for best director and best picture.</fullReview>

This story of an American legend is told with such poetry, both visually and narratively, that I could not help but find myself fully engrossed for the full 160-ish minutes. I have not seen a film as beautifully executed in every aspect since "The Godfather". The acting, especially from Brad Pitt, is subtle and honest, yet powerfully emotional. This movie is both artistically and historically significant. Many average moviegoers will have trouble tolerating the length and pace of the film, however I argue these are the same people who may dispute "Citizen Kane" as the greatest American film ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An absolute must-see for fans of the America's longest-standing iconic figure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Andrew Dominik's 'Jesse James' is a picture of grand scales and grave tales that is as intoxicating as it is disquieting, and as tranquil as it is beautiful. Dominik's scrupulous study of the two title characters never digresses throughout the film's lengthy showcase and permeates the grounded minds and hearts of its viewers, whose once sturdy estimation of Jesse James is demolished in light of the classic outlaw's truest depiction.The explicit detail of Hansen's novel is evident in each scene of 'James' and is transmitted sinuously by Dominik, leaving little difference between the original text and its ensuing screenplay ? which unfolds into an exercise on photographed literature that skips from scene to scene poetically and fluidly. In fact, Jesse James is one of the few films I've ever seen in which the dialogue is so cleanly delivered (whether it's in the first person or narrated in the third person) that if one were to close their eyes, they could just as easily visualize the happenings of the film as they could if they were watching it. Yet, the transposed script by Andrew Dominik could undoubtedly have fallen to failure had it not been for his outstanding cast. Fortunately, the cast succeeded, and did so by following the lead of its stars, Pitt and Affleck, who both bid phenomenal performances.Brad Pitt's portrayal of the Missouri bandit will corrupt every molecule of its onlookers through simple, yet inimitable glares and gestures that indicate the brutality of James that rested behind his sunken blue eyes and charming guise. The famed persona could have been offered to no one else, for Pitt becomes every glitch of James, from his ticks to his truths to the long-dismissed turmoil that had pitted itself deep within his soul.Additionally, Casey Affleck, whose depiction of the young, admiring, obsessive Robert Ford is tremendous, conquers the challenge of displaying the most notable hero anti-hero in American history. Affleck's Ford character speaks words that indicate admiration and wonder, yet his body glimmers of dissolved self-assurance. As the film progresses, we see Ford's approving eyes grow dark with disdain for the story's main character, as he approaches the unsettling disposition that gives the film (and, previously, Hansen's book) its gruesome title.In addition to the stellar supporting cast (which includes Sam Rockwell, Mary-Louise Parker, Jeremy Renner, and Sam Shepard as Jesse's older brother, Frank), Dominik sets a suitable pace, while also instituting large-scale tension, most apparent in the film's two climactic scenes (the train robbery towards the film's beginning and the assassination, which comes near the film's conclusion). However, the tension in both of these scenes (and for the duration of the picture) is catapulted by Nick Cave's truly haunting score, which is the very best of the year and corresponds impeccably with the desolate scenery and grabbing visuals of Dominik's absorbing motion picture. Directed with tact and tone, 'The Assassination of Jesse James' is an absolute must-see for fans of movies and of the timeless legend of Jesse James, America's longest-standing iconic figure.</fullReview>

Perhaps it's just one of those films that had wonderful potential on paper. Maybe after the final cut from the editors and director, the story and dialogue just got in the way of some private pretentious vision of the filmmaker. It had all the potential to be a great film. IMHO the director's art house cinema muse got in the way. Is this enough lines of text to pan this turkey? No? OK. How about now? Still not enough? Unbelievable!

		<fullReview>This is director Andrew Dominik's meditation on fame, trust, the wages of sin, and the scary bond between love and hate, as played out by the legendary serial murderer Jesse James and his cohorts who caught the public's fancy during the post-Civil War westward expansion, just as Bonnie &amp; Clyde and Dillinger did more than half a century later during the Great Depression. One could think of this effort as a sort of action film on valium, as it laconically traces the final days of the disintegrating James gang by exploring the crumbling relationships of its members under the pressure of law enforcement efforts to bring them to justice.Some have pointed out a resemblance to the films of Terrence Malick (which I can understand, especially Days of Heaven and Badlands) but I was also reminded throughout of Robert Altman's McCabe and Mrs. Miller by the photography, gritty physical environment, linguistically archaic banter laced with jokes, melancholy and sparse musical scoring, and the parallels between Brad Pitt here and Warren Beatty in the earlier film (similar beards, behavioral quirks like a snorting laugh, line readings, and even a resemblance between their respective nostrils). But whereas Altman's vision was chaotic and fuzzy, Dominik's is merely ambiguous but sharply focused.The way James is presented we simultaneously loathe him for his brutal crimes and pity him for the pathetic corner into which his wicked deeds have backed him. Throughout the film he appears to alternate between trust and mistrust of his companions, and between sadistic misbehavior towards other human beings and loving care for his own immediate family until finally he allows fate to take its course ? during Easter week no less, in a twisted retelling of the Passion whereby he is finally felled by "the coward Robert Ford" after he himself knocks off others in his gang whom he suspects of betrayal. Even this scene is edited so that we can't be quite sure what happened and who did what to whom.But the movie doesn't end with James's demise. It follows his killer, Ford, through his post- James career as theatrical re-enactor of the incident that brought him to prominence, and forward from there to his own ultimate celebrity-driven destiny.Dominik is helped enormously by the set and costume designers whose artistry steeps us in the look and feel of the mid-American late 19th century. And the cinematography of Roger Deakins constantly fascinates and surprises. All of this is held together by a lean, matter-of- fact but pointed narration by Hugh Ross which evokes Sissy Spacek's in Malick's Badlands and lends a formality and framework to the narrative.All the acting is top notch, including a brief bit by (of all people) James Carville, who fits into the late 19th century like a hand into a glove. But Casey Affleck's performance as Robert Ford is the standout: absolutely mesmerizing as he progresses from hero worship to bitter disillusionment in his relationship with James (Brad Pitt). But I got the feeling that any of the actors would have stood out as impressively, given the equivalent screen exposure.The director's original cut was 4 hours, but economic pressures evidently forced him to excise about 75 minutes. I can only wonder how the original vision was affected by this trimming. The release cut does drag in places, but this pacing problem could have been the result of excision of important connective material that would have given compelling context to puzzling or otherwise uninvolving stretches. Seeing a director's cut will tell the tale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Inasmuch as Robert Ford, this movie feels like it was destined for great things. It truly is a pity it did not garnered more audience, for it truly is an epic. The story is quite complex but also gripping, the characters are simply fabulous, each and every one of them, as for the cinematography, well... the Academy got it right: it is quite the achievement. Also there are so many little details thrown at various points in the movie that, when added up, make for perfect cohesion and reward an attentive viewer.So, what can be interesting about a movie whose ending is predicted in the title? We already know what's going to happen, but the way we get there is so rich that at certain points we almost feel like Jesse James won't really die. And in a way, he doesn't, as the end of the movie shows. Regardless, this just goes to show that Hollywood is getting more and more on the right track to making good - but also entertaining - movies: focus on the story and characters people, that's all you need. Speaking of characters, Pitt and Affleck are both highlights, each in their own right. Pitt manages to completely submerge in his role: he's one mean, loving, vicious, conflicted Jesse James. Affleck has a certain thing - that I've seen in Gone Baby Gone - that makes him truly captivating in any role.But the one thing that really turns this movie into something special is the cinematography. Whether it's the stereoscope view, the nature shots or some specific scene like the train robbery scene, it all makes it worth wile your viewing, even if you're not a Western fan. For truly, this is a Western in it's purest tradition. One that's classic and modern at the same time. The story, the people, the music, everything fits perfectly in this underrated jam.</fullReview>

Brad Pitt is a decent actor but if I had to watch another nano second of those blank stares by Casey Affleck I'd water board myself. Yes, the cinematography was beautiful and the acting pretty good but deserving of high praise? If you want to see a good western rent "Tombstone".

		<shortDescription>A long and detailed look at the supposed assassin of the famous outlaw Jesse James</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a long title, this long and serious film takes a hard and detailed look at the self claimed assassin of Jesse James through a soft, romantic and warm lens. I'm not familiar with the details of this famous 19th century American outlaw and the circumstances surrounding his untimely death. So, I cannot attest to it's historical accuracy. In this film, the focus is more on the motives of his would be assassin. For those not familiar with the circumstances after the death of Jesse James, there is a surprise in store near the end of the film. From beginning to end, there's plenty of biographical information, narrated, to inform those not familiar with the details of Jesse James and the story of his supposed assassin.Acclaimed cinematographer Roger Deakins provides some exceptionally beautiful widescreen Western style photography. For a complicated and dark story, we, the audience, are viewing it through a soft, sentimental, warm and romantic lens. Casey Affleck's performance as the assassin Robert Ford is convincingly complicated and serious.I'm a modest fan of old westerns and more a fan of biographical films of famous historical people. The photography and detailed narration initially drew me into this film. The screenplay, with it's carefully used and timed narration, works effectively throughout the entire film. Curiosity about the famous outlaw aside, the excellent cinematography of Roger Deakins and the acting performance of Casey Affleck, make this long film absorbing and engaging from beginning to end.2 Academy Award Nominations: Best Cinematography (Roger Deakins) and Best Supporting Actor (Casey Affleck).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Amazing. Simply amazing. 'The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford' is not a movie more than it is an experience. One that takes us to another place and time entirely. And folks, this is about as good as they come. A deliberate and methodical period piece, this is masterful storytelling on every level with a brilliant score to boot. A true American epic with gut-wrenching performances, 'Jesse James' is nothing short of an art form. It will transfix you, it will mesmerize you, it will haunt you.Written and directed to perfection by Andrew Dominik, 'The Assassination of Jesse James' is filmed in the vast open lands of Canada. There's such a profound and unspoken beauty that reaches beyond the film with strokes of sweeping majesty. Words simply fail you as James walks peacefully through fields of grain, gracefully allowing his fingers to brush against the tall, delicate crops. Not unlike this year's heartbreaking 'Into the Wild', cinematographer Roger Deakins uses nature's sweet marvels to walk side-by-side with Jesse James in the telling one of America's greatest tales.Coming in at 2 hours and 40 minutes, 'Jesse James' is a brilliantly rich and textured story. This is not a typical Western filled with gunslinging cowboys and tense shootouts, but that won't keep you from hanging on every twist and turn this film has to offer. And even though we already know the eventual outcome walking in to this film, it's the poetically layered story filled with fully realized characters that will keep you glued to your seat. Laced with such a detailed narration that seems to have been taken straight from the pages of the source novel, this legendary story stitched into the seams of American lore comes to life with that very same power.Bolstering some of the year's strongest performances, one can't ignore Brad Pitt's piercing gaze that makes him a perfect candidate to transform into one of America's original celebrities. He's a man who has both everything and nothing, and a tight-knit group of comrades that is slowly but steadily ebbing away. As he becomes further isolated, his sense of reality slips away. Pitt's character transformation is subtle but profound, and certainly moving. But it is Casey Affleck's emotional performance as Robert Ford, the man who commits the fatal betrayal, who gives 'Jesse James' a hard-hitting punch to the gut with a downright dynamite performance. Yet another intense character study, Affleck takes us on a roller-coaster ride as the man who puts a bullet in the back of the man he once adored so much. How could a quiet, socially awkward young man who was never paid much attention pull off such an amazing feat? 'Jesse James' paints such a harrowing and tragic portrait of both men, one of the film's most redeeming and unforgettable qualities. Two of the best performances these two men can ever hope to deliver.There's a lot to be said about 'The Assassination of Jessie James'. It's a film for the ages, an unforgettable masterpiece that exemplifies the very definition of perfection. It's achingly beautiful, and unlike anything you have ever seen or ever will see. It's a story that still captivates us, but while this American masterpiece follows no set path, there are many themes that seem more poignant today than ever before. Because I believe the central most theme that can be taken away from a film like this is in fact its study of celebrity status. The fame, the glory, the adoration. Our society's extreme fascination with stars that borders on obsession, it can't be healthy. And perhaps there are things we can take away from 'Jessie James', straight from the mouth of the coward himself. "He's just a human being," he tells us. "I was surprised by what happened. They didn't applaud." More reviews at rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&amp;view=public</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unexpected beautifully crafted film with extraordinary acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This superbly acted, intelligently written, and beautifully photographed film might be this year's sleeper. Less of a western and more of a haunting psychological drama painted with a discerning eye on a sweeping canvas. At moments it's pace seems slow but it is usually in the service of building up the layers of paint in each characters portrait. Casey Affleck's portrayal of Robert Ford was inspired. I very much enjoy when an actor can convey a complex series of thoughts and emotions with subtle facial inflections and body language. You read the character in their complexity without the distraction of words. The rest of the cast, including Brad Pitt, all delivered solid performances. This is one of the few films where the voice over narration was eloquent and insightful further rounding out the complex story of these fascinating characters. The film was also beautifully crafted visually, the camera is never just a passive recording device but rather a brush artfully painting the story. I couldn't help but feel this was a labor of love by writer and director Andrew Dominik.I originally rented this movie not expecting much, rather to escape with a western for a few hours. But instead I got so much more and was so pleased at my unanticipated good fortune. I haven't heard many others talk about this film and it's a shame as it seems to have fallen under the radar for some reason. It's worth seeing, which is why it seems destined to be a sleeper, just waiting for others to discover it's merits.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't say enough praises for this movie, a true masterpiece. From the beginning till the end it has shown us a side of Jesse James which none of us knew existed. To be honest, I didn't know much about Jesse rather than he was a outlaw, but this movie showed me his tough and sensitive side at the same time. Beautiful, gentle, calm and complex are the words to describe this movie. It is a long movie, but that does not show that it is diminutive comparing it to other westerns, but then, it is not a 'real western'. That is not a critic, but a praise. The time of old westerns has passed and the time of new, Andrew Dominik directed ones has come. I am surprised that this film didn't get multiple Oscar nominations, because it deserved them. The direction is flawless and I was surprised of the talent that Andrew Dominik is possessing. I mean, it's hard to create a movie from which a lot of people expected to be a 'yippee', old school western. The Director has made a masterpiece worthy of John Ford. The acting is probably the strongest link of this movie. Starring Brad Pitt, Cassey Affleck and Sam Rockwell, movie was fulfilled with their talent. Brad Pitt has probably made the best film of his career, and should have won a Oscar, sorry Daniel Day Lewis. Casey Affleck has received a nomination and my God it was deserved. It is hard to show a different side of a person that everybody hated and despised for what he has done. Sam Rockwell hold the film together, and is a balance between two forces, Jesse James and Robert Ford. All in all, I recommend this film to all people because it really has a message, which one I will let you decide.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Film of 2007</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved Control and I thought Into The Wild was extraordinary but I have no hesitation whatsoever in saying that Jesse James is the film of the year.Its hard to know which amazing aspect of this film to mention first. OK, so the cinematography is a dazzling amalgamation of epic beauty and harsh, cold hostility.The script is literate, visceral and gives the actors enough room to breath without ever straying to far from the core of the story, which itself is skilfully and painstakingly told with delicate charm and wit, intermingled with scenes of violence and debauchery.The director, Andrew Domink has captured a moment in history that has been mythologized in American popular culture, and redefined it. This film is a place where realism and romanticism can sit side by side without fear of contradiction.The entire supporting cast performs admirably; but its the two central performances that really capture the eye. Casey Affleck and Brad Pitt are Oscar worthy for this work. Affleck is great as the borderline psychotic, homo-erotic, nave young man who becomes equally obsessed and disillusioned with Brad Pitts charismatic and chilling, Jesse James, who has more than a hint of the supernatural about him.Its easy to enjoy this film on many levels; technically its wonderful. The story is thoroughly entertaining and there is a visual and literary commentary on mythologized history and the nature of celebrity throughout.Also the instantly classic soundtrack adds a thick layer of atmosphere to proceedings.Its hard to find a weak spot, perhaps the film lingers a little too long after the key moment, but probably not. Overall, The Assassination of Jesse James is arguably the best western ever made, for my money it is, but others will disagree. But there is no doubt that this film sits comfortably in the upper echelons of the genre, alongside the likes of Unforgiven, The Wild Bunch and The Searchers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Acting at its finest.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are looking for a gun-blazing, high intense shoot em' up western, stick with 3:10 to Yuma. This movie is about ACTING and drama. Just under three hours, this film delivers acting at its finest. Casey Affleck, nominated for best supporting actor, deserved the award. No offense to any Ben fans, but Caseys performance in Gone Baby Gone and The Assassination of Jesse James blows Daredevil and Paycheck right out of the water. Brad Pitt does a very well job as Jesse James, showing his cold hearted and distant side from the rest of the cast. A few would say this is a slow movie, I would agree that it was more dramatic than anything. The "slowness" only added to the strong plot, without skipping a beat. Very strong plot. Very strong acting, as well as perfect casting. I give this movie an 8/10. Highly recommended for history buffs, strong acting gurus and western fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When one watches the Oscars you may assume there was only 5 films released this year: juno, no country, blood and etc. After you really become connected with these characters you'll see a real winner.The film captures the paranoia of James and the demented obsession of Ford. Also the razor tight rope wire his former gang members have to walk.Scenery and setting are beautiful. The drama slowly builds as you witness the transformation of a disorientated/immature boy into a confused young man.Acting is spot on, i thought Affleck was great until i learned he sounds like a bitch in real life. Pitt grows on you (im a fan but at first i thought he sucked)Astounding storyline which unfolds itself like ART BE WARNED you must have the time and attention span to appreciate</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That dirty little Coward, what shot Mr. Howard, put Jesse James in his grave</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My mother, who was from Missouri, used to sing that song. Except she'd get the words wrong, but it was a testimony to how much of a legend Jesse James was a century later. She was distantly related to the Youngers, who were the partners with the James gang.In any event, this movie portrays Robert Ford, the killer of Jesse James, as a disgruntled fan-boy who bought into the hero-worship of the dime novels, and was disappointed to find out his hero was really a garden variety psychopath.Still, there's a lot to recommend this movie, in how it recreates the world of 1880 Missouri. Brad Pitt is pretty good in the role of James, to where you aren't saying, "Hey, that's Brad Pitt." He disappears into the role completely. In fact, the only actor who did jump out at me as not sinking into the role was presidential adviser James Carville, who played the Governor who sanctioned James Murder.The movie drags in places, but it is a very compelling story. Affleck portrays Bob Howard in a very sympathetic way, pointing out that he had good reason to fear for his own life, that James was eliminating all of his associates.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Story behind to story of Jesse James and his death.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I grew up in the 1950s and in movies saw the "romanticized" view of Jesse James, but never really knew anything about him. This movie portrays the gritty every day of Jesse James' last years, starting when he was a "middle-aged" 34 and with a wife and two children.Brad Pitt is Jesse James, portrayed as suspicious of all his "sidekicks" and quick to dispose of someone who he knew or suspected might turn on him. They would be told "we are going to take a ride" and the other person never came back. Brad Pitt is superb in this role.Mary-Louise Parker is good in a small role as his wife, Zee James. The other main character is Casey Affleck as "that coward" Robert Ford, and Affleck is also superb in this role. About 15 years younger than Jesse, we learn that Robert grew up idolizing him and as a 19-year-old desperately wanted to join the James brothers, first approaching Frank James (Sam Shepard), and finally getting in with Jesse.Sam Rockwell is also good as Robert's older brother Charley Ford. I enjoyed this movie, although a bit long at about 2 1/2 hours, because it looked intensely at the characters, not the criminal activities. I feel like for the first time I understand a bit about the real Jesse James and what a fragile existence the criminals of that day led.SPOILERS. As time passed Robert Ford became more and more unhappy with Jesse, and in the end arranged, along with his brother, to have Jesse turned in. However, in Jesse's own home, as he was on a stool dusting a framed picture on the wall, Robert Ford shot him from behind, killing him. Robert went on to to perhaps 800 stage performances re-enacting how he killed Jesse James, but in the end someone shot and killed Ford.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a movie that I will have to say I did not see coming... I did not know the director whatsoever, for example... And I was expecting an old fashioned western movie with a hint of story.All I can say, since I am still kind of speechless with amazement, is that this a rather poetic film. That Pitt is not the shiniest star in the cast, although he did shine quite a bit... That Affleck has done the real hard work here, proving that he is not just a shinny face like his brother.As I said the movie is all about poetry. The narration is poetic. The cinematography is poetic. The whole script is, ultimately, poetic... Even the bad guy's deaths, as gruesome as they can seem (I found them kind of cool!) are poetic.I am amazed... It's a 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having read all those articles regarding the god-like performance of Pitt and Affleck, and having slept last night to the brilliant OST by Nick Cave, I must say I exited the theater with a sour taste in my mouth. It could be those bad quality Nachos, but most likely it was the feeling that the movie I had just watched, missed a great chance of becoming one of my all-time favorites...I don't want to spoil an already spoiled (due to the title) movie, so I will be as abstract as possible.First things first, the acting of the two protagonists is indeed brilliant. Jesse's eyes reveal a marvelous mix of lunacy, cruelty, tenderness and desperation, in a way only really great actors can deliver. Bob Ford, on the other hand, has everything a made-to-be-hated character must have. The creepy look in his eyes and the trembling voice, both demonstrating his awe and fear of Jesse at the beginning of the film, give way to a vile stare and determined outbreaks as the film progresses... Just brilliant!The photography and music of the film also live up to the fuzz about the movie. Especially the score, by the hand of Nick Cave and Warren Ellis, is as lyrical and sad as it can be, almost unfit for a Western. A true requiem for a great man!So, what is it that disappointed me? At first, it was the feeling that the director focused on the wrong details. I should be cautious with this criticism, since I have not read the book, but I really wanted to see more of Jesse's life, what civilians thought of him during his "career" etc, and less of the trivial stuff about his men's lives. Jesse James is the star here, not Ed Miller!The second -and most important- drawback of this movie, is its length. There is no polite way to say it.. I got bored! And for a movie with such great acting to make someone bored, it must be REALLY slow! And it is! More than I could imagine! I am not against long films. I enjoyed the Lord of the Rings (even wanted more), I loved A Clockwork Orange, I liked Braveheart... But in those cases, the plot unrolling was constant during the whole length of the movie. In Jesse's case, it's not. Sunsets are great, snowy fields are nice, and long blank stares have their importance. But... This movie should last one and a half hour, to a maximum of two. Not more. That would be ideal, the plot would advance with a steady pace and people would appreciate a nice scenery, instead of saying "ah, nice, here's my chance to go out for a cigarette" (I actually heard that one!).My 7/10 is mostly due to the acting, music and photography. It could have been an 8, but I can't rate so highly a movie I caught myself wishing to end...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Melancholic beauty?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood has the idea to glamorize and exaggerate virtually every historical figure without acknowledging that the respective person's true self. This creates a flawed notion of the time period, yet there are times where a biopic is created with truthful richness and this so happens to be one of those times.As the title explains, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is pretty much that and, of course, the events that led up to the act. Jesse (Brad Pitt) decides that he will attempt one last robbery and call his career quits after that. Yet after the feat paranoia crawls into Jesse as he begins to debate whether members of his last outing might in fact take the large bounty that plagues him. Over time he becomes interested in Robert Ford (Casey Affleck), a nineteen year old who has idolized Jesse since his childhood but discovers that the outlaw hero is not what he appears.From the very opening scene the film captures you in its Western setting, and the authenticity of the period of the outlaw Jesse James is virtually realistic, albeit a few historical inaccuracies. Though if you aren't well versed in the history of Jesse James you won't have much to worry about, as these inaccuracies are relatively minor and doesn't impact on the overall feel of the characters, and story. The film is slow and almost action-less. For the most part this suitably helps the films haunting veneer. But beyond the realism and atmosphere, the film has an excellent way of never defining a definite hero or villain. Yes, it is obvious how certain characters are to be finally viewed, but Jesse is not the heroic outlaw he is perceived to be. He is mocking and willingly to kill needlessly. As well, Ford is not just the coward he is made out to be. He's a fragile character who has good intentions but his youthfulness does not allow him to see further then his actions.Once again Brad Pitt proves a wonder to watch, with his portrayal of Jesse James being one of his best. You can feel the cold, calculated nuances of Pitt's acting and the love and compassion his character is capable of. His acting his realistic and he is supported wonderfully by the rest of the cast, especially Casey Affleck, who on par with Pitt. Affleck has never struck me as being that great an actor, but his performance was nothing less than amazing. He exudes a creepy nervousness that is just waiting to burst into something more.There is, as well, an accompanying narrator. Who this person is remains a mystery, but who he is, is never ever the point. The narrator (Hugh Ross) like all narrators, serves as the story's guide, pointing out information of extreme importance, In fact, while the film is long, it could have been longer were it not for the narrator. He brings about certain bits of information throughout the film which adds depth to various characters, without these particulars having to be shown. One such time explains how Frank James (Sam Shepard) felt after the death of his brother Jesse, but we never see the character post-Jesse's death. It appears like a quick scheme to get more story development without showing more, but its execution is practically flawless. The music department is pretty thin: the majority of the film plays without music whatsoever, and when music is used, it's done so as a transition point from one main story arc to the nest. Best yet, it doesn't feel out of place and only goes to enhance the somber atmosphere of the film itself.If there is anything stopping this film from reaching greatness, it would be pacing issues. The film is just a little too long for its own good. While its final length cannot be cut by much, as every scene portrayed is of utmost importance, some scenes do linger on a few seconds too long. Much of the additional runtime comes from the director's attempt at adding abstract, yet serene, images of the environment, and just being too art-like. This is partly in due to the great number of times the director, Andrew Dominik, tries these shots, and also because every time this is performed, the main focus is always in the middle. While this is particularly the function of having an images centerpiece in the middle for emphasis, it just happens far too often and the art-like nature of the film loses its appeal. Still the director does indeed have some real highpoints, especially the beginning of the day of Jesse James death, where we are greeted with a splash of nervousness in regards to Ford. Even towards the end of the film the director experiments and with great results, adding much depth with symbolism. The scenes that are up to this quality show the ability the director has, but its shame he falls into a mediocre pattern.No sex and no nudity although there is a scene involving one man walking on a woman who is using the bathroom. Language use is kept to a minimum and violence, while infrequent, is violent and realistic.The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, sadly, misses its mark by a few inches. The story is engaging, if a little inaccurate and a little too much to digest in regards to the films length; the acting is of a sublime quality; the music is well placed and fits the films overall mood nicely, and the cinematography is absolutely breathtaking in its simplicity, but becomes overused. If you can survive till the films conclusion, and honestly if you cannot then it is a real shame, you will have watched one of the best films to grace 2007. The name of Jesse James still lives on, but now in a far more grand state.-- Full version available at http://cruizd.blogspot.com ?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You can tell from the opening shots and voice-over that 'Assassination' is going to be a good film. There are no credits and very little to introduce anyone before the James gang embark on their spectacularly shot last train robbery. From the outset the cinematography is breathtaking and as they block the track and get masked up the mist rolls and the music, second outing for Nick Cave and Warren Ellis after last years 'The Proposition', swirls in grand crescendos and fits the haunting night time scene. Brad Pitt is quite the Jesse James flitting from brooding intelligence to moody madness and Casey Affleck's portrayal of Robert Ford from bumbling simpleton to calculated killer and back again is almost as good. The story of Roberts obsession with James is akin to a modern day stalker and had the internet been invented then I'm sure Robert would have started many facebook groups dedicated to his childhood hero, it veers from sinister to just plain creepy. This then brings out the whys, why did James let the obviously obsessed Ford into his gang and inner circle? Was it a case of keep your enemies close or did he in fact love the adoration that ultimately would be his downfall? It posses more questions than it answers and in this respect gives the viewer plenty to think about during and after the film. My only criticism of the movie would have to be the length at two hours and thirty nine minutes it's quite the stamina test and I don't see why this couldn't be trimmed a little and still be as good. But that said strong performances all round, amazing scenery; a twisted tale rooted in truth and a great script makes 'Assassination' one of the best films of the year. A must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Plot: As his gang and legend begin to fragment, train-robber and outlaw Jesse James (Pitt) is a haunted man. He can feel his death approaching, but can he foresee that fringe gang-member Robert Ford (Affleck) will be the man to pull the trigger? My Review: Brad Pitt's career takes an interesting turn in this idea of a modernised Western based on a legend. At the helm of a two-time director Andrew Dominik, it's fair to say that new Western has likely left perplexed studio execs somewhat long in the face. It's also fair to say that we expected Mr. Jolie at the back of a greasy gun saying some ponderous if not idiosyncratic line to a enemy facing the other end of the barrel.The source is Ron Hansen's fictional recreation of the chaotic events that brought James-gang-hopeful Robert Ford (Affleck) to shoot his iconic leader in the back as he phased out of the frame of the picture. However, what Mr Dominik has given us is a unconventional thrill seeker, (all those expecting a thrill seeker may want to go get another thrill with more premise) a spurring yet slow and pensive poem-like film that makes existing luxuriant western outings seem less buzzing.Director Andrew Dominik cultivates a not-unfamiliar revisionist aura of America's formative days, a period drama that feels very modern, with the borderline being on the precipice. It shares the unique blend of contemplative power and unmaking of myth from say Unforgiven and shares its sepia-hued authenticity and indistinct morality. This is almost the most unusual form for a conventional idea of a Western with a backdrop of a psychological landscape.Andrew Dominik matches the book's shapelessness faithfully: messy like the throes of garbled history and hear-say with an undercurrent of the actual shards and slivers which is it's composite. Loosely weaved plot that feels more tangled than vague. With its few superlative undercurrents, and beneath a rambling exterior is a true immersing theme of death and assignation so foul that it makes you think of convention planned murder-outings being the weaker copies of this.Pitt is very impressive as he is most effective stalking the fringes of sanity - seeing how he borderlines his 12 Monkeys and Fight Club twitchy-ness that made him luminous - so he is fittingly cast as Jesse James. Affleck also gets more to work with than most previous outings. Each man lives in each others shadow, James parses his infamy in newspapers and observes the edgy brutal loyalty of his gang, especially Ford (Affleck). And when Pitt loosens the hinges a fraction, he really loses it, maniacal laughs like a death has a new best friend.A lot of weather-swept horizons and desolate farmhouses in post-Civil War Kansas and especially Missouri, float across the screen with less Western orientation, more like 'here is the countryside, look at it and "see" it'. There is no real colour, more like a bloated texture of a summers afternoon, left to some gold's, bronze's and faded styles of almost 'Deadwood' type haunts and well-dress gents who crave murder.No momentum like any ordinary thriller, more like it's laced with a cruel menace; with an inescapable clash as scenes travel disturbing and unpredictable paths. On that note, no guns, no galore-ness of any kind, very suave and unpleasantly vindictive, but we do get one possibly statuesque of modern train-robbery scenes that you will ever see, brutal and very indicative of the gangs of old. Just how much myth creates monsters is a overall theme.Verdict: Edgy, dark and maniacal in all-sorts, not the Western we all have an idea of. 8.5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Western Since Clint Eastwood's 'Unforgiven'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Ford: It is interesting the many ways you and I overlap; you're the youngest of three James boys, I'm the youngest of five Ford boys. You have blue eyes, I have blue eyes. You're five feet eight inches tall, I'm five feet eight inches tall.Some of the most unique and beautiful cinematography you'll ever see is in Andrew Dominik's western 'The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford'. But that's not the only positive thing to be said about this gritty and powerful film. 'Assassination' tells the true story of outlaw Jesse James (Brad Pitt) and his murder by weak-minded close associate Robert Ford (Casey Affleck). 'Assassination' is very much a play in three acts, the first is us being introduced to Jesse and Robert, the second is the growing bond between them and the third is Robert's life after the assassination of Jesse James. Although it's a western, there's not much gun-play here. There are violent bullet-ridden scenes, but very few and they are spread out quite a bit. Although I enjoyed the film from start to finish, many might not because of it's incredibly long running time of 2 hours and 40 minutes. It's leisurely paced (or slow) but seldom does it become boring. There's a slow chunk in the middle for about 20 minutes that I felt could be cut, but besides that 'Assassination' is pure cinematic greatness.Andrew Dominick, whose directed the obscure Australian gun film 'Chopper' with Eric Bana, does remarkable work here. The screenplay is very good as well, it has a few slow parts like I stated before but the dialogue is far superior to that of say '3:10 to Yuma'. On an acting scale, everything is pretty solid. Brad Pitt captures James perfectly, while Casey Affleck in a tour-de-force performance steals the film. Affleck is just so quiet, subtle yet creepy and sympathetic that whenever he's on screen your eyes are glued to him rather than his more famous co-star, Mr. Brad Pitt. The supporting cast is all solid especially the extremely underrated Sam Rockwell as Robert's older brother and Deadwood and John From Cincinnati's Garret Dillahunt as one of the outlaws who rides with Jesse James.As far as westerns go, 'The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford' is the best one since Clint Eastwood's 1992 Best Picture Winner 'Unforgiven'. Don't miss it. Grade: A-</fullReview>

Casey Affleck steals the show from solid inspired performances by the other actors including Brad Pitt.The competent use of narration keeps the overly long indulgences of the film in check,barely sometimes though.This is clearly a case where they could not muster the courage to coldly cut beautiful well shot footage and tighten the film up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Amazing Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are few characters in cinematic history that are shown and rehashed more often than the famed outlaw, Jesse James. Despite the fact that this persona has been portrayed from seemingly every angle, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, raises the bar to new heights. Hollywood superstar heartthrob, Brad Pitt, and the lesser known, but arguably more talented Affleck brother, Casey, play the two title characters respectively.The casting itself is genius. Having an unquestionably huge name portraying the also hugely famous Jesse James, and having a B-list actor playing the envious tagalong allows a clear sense of realism with their respective performances. Though Daniel Day-Lewis in There Will be Blood, is the early favourite for Best Actor at the Academy Awards, you can expect Pitt to at least get a nod. Casey Affleck has a very good chance at getting the golden statue for Best Supporting Actor. They are not the only noteworthy performances. The entire supporting cast does an excellent job with their characters, specifically Sam Rockwell, who plays Robert Ford's brother.The story follows both Jesse James, and his murderer Robert Ford. At the beginning we join Robert Ford on his quest to meet his idol, Jesse James. He has heard and read the great tales of James and has idolized him all his life. When he finally meets the man of his dreams, he is sorely disappointed. James is not what Ford expected. As the famed felon reveals that the stories are false, the pained expression grows on Ford's face. The rest of the story develops, as Ford grows angrier with James, before his dramatic murder. Even though the story does not try to hide that Jesse James will be killed (just look at the title) the film still does an extraordinary job of building the suspense for the event.This film is nothing short of a masterpiece. On every technical level The Assassination of Jesse James is magnificent. For starters, the cinematography is the best seen in film in over 10 years. Throughout the whole picture, the cinematography is so achingly beautiful it hurts. The landscapes, and the use of wind, combine for a visceral experience that sucks you into the picture and won't let you out. The dramatic use of light in contrast to shadow rivals that of The Third Man, which is no small accomplishment. The music is another aspect that is hit home by this piece. It is used beautifully to highlight a scene, where needed, and you cannot help but be swept away by it. Though, even more impressive than the use of music, is the use of silence. With music being used so extensively throughout the whole film, when it's quiet it is even more noticeable.The film is not without flaw, though it is close to it. Clocking in at just less than three hours, this film is not for the impatient viewer. Director, Andrew Dominik, takes his time slowly building up the suspense (which could easily be mistaken for poor pacing) for the gut-wrenching climax. If you are going into it expecting to see Jesse James jump off rooftops and kill seven men with a single shot, you will be disappointed. My only real quarrel with the film is the narration. It is used very well at points, but at others it is entirely unnecessary. The viewer should be trusted to sort what was happening rather than being told straight out. It is almost as if they are questioning the intelligence of the viewer. That being said, it is really a rather small quarrel considering the narration is used to great effect at other points in the film. In short, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, is a cinematic masterpiece and should be viewed by any film fan without a short attention span. ****/4.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is well?just read the title again and you should get the basic idea of what the movie is about.The film is essential about the famed assassination. It starts out slowly, builds up slowly, and ends slowly but still manages to become an incredible peace of work. It is a very well-developed, methodically paced character study of two men?Jesse James and Robert Ford. This is not a busy story with lots of things happening. Robert Ford (played by Cassey Affleck) is entering adulthood (he is 19 but tells everyone he is 20). He is the youngest of five brothers, and seems like the one who was always teased mercilessly, never taken seriously, and never given any responsibility or respect. In contrast, Jesse James (played by Brad Pitt) is coming to the end of his infamous legendary career (he is 34). He always seems in control, does not show his emotions outwardly and is feared and respected wherever he goes.The majority of the film is Robert attempting to get in the "in" group of Jesse's gang. He wants to be the close one to Jesse. He examines and imitates Jesse's every move and gesture with an intense obsession, like a crazed fan of a certain celebrity. His methodical, relentless observations of Jesse border on obsession and are laced with sexual longing overtones.I never was hugely impressed with Brad Pitt's acting abilities until I saw Bable and now he produces another very real, stirring performance brining out more of his talent. Cassey Affleck delivers the best performance of the film as he is able to convey so much emotion, longing, and desire just with expressions and tones of voice. I am curious to see what he does next. I love long films, but I think this should have been shorter because some of the length of the film (2hrs.40mins. to be exact) comes from extended still shots of various people and scenes which, due to the simplicity of the story, bogged the film down and seemed unnecessary. None the less, this is sprawling, languid, beautifully fashioned film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are movies your forget immediately after watching them. I kept forgetting what was going on in this movie every 10 minutes. I really don't blame the director for this exercise in the spectacle of drying paint, but the producer. When Hollywood operated as a dream factory and not an outlet for overpriced artisan craft goods, the producer would exercise his (rarely her) authority as audience advocate and insist on discernible plot development, characters you could tell apart, and some action that built to a climax in 90 minutes or less. No, we get to watch every precious frame that the director could not bear to cut. Every so often, people predict the revival of the western as a genre. I assure you that 2007 wasn't the year that that happened.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Narrated to Death</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problem starts with the title. Before the film even begins, you know what's going to eventually happen: Jesse James will be killed by Robert Ford. Since that's a historical fact anyway I'll let it pass. The real problem is what the title represents. This is not a film about showing you things, with images and dialogue; rather, this film will simply tell you things for the next two and a half hours, thanks to our trusty narrator.We learn several useful facts: first, that Jesse James is missing part of the middle finger on his left hand. We can see this plainly, but I guess the narration helps. Next we are told that an affliction of the eyelids causes him to blink frequently. This is an odd one, since Brad Pitt (who plays James) doesn't blink all that often. In a later scene we are told that James suffers from paranoid delusions. To be honest, I had worked that out for myself. Later still we are shown a scene in which Robert Ford lies restlessly in a bed while Jesse sleeps nearby, and it's clear from the way the scene is filmed that Robert is thinking about grabbing the gun off the bedside table and shooting Jesse. In case you weren't paying attention, the narrator tells you this as well. Thanks anyway. Mary Louise Parker and Zooey Deschanel appear in the credits, but their dialogue was replaced by more narration.When the credits finally rolled I was left bewildered. The movie is 160 minutes long. Couldn't the narrator have told me everything I needed to know in a fraction of the time? Maybe fifteen, twenty minutes, allowing a little room for a train robbery and some shooting and riding. In fact, let's skip all that visual claptrap and just let the narrator deliver his eulogy while we stare at a black screen. The funereal dirge courtesy of Nick Cave is optional. In the end, Jesse James wasn't assassinated: he was narrated to death.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a western! Not a western! Not a western!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie finally on DVD and while it had some good not great moments it lacked something. Let me see now, there was no plot, no real tension, the dialog was absolutely boring, no action to speak of, the characters were one dimensional, and the so called Hero(Jesse James) was despicable. Not one character in this movie inspired any remorse in me at the thought of them dieing. The one train robbery that took place was so boring and stupid that it defied logic. Brad Pitts acting abilities were wasted on this show, he did a much much better job in Portraying Achilles in Troy. That movie had some great dialog. In the end this movie can be summed up as a portrayal of one backshooter shooting another backshooter. John Wayne will be rolling over in his grave to think that this movie is called a western. Great movies must have some memorable scenes, memorable dialog, characters that rouse our emotions and we care about, a plot that has us on the edge of our seats, and a purpose for making it. This movie has none of the above and thusly can be said to be mediocre at best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ingmar Bergman does 'Deadwood'. Not an action western.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>TAOJJBTCRF is a long dramatised documentary of what the title says. Some people here didn't catch the suspense that runs through it - basically who will die next? - and weren't seduced by the top-notch period recreation. Some picked up on the feeling that it might be bit of a Brad Pitt vanity project, allowing him to play a pantomime villain for once. He certainly does Jesse James like a cross between a young Burl Ives and a Midwest Tony Soprano. But for me, it worked. It sagged when the gang members became hard to distinguish, the casual disappearance of Frank James was a bit well, casual, and as others have said the pistol shots seem strangely muffled (a period detail?). To be honest you do get to the point where you feel 'I've watched two hours, I might as well stick with it', but if you take it at face value as a historical psychological study - of Bob Ford and of Jesse (and how the legend was what people wanted), and don't take it as seriously as it occasionally takes itself (the voice-over is a flaw in that respect), you'll be able to enjoy how beautifully made it is. It's epic without having a huge cast or massive number of setpieces, and rewards concentration, a bit like a long stage play put on screen. If you 'get' Ingmar Bergman movies, or liked Deadwood, you'll probably enjoy it. If not, move along, nothing to see here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dreamlike film that's firmly anchored in reality...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's an almost dreamlike quality to this film which, given the nature of the story it tells and the disposition of the main characters, perpetually threatens to spill over into the stuff of nightmares. There are no heroes here (although Ford believed he would be considered one) and few people with any redeeming features. The story follows the final few months in the life of James (Brad Pitt) and the curious relationship he developed with Bob Ford (Casey Affleck), the idol-worshipping hanger-on who would eventually become his hero's killer. Because we know the outcome of the story from the outset, and because Pitt plays James as a character resigned to his fate even though he verges on paranoia in his mistrust of those around him, there is a very real sense of inevitability about the tale, as if nobody can escape their fate, which dovetails nicely with the slow, measured unfolding of the tale.Although this film contains all the attributes of its genre, it isn't a conventional western by any means. There's hardly any action, and what little violence it contains is presented almost matter-of-factly, with no concessions made with regard to glamorising the lifestyle and deeds of the subject. The one gunfight in the film takes place in a bedroom, with two men firing at each other from a distance of about three feet and repeatedly missing the target. Cowboys were lousy shots in reality, and legendary incidents (such as the gunfight at the OK Corral) apparently lasted no longer than a matter of seconds. It's refreshing, therefore, to see the de-glamorisation of the myth in this way (the only other westerns I can think of that successfully manage this are Dirty Little Billy and Eastwood's Unforgiven).The acting throughout is first-rate. Pitt eschews pretty-boy looks (he's too old for that now, anyway) in favour of a grizzled, weathered demeanour and a depth and inscrutability that is truly frightening at times. All his gang are terrified of him, and all believe (and, again, accept to a degree) that he will someday try to kill them. Affleck, too is terrific as Ford, something of a creep, a nobody who dreams of being somebody. It would have been easy for the character of Ford to have descended to the level of stooge but, again, the film takes the time to paint an altogether fuller picture of the man ? a picture that isn't complete until the last few seconds of the film. Paul Schneider also stands out as Dick Liddil.The assassination scene keeps with this aura of inevitability that pervades the entire film. James, knowing the Ford brothers are plotting against him, removes his guns and turns his back on them both. He sees Ford's reflection aiming a gun at him in the picture frame he is straightening but makes no attempt to avoid its bullet. Its an enigmatic touch, maybe intended to suggest that, for all the painstaking research carried out on the life and times of James, we shall never know the whole truth about his assassination and the events leading up to it.This is a film that can be wholeheartedly recommended to anyone who prefers not to disengage their brain when watching films. Everyone involved here ? director, writer, actors, cinematographer ? appears to be playing at the top of their game. A film like this is evidence, if it were ever really needed, that Hollywood can still finance and produce films of real and lasting quality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An underrated film that got overlooked at the Oscars.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't' know why this film was not even considered for something other than supporting actor (which Casey should of taken home) and best cinematography. This film was made in the exact same style as There will be blood and was almost as intense as No Country. To some Brad Pitt in the lead role is a turn-off because of his heartthrob image but he brings in a great but yet eerie performance of Jesse James which is portrayed perfectly and not one bit of fiction in his character. The idea of the film was to get into the mind game between Robert Ford and Jesse James and they pull it off perfectly. Some may agree that is was too slow a movie but if you give it time, let the action scenes come when they are needed as oppose to every other scene. My advice is to give this movie a shot, appreciate the music and camera work and enjoy</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Partners in paranoia...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An unusually thoughtful meditation on murder, THE ASSASSINATION OF JESSE JAMES BY THE COWARD BOB FORD cleverly sidesteps most of the gun play that made the James-Younger gang so (in)famous and focuses instead on the cult of personality and the debilitating power of paranoia. While Brad Pitt as the cobra-calm eye of the storm more than holds his own, the nail-biting performances by both Casey Affleck and Sam Rockwell give this one an edge-of-your-seat tension that is, for the most part, unrelieved. Their paranoia, ratcheted slowly to the nth degree, results finally in the foregone conclusion (see the title)- but doesn't stop there. The film follows through (as did the far more stylized TOMBSTONE, several years ago) on the aftermath of the gun play. Though there's very little in the way of actual gun play, THE ASSASSINATION OF JESSE JAMES is yet another notable notch on Hollywood's figurative six-shooter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I've heard about this movie, I immediately thought it would be a typical western with Brad Pitt wielding his guns, acting all Robin Hood... But when I heard that Pitt was presented with a 'best actor' award in Venice festival. It immediately caught my attention. The reviews were great and so I decided to wait for it on a DVD and check it out. And my God, did I not regret that I did! I cannot say for sure but it looks like the best movie I've seen to date! I's got so much depth, morality and truth that you want to believe in. The cinematography by Roger Deakins is unbelieviably beautiful, the direction by Andrew Dominik is flawless, the cast is superb and the leads by Pitt and Affleck are great. Absolutely astonishing experience. It strikes you so deeply and never lets you go. An unforggetable masterpiece and certainly one of the best movies of the past year - along with No Country for Old Men and There will be Blood, another western based dramas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A crime that is too elegant to punish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best films I've ever seen. The direction, acting, and cinematography are superb. This is one of the few films where the dialogs are remarkably spontaneous as if they were almost the way how real people talk in real life. I was just stunned.I must commend Sam Rockwell's acting. He was really good. I always knew he had a talent and this movie brought out the best from him.The story has stitched the perfect web of entanglement that portrayed a poignant and discomforting human aspect.As regards Brad Pitt's acting, I must say that he had some good and bad points.First, it was not the way real men cry. When alpha men cry, they must not show facial expressions of sadness; when they cry, the tears just flow and when somebody catches them crying, they deny it as if they never cried. Brad Pitt failed to portray this in more than three instances.Brad Pitt cannot avoid having to show off his pretty boy image when he does his cute expressions that they make him appear he wanted to appear in his 'cute' trademark shot. He did this, like, twice, which almost ruined the portrayal of an outlaw. It was just like, Pitt wanted to appear as a cute outlaw.Brad Pitt performed as demanded in most parts of the film, but I will still have reservations towards him if I were to give the Best Actor award.The scenery was powerful. Outstanding cinematography.The film showed a little more than what the story needed to tell. It would have sufficed to have told what happened to Robert Ford after he killed Jesse James in writing. Giving lots of details to what happened to him only added more insult to his injury as if rubbing salt to a wound. Denouement in this point was unnecessary.It is by far the film where I saw the best acting of Casey Affleck. He was able to take my approval when it comes to "Surprised" scenes. He did a good job. He did a great acting but he was not able to perfectly portray a character that was not his age. Although Casey looked young, several years younger than the person he is older than (Paul Schneider), his body language, mannerisms, and the way he talked always revealed his true age. I noticed them, thinking that Casey was young and before confirming his real age.It must be a crime not to commend the acting performances of Paul Schneider, Sam Shepard, James Defelice, and most especially Garret Dillahunt (Ed Miller). I could really not ask for more.Overall, this movie is great and to me, it will become a classic and an icon.</fullReview>

If the middle 100 minutes were chopped in half, or used to develop the back story, in my opinion, the movie would have been more enjoyable. The first and last 15 minutes were much more engaging.It seems that the story held to the actual events as much as possible, but some deviation for the sake of the viewer is OK with me.

		<shortDescription>powerful, poetic, compelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title already tells the whole story and yet The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford still manages to enamor its audience with its powerful, poetic cinematography and compelling acting that you will forgive its flaws, which are few.Director Andrew Dominik really took his time (2.6 hours!), but this is established early on, and lulls you into the idyllic environs of the time. You realize later on that this was necessary, as this helps set up the unexpected moments.Playing Robert Ford is Casey Affleck, who is arguably nominated for an Oscar for Best Performance Supporting Actor when he was practically the lead. He was perfect for the role: his cracking voice and shifty manner, his feeble, irksome and spineless performance is exceptional, reminiscent of The Talented Mr. Ripley. He is able to mix showing his deep awe and fear of his childhood idol Jesse James, played by Brad Pitt.For the first time, Pitt becomes the character he plays in the movie and it's unnerving. He was the perfect mix of charismatic yet scary; you don't know when he'll snap so you're also kept on your toes just like the others around him. Disturbed, suspicious and agitated, he could be smooth and suave one moment, then unleash his wrath so quickly. Even when he had no lines, his face and gestures spoke volumes. You could imagine feeling very vulnerable, the way he'd look at people when he's trying to figure out if they were lying. He is at once tormented, charming, and terrifying.Pitt and Affleck successfully translate the complexities on screen: Jesse James is the fierce bandit who made people uneasy yet is able to evoke compassion; Robert Ford tries so hard to please buts ends up forgettable and despised.The attention given to the rest of the cast, which includes Sam Rockwell (as Robert's brother Charley), Mary-Louise Parker (as Jesse's wife Zee), and Sam Shepard (as Jesse's brother Frank) was distracting but they deserve their screen time. Roger Deakins must win the Best Achievement in Cinematography Oscar for his work in this film, as he expertly toyed between the stark, Spartan settings during the day and the more gritty scenery at night.</fullReview>

I mist say the score is what continues to stick with me, especially 'A Song For Bob' which plays in the background during the final scenes of the story. This song, which is almost spooky, perfectly captures all that going on in the mind of the character in which the song is named.This will go down as a classic and I am very anxious to see new efforts from this director who has a very promising future in this business. another score for Plan B.

There were two western films 2007 worth seeing:"3:10 to Yuma" and this one(I don't consider "There will be blood" being a western).But TAOJJ outperforms 3:10 to Yuma in any possible way.The movie is very realistic and sticks to the true story of Jesse James.Even the decor for the house he lived in was a 1:1 reconstruction.The performance of Pitt is outstanding as well as Casey Affleck's. Too bad for Affleck that he will have to wait for that Oscar. Javier Bardem was definitely better in "No country for old men"I usually write larger reviews when I hate a movie so I'll keep this one short.One more thing...Can someone in the world explain to me how they nominate crap like "Juno" for best picture and leave masterpieces like TAOJJ out of the race??!?!?

The two leads are fleshed out so deeply that, by the film's end, you know exactly why these two men are doing what they're doing, without need of explanatory dialogue or rich narration. And it's complimented by two of the best performances of the year: Pitt's rogue, mysterious, and near-evil outlaw contrasted perfectly with Affleck's quiet, awkward, and off-putting coward. I think it's fascinating how Ford is the real protagonist of the film, and how his consuming desire to become Jesse James culminates in a devastating and fitting finale. Coupled with the beautiful cinematography (I particularly loved the shots with the hazy edges) and the terrific score, this is a character study of the highest order.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Western Since Unforgiven</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the finest western movies this viewer has ever seen. There is so much atmosphere here it's hard to take it all in. Truly amazing cinematography with every device imaginable. As for the story it's quite interesting because it doesn't try to be too broad, it's narrowly about how Robert Ford's emotional state was such that his idolization of Jesse James turned into an all consuming paranoia...Ultimately leading to the "cowardice" way he assassinated who was at the time Missouri's most wanted outlaw.The eccentricity and malevolent ways of Jesse James are portrayed stunningly well by Brad Pitt. Its the framework the entire movie hangs on as there is simply no story without this infamous western icon being portrayed realistically...Exuding dark menace and creating palpable fear among friend and foe alike. James may be a folk hero to some, but Pitt shows him as a heartless and unconscionable empty soul. Devoid of a moral compass, James can shoot a "friend" in the back without remorse or pistol whip a young child experiencing no regrets. In spite of this unrepentant personality James was very charismatic...This is a juxtaposition certainly driven home by Pitt's screen presence-simply put, he is the "Outlaw Jesse James".This dark backdrop brings us to Casey Affleck's Robert Ford. With James you want him to get caught, but you like him regardless. But, with Ford I was as conflicted as was his character so miraculously inhabited by Affleck. Is Ford as evil as James? Is he sane or insane? Though not loyal is he doing his fellow citizens some kind of justice that he should be commended for? The answers, all of them, are being pondered in every frame here. What may appear to be a slow paced movie is so packed with morality plays it's nothing short of amazing. True excellence in directing and writing make this a wringing experience to watch. But watch you will and somehow two and a half hours pass with little or no regard.Do not miss this movie. Brad Pitt has already shown he can inhabit a character completely, here he raises his personal bar to the highest yet. Casey Affleck will, after this, be A-listed simply because he is able to stand toe to toe with Pitt's great performance, maybe even playing a more difficult character in the bargain and doing so with aplomb. Westerns don't come better...And to beat all it's based on historical truth!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film could have been one of the best westerns in recent memory if they had dropped the horrible, destructive, condescending voice-over narration, hired a tougher editor, and tightened up some of the narrative arc. Brad Pitt, who is as uneven an actor as they come, isn't very good here?the role called for an actor with a greater range who could handle the tonal shifts and juggle the disparate relationships better?but Casey Affleck is stunning. It's Casey's breakout role and one that marks him as the better actor in the Affleck family. The tense scenes in the middle and toward the end feel and move like a European art-house film, which is to say that they spend a lot of slooww time developing tense relationships between the characters and allowing fate to darken the proceedings, but the film as a whole fails for some of the reasons I mentioned. Something tells me an executive forced the director to add the voice-over narration. It's the cancer of the film. Without the narration, the film had been relying primarily on photography, subtle shifts in character, gorgeous costumes and sets, and metaphor?as a good film should. I was disappointed, not so much because the narration ruined the film, but because whoever the decision maker was couldn't see that the film was better without a storyteller?that it held together better without it. Here we are in Schrader's "postcinema era" and Hollywood still hasn't figured out how to let a film be what it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A modern masterpiece that will age like classics of the past</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>DISCLAIMER: YOU MUST HAVE A LONG ATTENTION SPAN TO WATCH THIS MOVIE.I have seen this movie twice. The first time I saw it was after a 10 hour work day -- bad decision. This movie requires an alert and fully attentive viewer. The pace is deliberate.The second time I saw it, I couldn't help but note that I was watching a modern masterpiece. The cinematography, the acting, the direction, the score all come together to weave a movie that will stay true for years to come.I had the same feeling and level of appreciation when I watched The Shawshank Redemption over time. When I first saw it, I hated it. I felt it was too slow and too deliberate. When I gave it another chance, I noticed the nuances in the plot and the positive nature of the deliberate pace.The same can be said about The Assassination Of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford.It's timeless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A western unlike any other you may have seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Revisionist westerns are nothing new. They have been around since the fifties when directors realized they could be used to explore motives and psychologies deeper than conventional good guy versus bad guy histrionics. In 1969 Hollywood gave us two radical 'revisionist' westerns in which the style of the movie itself was used to subvert the genre. Although radically different in tone, both George Roy Hill's "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" and Sam Peckinpah's "The Wild Bunch" seemed to signal, if not quite the death of the genre, then a move away from the kind of western Hollywood had been giving us thus far. Since then, of course, westerns have been few and far between but all of them seem to have been influenced by this departure.Perhaps "The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford" moves further away than most from the traditional format. It certainly looks traditional. Roger Deakins' stunning cinematography vividly captures, not just the wide open spaces, but the dark, lamp-lit interiors to great effect. And it sounds traditional as well. The writer, Andrew Dominik, who also directed the film, in adapting Ron Hansen's source novel, has given full voice to the quaintly idiomatic dialogue of those times. In this respect it is much more traditional than many westerns of the thirties, forties or fifties. In every other respect it qualifies, in spades, for the term 'revisionist'.For a start there is little action. This is no gun-slinging oater but a long, (160 minutes), slow, deliberate character piece. When the film begins Jesse's life is almost over. The narrator tells us of his past deeds and what has brought him to this point. He also fills us in on the psychology of the man with Brad Pitt filling in the rest with a superb, career-defining performance. This is not the Jesse James of legend, (although, of course, in the film he is accorded legendary status); no Robin Hood figure robbing the rich and giving it to the poor but a pathologically unstable man, no longer a boy yet without maturity. His brother Frank, (a superb but under-used Sam Shepard), is like a gnarled father-figure to him. This Jesse is an outlaw first and foremost, a cold-blooded killer destined to live on the hop or be hunted down and killed.Perhaps it is this lack of maturity that draws him to the even more immature Robert Ford. It has been noted that this version of events is really a study in celebrity or rather a study of the perils that celebrity brings. Ford is the ultimate fan but a fan whose final act of homage is to destroy the star to whom he's drawn. At one point Jesse says to him 'I don't know if you want to be like me or want to be me'. It also could be argued that Ford was homosexually attracted to Jesse were it not for the fact he comes over as such a pathetically asexual creature, at least while Jesse is still alive. Rather he becomes Jesse's whipping-boy and you may think, 'is it any wonder the worm has turned'.Much of the film's two hour forty minute running time is taken up with talk and talk that seeks to explore the psychosis of its protagonists. I can understand why this won't be to everybody's taste. We live in an action-fueled age and have short attention spans. This is a film that demands a lot from its audience and amply rewards us. It is a beautifully crafted movie, intelligent and thought-provoking. Dominik's influences range from Peckinpah and Eastwood to Terrence Mallick yet the film seems wholly original, unlike anything in the genre we may have encountered before.If Pitt is a superb, taciturn Jesse then Casey Affleck is a mesmerizing Robert Ford. It's a great performance from this young and basically untried actor who, in every gesture, in the flicker of his eyes, in the faltering speech, inhabits the part entirely, as much in his mind as in his body. He has already won a number of critic's prizes for his performance but is unlikely to pick up the Oscar. The Academy prefers showier displays which is why this magnificent film is unlikely to prove a success either at the Oscars or with the public at large.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watching this movie was like having a session on the couch with my Jewish analyst...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is no way a typical "cowboys vs. outlaws" movie. It is a wonderful study of characters. What made me uncomfortable watching this movie is the other leading character Coward Robert Ford. In the movie, he is referred to as "Bob." In looks (my younger days) and mentality, I strongly identified with Bob in the movie. It was like taking a Fourth Step Personal Inventory in a 12th Step Program. This is the way I behaved in my youth. I was sort of a coward when it came to physical contacts but not in expressing myself with words. With words, I have always been courageous and even foolhardy.I was attracted to men like Jesse James in this movie. I had friendships with Mafia hoods while living in Brooklyn Heights, New York City. The higher up in the Mafia, the more I wanted to be their friend. They wanted to be with me because I was their alter ego. I was the smart college, advertising talent and goody-goody-two-shoes never committing crimes and even being truthful. Yet, they did not trust me as Jesse James, on a gut level, did not trust Robert (Bob) Ford.Watching this movie was like having a session on the couch with my Jewish analyst who looked a lot like Woody Allen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Six Cinematic Offences</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A critic once said that watching "The Assassination of Jesse James..." is like watching a book on tape. That's such a brilliant and succinct description that there's not much to add to it. I'll try to enumerate the film's cinematic offences anyway, but forgive me if I don't have the original writer's wit.1) A good movie should begin and end in sensible places. Not only does "The Assassination of Jesse James..." finish long after its ending, but it starts long before its beginning.2) Actors should have an excuse for lending their talents to a film, but the only real speaking role in "The Assassination of Jesse James..." is that of the narrator.3) The audience deserves at least one character they can side with. But in "The Assassination of Jesse James..." no reason is ever supplied as to why we should care about any of the characters, from Jesse James and Robert Ford to the sundry other gang members who get shot along the way.4) Dialogue in a film should express to the audience the thoughts and feelings of the characters. Since it's difficult to care what any of them think or feel, the fact that they mumble all of their overwrought lines hardly matters.5) A movie should seek to entertain its audience in some way, shape, or form. "The Assassination of Jesse James..." seeks only to put its audience to sleep.6) A movie should be a movie, and not a narrated slide show. The story should be told with action, dialogue, and images, and not by a didactic voice-over. "The Assassination of Jesse James..." tramples this rule into the ground.7) On the plus side, it's good news for insomniacs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A star each for the photography and Candian locations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the photography and landscape are the best and only good elements to a film, it is bad. Indeed both photography and location are time used covers for a bad film and this one is really awful.What's wrong with it can be summed up in Billy Wilder's comment about Titanic: Where's the story in that? In this film it lacks any dram at all, it has been written and conceived as a extended Ken Burns' historical film. But like the magisterial series Burns did on the Civil War the explication and narration of events clarifies and reveals, it is not dramatic unless the use of that word is so misunderstood.In "The assassination...." the same strategy is used with voice over narrating what is being shown on screen. That is not bad: it's not even admissible to film school, its so bad. Nothing is dramatized, the dialog has all the characters talking in similar cadence and the central relationship between James and Ford is left ambiguous, when it is the crux of the film.The result is a bloated, pompous, and over long movie; of course, as if the narcoleptic effects of such a long film will add significance to it. No it won't and it will join 'Heaven's Gate' and 'Days of Heaven' as failures.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lackluster would be the best word I can think of to describe this film. The only thing that might have helped compensate for the endless morbidity, slow pace, depressing soundtrack and emotionally stunted characters would have been a bit of comic relief. Of course, that wouldn't fit the dark, morose and somber celebration of criminals in the American west. Besides feeling empty at the end of this long, long, long movie, I was absolutely bewildered by the apparently historical narration that painted the public as admiring Jesse. They paid to see the house where he was shot. They bought his portrait in death. They petitioned the governor to pardon the man who killed Jesse's assassin, and he did! What is wrong with this country? Oh, I forgot. This is the same nation that reelected Nixon and Bush.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thanks to the Venice Film Festival for being the only ones that recognized that the real star of this artistic masterpiece is Brad Pitt, not Casey Affleck.This is another western that doesn't fit the mold. It is an art film in every sense of the word. From the brilliant cinematography by Roger Deakins, a seven-time Oscar nominee (Fargo, No Country for Old Men, O Brother, Where Art Thou?, The Shawshank Redemption, The Man Who Wasn't There, Kundun, and this film), to the superb acting in an ensemble that provide a thrilling experience for 160 minutes.Yes, Affleck was very good, and probably gave the performance of his career, but Pitt was clearly the star as Jesse James, a man possessed. He could go from friend to unemotional killer in an instant. He possessed an uncanny ability to discern the thoughts of others. He knew his time was over and committed suicide the only way he could.The film was an interesting study of the celebrity cult that we experience today. Ford would have been right at home in People, or Entertainment Weekly, as someone who had style, but no substance.If you are looking for bang, bang, shoot-em-up, look elsewhere. This is a film to be watched and studied.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Review: The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was ignored. Don't get me wrong; I think the Academy picked some great picks for their nominations, but they screwed this picture. How did this not win Best Cinematography? How did this not get a Nom for anything else? How did Juno get a damn Nom over this? (Not that Juno is bad).'The Assassination of Jesse James' was a very exciting and moving film with beautiful cinematography, great acting, great script, and so much more. When the film starts out, it sets the tone immediately. The coloring; the music; everything about this film is all very well crafted to carry the movie to viewing bliss.The color of the movie is constantly a blue/gray, like an overcast; no sun showing through the clouds. To boost the look, a heavy yet light score is added with rumbling bass hitting in beat. The best example of this is the scene when they rob a train. Jesse feels the tracks for vibrations, and as the train comes into the view, and we see the light peaking in through the trees, all sound dies, and all we hear is the score.This film is great, and though it might not deserve winning Best Picture, it certainly deserved a nomination. Casey Affleck thoroughly deserved his nomination. He was very unsettling, and yet we felt bad for him, as we did with Jesse.The movie doesn't make you choose who the 'Good Guy' is to root for, because in a sense, no one is good, but no one is bad.This movie is highly recommended from me.Rating: ***1/2 (of 4) Entertainment: ***** (of 5)</fullReview>

It takes 3 hours to agonizingly meander through a story that could be told well in 30 minutes. The dialog, with only few redeeming exceptions, was dull, uninspired and rather pointless to the overall plot. It was honestly the most boring movie I've seen in the last few years.The visual elements of this movie are excellent. The art of telling a story with these visual elements fails miserably.

		<shortDescription>One of the best of 2007</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the very best films of 2007 is THE ASSASSINATION OF JESSE JAMES BY THE COWARD ROBERT FORD starring Brad Pitt as the infamous Jesse James and Casey Affleck as his murderer, Robert Ford.In the mid 1800's, the James brothers were the key figures of a gang centralized in Missouri most notably famous for robbing trains all throughout the Midwest. They were in many young men and women's eyes, saviors and modern day legends that broke free from the strain and boredom of everyday life, stealing from the rich, living spontaneously, questioning and denying the government. It was a life that many tried, but only a handful mastered. Arguably the most culturally popular man at the time, for his handsome and eccentric looks, his even yet dangerous temper, and his wily and daredevil lifestyle, Jesse James was envied far and wide; especially by Robert Ford, a young man who once only admired James from comic strips, preaching his law and emulating his gait and dress, but soon, through the connection of his brother Charley Ford, became one of his most trusted side kicks.The rest is history.JESSE JAMES is a beautiful film to look at with great cinematography of wide snow swept landscapes by Roger Deakins and authentic costume design, as well as an interesting and appropriate score by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis. But the acting really holds this film above the clouds with Pitt and Affleck both giving performances of their careers, Sam Rockwell as Charley Ford is also great in support. Pitt was born to play Jesse James as was Affleck to play Bob Ford.A great study of what these men may have been like, and how fate linked them forever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Good Ending, but way too long...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on a book, the pacing may have been long, necessary and useful in the novel, but from the beginning, I felt that this movie was going nowhere following a bunch of bandits and their uneventful, uninteresting lives. If someone got caught up in the legendary tales of Jesse James like a good portion of America at the time, I certainly did not from watching the movie. Yes, Brad Pitt and director Andrew Dominik portray him as a more down-to-earth, conflicted person which is fine, yet, there is no transmission to the viewer of the type of blind admiration that Richard Ford feels for him.The younger Affleck, Casey, plays the younger brother of the two 'side-kick wannabes' of Jesse James and his older brother. He plays the coward well and is a good counterpart to Pitt's outwardly assurance. From the title, even though it is strategically not actually shown in the beginning of the movie, we know that Ford is going to kill Jesse James. We don't know how and we don't know exactly why, although we have a strong suspicion.Visually, there are a few great moments. Scenery. The outdoors. Horses. Houses. America at the end of the 19th century. Yet, the movie is too static, the story too uninvolving. Not having read the book, but being privy to surely to some of its passages in the voice-over narration, I have to say that I imagine that writer Ron Hansen's delightful descriptions were much more potent than even good actors in a room with regular lines and not much to do. In fact the best parts of the movie were this passages which makes me think that the book may have had additional richness not well translated in the film.In any case, especially at close to 3 hours, this film did not work. The last half hour (the leading up and the aftermath of the assassination) were by far the best part of the movie. If that type of cunning film-making, introspection and moving storyline could have served the rest of the movie, I would be rooting too. Yet I cannot say why this film is so highly-regarded as it stands now and as I have seen it last night. Better luck next time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>both amazing and annoying, it's a revisionist western with content and style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With maybe the longest title of any film this year, the Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, writer/director Andrew Dominik is out to make a real statement on the legacy of outlaw Jesse James and the man who shot him, Robert Ford. Was it murder or almost a kind of suicide? Was Bob Ford a hero, a coward, or just reluctant to get any of the press he originally might have wanted as a youth? Questions are raised legitimately by the filmmaker, and they aren't questions that shouldn't be overlooked. But there's a catch, actually a couple: as Dominik wants to stay truthful to the original source AND make an epic film, he makes a work that tells too much while also showing in a style that veers between the magisterial and the false. It's a subjective thing, to be sure, when looking at the cinematography of a film and how it is effective to the senses, though it could be something more legitimately arguable in looking at if it works for the material itself. These, of course, are the big minuses, which I'll get to in a moment.But one aspect to 'Jesse James' that should be noteworthy all the way is Brad Pitt's performance. He's been a Hollywood star since I can remember, even going back to the mid-90s when he started to break out of character actor parts and into marquee status. Now here's a sort of throwback to the best work he's done as a quasi-chameleon and still with the gravitas of a star. It's a mesmerizing portrayal of a man who is as mysterious as he is deadly, psychotic, loving, paranoid, scary, crazy, affable, and even charming. Just a little facial movement or raise or lowering of the lip indicates so much, and Pitt nails it every time, even in scenes where he almost starts to drag along with the dialog. It is, at the least, worthwhile alone to see the film for him (maybe a little less so for the rest of the cast who, while good at what they do, are there as typical back-up western parts). Affleck is also a good co-star, who has to play mostly in one-note status (mostly pouty, like a nerdy kid on the playground who is scared s***-less but out for blood). But it is, at its best, the Brad Pitt show, which is rare to see as of late in his career.In fact, it's probably Pitt that probably kept me in my seat through most of the film. Dominik's direction and writing are, on the other hand, a mixed bag. He wants to make a sprawling, affecting tome on the nature of a legend and of the effect it has on those around the person (who is, as Ford acknowledges, just a person), while coating it as an auteur. His tactic is to take as much narration possible, and it's literal overkill (no pun intended); we hear some moments when the narrator comments on Robert Ford looking through a closet! What does this add? It turns right from the start, and off and on until especially the last fifteen minutes, into a history lesson as much as a dramatization, which disrupts the intentions of making it a subjective perspective. OK, it's known, James was an icon for Americans as a figure of anti-establishment as part of a kind of establishment (not above the law but not one who should've been killed by a man of no consequence like Bob Ford). But does it need to be pounded over the head? It doesn't help then that cinematographer Roger Deakins adds to the mixed feelings. He captures many wide vistas, tight rooms and dark night exteriors (I did love the train robbing shots) like a true pro. But what are we to make of the constant shots with soft-focus? The explanation I have read is that it's meant to represent the truth that is blurred by legend in the story. That's fine to hear after the fact, but while sitting and watching the movie it just doesn't make sense- it's less poetry and more a consistent form of drab self-indulgence. After seeing No Country for Old Men, where Deakins made, ironically, a better looking western set in 1980, it becomes clear that the directing has to also be taken into account. And this goes without saying that it isn't a bad movie at all. Dominik does explore the themes at work here, with the damnation of betrayal and the fatality of the criminal, plus the side of America as a kind of hidden backdrop of pain and misery and fear of death. It's just that they're explored for too long and without the kind of depth that's really required. If you're looking for a real classic interpretation of the Jesse James/Robert Ford saga, watch I Shot Jesse James by Samuel Fuller. It might not have the aspirations of great art that 'Assassination' has, but in its B-movie way it's almost a masterpiece in examining some of the same material.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This had potential to be an extremely good movie. It had potential to be one of the finest Western movies made in this decade. However, for some people it gives off the classic "Did I watch the same movie that everybody else watched" type of vibe. The movie moved slower than this year's Notre Dame offense, and had the excitement level of watching the Detroit Red Wings home opener. I am one of the biggest Western fans out there, but I struggled just to stay awake during the near three-hour film. It ends giving you a sense of morbidness, while some parts of the movie seem like more of a horror than a Western. Why do most people go to see Western Films??? Action!!! Action!!! Action!!! There wasn't even one good shootout scene in the entire film. And the narration just gave another weird sense of awkwardness towards the film.Some people are trying to say that this is one of the best Western films of the era, but in my opinion, its not even the best one of the year. The remake of the classic 3:10 to Yuma was much more intense and exciting than this movie.Yes, this is all just my opinion, and I'm sure many of you will disagree, but once again, a great story, but poor transitions and terrible lack of action and suspense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been a great year for films, and right now, this one is my favorite. I went without knowing the source material, and had only read some reviews which were mixed. I expected a pretentious mess, but instead was enthralled. I haven't seen a film that was as original as this one, that is, it references no other. Comparing it to the work of Terrence Malick is only valid because he's another unique director (who included fields of waving wheat). This has a potent narrative pull.I don't remember seeing a film that fuses images, acting, music, meticulous period detail in its art direction and mood so seamlessly. Despite claims that it's overlong, each scene--all unexpected--moves the action forward. The title tells us what's going to happen. We're left to see why...and when. So there's incredible tension leading up to the killing. While all the performers are extraordinary, Casey Affleck dominates this group of psychopaths so successfully that everyone else looks quite normal (he out Norman's Norman Bates). His very complex character is so thoroughly laid out before us that the aftermath of his notorious act disappoints us as much as it did Robert Ford.Because this film is so frankly original, I think people might resist it. But if you buy your ticket without expectation (this is not a Western; it's a psychological exploration of a wide range of deviants), you're in for an astonishing experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Zen of Celebrity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. The star of this film is Super-Cinematographer Roger Deakins. This guy is a true artist with a camera and thanks to the excruciatingly slow pace here, we get plenty of opportunities to admire his craft. I am not just talking about the stunning snow scenery, but pay attention to the way Mr. Deakins photographs faces and the movements of the actors. It is truly a technical marvel of film-making.As you might guess, when the best thing about the film is the cinematography, it may not deliver the goods from a dramatic standpoint. I won't call this a snoozer, but if the pace were any slower it could have been just as effective as an old fashioned slide show.The film is really not about Jesse James and it really isn't too much about the coward Bob Ford. It really is about one desperate attempt to get famous ... to reach celebrity status. As the old saying goes, be careful what you ask for. Brad Pitt does a nice job capturing the existential side of the famed bank robber, but the film really belongs to Casey Affleck, in his first true lead role. I must admit, Affleck's mumbling and fake naivety wear thin very quickly. Sure he may be the best actor among the Affleck brothers, but is that really saying much? New Zealand director Andrew Dominik put together quite a supporting cast but really doesn't now what to do with it. There is so much wasted talent ... in particular, Sam Shepard and Zooey Deschanel, whose roles appeared to be thrown in at the last minute. Faring better are James Carville in a surprisingly effective role as the Governor, Paul Schneider as a creepy Wood, Nick Cave in a weird scene as a saloon singer, Sam Rockwell as Ford's older brother and the always effective and interesting Michael Parks, who is to "GD" what Samuel L. Jackson is to "MF".As a work of art, this is definitely one to see. From a dramatic standpoint, it is quite a let down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Character assassination</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>New Zealand director Andrew Dominik breaks many genre rules with this unconventional western about the illustrious outlaw Jesse James and his assassin Bob Ford. Better he should have broken something else (let's start with his type-writer) in this turgid, sluggish western that moves slower than a Conestoga wagon through the Badlands in the 19th century.The first rule he forgoes is in ignoring the axiom that Western characters are men of few words. The James brothers are in the twilight of their careers and this last gang they have assembled is a band of dullards and morons that have trouble putting a sentence together in between long vacant stares. The film opens promisingly enough as the brothers plan a train robbery in a stark wilderness setting. Here Bob Ford, the delusional, James worshiping sidekick attempts to inveigle his way into the good graces of Frank (played with a fine stoic, resignation by Sam Shepard) who will have none of it.Casey Affleck's speech and tick affected Ford is interesting for the first half hour of the film before he becomes downright annoying for the rest of it. Nevertheless, brother Jesse takes him under his wing and for over two hours we are given obvious hints from the pursuit of fame to latent homosexuality as reasons for Ford's ultimate act of treachery. Director Dominik clearly loves cowboy movies. He manages to plagiarize (in a decent film this would be called homage) from westerns good and bad. The Searchers, McCabe and Mrs. Miller, The Left handed Gun, The Great Train Robbery and Dead Man are among others all hinted at. Visually it has some striking moments but overall the cinematography is uneven. At ninety minutes this would have been a bad film. At two and one half hours it becomes a tortuous one. While the heavy handed Dominick deserves most of the blame, producer and actor Brad Pitt should have strangled this project at birth. His comatose performance of Jesse is all pose and little substance and as producer he green lighted this soporific monstrosities running time. For more engrossing, entertaining, better acted and filmed evocations of the James legend I strongly suggest you see The 1939 Henry King Jesse James with Tyrone Power and Henry Fonda and the 1973 Philip Kauffman film The Great Northfield Minnesota Raid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong characterisation and acting, weak plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's much to like in Andrew Dominik's film, 'The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford': most of all, it truly is a psychological western. Brad Pitt is excellent as Jesse, a murderous but charismatic bully, fully aware of his own magnetism and ability to inspire terror; while a group of misfits gather around him, bound to him through fear, envy, idolisation and daydreams. But somehow the plot doesn't quite work: Jesse seems to rightly distrust his acolytes, yet nonetheless, leaves his fate in their hands. The movie's solemn narration (not to mention its title) gives away the plot; while the broader context (the aftermath of the American civil war, which goes a long way to explaining James' status as a folk hero) is passed over. Ultimately, it's a lengthy movie, in which not enough happens that is not foreseeable from the earliest scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite film. The motion sequence captured in every scene is just mesmerizing. The lighting and the colors being played here just perfectly blend with the natural surrounding. The narrator provides a handy job to make it a downfall film about Jesse James.The music just scores all the name. Thanks to Nick Cave and Warren Ellis.The film tells the story of Robert Ford (Casey Affleck), a seemingly insecure man seen as a coward by those around him. He grown up idolizing the outlaw, Jesse James (Brad Pitt). He finds James in Missouri and joins his gang, taking part in a train robbery.Gradually, he forms a complex love and hate relationship with James, still admiring him to the point of obsession, but also becoming resentful and somewhat fearful due to James' bullying nature. Even after the gang members have gone their separate ways after the last train robbery, Jesse James takes to calling in on his old gang, killing some of them and terrorizing the relatives of others.Ford ends up shooting Wood Hite (Jeremy Renner) after he comes to the house looking for Dick Liddil (Paul Schneider). Wood and Dick had a falling out because Dick defiled Wood's father's wife in Kentucky. Resulting in a gun-battle, Ford shoots Wood in the head just as he is about to do the same to Dick.Jesse not knowing Ford and his brother Charley (Sam Rockwell) are hired to arrest James by Governor Crittenden (James Carville). This is not as easy a task as it seems: Charley is too scared of Jesse to raise his gun against him and Jesse proves on more than one occasion that he is never out of reach for his guns. Even when he appears to be asleep, he can awaken at a moment upon hearing the sound of a gun drawn or footsteps. Given these circumstances, Robert decides killing him would be safer.On the day of the shooting, both Ford boys wrestle with task they have been given, especially Charley. Robert notices a paper on the couch with the headline "The Arrest and Confession of Dick Liddil" and hides it under a cushion from Jesse. Jesse finds the paper and reads about how he was caught three weeks before and asks Robert if he was in the area.There seem to be some silent thought as if he knows that his time has come that, Jesse takes his gun belt off. He notice a dusty picture on the wall then watches in the reflection of the picture as Ford draws his gun and shoots him from behind.The body of Jesse James was examined and sold to circus troupe and onwards to museum as public display to tell everyone that Jesse James will no longer terrorize the town.After the assassination, Robert and and Charley become actors in a theater show. They portrayed as Jesse James and Robert Ford himself shooting Jesse in the head from repetitiously. Until one scene, he was shunned by one audience as a coward shooter. Enraged, he fought with the audience.Ten years later, he seems to own a saloon and met a dancer named Dorothy Evans (Zooey Deschanel). He confessed to her about his murder and betrayal to Jesse James.The next day at the saloon, an unknown man said, "Hello Bob". And Robert was shot and died instantly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Long of a Title, Suffice to say: He Died</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, what a spoiler the title of The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford was. I'm not into westerns, but strangely, when I do watch one, I generally like them. This one I did?albeit it was rather slow, VERY long and already gave away the ending in the title. Yeah, I'm assuming they assumed everyone and their great-great-great-grandparents knew the story, but it's untrue ? the fact we all knew what happened. I didn't. In either case, it was entertaining, but not something I ever want to sit through again. Most notable was the performance of Casey Affleck even though Brad was still good, and the score and cinematography. Not my favorite western, not even in the top 5?this, coming from someone who's seen maybe a dozen westerns in my life, so it's somewhere in the bottom 10 (of 12)?but it's still worth a (as in one) viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>yes it is beautiful, the cinematography is unique indeed, but the script although appears to be cleverly written, the whole movie doesn't seem to be realistic enough to be convincing...look at this, 1 person gunfiring against 3 in a room? and as robbers they have such poor gunfire skills....shooting at each other at only few metres apart and still just managed to injure a leg?? conversation-wise, at times it lacks depth that i don't see what or why they are talking about ( not talking about casey's character or when people are talking to him though) when the story is already that slow-paced...even the acting does not help much to repair this seemingly disjointed plot. It relies too much on narration apparently to save some of its flaws in this regard.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brad Pitt stars as legendary Wild West outlaw Jesse James.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The nervy style of this newfangled Western, with its eerie, insinuating score by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis, is so effective that long after Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck have left the screen, emotional disturbance lingers like gun smoke. The film is an account of the final years of the outlaw Jesse James, how he came to be slain by a member of his own gang, and the curious aftermath of his death.The Assassination Of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford is ravishing looking, in muted tones that recall sepia-tinted photos, the story has a modern resonance; Affleck's grinning, sycophantic Ford is like a celebrity stalker-fan who goes to the extremes. Pitt's Jesse verges on psychosis, switching from charm to cold fury in an instant. This slow moving film, all showy vistas, field of waving corn and fast-moving clouds, aims for epic grandeur. But director Andrew Dominik also stages a night-time train robbery thrillingly. An elegy for the Old West, it is touched with brilliance throughout.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Art-house take on the James legend has style but lacks focus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (Andrew Dominik, 2007) has the stamp of authenticity, but is let down by sloppy pacing and a lack of focus. Casey Affleck is nothing short of brilliant as the 19-year-old Robert Ford, who's drawn into outlaw Jesse James' (Brad Pitt) dwindling band of confidants, only for his awestruck subservience to morph into dreams of revenge, betrayal and greatness. It's a plausible premise: if one was craving approval and was met only with insensitivity, the snub would be intensified by the accompanying feelings of servility. Add to that the lure of fame and the opportunity for Ford to finally seize the mettle and become a man, and you can see why a shifty young kid might grab the revolver his idol gave him and stick a bullet right through his brain.We start with the build-up to James' final heist, and that night-time train robbery itself is shot with impressionistic flair by cinematographer Roger Deakins. Indeed, there's plenty of great imagery in Dominik's film, as the work oscillates between painstaking realism (via impressively-detailed sets and a busy, factual voice-over) and a sort of heightened otherworldiness. But such sporadic artistry sponsors a narrative that gives the impression of being methodical, whilst leaping all over the place. The filmmaker's debt to Terrence Malick is obvious in the meticulously-composed wide shots, but the movie lacks the hypnotic rhythm of Badlands - and therefore its weighty cumulative impact. Apparently the film was taken out of Dominik's hands and recut into various versions, which might explain the rogue pacing, as well as a shapeless extended epilogue that seems to undermine the film's point of view, as its voice-over artist takes to providing an audio commentary.That's not to say there isn't a lot to like in this ambitious, art-house take on the James legend. Affleck and Sam Rockwell - as screen brother Charley - offer definitive portrayals of the Fords, compensating for Pitt's charismatic but empty lead turn, and there are passages of great insight and truth, even as the film takes to hurtling through history at the close. But despite the inevitable tension in its slow, stately presentation of the titular deed itself, the little gem to be found within the film's largely worthless coda - Ford's qualified success on the New York stage - and the fine Nick Cave/Warren Ellis score, it looks more like an interesting failure than a modern classic. It's still a lot better than the Tyrone Power version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I failed to see any point in this movie. It is certainly artistic with several Andrew Wyeth type scenes. But there are a plethora of characters who are interchangeable and look alike. There is a voice over that desperately tries to make this movie appear to be a serious undertaking. What we get for over 2 hours is a lot of style with a lot of postcard scenes. Was there any editing done in this movie at all? Or did everyone believe that this was an artistic masterpiece? It's mostly visual pretentiousness.It's a very long movie and the seasons and the scenery change rapidly. There are scenes and dialogue that appear for appearance sake. In the end do we really care about Jesse James?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A strange obsessive film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film on DVD while lying in bed late at night - I mention this as it might have influenced how I feel about it. I found the film to have an obsessive, haunting, but authentic quality about it.Regardless of personal performances I felt that overall the film gave a very good look at a certain period in American history. Unlike films like "Young Guns" very little is glamorized here. People are not thrown back by gunfire - they drop from the trauma - and gunfights are a haphazard affair. All that was much like what "The West" was like, rather than how it was portrayed in novels and films. The length of the film, with its long conversation driven sequences with little background music also emphasize the period nature of the topic. Before radio, records and TV, folk found slower ways to pass the time.The "facts" of the story are revealed in the title and "known" to many. But this film deals with the interior emotional landscape of the main characters rather than a straight forward plot driven set of scenes that we might expect. For some that will made it tedious to watch, but I found that I couldn't tear myself away from watching it - perhaps a bit like watching a car crash in slow motion - you know what's coming but have to watch anyway.I also found the narration to be a peculiar, but effective addition. The narrator has to represent the author of the original book that the film's based on, because more than once he describes things that no character in the film would know. And yet this too helps set the scene in a manner counter to the usual, and I like that.An enjoyable watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From envy, admiration and worse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not the classic western. If anybody had ever asked what were the motives that led to Robert Ford to commit the murder of Jesse James, this movie is the answer. This isn't the story of a murder is the story of an introverted, fearful, nervous, somewhat gay, silent and little smart man that admired another man who was quite the opposite and that once this admiration wasn't reciprocated, like Robert Ford had wanted, then came hatred, revenge, resentment because he wasn't, not like Jesse James, but Jesse James itself.This film is an analysis of how admiration for a person becomes an obsession to be what we are not (this story reminded me somewhat of The Talented Mr. Ripley) Does Robert Ford wants to be as Jesse James? The answer is no, basically story shows us that Ford was looking for what Jesse represented, an admiration by the people, an applause, but what he found was exactly the opposite by not realize that the only real applause isn't from cowardice, or vile acts, but it is to exploit what we are, what makes us be us.This story whose message transcends beyond an historic landmark is also gratifying for any person who likes movie due to its technical details are extremely impressive, it is necessary to highlight the photo, that undoubtedly, they choose a number of perfectly frames that get making plastic each scene, at times actually seems we are seeing a painting by the way in which natural light becomes an essential element. Just include the value that music gives the scenes since served as a catalyst for emotions to give a touch more melancholic to some moments.Perhaps the only things that could bring as defects are the abuse of the blur effect in the lens only to highlight what is at the center of the image, and the rhythm a bit slow but justified wonderfully with the editing and photography. In short this is a really beautiful film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The death of the John Wayne Western: The assassination of Jesse James by the coward Robert Ford It's been a long time since a great western movie came out. 1992's Unforgiven was Clint Eastwood' last ride in the genre and later in 1995 the exciting The Quick and the Dead. The assassination of Jesse James by the coward Robert Ford is a new type of western; it is a non-fiction story beautifully told and well acted by its entire cast of characters. The plot revolves around Jesse James last months. The film begins with Robert Ford trying to join Jesse James's gang. He is accepted and they proceed to rob a train in Blue cut, the year was 1881. The events that follow are grim, dirty and nonetheless captivating. The cinematography is hauntingly beautiful, every scene is carefully set and light turning the landscapes into characters themselves. The cinematography is most notable when Jesse James and his gang are robbing a train in Blur Cut, on September 5th, 1881. Shot in near darkness, the camera gently sweeps across a man's silhouette, as it slowly disappears under smoke from the train. Roger Deakins's cinematography is truly spectacular and rightly deserves its Oscar nomination. The pacing is slow and slightly uneven. You will not find many action scenes, and the few that are in the movie, serve only to further the story.The film has a runtime of roughly two hours and forty minutes. It is shot realistically without the overuse of editing; the viewer sees the action as though he or she were there. The narration takes time to get accustomed to but adds clarity to key scenes in the film. The movie itself plays out like that of a discovery channel re-enactment, which is not to say is bad, it simply makes it unique in terms editing and pacing. Brad Pitt showers the screen with emotional restraint and a characterization that overpowers all his previous performances. His portrayal of Jesse James is sly and captures a lost soul. Jesse James is portrayed as an intelligent man that could be kind yet evil, trusting one moment and menacing the next. Casey Affleck is the coward Robert Ford. His soft-spoken portrayal seeks and succeeds in showing a man who truly glorifies Jesse James. In a scene near the end of the movie, he tries on Jesse James's hat, sleeps in his bed and tries to emulate his stance and manner. The movie is long, uneventful, yet wholly captivating. The film is recommended for those who like photography, character studies and period pieces. It is a very good movie, but not great and will probably be disliked by action fans and those that like a lot of explosions in their movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If nothing else, this film should have won an Oscar for longest title of 2007. The Asassination of Jesse James... is the story of the final days in the life of the legendary outlaw, and the mousy young man who ends his life. This film has many strengths, but it just meanders a bit too much to really move its intended audience. More than anything, you'll remember the beautiful cinematography by Roger Deakins. He was nominated for an Oscar for his work on No Country For Old Men, and his work here may have been even better.The film begins with Jesse James (Brad Pitt) and his brother Frank (Sam Shepard) staging one last big train robbery. By this point in their careers, they are the last of their original gang still together. The rest of the guys they use for the job are a motley crew of low-lifes from the backwoods of their native Missouri. One of these fellows, who literally just walks into their camp and tries to suck up to everyone, is a young man named Robert Ford. Casey Affleck plays this young man who seems to have read and memorized about everything ever written about Jesse James and considers him a hero. Nobody seems to even want to talk to the lad except Jesse James himself. Maybe he's just being polite as a famous athlete would to a young autograph seeker. But when the robbery goes down, Ford is right there with the gang, and the robbery is a success. After the job, the gang splits up except for Ford who Jesse inexplicably allows to stay with him for a brief spell. After a while he is finally sent packing, but by this point their destinies are intertwined, and anyone who reads the movie's full title will certainly know what happens in the end.There are some great things about this film to be sure. The acting is outstanding. Casey Affleck earned his Oscar nomination. He is exceptional as the skittish young man Robert Ford who dreams of fame, but understands that the most sure fire way to get it is to kill his hero. Brad Pitt is.... well, he isn't bad as Jesse James. Maybe its a sign that his acting is finally getting better if I can't tell you he was terrible like he usually is. Sam Shephard was miscast, but it still would have been better if he'd been in the film past the first half hour. His Frank James character splits for the east coast after the initial robbery. Sam Rockwell, as Robert Ford's brother, is pretty good, as well. Pacing is a problem for this film, and almost sinks it. The first 45 minutes or so are outstanding. Then, the film just seems to evaporate for a while and nothing of note happens. The final 45 minutes or so are also outstanding as the film redeems itself with a very insightful ending. We see that Robert Ford becomes more "infamous" rather than famous after shooting Jesse James in the back of the head. Luckily, the great look of the film helps pass the time during the dead spots.It almost seems like the art of cinematography is being reborn in Hollywood. For too long now, people have been letting CGI do all the work, and not catching the magic of the outdoors on real film as well. Remember back to the 1970s when nearly every film looked this good. The days of Laszlo Kovacs, Vilmos Zsigmond, and Nestor Almendros were wonderful. It looks like people are starting to care what their films look like once again. This film cost roughly 30 million dollars to make. It barely made a tenth of that in theaters. It's hard to say who they thought their audience was going to be for this film. Most western fans demand more action, hence the huge payday for 3:10 to Yuma last fall. The Asassination of Jesse James is nothing like that, and many casual viewers may not even get through it. I'd recommend it, but it is not quite a great film. 7 of 10 stars.The Hound.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm confused. This movie caught me off-guard. Because of its:- MUSIC -- absolutely haunting masterpiece - CINEMATOGRAPHY -- so beautiful, it hurts - CASEY AFFLECK'S PERFORMANCE -- if THAT acting doesn't win an Oscar .... Hollywood is DEAD; it's amazing to put it mildly..so layered, so convincing...it's really shockingly good; - THE SCENE WITH THE ACTUAL ASSASSINATION - it's easily one of THE BEST film scenes ever made -- just watch it again, from the part where Jesse gives Bob Ford the pistol as a gift, till the BANG and Jesse's head hitting the picture with the horse on the wall! Yes, it's overloaded with symbolism, and, yet it's a sequence that hits you like a hammer...--- and then, the downside: - The movie is too long - It's a book adaptation and, boy, it SHOWS (in a negative way) - the Jesse character isn't even half sympathetic, real, and full-blooded, as opposed to Bob's - therefore the viewer doesn't connect with him - there are some boring parts - there's something more that prevents this film from being a cinematic gem ... I only can sense it, not describe it ... just something's wrong with it. Otherwise, it was meant to be (and COULD have been)one of all-time's best. But it's not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very fine movie from Andrew Dominik, who directed it and also adapted the screenplay from a novel by Ron Hansen. The train robbery sequence is built up in a very unexcited way and executed very well. After that the film concentrates on James' gang and how fast trust can knock over in distrust. Men get killed, friendship is not possible ? there is just too much past in between them. Woman and children have to do the hard work, while their men are carrying out duels. And they also have to deal with it, when from one second to the other they lose their husbands or fathers. Also the end was very good, it added the right tone to a visually rich and thoroughly told story. The film is dominated by the performances of Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck. While Pitt is really great as Jesse James, in comparison to Casey Affleck he has to pale. Affleck perfectly portrays this seemingly weak character with his conflicting behaviour.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply OK, not great. I wouldn't re-watch it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, the cinematography is beautiful. Although the camera 'view through glass' shot is used a bit too often as to render the effect redundant. There are lots of sepia tones and sickly greys. The set design is very nice. This isn't a prettied up old west and the people and places often look run-down and in need of some t.l.c. The dialog is quite often, very poetic. I'm not sure if some of it is lifted straight from the novel?J.J - "No. I haven't been acting correctly. I can't hardly recognize myself sometimes when I'm greased. I go on journeys out of my body and look at my red hands and my mean face and I wonder about that man who's gone so wrong. I've been becoming a problem to myself."The acting is good but not especially great. Affleck does a good job of the tremulous voiced, duplicitous boot-lick Robert Ford character. A man who craves some kind of celebrity even though there's is nothing particularly special about him; he has no special talents per se, aside from collecting trivia about Jesse James and trying to convince himself and others that he is cut from the same cloth as a man like J.J. Pitt is OK, but his J.J is laconic to say the least. Often, scenes that are meant to hint at the darkness and turmoil lurking beneath his calm and composed exterior simply come off as being a little... baffling (the snakes and the fish in the ice scene. Some kind of animal symbolism intended there? I'm not sure). Even when he goes all giddy and get's excited at the prospect of imminent violence, I felt that it was the same kind of acting I'd seen Pitt do a better job of elsewhere. Lastly, the various plot threads concerning the ex-members of the James gang, and J.J's various beefs with each of them, are hard to keep track of. Suffice to say, the intention is to illustrate how J.J has just gone off the deep end at the end of his 'career' and doesn't seem to trust anyone anymore. In that sense, perhaps the adaptation is a little too greedy with how much it tries to pack into the film. Less probably would've been more. The narration is at times intrusive and, especially at the end, tends to subtract from the overall experience of being immersed in the films world. Like an unwanted tap on the shoulder from a friend who's already seen the film and is trying to make sure that you're in the loop, it's more distracting than anything. The music - Nick Cave and Warren Ellis. I loved the score they did for The Proposition but, at around 150mins, it feels like they have underwritten for the film or maybe just written the score in a hurry. We get 2 or 3 themes played repeatedly over and over and this has the unfortunate effect of making the film seem longer than it is by virtue of there being the same pieces of music used for multiple scenes. Cave has a cameo at the very end, playing a song on an acoustic guitar in a pub. Overall, it doesn't even come close to being a great modern Western. Just my opinion. I could re-watch 'Unforgiven' and 'Tombstone' many times over, but 'The Assassinatination of Jesse James' is, ultimately, a once was enough for me film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Counterculture James</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Assassination tells us is not easy to go against the system, and the counterculture at the time was Jesse James.The film achieved outstanding cinematography inside the last 10 years of cinema. Simply astonishing work from veteran Roger Deakins (Cohen bros. top man! See The Man Who Wasn't There) who overcame himself here.The theme is also in vogue for some time, assassins, outlaws, and anyone else who fits the counterculture-against-the-system profile, is being reviewed by history or public opinion in a way with the helping hand of media. Well, not just media. I tell you why. In the film when they say people missed men like Jesse James, it is a reflection or comparison with all the crimes and the level of psychopaths out there nowadays, and it feels like men of the James Gang were not bad guys at all, even if considering time and place of facts. The complete detachment of responsibilities from society's leaders towards general public today, such as politicians, police, lawyers, doctors, corporative CEO's and so forth, shows the importance of these formerly labeled "outlaws". Mainly what they were trying to do was to go against The Man and today the bad guys can only target middle class people who are caught in between the shootouts of our life routine.People of middle class are being thrown into the lions' dungeon like never before. I never saw as many betrayals and backstabbing even in movies like I've been seeing recently. And I'm not just talking about movies or art in general. It's coming to get us inside our homes! It feels like you can't turn your back anymore, even to a close relative!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Beautifully-Shot Movie!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just got done watching it - "The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford." whew... the main reason i went out and rented it was simply because i had seen clips and heard that the cinematography was absolutely stunning. it IS!i'm sorry, but the real star of this film is roger deakins, who also directed the photography of the "equally-beautiful-but-not-obviously-so" no country for old men. i think he is one of - if not the best cinematographer Hollywood has today! i am absolutely stunned at what an amazing eye he has! the scene that stole the whole movie for me though was the infamous 'train robbery' scene - where the ghostly white light of the train penetrates the darkness of the forest - revealing the masked robbers. the warm yellow smoke and lighting turns the scene into the most stunningly shot scene in the past 10 years. hands down. i am torn between this and 'there will be blood' - the Oscar winner... very tough...i also am AMAZED at how much talent the affleck family bestowed on Casey. his performance as Robert ford was so complete and breath-taking - i'm sure he would have won the Oscar had Javier bardem not taken his amazing role in 'no country for old men.' and brad Pitt - a star i hadn't thought too highly about until 'babel' is incredible as Jesse James. i am a bit surprised that he was absent from so many best actor lists... oh well - one day soon...AND THE MUSIC! technically this film is nearly perfect. i thought this was one of the most effective, moving, and beautiful scores of the year - in fact i think it could only be topped by the brilliant 'atonement' score. this should have DEFINITELY been nominated for best original score - i mean seriously - the 'michael Clayton' score is just a bunch of sounds - not music! wtf! if you're gonna honor James newton Howard at least nominate him for some GOOD music (hmmm - 'i am legend?') anyway - i am in the process of buying the main theme from the movie off of itunes. check it out! overall, i think the pace was just a HAIR too long, but not that much. the plot was a bit muddled and i found it hard to follow at times... i don't know about other people, but for some reason i had trouble remembering the names of characters aside from Jesse, bob, and his brother... that kinda messed me up a bit... i did watch it later in the night...so basically - i would definitely recommend this movie - if for nothing else that the shockingly beautiful cinematography and beautiful, lullaby-ish soundtrack. enjoy!*******/********** (7/10 stars)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film but the coward that couldn't edit jesse james properly.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are ready to watch a beautifully shot film with a narration like some cheap almost dull like yawning soap commercial, that is very well acted, but i have to agree with many - that the film loses its potential because the editing and pace is so disgustingly slow - my mother walked out after almost falling asleep in the first looooong half. This movie was interesting but is no Ben Hur that deserves feeling like it needs an intermission. It is sad when an editor or perhaps the director forgets that were not looking for a history channel piece but also to feel entertained enough to not yawn esp with this wonderful musical piece.. but big thumbs up for all the actors, dp and indeed brad pitt, afleck and sam did a superb job - but how sad that it lost its true shine by going too long. the coward that couldn't edit jesse james properly. ;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great but no Peckinpah</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Long, sonorous and portentous film about the last days of the outlaw, and the man who killed him. A beautiful and immaculately crafted piece of film-making, it nevertheless seemed to me to be less than the sum of its parts. It doesn't have the withering analysis of the corporate world which was being moved into place with the death of the West which makes Peckinpah's similarly themed films so interesting. We are left with a really rather ahistorical study of a young man who becomes disillusioned with the celebrity criminal he hero-worships. Jesse is a charismatic psychopath but the film sidesteps his virulent confederate racism. The acting is certainly committed and compelling, although a trifle self-regarding; at times, it seems like the film is a gambit from Brad Pitt to sell himself to consumers as a "movie great". Afflect's studied edgy twitchiness is potentially an irritating affectation, although it seemed to me an accomplished achievement by the end of the film.It's a film with some great scenes and with real emotional impact. I just wish it had a little more historical or political substance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a FANTASTIC film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is fantastic, quite simply the best film I have seen for a while. The acting, directing, cinematography, music are all superb - Pitt, Affleck, Rockwell, the whole cast are submerged in their characters. It works on many different levels. Chopper is a good film, however I feel this work has far far surpassed that. Where some people may have criticised the film for being too long, or starting and stopping, I see this as its true beauty - ebbing and flowing, taking us on a tragic yet beautiful trip, with a truly haunting (spine tingling) soundtrack by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis evoking the building of tension, paranoia and sense of wanting. At its core I feel this film delving directly into the human psyche that has a need to be recognised as somebody and something. This may be the need to be infamous for the outlaws, yet it satisfies their need, or more appropriately it temporarily satisfies their need. This is a film that burns imagery and feelings into your mind, and that, makes me want to see it again. People who under rate this movie in my opinion don't have an opinion worth counting. Each scene is cut to perfection, with sublime cinematography, music and dialogue that represents film in its true creative art form. The scene I love is the build up to the train robbery, not far into the film, which for me begins the trail of inflections.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning in every way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film provides a cinematic experience that left me thinking I had just seen one of the greatest films ever made. It was a treat in every way from the superb acting (from Affleck and Pitt as well as the excellent Paul Schneider as Dick Liddle) to the haunting Nick Cave score, from the beautiful scenery to the thoughtful direction. Two particular things to praise - firstly I was concerned that the last half hour after James' death might be unnecessary but I left thinking that it was possibly the best part of the film and indeed served to accentuate that this film really is far more about the tragic character of Robert Ford than it is about Jesse James. Secondly as somebody that is very interested in American history I thought that the film did an impressive job of creating an atmosphere that felt genuinely authentic. The towns, the people, the music, the imagery - everything seemed to perfectly reflect the change, excitement and brutality of the post-Civil War era.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Haunting and beautifully filmed study of hero worship and the reality behind a legend!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Andrew Dominik's THE ASSASSINATION OF JESSE JAMES BY THE COWARD ROBERT FORD, stands out as one of the best films of this year and one of the most interesting modern westerns to come out in recent years, and one that will certainly be ranked among other classic westerns in the future. Despite using the wild west setting the film is more of a study of the perils of hero worship and the reality of the myth or the truth behind the legend of Jesse James. It focuses on the final few years of Jesse James's life and his relationship with Robert Ford one of the members of his gang of outlaws, who worships the ground Jesse walks on. Yet Jesse's unhinged and erratic behaviour eventually disappoint and confound Ford's image and admiration for the man, eventually leading to resentment and fear of his own life, and to the assassination of the 'outlaw hero' at the hands of Ford. Dominik has crafted a true genuine American classic here that sets out to examine the western legend, who has been romanticised in so many novels and Hollywood films, to the point of being a Robin Hood sort of character, robbing from the rich and giving to the poor. Yet it's far from the truth, the Jesse James we see here is becoming fearful of everyone around him, increasingly erratic and disturbed and also protective of his outlaw image that he revels in. Pitt is excellent in his role (an best actor nomination surely should be on the table for him), he displays Jesse with many nuances, both funny and interesting though also disturbing and dangerous at the same time. Every time he appears on screen you are unsure of what he is about to do, and Pitt perfectly portrays this charismatic yet disturbed individual. As Robert Ford, Casey Afflek, is excellent perfectly contemplating James' menacing yet alluring charm, with Ford's wide eyed innocence and idol worshipping enthusiasm that soon turns to resentment and fear. On top of the performances the cinematography is beautiful, perfectly done by Roger Deakins (regular cinematographer for the Coen Brothers) that captures the desolate and snowy wastelands and landscape of the American mid-west. If anything the film captures the idea and myths behind the celebrity, James is in love with his image, that masks his insecurity's and Ford, who is more or less a celebrity stalker, worships his hero, yet when meeting him in the flesh soon realises the cold hard truth behind the image of the hero outlaw. Unmissable cinema at its finest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a like-or-dislike movie. If you like a deep movie that really penetrates into the feelings of the character you will love it. But, if you are looking for a typical western bang-bang movie, you are in the wrong movie theater.It basically shows the relationship between a sort of Robin Hood, Jesse James, lived by Brad Pitt in a very good performance, and a teenager obsessed about him, Robert Ford, lived by Casey Affleck in a performance of a lifetime. As the title says, it will turn out in Jesse James' assassination by Robert Ford.Although I dislike westerns, this one was, I believe, very-well directed and with an unbelievable score. This movie would not have worked with a poor acting. And, luckily, the acting of all members was rather surprising.Afterall, this movie is aimed for the Oscar, it is not meant to be a blockbuster, and I think it will have quite a number of nominations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Society's Mirror - Why this film must be seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has had what can only be called a tortured genesis. Having been in the pipeline for some time it disappeared shortly before its original release date of autumn last year. Rumours of production problems were rife and expectations fell very low. Now it has arrived, only a year late, and, in what has been a year of many good films but few standouts, this film has rode in to save the day. It is, quite simply, awesome.Andrew Dominik conjures three exquisitely detailed, well rendered and poignant portraits in this film: Jesse James, Robert Ford and a society that must be seen as not so different from our own. Brad Pitt is astonishing as James, portraying the paranoid madness of a man trapped in his own myth whose fascination with and fear of death haunts his every move. However, Pitt is matched by the brilliance of Casey Affleck's performance. Robert Ford is shown as a man obsessed with the myth of Jesse James who, through disappointment, rejection and desire, turns against the epicentre of his dreams. It is this fascinating portrayal that lies at the centre of this film.However, Dominik places this engrossing character drama against a bewildering social background. The two live in a society that has a government that allows murder when it sees fit and punishes it when it doesn't and a public that celebrates a mass-murderer and despises an assassin who shows no remorse. To delve any further in this would give away the ending which, surprisingly enough, is not the one in the title, but the questions that arise from this film are ones about society and its moral nature and the power of obsession on a personal and a mass level.If this sounds dull to you then you're in for a surprise. The film, whilst slow-paced and long, is never boring and grips you from start to finish. Much of the reason for this has already been discussed but credit must also go to the brilliant ensemble. Sam Rockwell is the standout supporting player and his performance is a career best. Then there is Roger Deakins' cinematography which is fantastic and Nick Cave and Warren Ellis' music which is extremely well used. But, ultimately, the showpieces here are the central performances, an interesting and stylish director and a pitch perfect script. This is certainly the most accomplished film I've seen for a long time. It doesn't invite comparison (though it deserves it) with Leone's "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly", but the assassination scene is not only reminiscent of Leone's final shootout scene but is every bit as good.It may be seen as arduous by some but at some point, at home or (preferably) at the cinema, you must see this film for so many reasons ? the technical brilliance, the incredible performances, the experience and, above all, the questions it raises that are some of the most important of recent years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great film, exploring the minds of Jesse and the brothers Ford.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Throughout the years cinema has changed the way it tells a story. Whereas in the past most films would try to show as much as possible nowadays generally the rhythm is slower. Comparing the films made about Jesse James we can verify that. This film is slow moving, but it is a slowness you want to last, because you cherish every second. Casey Affleck, Brad Pitt, Sam Rockwell, are incredibly real in their characters. The film makes you feel you are there, inside it. Even the sound made by the guns when they shoot is a sound of fatality, slow and tragic. Fear is the main cause of the violent reactions sometimes the fear you show means more than any words like in the case of Ed Miller (Garret Dillahunt). The climax of the film is the revelation by Robert Ford of the motives that made him kill Jesse and we can see in this revelation the universal drama of those that fail when making the most important decisions of their lives. I thought I had seen my share of all the great westerns that were made, but fortunately this one came. GREAT FILM GREAT WESTERN.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the worst movies ever. Vulgar profanities and stuff thrown in without any historical facts regarding Jesse James. About the most unexciting movie I have ever seen. Pathetic. The acting is awful. Scenes showing Jesse just sitting around mostly smoking a cigar and staring at Bob Ford. Other scenes show Jesse back shooting his supposed enemies. No record of that being fact. After all Jesse was a seasoned gunman, who didn't need to shot punks in the back. Some facts are correct, others are totally false. Like most historical movies, throw in just enough facts and the rest is conjecture on the directors part, just like in the latest movie "Tombstone". Some movies are more historically correct than others, you have to do your research to know if any of that stuff is correct/ I was totally bored and I am a history buff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Disappointing -- Needs a serious edit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very disappointed with this film. The pacing is slow, very slow. The narration is ponderous and should have been unnecessary, or at least greatly reduced. The film is long. There is nothing shown about Jessie James that explains why the American populace treated him as a hero. There is nothing in the film to support the narrator's suggestion that he gave money to the poor, or cared about anyone outside of his immediate family. Did I mention the film is long?The cinematography is ... wide open spaces ... lots of shots of tall dry grass ... and a way overused "technique" -- a focused circle surrounded by out of focus. The focus effect made no sense whatsoever. Was it supposed to be how Jessie saw the world? How Ford did? The music only added to the slowness. Way too many sad slow violins and other strings. The music is lifeless and so is the film. Perhaps that was the point, if so it still could have been made in less time. Hey have you heard how long, and slow, and morose this film is?I kept expecting it to pick up, or for there to be some twist, something beyond what is told in the title. There was not. It was like a bad documentary, only even a bad documentary would have been edited so that it moved faster. It should have run 40 minutes shorter. At least.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pitt the Major Flaw in This Otherwise Strange and Beautiful Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2007 is shaping up to be the year of the Western revival.There's not much need of a plot summary for "The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," because it's all right there in the title. And there's not much plot to summarize anyway. This is a movie more interested in character than plot and more interested really in aesthetics than character, and it's a strangely fascinating film. It's certainly one of the most beautiful films I've seen in a long time.The young actor Casey Affleck is a revelation as James's assassin. His Robert Ford is awkward and stammering, whose appearance and behavior leads people to believe he's dumber than he is. His idolatry of Jesse James is fueled by the dime novels he collects and in which James so frequently appears. The character as written is somewhat obtuse; I'm not sure I completely ever understood what makes Ford turn on James, or when the change in his feeling occurs. But Affleck does wonders with what he's given to work with and gives one of the best performances I've seen thus far in the year. Unfortunately, at the film's center is Brad Pitt, and he creates a vacuum which the film succeeds in spite of rather than being dragged down by. Pitt is simply not a good actor, but his good looks and sheen of Hollywood glamour will assure that film makers keep giving him starring roles. I kept thinking about Russell Crowe's marvelous performance as an outlaw in "3:10 to Yuma" and couldn't help but wonder how much better this film would have been if Crowe had been cast instead. Pitt doesn't sink the film, because the cast he's surrounded by does such good work (in addition to Affleck, Sam Rockwell is a stand out as Robert Ford's older brother), but he prevents it from being even better than it otherwise could be.Some may be turned off by the film's formality; virtually every shot looks like a carefully composed photograph. But I thought the film's tone and visual style matched the subject. After all, we're talking about a legendary figure here, someone who's as much myth as man, so why not give the movie the imprint of myth as well? "Jesse James" isn't much interested in ideas, though I think it wants to be. Only in the movie's final moments, after Ford has assassinated James and then suffers the harassment of a public that decides to idolize James in his death and deride Ford as a coward, does the film toy with the question of what distinguishes a hero from a villain. It doesn't come to any conclusions, and because of Pitt's inadequate performance, it never explains why James was able to make himself into a legend while Ford died a figure of infamy. But I was willing to let the film's sheer physical beauty and fine supporting cast sweep me along with them and cause me to not care too much about anything else.Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of all this puzzling mess's fatal flaws, the one I find most perturbing is what was Andrew Dominik attempting to do with the repetitive panoramas of flying time-lapsed skies? Was it counterpoint to the mindlessly glacial pace of the script or simply a reminder that every other scene was going to be more of the same? More of Casey Affleck's whiny petulance? More of Brad Pitt's gratuitous scenery chewing? More marginal characters whose presence is never wholly explained or understood because they are all swallowing their lines in a desperate attempt to sound more authentic? It is a shame that a lot of the truly meticulous production values were wasted on a self-important story that could have been told far more effectively and succinctly. As many negative writers have already said, I want that 2:40 of my life back, and I wanted Bob Ford to shoot Jesse after about 30 minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At 160 minutes this glacially-paced film is at least 35 minutes too long. It's THE talkiest period western since "Ride the High Country" in the 1950s. WAAAY too much character development and not nearly enough gunplay. However, it has good period shootin' irons and leather, and sets the stage in Missourah. Not up to the standard of "Ride w/the Devil" but OK. Not enough Pounding Hooves, either, and hardly any Sweeping Vistas.Several reviews laud the cinematography. I admit: I do not get it. The camera work is OK, but much of the story occurs in the bleary drearidom of winter.Writing: the prologue is first rate. Some of the subsequent narration is pretty good.Casting: good to excellent, especially the 2nd tier players who really do look/act low IQ, Ferrell types. As we might expect, James carville is perfect as a sleazy politician (!) and I've not seen Michael Parks since "Then Came Bronson." Bottom line: if you see one western this year, miss this and catch the 3:10 to Yuma!</fullReview>

I obviously knew the ending - and if I didn't maybe I would've given it 2.5. The character portrayals almost to a tee were annoying, full of some sense of their own importance, and the impending sense of doom and foreboding. Nothing ever happened though there was this sense that something was going to happen to make it in some way interesting. I just didn't care by the end. Positives - some well constructed scenes like on the train, cinematography was great, period well presented. But the acting and pace, ick. A waste of my evening.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If Jesse James was really so void of personality and depth as Brad Pitt portrays him to be, then there should never have been a movie about him. There are attempts to give the guy some soul, but it doesn't work. I don't know why, maybe Pitt simply can't help being himself, and brings to the screen a very confused man who tries to be cool, cocky and depressed at the same time, but you feel it doesn't make for natural viewing at all. Even the way he speaks is very unnatural. He finds it very hard to play anything but himself.The only redeeming feature, and the only engaging character in this film is Robert Ford, played by a magnificent Casey Affleck. He's the only guy one can connect with, even though he's a misguided, delusional youth.That's where the compliments end. Because the film sets out as a deep character study of people without character, and cares not a iota about thrilling or entertaining with plots, it turns out to be one loooong failure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK film... but why did i need to see it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be honest, this film left me wondering. I mean, everything in it was good; the acting of Pitt and especially that of Affleck was faultless. The cinematography was inspiring, and considering the setting and the story, the writing maintained a sustainable pace. It was all good... but the big question it left me asking, is why did i need to be told this story?The one area in which i think the story fell down, is the part where it is supposed to tell me why this historical story is of any significance to history? Is it? Because in the end, the entire story is just about a junior criminal killing a senior criminal... I'll admit, this comment may sound a little naive maybe, (I don't know if Jesse James is some kind of people's hero in American culture or what), but the film failed to explain it to foreign (i.e. non-American) audiences. Why does it matter that Jesse James is killed, i just didn't get why everybody was making such a fuss and ostracising his killer. I mean, yeah the way he did it was cowardly, but its certainly not the only time a cowardly murder has occurred, so why is this one special? Whilst this may sound like a minor issue, when you spend 2 hours and 40 odd minutes watching a film, you want to know why you invested your time in such a venture...For future viewers, don't let this point prevent you seeing what is otherwise a brilliant, near-perfect movie, but my suggestion would be that if you are unfamiliar with Jesse James, maybe do a little bit of research regarding why he is infamous, because you will only be left guessing here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that so many people on this web site absolutely love.I have read many of the reviews posted about this movie and find myself in disagreement with most of them.It isn't all bad but I will try and explain just why I can only give this film a five out of ten score.Firstly,I will admit that the cinematography here is fabulous.A really great job was done on the look of this movie.Also,the acting is pretty good throughout although I think that the praise that Casey Affleck(Robert Ford) has garnered has been overplayed.He is good but not brilliant.In his early appearances in the movie he tries too hard to be the naive and slightly odd youngster and his voice is grating.You can just tell he is acting.He is much better later on as he becomes a more cynical character.But it must be said that there are other actors here that are just as impressive especially Garret Dillahunt(Ed Miller) and Sam Rockwell(Charley Ford).Also impressive is Sam Shephard(Frank James),who is very much underused.Brad Pitt is fine as Jesse James.Not an award winning performance but he is OK.Now I come to the two biggest problems.The film is way too long and also way too slow.There are just too many times when the pace drags almost to a stop and there doesn't appear to be anything going on at all.I have no problem at all with films almost three hours in length if they hold the attention.'Godfather 1 &amp; 2','The Good,The Bad &amp; The Ugly' and 'Once Upon A Time In The West' are all wonderful movies simply because the stories are so compelling.They are involving and the pace moves towards a gripping conclusion.With 'The Assassination Of Jesse James' the pace flags too often and by half way I was losing patience and interest.I have read reviews where people have compared this to the films of Sergio Leone.Don't make me laugh!It comes nowhere near to the tension,the sheer drama his westerns can muster.Many people will think my review is a load of rubbish but I stick by it as this is a ponderous movie.Great to look at maybe but a journey that will most definitely make you saddle sore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>excellent film and accurate as a documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Assassination of Jesse James is not only an excellent entertaining film but it is one of the best documentaries I have ever seen.The use of music and narration are superlative in this film. The film achieves a very difficult scenario of documentary and entertainment.Brad Pitt puts in one of his best roles demonstrating the massive mood swings of Jesse James.The film has difficulty in transitioning in the scene where Jesse takes his guns off to dust off the picture of his horse. This scene needed extra work to achieve the smooth move of the film...the scene in the film is awkward.The film does not directly address the brutal killing Jesse James did during his career. The film indirectly mentions several of the victims of his attacks but leaves the viewer with less than a true picture of the James' gang.</fullReview>

I want my 2 hours back. If you have a chance to watch this particular flick...... PASS, punching yourself in the balls would be more entertaining. Yes they stuck to the story of how Jesse James was "murdered". They completely skipped over the largest part of the action involving Jesse James life, instead that creepy narrator steps in and describes the action. There is only roughly 10 minutes of this movie actually worth watching (if that. I would have to bust out a stop watch and re-watch it, which I am not going to do). It's almost like they were trying to teach me a frigging history lesson, I honestly felt like I was back in class.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Long And Too Muddled, But Great Characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE ASSASSINATION OF JESSE JAMES BY THE COWARD ROBERT FORD is a perplexing film in scope, subject, and style.The first thing that hits most people is the title. I mean, how long does a film's title have to be? Although I understand WHY they settled on it, I still feel that alternatives must've been out there.The next is the length of the movie itself. At over 2 hours and 40 minutes, it's a behemoth in terms of size. I understand, too, that the original uncut version was a bit over 4 hours. Four hours! Thank goodness they cut it down. But I feel more cuts were needed and a better direction taken with the movie as a whole.The biggest issue I have is that the entire production seemed to have difficulties deciding on who the main character was. Was it Robert Ford (Casey Affleck, GONE BABY GONE)? Or was it Jesse James (Brad Pitt, BABEL)? You can, on occasion, have multiple main characters, but with this film the muddling of who was doing what to who and why got seriously confusing. I attributed this to the fact that half the time we were focused on Jesse and the other half on Robert. The problems this caused was a lack of consistent story flow and a lengthy film that could've easily held more interest if it would've focused on either one character or the other. Personally, I would've liked to have seen the film start near Jesse James' assassination and then lead us off on the life of Robert Ford afterward. But that portion of Ford's life is quickly skimmed over and we never get the true feeling for what he went through after being labeled "the coward who shot Jesse James in the back." I also have to comment on the repetitive use of time-lapse photography during scenes meant to show the passage of time. The constant showing of clouds skidding rapidly across the sky got a bit tiring; time after time after time after time.Regardless of title and movie length, and the lack of a consistent character, the acting was pretty much perfect. Brad Pitt played the confused, dangerous, paranoid, and nearly psychotic Jesse James exceptionally well. And Casey Affleck as the disenchanted Jesse James fan-boy came across as creepy and not-just-a-bit pathetic.Although this film received plenty of praise (including two Oscar nominations), I found it to be slow and the first hour confusing with regards to understanding which character was doing what and why.But the acting saved it for me. Although I wouldn't necessarily recommend this flick for those who are ready to head off to bed (as this might put them to sleep before bedtime), I would suggest it as a good character study of the times surrounding the life of Jesse James and the poor sap who shot him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a film that is beautiful and full of spectacle in both appearance and substance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only thing about this modern retelling of Jesse James's assassination by Bob Ford that seems out of place is the title, "The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford" which is a tad bit verbose for a film title. Nonetheless, beneath the title's usage of too many words is a film that I found myself simply amazed by. This is one of the best Westerns to come out of recent times. Some critics have called it the best since "Unforgiven". It tells a story that has been told on screen many, many times before, but never so beautifully as this.The film stars Brad Pitt as the unstable bank robber and killer Jesse James, in which he gives yet another golden performance that is certainly noteworthy in this film. Casey Affleck is the other title character, Robert Ford, the man who first idolized Jesse James, joined his gang, befriended him, and later felt he had no choice but to kill the famous outlaw. Both of these actors gave spectacular and authentistic performances, especially the first of the two. Affleck got the Oscar nomination and I felt he deserved it, but I was even more fond of Brad Pitt's portrayal of Jesse James. The two real-life characters, portrayed by the actors, are bound by a screenplay that is very realistic, intense, well-written, and full of substance that shows development of the characters as human beings rather than just historical figures.The film's style is very appealing, especially with the fantastic Oscar-nominated cinematography job by Roger Deakins. The sets are very convincing, the gunshot sound effects sound good, and produce a fairly realistic effect on the characters being shot. Gunshots in this film can literally make you jump in your seat even when you're expecting it. Just as a real black-powder weapon would do, the shots are booming loud. Hits look like real hits rather than just squibs with fake blood exploding under the actors' clothing. I did feel the many usages of sped-up shots of the clouds rolling by was inapposite or maybe a bit clich, but that was no big deal. The film still works. And the great score by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis added to the overall feeling of the movie.In short, "The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford" is a film that I highly recommend for both fans of the Western genre and fans of movies that are simply well-made. It is beautiful in appearance and even beautiful in its substance, which is rare to find in movies these days. But this just shows that the era of symbolic films has not come to an end and despite "The Assassination of Jesse James"'s poor box office results, it was a critical success and in my opinion, was worthy of more audience members than those who attended it.</fullReview>

A lot of the people walked out of the movie at the end saying they didn't like it especially because it was so long and drawn out but we enjoyed it because of an appreciation for the old west and the outlaws from that time. Brad Pitt did a very good job but if you are going to this movie because you like Brad Pitt you might not like it but if you go to see Jesse James because you are interested in him, you will like it.

Thus it uses the usual stylistic devices, rearranging them in a lyrical manner.But the film has several deficits. It often stays flat and the short narrators parenthesis back up what they shouldn't: unreflectedness. Regarding the length of the film it narrows the pleasure and brakes the proceed too much. Nethertheless it fulfills its purpose by giving additional info's and insight views. - Not a difficulty but a lag of the movie is that despite actors doing a solid job they could have been used much better.Overall it's a good movie. Because of its lenght and its further not mentionable but many little lags, it is unfortunately not worth seeing it twice. But if you like the story of Jesse James and authentic re-editions, you should see it.</fullReview>

About Casey Affleck, man he's going to become a legend if he keeps his performing this way. It's already known that Javier Bardem with "No Country For Old Men" won the Oscar but am still "annoyed" how it didn't go for Casey, but that's another story.As for the sound track, its just gorgeous, it makes every scene of the movie worth it, this soundtrack will draw anyone in and make every frame enjoy-able.Very nice movie, for anyone who likes western kind of movie, and Casey fantastic performance, will just leave you speech-less.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clearly, I am in something of a minority, but I just didn't get into this meandering and somewhat pretentious would be epic. Brad Pitt is fine, of course, but because he underplays his role, even he cannot raise this above the level of an overlong TV documentary. Maybe its because I love Altman's, McCabe and Mrs Miller, so that I fail to find this in any way at all well shot. True there are one of two rather fetching shots, I recall a cornfield, an amazing sky and the oncoming train, but so there should be in a film this long! The film does eventually seem to finish, only to start up again and give us another half hour with Robert Ford making the most of the post James years. Little action or violence and lots of very ordinary dialogue.</fullReview>

Some scenes and landscapes do remain in the memory and I enjoyed the score. However by the end it left me cold and bored. James' character wasn't there - a black hole. Did I miss it? Was this on purpose?The interesting thing was the development of Bob's character and reactions to him, which could have merited deeper treatment - a longer end, shorter lead in. The Jesse/Hank relationship.... where did that go? The female characters were non-existent, ciphers at best.I gave it four stars because it looked good. I was also unsure of the tone. Was it supposed to be funny? Stately? Is it deep or pretentious?Sorry. This might be my fault but I just don't get it. Maybe I'll try again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good....even great, but not exceptional.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before my review, I'll admit that my reasons for seeing this film were shallow. I of course went to stare at Brad Pitt and because I really like two of the actresses who were thrown on the screen for a few seconds. Of course, I was given much more than I expected, since I really had no expectations (I find it dangerous to have any when you go see films lately). I knew about the length. I had no issues with the length. I can't say the same for the guy snoring in front of me (I tried to wake him up by gently kicking the back of his seat...he was missing a great film folks!). I loved the pacing of the film actually (and not just because it makes my $8.50 seem more reasonable). The slow deliberation of the film was absolutely necessary for the times and the people it was studying. The film itself was obviously beautiful...but nothing particularly special in my opinion. It simply reminded me of films like "Cold Mountain" or "Legends of the fall." Although I did love a few shots with the light on the hardwood floor and the scene where he gets shot. It was nice to look at, but was there anything new? Not really. The cast was probably one of the films strongest points. First let me talk about the more supporting characters. Both Paul Schnieder and Sam Rockwell were awesome. It might just be that I already like them, but really they both gave a lot to their characters. I can't see the film without them. As I mentioned before I also really like MLP and Zooey, so my only complaint is how little they were used. In actuality it probably would not have been as good if their roles were any larger. The film was a study of two men and the world they lived in...I suppose it was right to accentuate the lack of women in their lives. It would have been a sellout to do anything else. Okay, so Casey Affleck....is he that annoying in other roles, or just a really good actor? I can't say because I've never seen him otherwise. All I know is that he annoyed the snot out of me throughout the film, but in a good way. If that was the goal here, it worked! I was captivated by his acting and my annoyance. I'll have to see him in something else to give a final verdict on how good he is. I suspect that he might just be annoying, because I find the same with his brother. Brad Pitt. I was kinda disappointed actually. I don't know if he's been type cast or maybe has just reached the peak of his acting abilities. To be honest, I'm kinda getting bored with Mr. Pitt. It seems to me that he was just sorta "there" in the film. They could have cast anyone else with a semi-big name and gotten the same needed effect. If they hand him an award for this role, I'll be really confused. The writing and overall story telling were the absolute best features of the film! I saw this film and the new "Elizabeth" film on the same day. Of the two films that attempt to delve into the psyche of historical figures, this was by far the better film (of course the first "Elizabeth" was better than both). I was just thinking...maybe they could have cast Cate Blanchett as Jesse. I think it would have been the same. Haha. No seriously. Anyhow, my final verdict is this: It was a good film, but not exceptional. I feel that we should expect work like this on a regular basis. Films like this should be the standard, not the exception.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The assassination of audience by those 3 hours of boredom !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No offence for those who liked this movie, but I didn't like this movie at all. I went to cinema expecting to see something much better than "American Outlaws" (which is an excellent movie, by the way), but I was totally disappointed. It was very, very boring. Long and boring. I guess I was expecting much more action and ... there was almost no action... It's a very.. "statical" movie... almost like a theater play... It should have represented at least a part of Jesse James life (robbering and being chased), finalizing with his assassination by Robert Ford, and Robert Ford's assassination, so they can justify those 3 hours this movie runs... No doubt, acting was very good, but... that's all. I saw all kind of movies, I like almost all kind of genres. This is definitely a drama, more or less biographical and a little bit western (only because of the time events took place). So... my opinion (and my friends opinion and everyone I asked opinion) is that it's a mediocre movie. For its action and drama intensity is no more than a 6/10 stars rating movie. It doesn't deserve to be considered a brilliant movie just because it has a good acting and good and known actors. I've seen a lot of dramas, westerns or biographical movies much better than this one with little stars rating. Only because Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck plays in this movie and their acting is brilliant doesn't make this movie brilliant. It makes it good... mediocre. If there weren't Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck and another 2-3 actors... no one would have liked this movie so much. There is a word.. "Each one with his tastes"... so I didn't judge those who loved the movie... no way.. I only told you my opinion and the only logical explanation I found for that exaggerated rating. P.S.: I didn't grant this movie 1/10 because I think this is the best it deserves. No, I gave it minimum because of those who voted 10/10 only because Brad Pitt plays in this movie, or those who like Jesse James or western stories and that's why I was so angry. In my opinion a fair vote is 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The finest titles, think "Damage" or "Misery", are revealing and enigmatic at the same time. This one gives it all away, and in more words than I've seen on a movie poster in a long time. The title tells the story. So all the beauty would have to be in the way it unfolds in image and dialog, right? Wrong. "Jesse James" is slow for the sake of being slow. One hour into the movie, next to nothing has happened. To make things worse, Casey Affleck (Ford) equates "good acting" with "poor pronunciation", while Brad Pitt (James) stands, sits, shoots and smokes with his mouth gaping in a most unfetching fashion, no doubt a misguided attempt at developing a trademark expression. Their blathering is so winded you keep thinking the bugger might well die before the claptrap concludes. Think "Snatch" on sedatives. Only Nick Cave's signature score and Hugh Ross' quiet off-screen narration tie this thing together. And there's the small reward of Zooey Deschanel's brief appearance as Robert Ford's lover Dorothy Evans. Her three on-screen minutes outshine the entire rest of this three-hour movie. "Jesse James" is so boring and pretentious I'm beginning to think of it as Oscar material. Say it ain't so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overblown, overlong; great role for Casey Affleck</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>New Zealander Andrew Dominik's 'Chopper'(2000) had Eric Bana very effective in the biopic of a famous Australian criminal. This overblown, overlong, pseudo-arty rehash (with intermittent fake-antique "refracted" camera-work) of Jesse James's last days has been admired and hated. Brad Pitt got the Venice Film Festival's Best Actor award. In fact Pitt lacks the presence needed here to make his role interesting. Casey Affleck, with his embarrassing faux-na?ve eagerness, is the one who holds the screen. With this and the upcoming movie brother Ben has debut-directed with him as the star ('Gone, Baby, Gone' from a novel by 'Mystic River' author Denis Lehane), he may be moving up to major roles, so that's the most noteworthy thing abut this otherwise misfired effort. Sam Rockwell, Sam Shepherd and others are wasted in scenes and conversations that ramble on and never make much sense. The Seventies-style quirkiness isn't backed up by solid ideas, and at over two and a half hours, this is a long, tedious slog to sit through.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you want to impress, make it slow and ponderous and full of meaning. But if it is slow and ponderous and has little meaning, then you will only impress those who find slow and ponderous more impressive than a little meaning.This movie has a story that up and until the killing could be told in twenty minutes without losing any meaning. The fact that Jesse James was a horrible deranged man, who went around the countryside in his last years killing his accomplices and robbing no banks or trains is not particularly interesting.The only really interesting story is that of the killer who then went on to recreate the killing on stage for the delectation of American audiences several hundred times, but who was then despised and murdered for having killed a folk hero. It illustrated again America's predilection for making "heroes" of villains because they are celebrities, and despising those who deal with the "heroes". Sensational was that the senseless killer of the killer was pardoned because of public support.And all this, the truly interesting part of the story, is flashed through with little analysis after several hours of plodding through the snow on horseback and sitting around a table staring at each other and laughing manically in yet another dirty shack.As to acting, Brad Pitt makes a convincing deranged nasty man but repeats the same performance in dozens of scenes with little variation. As does Casey Affleck, who plays, very well, the same squeaking dim adolescent in scene after scene and fails to convince that the naive hero worshipper could be turned into the deadly killer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Poetic Elegy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw The Assassination of Jesse James this afternoon in New York. While I had an interesting cinematic experience, it was not completely satisfying.The film is meditative, poetic and elegiac. Which is to say that it moves at a slow pace and is somewhat obtuse. It is neither Peckinpah nor Sergio Leone, for that type of movie western you'll have to see 3:10 to Yuma.The film is not bad, it did hold my interest. But in the hands of a better director it would have become a true modern day classic like Eastwood's Unforgiven. Brad Pitt is very good in the role and Casey Affleck is great at creating a character that you love to hate; a truly breakthrough performance.I keep wanting to call The assassination of Jesse James an "existentialist Western." The only other film that I have given that designation to was El Topo, although the two films have absolutely nothing in common. While Unforgiven was a meditation on the nature of violence and killing, Assassination of JJ is a meditation on the pit falls of celebrity, even among the notorious.The cinematography is the best that I've seen this year and hearkens back to the work of Nestor Almendros on Malick's Days of Heaven. Roger Deakins will be remembered at Oscar time.I've often said that a great film by a mediocre director is not as interesting as a mediocre film by a great director. The Assassination of Jesse James falls somewhere in the middle, it's a good film by a director whose best work is yet to come</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rented this film with high expectations. The expectations were consistently lowered through the first 30 minutes of viewing, until I was beginning to feel like a fool by continuing to watch something this bad.The cinematography is postcard-perfect. The rest of the film really sucks. It starts with a very pretentious narration, which continues throughout the film. Casey Affleck starts by mumbling his lines. Everyone else, including Bradd Pitt as Jesse, is totally undecipherable, despite the narrator telling us what to think and explaining what is going on.The film starts with an extended night sequence, leading me to wonder if this would be an attempt at film noir. Nothing much happens during the sequence. For a "western" this film has amazingly little action. I've seen Ingmar Bergman films with more life.This film doesn't even work as a character study. It certainly aspires to do so, but between the mumbling, stasis and pretentiousness, I decided I had enough about 30 minutes into it. The last ninety minutes might be absolutely terrific, but I doubt it. I am not going to rate this film because I did not see most of it. Not having to sit through it all would probably cause me to be more generous with it.This is just awful.</fullReview>

Shot in Calgary and Edmonton, AB, and Winnipeg, Canada. I think the camera work was beautiful. Very professionally shot. I was a little let down with the Producing of Ridley Scott and Brad Pitt. Mr. Pitt has not made a good movie since Mr. and Mrs. Smith and the Bradgelina curses his career still. Par acting by Brad Pitt, I've seen better from him in older movies like Fight Club. I got all hyped up for this shot em' up cowboy story that glamorized a fading legend. Instead, I thought this film was pretty boring and is going to get looked over by many. There has been many more westerns made that pay better tribute to the genre then Mr. Pitt's latest effort. But thanks Brad for supporting the Canadian film industry as you just love charities and helping humanity with Angelina.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Admittedly,I read one or two comments from the IMDb just to get a feel for the film before viewing. I felt confident with the cast list and excited by the comments on the film's visually stunning images. I also thought that I would be going to get Nick Cave's 'melodic' soundtrack to the film.No chance! What a lengthy two hour tedious amount of drivel. That story could have been edited to one hour if it was not for the pretence of lingering images of shadows and so forth.After two hours I was willing the assassination to take place, the characters may have been given some depth - but they were just plain boring! The story meanders in a plot which does not build tension but instead just meanders along from one dark scene to another.And as for the train robbery scene: I have seen better masks in Tim Burton's 'Nightmare Before Christmas!' Why is everybody brainwashed by this film?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a nutshell, disappointing...Some good acting.... Sam Rockwell, Casey Affleck; some OK acting, Brad Pitt (same laugh as he used in Snatch) Photography beautiful, great scorebut...Boring, sleep inducing...! I wasn't looking for an all guns blazing shoot em up, but this film seemed to go on forever, with very little happening.Looks to me like Brad Pitt wanted to make this movie no matter what. There was a lot of talent here both in front of the camera and behind the scenes (Ridley/Tony Scott, and I loved Dominik's Andrew Chopper)but it seemed to be a vanity project for Pitt, and it ended up as most vanity projects do, of interest to the people behind the scenes, rather than those in front of the screen, in the cinema!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Totally Incomprehensible Without the Pretense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most incomprehensible films are, at least, pretentious. You can't even say that about this rambling, never ending, cinematic waste of time.The characters are indistinguishable. Without the use of captions (thanks to home viewing), it would be impossible to know who was who, and even then, it's never quite clear. There is almost no character development, except in the case of Bob Ford. Why is Jessee tracking the members of his gang? Who knows? We know nothing about him.The last fifteen minutes are pretty good. Bob Ford is far more interesting than Jessee, and the end of the movie leaves you wishing the movie were about him, not Jesse.A total mess. One can only hope it won't kill Westerns (again). Forget it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great cinematography, average acting, terrible storytelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like the soothing but mysterious and sometimes spooky feeling that brought by the excellent cinematography. The acting is alright. Nonetheless, I have some problems about the storytelling.In most of the runtime of the movie, Jesse James is portrayed as a bandit who is highly wanted by the government by substantive rewards, who commits lots of robberies and murders, beats up armless train attendant, works over a young innocent kid, puts extreme mental and psychological pressure on his fellow gang members, kills people he is suspicious of although he has no firm evidence. All in all, he looks like a cruel tyrannical ruffian (except to his family). However, in the last ten minutes of the movie, after his assassination, out of the blue, he turns out to be a real hero, worshiped by the entire country, and his assassinator becomes the worst man in the world disgusted by every single individual.This just doesn't make sense, especially to those who have never heard about the story of Jesse James ever before (like me). It is OK for the director to have his own point of view (obviously as written in the movie title), but it is not supposed to be suddenly indoctrinated to the audience in the last ten minutes of the movie without any proof previously shown in the movie. To me, this movie looks like a report of the psychological interaction between Jesse and his gang members, and Robert's assassination is just a natural instinct of human being. The movie doesn't at all convince me that he is a coward.Besides, I have a pet peeve of too much narrative in a movie. I know it is a personal thing, but at least it manifests the director's incapability of the exhibiting some complex plot line, subtle emotion of the character, and so on. It is just a shortcut to avoid further thinking of a smarter way to organize the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jesse James and Jesus?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anybody see a parallel between how the death of Jesse James was portrayed and the Biblical account of the death of Jesus? Obviously (according to the movie) Jesse knew he was going to die. He was approximately the same age as Jesus. And he had a trusted member of his gang betray him (Bob Ford in the Judas role).I don't know if it was the novelist, the screenwriter/director or Pitt who may have tried to parallel the ultimate hero and the anti-hero but I saw it very clearly.As for the movie, the only redeeming quality for me was the cinematography. The film was interminably long and had all the excitement and action of the dusty picture Pitt was looking at when he was shot. Had they released the original cut at four hours, I would have sought out the descendants of Robert Ford and had him put a bullet in my head.This was obviously a vanity project for Pitt and he obviously called the shots as this was the writer/director's first credit and apparently was there in title only as Pitt's stooge. Another case of the nuts running the nut house. What a waste of film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Asssasination not enjoyed by all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford By Daniel Rosado Directed: Andrew Dominik Cast: Brad Pitt, Casey Affleck, Sam Rockwell, Paul Schneider, Jeremy Renner, Sam Shepard, Garret Dillahunt, Alison Elliot The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is one of the longest movie titles ever made. It's a film about how the legendary Jesse James (Brad Pitt) died. He was shot by a young follower Robert Ford (Casey Affleck).Robert Ford was a cowardly young man who had been obsessed with Jesse James his whole life. Robert Ford had many similarities with Jesse, but at the same time they were very different. Jesse enjoyed murdering people, and was going insane; while Ford was always made fun of, and was easily intimidated by people.While watching this movie you start to feel bored, because it's nothing but senseless talking. You start to think you are watching a documentary. Then you start to realize the movie isn't really about Jesse James. It's about Robert Ford being a coward, and not doing much else.There are a couple of scenes where there's some action, but not much. When you think of Jesse James you think there's going to be some cowboy guy riding around on a horse shooting at people for no reason. But this movie is just about a little skinny guy killing Jesse after what seems like four long hours.Jesse isn't even in the movie for that much, which is disappointing because Pitt was a pretty good Jesse James. I also feel that Casey Affleck was the perfect Robert Ford, he seems like he would be a coward in person.After Ford finally kills Jesse, which was just insulting (he shot him in the back), you think the movies over and you can go home. But you then realize that your wrong and the movie is still talking about Robert Ford. Eventually Ford gets assassinated, and even though won't admit it, you're glad it happened because now you can leave. But even after that the movie still goes about another fifteen minutes.The movie had the potential to be a lot better, but in the end it was disappointing.2 out of 5 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My wife and I walked out after about an hour and a half. Three other people didn't wait that long. The cinematography was beautiful. The atmosphere was definitely there. The problem is that the screenplay gave us no reason to care about these characters. If anything it convinced us not to like them. Watching offensive characters that give the viewer no reason to like them for 160 minutes is asking a lot. Furthermore, while Pitt is an engaging personality, we don't care to watch him beat up a little kid or shoot people just because he can. Any "Oscar Buzz" about this movie or Pitt has to be the result of the studio's marketing efforts and not the reality of the movie itself. Watching people being terrorized, intimidated or killed in cold blood is not what we consider entertainment. The overt violence is held together by random acts of mental and emotional cruelty. Somewhere along the line I recall reading a couple of offhand remarks by Pitt wherein he indicated he didn't really care for the finished product either. We agree.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While the movie is a slow moving and languid take on the legend of Jesse James, a play exists that would make a far more interesting movie: The Man Who Shot the Man Who Shot Jesse James: A New Tale of the Old West. It was created by a group of actors in New York and performed at the Manhattan Punchline to excellent reviews in and around 1979. it is faster, wittier and quicker to the point than the movie. I saw it at Creede Rep in Creede, CO and I remember hoping that this movie was based on the play. Alas it wasn't, and I don't see this topic being ripe for a competing film.

		<shortDescription>Should have known from the title this would be long and boring...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't mind long movies. A 3 hour movie can go by in a snap while a crappy 90 minute movie might seem like 3 hours. There's a good movie somewhere in this meandering mess but would have required a few more rewrites to get there. The only tension is between Casey Affleck's character who loves Jesse James the legend and slowly he sees his image being torn down. But there's too many bloated scenes of unnecessary subplots that make you want to hit the FF button.One thing this does prove is that Brad Pitt does not have the chops to carry a film as a leading man. He's trying, but he's not really acting. In this film he's actually kind of hammy. And there were points in the movie when Casey Affleck's purposely whiny, cracking voice almost seemed like I was watching an actor on Saturday Night Live mocking him. I haven't seen a voice that annoying come out of an actors mouth since Mos Def in 16 BLOCKS. If the whiny Affleck doesn't change his schtick, people are going to be laughing out loud at his next flick. Although he was good in Gone Baby Gone.Why they stole the narrative style from The PBS Civil War Documentaries makes sense, I guess, but they beat it to death so much you just wanted it to stop as well. If I want to watch PBS I'll watch PBS, not pay 12 bucks to see it in a theater. And what's with the 'sepia tone' thing happening in Hollywood these days? If you show us a film in sepia tone we're automatically going to think its good? Didn't work in another snooze-fest 'Flags of our Fathers' and it didn't work here.My guess is Pitt, as producer, exerted some control over this and tried to make a 'film' not a movie and he ended up doing neither. I watched half of this on my own, then started it again the next night with my girlfriend and she didn't even want to finish watching it. AND she's the biggest Brad Pitt fan there is! It is completely devoid of any narrative tension and has no other qualities about it to make it worth watching. All the performances are banal. A complete waste of time. This makes you long for the days of the studio system when actors would be forced to make good movies. Too many actors with too much power thinking they know what it takes to make a good movie.Stay away from this one!</fullReview>

Yes, Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck give great performances, but I was utterly disappointed after watching it. I felt I have completely wasted 2.5 hours of my life.The plot is highly confusing. It's so hard to follow who is who, who does what and why do they do the things they do. There seems to be no explanation as to why they kill each other in the film. The pacing is so slow, there is so little action in the film, all they do is talk. Even after Jesse James died, the film stretches on and on. Zooey Deschanel receives a mention in the production notes in the film despite her role being a 30 second role in the film? I just don't understand this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So, a movie about Jessie James that instead of being about gunfights and bank robberies is primarily about characters other than Jessie James, and the lies they tell each other.It is a in depth character profile of far too many characters. The pacing of the movie is all wrong, leaving the viewer for half hour segments with nothing to watch but the actors chewing the scenery. If it weren't for the brilliant casting and the wonderful performances offered, this movie would be outright dreadful.As it is, we're left with a director who apparently wanted to write an historical novel, not direct a movie, and a director of photography who is clearly in love with himself.A good movie should be of interest even to those not interested in the subject. Instead, this movie is about what the actors and directors want to offer. Express yourselves on your own time, gentlemen! My nine bucks was for ME to be entertained, not you.On the whole, a painfully slow and ridiculously long narrative about the James gang. Credit goes to the actors for making it tolerable, but a movie has to be more than just acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is the perfect example of why directors should stick to visual interpretation of the script and leave the writing to someone who really knows how to tell a story in a concise and engaging manner.Film is not a forgiving medium when it comes to character development and this movie is no exception. I would go as far as to say that "The Assassination of Jesse James" is trying to be a novel rather than a film. It spends much too long trying to develop characters who, in the end, we can neither admire, identify with nor completely understand due to the obvious time constraints of the medium. With this in mind the entire pacing of the film will leave most movie viewers snoozing in their seats. I certainly caught more that just a few folks doing just that.To put it bluntly Dominik seems to have made this film for the benefit of other 'artists' and not for the movie-going public. The plot is circuitous, the cinematography breathtaking yet pedantic and the individual scenes anti-climactic. I'm sure that the film will be heralded as a masterpiece by critics and other 'artistes' that consider the rest of us to be cretinous 'Philistines'. To the general movie-going public it will be neither exciting, intriguing or particularly enjoyable. I would recommend "Jesse James" only to people who find movies such as 'The Thin Red Line' or 'Citizen Kane' compelling. Everyone else will see it as a flop (and deservedly so).</fullReview>

I wonder why Ford thought people would think his action would be one of a hero. The lighting is dim and entwined with depressing dialog, which makes for ickey and messy film. The directing and script creates the mess of a life these people endured. Plays where Ford reenacted the sick deed of shooting Jessie in the back is painful to watch. Jessie and the clan were negative towards one another displayed in their self centered paranoid criminal lives. Gut wrenching too watch. What comes around goes around is the enduring theme for the viewers to watch. So enduring I fell asleep for twenty minutes during the film. Too enduring for me especially during a cold Drury Febrauary day. I give this film a 2 out of 10. Like watching a slow train wreck of Ford's life. The end is ironic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, when you go to see a movie with Brad Pitt cast to play a Wild West outlaw, you're bound to get suspicious. I mean, Danny De Vito doesn't play Batman, does he? Brad Pitt and Wild West simply do not mix, and there is no plot great enough to conceal this miscasting.Then there's Casey Affleck, whose acting skills (or lack thereof, which is a tradition in the Affleck family) leave you wishing someone would shoot him as soon as possible. His acting is unbearable, flat and one-sided. That's what he's nominated for Oscar for. Laughable.Then you get curious as of what genre this flick belongs to. It's definitely no western (with that much blabbering throughout the movie, all traditional western characters would probably shoot themselves in the first 15 minutes), it's no psychological drama (not with a bunch of two-dimensional, stick figure characters), and it only falls into a bad comedy category due to some unfunny jokes that some of the characters utter from time to time.Did I also mention that it's almost three hours long? Three hours of constant pointless talking, with only a couple of slow horse rides that take the characters to another location where they can continue to rattle their boxes just like all Wild West heroes used to do back then.Overall, I failed to see anything worthy in this movie. It's beautifully shot, and that's about it.</fullReview>

The cinematography was not bad but if I ever have to look through another distorted window I might have to rob a train, too. This bland fiasco could have been done in three minutes and the impact would not have suffered. By the end of the show I was thinking, "Kill him already, maybe there will be enough time for me to do something more fun like get a root canal.

This movie took forever to make a simple statement in the beginning that Robert Ford is creepy and Jesse is dangerous. The opening train robbery introducing the characters should have taken 5 minutes and it took 20! The acting is wooden with Casey Affleck just saying his lines while looking like a lost puppy walking around pit bulls. Pitt did a fair job, but he seemed to take himself too seriously in the role. Sam Shepard looked old enough to be Pitt's father and not his older brother Frank. He also had no rhythm with his character and just said his lines without much feeling. He and Pitt were not believable in the least as brothers. I didn't buy it for one minute.Too many characters that were there for absolutely no reason and weird long setups trying to tell a story that should have been much more simply told! Strange forshadowing mixed with telling the story from a backstory way... really slow and boring.If you want to see a really good psychological movie in the western genre, go and see 3:10 to Yuma, you'll enjoy it much more! Wait and rent this one... it's not worth the time spent sitting in the theater!</fullReview>

This movie was the biggest let-down of the year. We greatly anticipated seeing it, but found it was boring and stupid in the beginning and remained boring and stupid for 2 hours and 39 minutes.Having almost no story, no suspense, no love interest, and with most of the dialog mumbled and incomprehensible, Brad Pitt and Casey Aflick seem to be in a contest to deliver the dullest and flattest performance of the year.It is not impossible for today's Hollywood to make a good western. HBO's "Deadwood" proves that. Deadwood was as full of life and full of entertainment value as "Assassination..." is full of boredom and stupidity.The film takes the aura of historical accuracy, but a mere 5 minutes on Google will teach you that most of the alleged accuracy is a lie.Sixty-nine years ago, Henry King directed JESSE JAMES and it became an instant classic, still sought after in 2008. A year later, Fritz Lang made the sequel, RETURN OF FRANK JAMES. Both pictures were superior in terms of acting, suspense, cinematography, musical score, and the ability to entertain --- the essence of quality film-making. Later, Sam Fuller made his B-movie classic I SHOT JESSE JAMES featuring John Ireland's on-target role as Robert Ford. These were quality movies, and they endure decades later. "Assasination..." despite the alleged 10 scores was an instant box office failure, and after the current DVD run will be quickly forgotten.Please don't waste 2 1/2 hours on this pile of trash. Rent any or all of the 3 quality movies mentioned above. Quality wins!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What was this? I attended the free screening tonight in San Francisco and, within the first hour, I was ready to pull out my own handgun and shoot Jesse James myself...and then turn the gun on all the rest of the boring characters. What a long, drawn-out excuse for a Western...with totally irrelevant scenes and long supposedly poignant or extended staring and deep, what I assume were meant to be, soul searching scenes of men staring at each other somberly. Geez! Give me a break! A character study of Robert Ford, unnecessarily long and despairingly drawn out to almost 3 hours. Simply cinematographers trying for Oscar without making a movie for an audience! Do not go! Rent it, if you must, and forward through the majority of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst movie ever...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the USA if the main character is Brad Pitt the movie is ''amazing''...but not in E.U.!!I saw this movie last night with my friends at the mall and it was amazing , but in the worst way possible! No action , no adventure no NOTHING ! ... just chatting around...and by the way...the end of the movie is revealed by the title...so whats the point watching 2.5 hours of chatting just to see that gay Robert killing Jesse ?!? And one more thing : Jesse was the quickest gunmen , but all he did was shooting people from behind...you really need to be fast for that ;)The only good part of this movie was the music (Max Payne theme) and the landscape.......but nothing else...Njoy</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most Boring Big Budget film of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ignore the elitists and aesthetes who are swooning over this ridiculous cowboy travelogue with its beautiful photography.My god! - what were they thinking? Maybe it's really an allegory about the latent homosexuality of Jesse James and John Ford, If Ford had only mounted Jesse in the finale instead of shooting him; it would have been a more relevant denouement - given the sickening and slow slow slow paced evolution of their ridiculous relationship by this ego maniacal and self indulgent director.Universal must be apoplectic - Pitt is brilliant but no one will watch this clunker who talks to a normal movie goer who suffered through it ahead of them.Yeek! - Unbelievably Awful!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off with Positive I really enjoyed Brad Pitts in the roll as Jesse James I found it effortless, dark and brooding. I would not be surprise with an Oscar nod for Mr. Pitt. I cannot say the same for Casey Affleck as Bob Ford I found him whinny, irritating and almost un-watchable. The supporting cast was good and for the most part I thought well cast in their rolls I especially liked Jeremy Renner and Paul Schneider. I must give hats off to Garret Dillahunt I honestly felt he was terrified in a later scene with Brad Pitt his fear looked genuine. However the Movie seemed to just carry on for too long and minor details that did not need a depth to them, were carried on for just to long. Trimming this movie to a respectable 100 minutes might do wonders. It's still a movie worth a look just not at today's ticket prices. My rating is a 2 worth a look but wait until its trimmed for network TV.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Was this movie interesting and well acted? Yes - though Affleck...well he played Affleck...just slower, and a tad creepier. Was it beautifully shot, sucking you in with a unique visual style? Yes. Was it too long? Yes.Never has one viewer been so happy to hear the words... "The day before Jesse James died was Palm Sunday." That means the end is near folks....and to be fair - the best parts of the film, and Affleck's acting, were to follow. It seems some of the more interesting aspects of this story - the richer fodder for a visual medium that requires a viewer to remain seated while drinking a soda the size of a small baby - were compressed into the post-James dying portion of the film.Honestly - we know who killed him, can't you get us to the why a little quicker, and show us more about the after-effects? Sam Rockwell was awesome - perhaps the best performance in the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm telling you right now: All these praises are either from paid gardeners or from seriously misguided film viewers. This movie is bad; YOU WILL NOT LIKE IT. Never in my life have I fallen asleep in a theater but it kept happening over and over again at this showing. And guess what? Having slept throughout most of the film, I can still give you a fairly detailed description of everything that happened and why (along with the film-maker's philosophical perspective on the events). How on earth can all these production companies allow this guy 2:40 mins of nearly nothingness? Are the Warners sans Oscar contenders this year? Did they think that long pauses and extended scenes of nothingness will be mistaken for some form of cinematic genius? Shame. Can't believe Pitt and Scott are associated with this thing. UGH.</fullReview>
