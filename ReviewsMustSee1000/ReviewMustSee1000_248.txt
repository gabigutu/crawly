		<shortDescription>These Things aren't Wild, they're just slightly troubled</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where the Wild Things are is a well written, intelligent, and very cold drama about the often challenging interactions within a closed group of people, the complexities of leadership and the cost of selfishness.It's not a movie about imagination or childhood at all, and it's only vaguely concerned with themes of growing up, family or maturity.It's not wacky or funny. Not colorful or exciting. There's only about 10 minutes of what I'd call "fun" in the whole 2-hour package.That doesn't make Where the Wild Things Are a bad movie. It just makes it completely defiant of the viewer's expectations, and thus a rather confusing film to watch.The first time I saw this I wasn't sure how I was supposed to be taking things. Was that supposed to be funny? Is she being sarcastic, or serious? Is Max in real danger now, or not? That's not because the movie is actually confusing, but because it all seems vaguely wrong and inappropriate. I left scratching my head saying "I guess that was good?" In the end I decided I didn't like it. I felt that this was either the wrong script for this movie or the wrong movie for this script. Either way, it didn't click for me and felt awkward to the end.Nevertheless there is quality here, and I recommend you watch it yourself and reach your own conclusion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a child's kingdom</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's taken Spike Jonze a while to write, film, edit and (after some wrestling with Warner brothers over the final cut) release his adaptation of Maurice Sendak's Where the Wild Things Are. One who greatly admires filmmakers will wait especially for a filmmaker who takes his time in creating something after years of speculation. Now, the filmmaker who first came on the scene with Being John Malkovich, once again gives me a one-word response with this third film of his: Wow. Hot damn. That's two more. This is, simply, a classic work of film-making, but also on a particular subject that so few filmmakers even attempt to make let alone get right, which is what it's like to really be a child. Films that come to mind like this could also include the 400 Blows, Fanny and Alexander, (arguably) Tideland and E.T. Now here's another, and one that is directed with an original eye and an inspiration of texture and feeling, a look like out of our own wanted childhood playgrounds. Or some kind of playground.If you don't know the story by Sendak- and to be fair it's only several pages long and its story was *loosely* used for this film- is about Max, who, not entirely pleased with his life in the real world ventures into the world of the 'Wild Things', a place where he can be king (or rather makes himself one) and tries to create a paradise with his fellow creatures. This is the main bit of what the story is "about", but how it's about it is a whole other matter. It's a movie children can see and hopefully adore, but it's more than that. What it's going for is childhood itself, what makes up a young guy who has little experience in the real world and can only really see things through imagination and in a prism of what the 'real world' represents.We see Max in class, for example, learning about how the sun works in relation to Earth. It's a truthful but pessimistic lecture (considering to elementary school kids no less) about how one day the sun will die, and so will all life. This is carried with Max when he ventures into the world of the Wild Things, and when he mentions this to Carol there's a perplexed response to this. "It's so small," Carol says of the Sun, and while it doesn't bother him at the moment it later comes back as a bit of real inner turmoil that Carol can barely contemplate. Or anyone else for that matter. Can one really be expected as a child to understand the full scope of the sun dying out and life as everyone knows it ending? It may be billions of years away, but to a little boy it could be just around the corner.That, by the way, is one of the brilliant things about the movie - all of Max's collected experience, and who he is as a person, and what he can see and understand around him in his family and surroundings, is represented in the bunch of Wild Things. All of Max, indeed, is split among all of them: Carol, KW, Douglas, Ira, Alexander, and a particular 'quiet' Wild Thing that barely says a word, they're all Max, and yet because of their split pieces they're never fully whole either. This makes it easy, perhaps, for Max to be crowned as their king (hey, he did lead vikings after all!), and to lead Carol's dream of a fortress for them all where "everything you would want to happen would happen." There's magical moments experienced among them, and all of the Wild Things, thanks to the Jim Henson creature shop work, are all in front of us and live and breathe as real things in this set of 'wild' locations (woods, desert, beach, rocky coast). As soon as you can open up yourself to these being real beings, not just animatronics, the whole emotional core of the film opens up as well.But oh, it's also such an unusually, beautifully realized film. From its vivid and in-the-moment use of hand-held cinematography (and, sometimes, the stillness of looking at the creatures and Max in the backdrops), to the songs from Karen O. that are always supportive of the scenes (never the obtrusive kinds in other kids movies), to the complex relationships between all of the characters that one can see reminiscent of the Wizard of Oz, it's a piece of pop-art that lets the viewer in. Its welcoming, refreshing and kind of staggering to see someone who knows the way children think, and how we don't have to be a mixed-up little boy to identify and see ourselves in Max (and, also, how we can't fully identify with things as a child like divorce, re: Carol and KW's 'friendship'). Where the Wild Things Are works as spectacle and comedy, and as the best Jim Henson movie the man never made, so it works for children. But for adults, because it's really about *us*, it can work wonders for us too.Let the wild rumpus start!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't know what I expected... but I loved it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I attended an early screening with my 8 year old daughter; we're both big fans of Sendak in general and this book in particular, and I quite like Spike Jonze as well. But this did not prepare us for the moody, almost downbeat atmosphere through most of the film, nor the sense of immediacy and almost hyper-realism combined with astoundingly fanciful imagery. It is such an odd movie! And yet, when it was over, we turned to each other smiling a melancholy smile and said, "I loved it." The expansion of the tiny story into a feature-length film is so subtle that you barely sense it happening. There isn't an artificial new plot laid over the bones of the original -- it's simply expanded at every turn and very gently stretched out to feature length. The voice performances are wonderful, and the costumes are magnificent, as is the one major visual addition to the material (which I won't give away). Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review: Where the Wild Things Are</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Plot Synopsis: Adapted from Sendak's beloved children's book, the story follows Max (Records), a young boy experiencing both the joys and loneliness of childhood. After a fight with his mother (Keener), Max runs away; a wild rumpus ensues.In the years since principal photography wrapped, Spike Jonze's Where the Wild Things Are has become notorious for its turbulent production. After seeing Jonze's first cut, the studio considered re-shooting the entire film, feeling that it was too dark to attract the audiences an 80 million dollar budget normally justifies. Apparently they were expecting something along the lines of Beverly Hills Chihuahua, not a poignant, complex journey into the mind of a young boy.It's not a coincidence that Sendak refused to allow any adaptation of his story to enter production until he had hand picked Jonze to direct, feeling the director was the only one up to the task of capturing the subtle sensibilities of his classic tale. The end result is mesmerizing. Jonze's creation is a masterful piece of art, both visually arresting and exquisitely affecting. You will never see boyhood captured as truthfully on film as it is in the film's first 20 minutes. Its richness only increases when Max runs away, the events of his odyssey reflecting the depths of his psyche.The film is as visually stunning as anything released this or any other year. The images are paired beautifully with the tone of the story, a goal many filmmakers strive for but seldom accomplish. Striking images only carry a film so far, and it's Max that gives the film its heart. Records delivers an exceptional performance in a truly complex role; he masterfully exposes Max's inner pensiveness, expressing a range of emotions most adult actors strive to demonstrate their whole careers.Those who know me are undoubtedly aware that Sendak's book holds a special place in my heart. If anything, my feelings about the film are indicative of its successes, and should not be read as the words of a fanboy who would have adored the film regardless of its content. My expectations were astronomical, and the fact that the film exceeded those expectations are a true measure of its brilliance. It soars to heights I never could have imagined.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Book: Boys will be boys. Film: Boys will be maladjusted demons.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film jumps around between gravely disturbing, mind-numbingly tedious, naively innocent, and severely depressing. Our nearly seven-year-old daughter and her friend were bored to tears, our two-year-old was freaked out, and our whole family felt simply awful afterwards. What a waste of time, money, nerves, and my 35th birthday!(Warning! Minor spoilers follow?as if anything could spoil the viewing of this movie more than the movie itself.)The film's main message seems to be that just because your parents get divorced, or your monstrous girlfriend moves out, or your older sister starts hanging out with other friends instead of you, or your mom starts dating again, or, worst of all, she decides to cook frozen corn instead of "real" corn ... does not mean that it is acceptable behavior for you to trash someone's bedroom, bite someone's shoulder, destroy someone's house, or tear someone's arm off. If only you would finally pull back that wolf hood and realize that your demented actions have exhausted your poor mother (and an entire audience).The filmmakers somehow manage to deliver their message in a simultaneously heavy-handed and vague way. Most viewers will not grasp it, and those few who do will probably not have need of it. If you dare watch this cinematic abomination?which life-sucking action I would never recommend?please understand that you will be subjected to displays of emotional instability the likes of which have not been witnessed since Anakin Skywalker graced the screen. At least Anakin had a cool lightsaber to vent his frustrations; besides using a fork and his teeth, our dear friend Max can do nothing but track snow into the house, defiantly stand on the kitchen counter, and conjure up a pile of dysfunctional overgrown tater tots (and a goat) to help him explore every ugly facet of his consciousness.You should also be prepared for some ambiguity: I believed for an overlong period that Max's older sister was actually some across-the-street neighbor that Max had a crush on, so imagine my surprise when Max's mother suddenly asked the girl to clear her things off the table for dinner! Another confusing bit is the fact that the main tater tot-creature is named Carol even though he is male, and this character is first seen when he is destroying houses for a reason which will remain unclear unless you can decipher his shouts amidst all the bangs, booms, and gnashing of teeth.The movie has an air of being steeped in symbolism or in child psychology, but really all that comes across is alarming juvenile psychopathy with a shallow, incomplete, and one-sided resolution.Several inconsistencies appear in the film, the most upsetting of which has to do with physical injury. When one character is sharply struck with a dirt clod, his resulting wound and suffering are clearly evident; yet when another character loses his arm in a scene which is not graphic but still gruesome, the filmmakers conveniently gloss over any expected pain and replace it with a cheesy joke. How inappropriate and insulting!The movie is not at all a delightful adaptation of a beloved children's book. It provides absolutely no entertainment for children or adults. Its seeming claims to educational value are far from viable. It embodies a perfect recipient of the complaint relegated to poor films: "That's two hours of my life I'll never get back!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit misleading.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw that Spike Jonze and Dave Eggers were adapting "Where the Wild Things Are" into a feature-length film, one question kept coming up: how do you turn a nine sentence children's book into a movie? Unfortunately, after seeing it, the question remains. My initial reaction was that I felt dazed. Part of this reaction was derived from the awe of seeing top-notch, jaw-dropping CGI and puppetry bring the illustrations from Maurice Sendak's 1963 children's book to life. Another part was the appreciation of the fabulous voice acting of James Gandolfini, Forest Whitaker, Catherine O'Hara, Paul Dano, Lauren Ambrose, and Michael Berry, Jr., which added depth (and names) to monsters that never spoke in Sendak's book. However, the overriding reason for feeling dazed is that the viewer is unfortunately beaten over the head with heavy-handed metaphors for the duration of Max's (Max Records) time on the island.It takes the viewer little time to figure out the role each monster plays in Max's psyche. Carol (Gandolfini) is mostly Max and represents his wildly-swinging emotions, switching from happiness to destructive anger to crushing depression with little warning, while Douglas (Cooper) is Carol's safety blanket and represents the same for Max; a friend who is nearly always obedient and agreeable. In Max's real life, we never see this person, so perhaps Douglas is an imaginary friend in Max's waking hours. At least, we can only hope he's imaginary after seeing how Carol treats Douglas. K.W. (Ambrose) is Max's sister, Claire, not only emotionally?both characters keep leaving the "family" to hang out with cooler friends, breeding jealousy in Carol as Claire does to Max?but also physically, as both the puppet and actress (Pepita Emmerichs) have shaggy brown hair, a slow smile, and that all-too-detached teenage voice. Alexander (Dano) is Max's fear and insecurity. Physically Alexander is smaller than the rest of the monsters, which is a nice detail for a character that always feels ignored and attention-starved.While the main conflict lies between Carol and K.W., the two most telling monsters are Judith (O'Hara) and Ira (Whitaker). These represent Max's parents. When Max stormed out of his house to begin his adventure, it was rage towards his mother that served as the catalyst, which even manifested itself in Max biting her shoulder. It's no wonder then that Judith displays all the things Max dislikes about his mother: she is the one that doubts him, questions his motives, and generally ruins his good times. If Max had stormed off into the woods after the opening sequence involving Claire's friends destroying his igloo, it would have been K.W. that played this role, while Judith would have been the reassuring, yet distant character.Ira is most definitely Max's father, who is never shown in the film, but doesn't have to be. Max obviously longs for him and shows nothing but jealousy and anger towards his mother's new boyfriend. The most obvious clue is that Judith and Ira are the only couple on the island. Ira is a pleasant, lovable character, which is how Max would idealize his father if he was mad at his mother. Furthermore, Ira is the monster that Max goes out of his way compliment?a bit of a role-reversal from father-to-son, now king-to-subject?and Ira is the only monster that Max hugs when he departs. It's an interesting concept, turning a children's book into Freud 101, but is seems dark and oppressive. I realize Sendak's book was visually dark, but emotionally is was vibrant and happy, much like the melody to "Wake Up" by Arcade Fire that was used in the trailer. Unfortunately, this film desperately fails to be vibrant and happy, and for a movie based on a children's book that many parents will take their children to see, it's a major flaw.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seriously, that was one of the most bring you down, feel bad, downer movies I have ever seen. I honestly didn't get it. The wild things were mean to each other, the wild things were mean to the boy, no one was happy (especially my kids), the wild things had scowls on their faces the whole time and walked around in a kind of trance like state glaring and yelling at each other. If there was ever a hint of happiness it was quickly followed by some rude remark or mean comment to stifle the mood. I kept thinking to myself, "why did he do that" or "why did he say that", it made no sense.The movie begins with the boy being mistreated by his sister, and then yelled at by his mom so he runs away. Then the sad feelings continue as the wild things act the same way towards each other. At one point when, Carol, goes completely bonkers and rips the arm off of his 'friend' and then tries to hit Max and then chases him through the woods, I felt like I HAD taken my kids to Saw! If you've ever had any negative, sad, depressing or horrible experiences during your childhood/adolescence, then go see this movie, and they will all come flooding back....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where the Wild Things Are - Extraordinary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A beautiful, audacious, roughly-hewn motion picture (adjectives that are no doubt overused in describing the picture's modus operandi), Spike Jonze's adaptation Maurice Sendak's adored children's book "Where the Wild Things Are" taps into the innocent, volatile world of a 9 year old boy the way few mainstream feature films have. It is original, unique, melancholy, and because of this several mainstream critics (and even lucid critics like Salon's Stephanie Zacharek) have derided the film. "There's no story"; "kids won't like it"; "it's an adult film about children, not a children's film"; "it's boring"; "the pacing is slow"...What? Why did it become such a crime to make an abstract art film within the spineless confines of the Hollywood system? Doesn't Spike Jonze get credit for personalizing, therefore, retaining a substantial amount of voracity while delving into one of the most revered children's books of the last fifty years? What the hell is wrong with that? I understand that some people just don't respond to the abstract, pseudo-verisimilitude of pretentious art films, but there's a stripped-down purity to this picture that cannot be denied. It's not pretentious, but emotional and honest.It's bold, it takes chances...why is it being chastised in the media? How often do we get movies like "Where the Wild Things Are"? It should be celebrated, not snidely dismissed (Ex. Lou Lumenick, NY Post).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant film if sadness and hopelessness was its intent.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last night we went to see Spike Jonez's film adaptation of Where the Wild Things Are by Maurice Sendak. I can't say that the film was bad. Considering that everyone in our party, who ranged in age from 7 to 42, had an incredibly strong reaction to it, I have to admit that it probably is quite good. It doesn't mean however, that any of us liked it. None of us did.As a child, I found the book a little creepy and maybe even sad, but the last images, those of Max returning to his own room on the very night that he had left it and finding his supper, left for him still warm, redeemed some of the angst of the book. Those last few lines left this little reader feeling relieved and hopeful that tomorrow would be a better day for young Max. The film offered no such relief from the considerable gloom and sadness it inflicted.In fact, Jonez's adaptation was overwhelmingly sad from beginning to end. Worse, there was a weighty hopelessness to it all. Jonez's characters, whether human or monster were so wholly deficient that they appear forever locked in a cycle of longing for love, understanding and acceptance without any apparent means to make it happen. Not one of them presented the strength in character to make those slight alterations of growth and understanding that would break the barrier and connect with the very creature standing next to him, who although desirous of the exact same thing, is somehow rendered unreachable.The effect was so powerful that even the chatty, joyful eight year old girl in our group left the theater legitimately depressed, an emotion that is completely new to her. If the director's intention was to leave his audience with this level of hopelessness, then the film is brilliant. I myself will not be purchasing the DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bold but beautiful risk for a children's book adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spike Jonze's imagining of "Where the Wild Things Are" is nothing like you'd expect from a film adapted from a beloved children's book. It's dense with top-notch visuals from the cinematography to the incredible fusion of costumes, puppetry and CGI used to bring the Wild Things to life, but its plot is very frank in its approach to anger, sadness and loneliness. It should be noted that this is not so much a children's film as it is a film that children are capable of enjoying. I refuse to insist that this is not for children, but it would be untruthful to say that this is a film *intended* for them. "Wild Things" is likely going to be appreciated most by those who already have experienced what the main character Max is going through emotionally with regards to his family and his peers (the wild things). To put a number on it, I think that -- depending on the child -- kids ages nine or older will not only be able to enjoy it, but take something away from it. As for adults, it should be a touching and somewhat nostalgic filmgoing experience. Jonze pretty much perfectly captures the essence of childhood within the first 20 minutes of this film. Whether it's the way Max (Max Records, who is excellent) looks up at his mom (Catherine Keener) from underneath her desk or his imagination taking over as he sails a toy boat over the curves of his covers, Jonze creates moments that reconnect us to childhood in simply poetic fashion. Immediately we're ready for Max's adventure to begin because he helps us so easily recall that childlike state of mind. After a bad dispute that ends with Max biting his mom, he runs away and discovers the island where the wild things are. If you've seen the trailer, nothing more needs to be said about Jonze's incredible choice to go with puppets and blend in CGI elements to give it a breath of realism. As for the characters themselves, Jonze and longtime co-writer Dave Eggers take an interesting approach. The wild things are voiced by adult actors and give them a sense humor appealing to adults, but give them the social functionality of eight-year-olds. It ends up creating this schism between what we expect will happen (they're going to behave either like children or adults, it can't be both) and what does (they carry themselves like adults, but they interact like children). The results of this concept fall somewhere between hysterically genius and bizarre/random. On one hand their child-like behavior makes for some elegant teaching points for Max and on the other you have one wild thing knocking two gulls out of the sky and then telling Max their names are Bob and Terry. It's simultaneously goofy/immature and completely fantastic. One of the challenges of the film had to be expanding the story to adapt instead of condensing like most adaptations require. Jonze and Eggers use this as a chance to establish the real world issues Max is dealing with (how to handle his need for parental attention and his anger) and manifest them in this imaginary way in the world of the wild things. The scenes with the wild things are very physical, which will help to keep children's attention. They have a dirt clod fight and go running through the forest before falling into a pile (we all know what that was like as children). Some parents who are very sensitive to what their kids see might have trouble being okay with some of the anger and other extreme emotions. If there's one good way to put it, it's that the emotional transitions can be abrupt. One minute is playful and fun, the next can instantly become lonely or sad and then immediately one of anger mild violence follows. Some might wonder why this wasn't catered more directly to kids, but if you stop and think, don't instant emotional mood swings sounds like a pretty spot-on portrayal of childhood? Jonze telling of "Wild Things" is a mature albeit truthful one. This is not pure syrupy children's entertainment. A child should come out of this movie knowing disputes between family members happen, but that it doesn't change how much we love each other -- that it's okay to get angry sometimes, but we should try and understand everyone's feelings so that next time nobody will do anything they regret. That's daring storytelling considering the expectation was for something lighter. Absolute kudos to Jonze and Warner Brothers for letting this unique film happen. You don't see movies about childhood as beautiful as this one more than once a blue moon, which is plenty cause for a wild rumpus. ~Steven C</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will you keep out all the sadness? ? Where the Wild Things Are</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is rated PG, but I will say that its dark overtones could be a bit much for really young children. Is it to the point where rumors swirled that it might have been completely re-shot due to Jonze's vision being too scary for its target audience? I don't think so, but buyer be warned anyway. Sendak's book shows a glimpse of temper and anger, a child acting out after not getting what he wants, soon becoming the king of a band of giant monsters looking for direction much like him. These beasts are the manifestations of our sorrow, our frustration, and our demons; they are the voices living within us, kept down by self-control and overcome by happiness and love. However, when those emotions are brought to life, unchecked, the end result can be nothing short of war, retribution, and malice. It becomes the duty of young Max, the creator of this imaginary world, to not only discover the love he has waiting back at home, but also to defeat the anger that has been bubbling to the surface, allowing him to even bite his mother in this cinematic version. We all need some time to let loose and run wild?howling to the moon?it is what we do after the burst of energy subsides that counts. Sometimes looking into a mirror is the only chance we have of becoming the people we should and hope to be.Eggers and Jonze add so much depth to the tale, creating a world and life for Max, (Max Records), to take for granted. His father is, assumingly, deceased; his mother, (Catherine Keener), is busy supporting the family when not trying her best to cultivate Max's imagination and court a new boyfriend, (Mark Ruffalo); and his sister is at the age where acting cool for her friends trumps any remorse or sibling bond with a lonely and tossed aside brother. As KW, (Lauren Ambrose), says later on in the film, "It's hard being a family". Everyone is trying their best and working hard to stick together, but as Judith, (Catherine O'Hara), ponders, "Happiness isn't always the best way to become happy". Loneliness is a huge theme here, and we all face it, even when surrounded by people we live with and cherish. To be able to accept others, one must always be able to accept oneself. This becomes the biggest obstacle for Max to overcome, right alongside his fantastical equal in Carol, (James Gandolfini). The two are kindred spirits, wanting to stay in the past where they remember happier times, throwing tantrums and fits if they don't get their way, unknowingly pushing those they want closer, further away as a result.It is some weighty stuff to deal with for both children and adults alike; a parable that spans all ages with its intrinsic focus on compromise, sharing, and seeing what is right in front of us for the pure gift it can be. Kudos to the filmmakers for never shying away from the darkness that inhabits each and every one of us; when the world begins to crumble, characters get angry, cause destruction, or cower in fright at what may happen next. We all fear the unknown, we all get scared when we see someone we love in trouble, but sometimes we forget that those by our side fear for us too when it is we who are lost. The true success of this story and film lies in the little things, like Alexander, (Paul Dano really adding some feeling to this ram-like beast), and Douglas, (the always wonderful Chris Cooper), knowing the game going on with Max, but trying their best to let the others be happy, even at the detriment of their own joy. Here are the two unselfish creatures in a land of egos. The other "wild things" prop up the film as well, however, in their vocal performances as well as puppetry. If you ever thought that costumed monsters from Jim Henson Studios couldn't make you cry, or at least feel something, you will know they can before the end credits roll.Where the Wild Things Are needs these fantastical beings to have the emotional range of a human being in order to succeed. It also needs young Max Records to bear a large portion of the weight on his shoulders; he is alone on screen with the "wild things" for about eighty percent of the film. I will admit to being pretty confident on the first point, but a bit skeptical on the second after watching the trailer, (how beautiful is that mini-movie with Arcade Fire playing in the background?). However, I was completely wrong about Records, because his innocence is what keeps this tale pure. His childlike expressions of joy and fright are utterly realistic, taking him on a journey inside himself, discovering what it is to grow up and accept responsibility for oneself and those around him. As for the wild bunch of half animals/half humans?they are absolutely brilliant. The art direction is phenomenal and the use of practical effects meshed with CGI, (mostly in the faces), provides a sense of realism that fully computerized beings never could. Heck, even that Karen O soundtrack that I was so disappointed in last week became a magical score that breathed life into this classic story. I truly believe this film will become the treasured piece of art that its source material has. It deserves all the praise it gets for its ability to touch each audience member to the core, without ever preaching. It will touch you on a level so pure that you won't know what hit you, and you'll be remembering it hours afterwards, wanting to find that person you love so as to give them a hug to let them know how important they are to you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Redefining the adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where the Wild Things Are, one of the most beloved children's books, comes to the big screen in one of the most highly anticipated films of the year. Spike Jonze, the man responsible for Being John Malcovich, Adaptation, and several Beastie Boys music videos including "Sabotage", brings the tale to life. I must admit, I have been anxiously awaiting this film for several months, something I don't like to do too often as it sets up for a potential major let down.Well, that didn't happen this time.We follow Max (Max Records), a boy who is lonely and misunderstood. His sister doesn't pay attention to him, his mother is busy with work and her boyfriend, and he has worries at school. All he wants is attention and to belong. One night, he finally breaks and runs away. He makes his way to the woods and to the waters edge. There he finds a small boat and set out on the open sea, leaving everything behind him.He comes across an island and goes ashore. There he finds a group of monsters in turmoil. Max seizes his opportunity and confronts the group. He tells them that he is a great king and help them solve their problems.I don't want to give too much of the story away because I feel like telling it would ruin some of the magic. This is one of the most visually pleasing films I have seen in a long time. Jonze filmed in Australia. We are given vivid landscapes of lush forests, arid deserts, and beautiful shorelines, culminating in an almost Lord of the Rings like experience. These spectacular settings would rarely be beaten in magnificence in another film, but here they come second to the unbelievable special effects used for the monsters.There are seven monsters on the island. Carol, Ira, Judith, KW, Douglas, Alexander, and The Bull. They all have unique features and are of massive size. Jonze could have gone two ways here. He could have completely made them all CG or he could have gone Jim Henson and turned them into Muppets. Instead, he carved a third path and combined the other two options. Max is able to interact extremely well with the gigantic puppet/suits, but the faces are edited with computer graphics, giving them startlingly realistic features and expressions. Making these monsters any different way would have been disastrous.Another key aspect of the monsters is giving them a voice. Jonze chose excellent voice actors with James Gandolfini, Forrest Whitaker, Catherine O'Hara, Lauren Ambrose, Paul Dano, and Chris Cooper. They each have their own personality that compliments their physical and emotional characteristics.Aside from the monsters, I was very impressed with Max. He is asked to do a very demanding thing: be a kid. That sounds easy, but it is very easily messed up. I'm interested in finding out how much freedom Jonze gave Records in certain scenes that called for him to go "wild". I can imagine directing young actors is not the easiest thing to do, but sometimes you catch a break when you get a talented one.Giving life to these characters is a spectacular screenplay by Jonze and Dave Eggers (who wrote Away We Go). Their writing speaks to both kids and adults, using language that is meaningful and easy to understand. The things Max goes through every child feels growing up: loneliness, fear, belonging, etc.There is so much to love about this movie. It speaks to the heart. But before you head out with the whole family, heed this warning. Some parts of this film might be too intense for younger audience members. Certain scene involving the monsters might be a bit too overwhelming. Yes, these monsters are friendly, but they are monsters, meaning they are large, intimidating, and somewhat scary.Where the Wild Things Are will satisfy, entertain, and open your eyes. Spike Jonze poured everything he had into this film and the wait was well worth it. I hope you will fall under its spell just as I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure nonsense and the main character is neurotic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember reading the book that was the basis for this movie when I was a child. It looked like a fun book for a kid when I looked at the cover illustration but when I read it, it came across as silly nonsense that I soon found boring. Now warranted most kids books of that nature are written for the under 10 set and usually full of funny goofy stuff but to me the book was not full of the fun kind of imagination or silliness rather a weird dull boring daydream , especially the child wearing the ridiculous wolf costume - where it came from and why he had it is not explained in the book. Now on to the review of the film.I caught this movie when I was in a club this past weekend that shows movies in the back area, usually the newest DVD releases. It was free so I figured why not watch. The movie is one big long mess. Max is not like he is in the book, rather than being portrayed as a mischievous daydreamer, he comes across as a neurotic schizophrenic who suffers from ADD and multiple personality disorders,he also looks like he's on drugs half the time. In the movie's opening prologue he chases his dog around and grabs it by the neck and jerks it around while growling and wearing the stupid wolf costume -whoa now that was disturbing.He looks as if he's going to break the dogs neck. Then a whole story of feeling ignored from his mother and sister which seems to cause his bizarre behavior and drives him to bite his mother and run away , this after standing on the kitchen table and exclaiming to his mother "Feed me woman" which totally embarrasses the mothers bf. Evidently the boy feels that since he has no father anymore(I can't remember if his parents are divorced or the father died) , he feels jealousy and is also to me selfish of his mothers feelings ,wanting her attention all the time. He even trashes his sisters room , I will sympathize with him there, a scene in the film has him in what starts out as a fun snowball fight with some of his sisters male friends, however it turns serious when he tries to hide in an igloo and the larger boys jump on it ,almost crushing him.They watch him cry and walk away -barely even caring whether or not he got hurt His sister does not even run over to make sure that he is OK , she simply shrugs in annoyance and rides off in the car with them.I thought that the reworking of the story in this way was unnecessary. It made it seem mean spirited and basically turning it into a neglected child feel sorry for him rather than a typical naughty 10 y/o who gets punished for chasing the dog around and basically being a brat. Max is a really scary child in this movie. I don't know why the producer and writers made him a little nut-job. The monsters on the island are nothing more than large Muppet like creations and I soon felt like I was watching an episode of the Muppet show. It plods and drags and you want it to just end already. Most of the dialog is utter nonsense ,even for a child -to say lets build a fort and then a robot and then lets make a TV that shoots rockets that will serve us ice cream. Where did they come up with this crap. I cant imagine any kids over the age of 8 that would find any of it amusing or even interesting. By the time the movie ends and he goes back home , you feel like you just sat out in the woods watching the grass grow for an hr and 40 minutes.I don't understand all these awards and such for it - it seems that a lot of really bad movies come across as creative or inspiring or that its such a wonderful storytelling thing when to me its utter nonsense and stupid. 1 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review For "Where The Wild Things Are"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Running Time: An hour and a half MPAA Rating: PG Max is angry. He is imaginative and rambunctious, but he has no control. He knows that, like the sun, one day his energy will run out and he'll fade away. These are difficult thoughts for a young boy who already has the dilemmas of his age to deal with. Many people learn to cope with life's troubles in their own way, and Max does so by becoming a wild thing.The movie adds some unique elements to the original Maurice Sendak storybook. Max's behavior is given a cause and his trip into the land of the wild things is given a purpose. Each of the creatures has a unique personality derived from Max's experiences with people in his homeland. Carol (played by James Gandolfini), whose anarchic and misunderstood nature Max immediately identifies with, specifically seems to provide the boy a means for coming to terms with the father now missing from his life.What really brings this film to life is the music. Written by Karen O (of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs), the songs provide a youthful vigor that complements the action on screen. It was built from scratch for the movie and great use within each context shows. Energetic tracks filled with wild instrumentation and playground yells lend credence to the playful scenes in the movie, and Karen O's soft vocals fit in perfectly with the sentimental points.Book purists won't be pleased to learn the extent of added material, of course, but may find comfort in the heavy involvement of the original author in the making of this film. Spike Jonze was specifically given the permission of the author, who had previously seen and highly regarded his work. Although this film does take much of the mystery and imagination out of the hands of the viewer, Sendak has given his personal approval of the interpretation after viewing the final product.In the end, this movie wasn't quite what it could have been. It loses some of its steam toward the middle, when certain scenes feel as though they've been drawn out as long as possible to give the movie a bump to above the acceptable hour and a half mark. There are more shaky-cam running scenes in the film than an episode of "24", which could have easily become redundant and intolerable had it not been for the expressive and enthralling soundtrack. Fortunately, the movie manages to work as presented, and members of the audience may be inspired to search out the wild things within themselves once more.The easily queasy should be warned; much of this movie is shot by hand-held camera, leading to what has become known as the "shaky-cam" effect. This can work out of some viewers' favor, but shouldn't provide a problem for the majority of audience members.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Gritty, Weighty, and All the Same Childlike...Pure Sendak!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maurice Sendak, who recently passed away, was one of the most controversial yet still imaginative authors to ever have been published. The stories he wrote are very much like Grimm's Fairy Tales: whimsical and fun, but still dark and threatening. He didn't pander or sugarcoat his stories simply because he didn't feel a need (as well as a rather unpleasant childhood that introduced him to mortality in a less gentle light than most kids, but that's another story). These come through in such books as 1981's Outside Over There, 1970's In the Night Kitchen, and, in the case of this review, 1963's Where the Wild Things Are.The funny thing about the latter is that this book is only 9 sentences long! That's a short book, even by children's standards, despite the story being told more with pictures than words. So, naturally, director Spike Jonze and writer Dave Eggers had to go out on a limb with the extra effort if they were to successfully make a movie based on it. The effort is an interesting and impressive venture; No embellishment, no sugarcoating, just a stripped- down, but still whimsical tale of a child's curiosity and imagination.The story is pretty much the same: Max, (Max Records, believably a kid), an imaginative, but frustrated kid gets into a fight with his stressed-out mother (Catherine Keener), runs away, and soon finds himself floating to a strange land, wherein dwell creatures that are both terrifying and fascinating at the same time. It's a simple story, but, as said before, they get across a lot with what they have.The performances in this movie are stellar. Max Records plays Max as...well, a kid. He doesn't pander to the audience or become cloying and 'pwe-shuss' at any point in the movie. He's angry, bratty, imaginative, playful, greedy, attention-seeking, kind and all those other things a normal kid is. This doesn't make him a bad person, but it does make him humble and endearing when coming across what he sees and experiences with the titular "Wild Things." Speaking of which, these creatures not only look great, but are also something of (which has been made abundantly clear by most of the critics, but it's still there) a representation of Max himself. Take the imposing, but enthusiastic Carol (James Gandolfini, aka Tony Soprano), for instance. He's Max's pent-up frustration, creativity and longing for love. Loudmouth Judith (Catherine O'Hara, a scene stealer) is Max's brazen independence. Gentle Ira (Forest Witaker), is Max's artistic ideals. Shy Alexander (Little Miss Sunshine's Paul Dano) is Max's longing to be heard, as well as his fragile na?veté. And the gentle KW (Lauren Ambrose) is the feeling of maternity that Max has not felt from his own mother in a long, long time. Once he discovers these fragments and puts them together, he realizes that there is more love to be had at home than he realized. The visuals in this movie are also great. The place where the island is doesn't have any magical places aside from the Wild Things themselves, but its full of trees, dirt and desert plains that are barren and empty. But, it's what they do with it that makes it impressive. They have huts made of branches, a dirt clod fight, long walks along the desert, and even the building of a huge hut. It's so massive, just like an imagination.The only problem with this movie is that it can gets pretty depressing at times. It's probably supposed to be pushing boundaries, as the original book did, but the conversations, dialogue and themes can become quite weighty, and brings the movie to a grinding halt. This is especially true towards the end, when Carol becomes more and more savage, and tensions rise between Max and the Wild Things. But, that being said, it does give the movie some conflict and raises the stakes for Max's safe return home, despite his strong bond with these creatures.Overall, this movie is, like the book, a portrait of childhood at its core. There's no talking down to the audience, but at the same time, it's more for nostalgic adults than kids. But, the adults that enjoyed the book will enjoy what Jones, Egger, Sendak, and this movie have to say. It also looks beautiful, with fantastic sets, creatures, and characters to ogle at. There's so much love and detail put into this movie that all that can be said is...well...I'd eat this movie up, I love it so...even though Roger Ebert beat me to that, it's still true.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the fondly remembered, cherished work I expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't imagine for whom this film was made. Adults (except those few deviants who are into the "furry" thing) typically do not enjoy animated stuffed animals bemoaning adult problems while pretending to be child-like monsters. Children cannot understand, nor should they, the sexual frustrations of communal life. This film presents both, in such a context as to negate all ages from watching it.Max is not a "disobedient" child. He's a misunderstood terror who only needs his mother to communicate with him in order to behave himself. She's got men over and is drinking and not even saying, "Oh son, I've invited someone over. There will be alcohol. Perhaps you would like to take your dinner in your room?" He is put in one awkward situation after another by a selfish and self-centered mother, and is expected to just deal with it. Frankly, I don't know what kind of mother Spike Jonez had, but if this film is any indication, I don't care to meet her.This entire work was done from a perspective of a sexually frustrated individual who is not only jealous of his mate, but of everything and everyone around him to the point of not being able to live a productive life. This wasn't fun. It wasn't amusing. I was not entertained. It's troubling, confusing for children, confusing for adults (as in WTF?), and overall pretty pathetic.This isn't worth your time. Sad, really. This should have been something magical.It rates nothing from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did crack-addicted toddlers direct this movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched it last night with my husband and son, and all three of us were completely disturbed by it. Maybe I missed the symbolism, but I hated it and found it so confusing. Without a doubt it was the worst movie I have ever seen.The kid (Max) had something friggin wrong with his head. He was insane! He would go from happy, to crying, to yelling, to breaking things, to bored, to PLAYING WITH HIS MOM'S FOOT (wtf), and he always had a weird look on his face. And his mom was too busy with work and bringing her "friend" over to notice her son was a mental case. Max is destructive and bratty and needed some serious mental help. Everything about him was so depressing.As soon as he enters his little monster world, the story jumps all over the place and a bunch of random, semi-violent, unfollowable things happen. I thought if I watched it all the way through, it would end happy and it would start making sense, but it didn't! It was just awful. If you want to take your kids to see a happy movie, don't choose this one. It was boring, depressing and made no sense.The directors of this garbage-dump need a slap in the head for destroying such a wonderful children's book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where the boring and depressed things are</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Incredible that so many people have well received this film -- it is long, dark both in visual terms -- but even worse, it is dark in emotional terms. "Where the wild things are" turns out to be a place where the animals/monsters are all passive/aggressive depressives. How do you take one of the best visualized children's stories that has only a couple of hundred words of text into a feature length movie? Answer: you don't. For whatever whimsy the book contains, it is distorted into a singular, overlong and morose personal version. I found the angst of the characters to be completely unengaging and most of all boring -- as did my four year old. Fantastic Mr. Fox is an incredible contrast -- wonderfully visualized with sufficient intellectual content to carry a feature length film -- and most importantly, upbeat and positive in outlook. The monsters in "Where the wild things are" really are analogues for unhappy, bitter adults with deep emotional problems -- YUCK!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sad Max</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I have a vision of eight-year-olds leaving the movie in bewilderment. Why are the creatures so unhappy?" ? David Denby from the New YorkerI'll start by admitting that I had very high expectations for "Where the Wild Things Are." Though I loved the book as a child I never developed a particular attachment to it. Rather, I was impressed with the audacity of the concept of adapting such a short story into a feature length film, though including a version of Arcade Fire's brilliant "Wake Up" in the preview certainly didn't hurt. I had a mixed reaction to the movie ? in terms of quality I found it to be the utterly lopsided. The first half it all the right notes, eloquently capturing a child's perspective and achieving a perfect balance between the wonder of the creatures and the setting and the underlying layer of sadness. For an hour "Where the Wild Things Are" is a masterpiece. The second half, unfortunately, scraps everything but the sadness. The creatures cease to be interesting. The charm and humor disappear. I understand that Spike Jonze is trying to say something deep and meaningful about leaving childhood, understanding the limits of imagination, and learning the difficulty of pleasing other people, but the point is as subtle as a charging rhino. I haven't seen this much moping since Hayden Christianson in Attack of the Clones. It's like halfway through the production Spike Jonze left to be replaced by Thom Yorke.The best part of the film is the first fifteen seconds. We see Max (Max Records) in his wolf-pajama costume chasing a dog around the house, and the movie pauses on a blurred close-up on his face. It's a delightful moment. Let me say something about Max Records. He's absolutely amazing in this film. He crawls, runs, and speaks the way a child would. Watch him wield his staff as king, or listen to how he explains his unlimited powers. Even when the rest of the film doesn't work Max Records is always in top form. Jonze's chief accomplishment is in capturing Max's point of view. As he crawls around an 'igloo' he build at the start of the story, the camera is close enough to make us feel like we're inside of it, too.The introduction of the 'wild things' works just as well. The creatures are magnificent creations. They are CGI-enhanced giant puppets, but never for a second do we question their physical existence. They are alternately amusing, sympathetic, and scary. Max proclaims himself a king, dons a crown, and the fun begins. There's a delightful sequence where the wild things jump all over the place, eventually landing in a huge pile in perhaps the most magnificent effect in the movie, which is significant praise as every special effect looks great.The setting is impressive. The cliffs and trees of the island dwarf Max. The island fades into a desert where an old English sheepdog wanders for no apparent reason. It's a great effect. The fort that Max has the wild things build is awing and creative, as is the miniature city constructed by wild thing Ira (voiced by James Gandolfini).Jonze imbues these early scenes with some significant dramatic elements as well. Max throws an tantrum early in the film, and it feels appropriate. Curiously, the wild things start off with problems of their own. They're an unhappy, bickering bunch who've apparently eaten all of their past kings.Max decides to organize a 'good guys' v 'bad guys' fight, an obviously awful idea that, once again, feels appropriately in character, but it's here that the film starts to fall apart. The fight, though fun (and visually spectacular) goes out of hand. Many of the wild things become angry or hurt. Fine. It's just that the wild things whine incessantly. Everyone's mad off all the time. Ira destroys his own model city. Max fears for his life. One wild thing's arm gets ripped off. I'm serious about that. The sadness is so over-the-top that it approaches parody. It gets tiring. The most egregious scene occurs when the wild things ask Max to prove his powers and act disenchanted when he cannot. The problem is that whole sequence is beside the point. The wild things aren't supposed to be rational beings who question that sort of thing. The effect is devastating to Max and the viewer. When he leaves his motivation seems to stem less from homesickness or character development than from simply wanting to get away from these angry monsters. We get the impression that everyone has had a rather miserable time. We sure have.Maurice Sendak has praised Spike Jonze's film for keeping the essence of the material and expanding upon it. I disagree. I think the first half did that but that the second half was overfilled with boring character conflict. Two things were continuously phenomenal: Max Records' performance and the special effects. Once again, I understand the point of the darkness. "Where the Wild Things Are" is meant to be a multilayered, bittersweet story. Jonze was on the right track for a while but the essence of childhood captured so well early was replaced with waves of depression. Childhood can be sad. Jonze knows this and relates that fact well with Max's early tantrum. Pleasing everyone is difficult. Max learns that. Again and again and again and again and again. The simple fact is that this film's wild things have serious emotional issues far in excess of what the story requires.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>this movie sucked, did not tie together</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a child i remember reading "Where the wild things are" many, many times. When i discovered that there was a movie in production, i couldn't wait to see it.. i even followed it on twitter! After watching the movie, i can say that i am deeply disappointed with it. What a major letdown! Firstoff, i'd like to say that this movie did not follow the book! i understand the book was short, but come on, at least it kinda made sense! this movie is possibly the worst movie i've ever seen! i was sitting in the theater with my friends, who were all fans of the book, and we were all lost halfway through the movie!I found quite a few flaws with the plot of the movie: Not all the monsters are as wild as max himself, Carol's model of the island did not actually match the island, when Carol's face is stepped on, it's a big deal, but when he pulls off Douglas's' arm, it's no biggie, Max never solves any of the monsters problems by the time he leaves, in fact, he makes it worse, why didn't the monsters respond after Max made the snow fall after doing his dance, it is never explained what Carol has against Terry and Bob, or why he can't hear them, it is also never explained what is going on between Carol and K.W., also, unlike the book, the movie doesn't accurately portray Max's personality, it is never explained why don't the monsters try and eat Max when he was one of the worst kings the ever had, what's the big deal with a king's secret chamber, and finally: WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH THE GIANT English SHEEPDOG?!? In one part of the movie, you can even see someone's fenced-off estate, I THOUGHT THIS ISLAND WAS SUPPOSED TO BE WILD!!! This movie sucked... i want an hour and a half of my life back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where I blew my two hours was in the theater seeing this. I really didn't take to this movie much. The opening was okay with the little song and all. But after that it pretty much went downhill fast. The kid Max is just portrayed as a spoiled brat and it's too bad he's not likable. He just gets on your nerves. You just don't want to spend time in this kid's illusion world.Aside from that, the monsters were too goofy to be scary, and not even goofy enough to be funny. The voices the monsters had were mostly bad and took me out of it. Also, the mother was not very good actress and neither was anyone else, really. It was just really not a good movie, except for the first five minutes. I'd say skip it unless you absolutely love the book and can't stop yourself, but otherwise not recommended. 2/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't read the book, but I thought the movie was going to be something like the "Labyrinth" or "The Never Ending Story." What a letdown, absolutely nothing happened! The main character was highly annoying and remained that way throughout the entire movie. Was the boy supposed to be Autistic or have some other condition? That is the only way to explain zero character development. Also, all of the boy's interactions with the monsters were completely meaningless. He didn't help them or make them better off. Completely pointless.The monsters looked like actors in costumes. With movies like "Avatar" and "A Christmas Carol" coming out the same year with superb visual effects, you can't give the audience Sesame Street characters. FAIL.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Has All The Makings Of A Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Max is a little boy (10 yr old, I think) and he is a loner, as in he doesn't have any friends and he wants to play games with his sister, who's a teenager and doesn't have time for Max. Max builds an igloo and his sister's friends destroy it while fooling around and he is very sad and angry, so he wrecks his sister's room as she doesn't do anything about it and goes with them ignoring him. His mom is sweet and she cares for him and loves him very much. When she has her friend over, Max behaves recklessly and bites her. She is angry and shouts at him as to what is wrong with him, and that's when Max runs away from the home in his wolf costume. He boards a small boat, goes to sleep and when he wakes up it is night and he is in a strange magical island where the animals can talk and they behave socially. Through a turn of events, he befriends Carol and the storyteller that he is, tells tall tales of him being a king and defeating the Vikings, so as to avoid being eaten by the animals. The animals need a king and believe he has magical powers and that he could bring happiness to their lives. He has good times and bad times with them, but through Carol and K.W's lives, he realizes that he needs his mom now more than ever and comes back home to his worried mom.This a wonderful and magical film about friendship and relationships. The director, Spike Jonze doesn't tell if the world Max visited is real or whether it was all in his head, because frankly the adults will know and the children will be thinking that the island and its inhabitants are real. I liked the way that the film was made. It wasn't completely filled with CGI animals, real people dressed up as animals and minimal CGI effects made this film very real to me. Max Records gave a beautiful performance as Max, even the voice actors and the animal suit actors gave good performances. It had to be expected as the voice cast consists of James Gandolfini, Catherine O' Hara, Forest Whitaker and others. Catherine Keener is a very talented actress, but is given a limited role here, which she does justice to. The music scored by Carter Burwell is amazing and gels so beautifully with the story, that you can't but nod your head along the tunes. I became a fan of Carter Burwell from Twilight and he doesn't disappoint with this one. The humming tune of the little kid is still playing in my head :) There is a scene where Carol is taking Max to his favourite place and on the desert Max sees a gigantic dog and Carol advises Max to just ignore it, and if he fed it, it will just follow around; that was hilarious. This film brought back memories of my childhood, when I ran away from home to go to Aladdin's land to get a wish from the genie, and getting scared that I didn't know my way back home when I was hungry and didn't know where I was going with no money. It was a nightmare back then, but now its turned into a sweet memory which I had almost forgotten.Moving on, this has all the makings of a classic. Try seeing this at least once and you will definitely fall in love with Max and the creatures. But, be forewarned, this isn't a Disney film, there are plenty of dark, terrifying moments and little children will definitely be scared by it and some older ones will probably find it boring as this isn't filled with laugh out loud moments or eye-popping CGI effects. As for 20 yr old me, this was a good entertaining film which had a lot of heart.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A painfully boring and meaningless film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this at the dollar theater with my wife and 9 yr old daughter over the Christmas holiday while school was out. We had fully intended to go see the movie shortly after it was released. After hearing so-so reviews we were a little hesitant but still wanted to see it, but it just never happened. Boy am I glad now that we never got around to it earlier. Was there a point to this film other than the fact that our society no longer views reasonable discipline or supervision of children by parents to be an expected practice?I want my dollar back, but even more important, I want my 101 minutes back! Just Awful!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The kids book was great.The movie is terrible for kids and adults, and just weird.Nothing but a bunch of monsters bickering, fighting, and arguing about their problems in a very serious and aggressive tone. You're better off watching some lame reality show like the "Real World" than you are watching this. Definitely not for kids at all. It really is a depressing show overall. One of the only films I probably ever regret having watched. Not only a waste of time, but seems to really put the idea into my kids heads that fighting is normal, and how to deal with problems.Even without all that, as the other reviewers put it, you're not really even sure what the show is trying to say--It's all over the place.Do yourself a favor and read your kids the book instead!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst Movie Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>See, I didn't want to go into Where the Wild Things Are with any premonitions. I read reviews by people that all pointed towards the "this movie is garbage" category, but they mostly related to it not being good for kids. Seeing as how it has been many years since I was a kid,the reviews that mentioned the word Oscar were the ones that appealed to me. When someone starts saying that Spike Jonze should be nominated for an Oscar, I might give a little listen. After all, I like some of his videos and love his films. The guy seems to have a great way with camera and especially mood on camera.Allow me to set the record straight. Where the Wild Things Are was the worst film I have ever seen. Imagine if you took all the joy out of a children's book, made every character a indie emotional tool, put a kid with no acting talent at the forefront and combined it with a horrible score and soundtrack and there you have WTWTA.First, there was nothing good about this film. The cinematography was only palatable. There was a dimness and desolation set with the light and cameras in the beginning that looked promising, but as I was treated to a wide-eyed, indie-haircut, effeminate looking boy with emotional problems brought on by his being a pain, I couldn't help but wonder if I had just wasted my money. I did waste it because the movie went nowhere from there.What followed was a whining kid running away to a place where the most boring creatures ever exist, whose only purpose is to sit sullenly at intervals in the movie so that Max can go console them yet not offer one good word of advice. Seriously there was no point to this movie. How it has at the time of this blog a 8.1 rating on is pretty simple. Indie-hipsters were going to jump on this like flies on mess because anything stolen from a different time is cool to them and WTWTA is that (referring to the book of course), and they saw previews for the movie with the same things that are appealing to the hipster mindset (Arcade Fire song played over preview, shots of kid wearing 80's outdoor clothing, the outdoors which are appealing to every hipster, and orange and brown hues of sunset which are mainstays in all videos trying to appeal to hipsters) so they went on IMDb and insisted this was a great movie before it even came out. Does this make them bad? No, they genuinely wanted this movie to be good, and since hipsters are perpetual children, I bet some were disappointed. The others just convinced themselves it was good no matter what, because that is what many of us do when we really want to enjoy something.Oh but no, the hipsters are not to blame for this movie being bad. If anything they have the most right to be angry, because this movie was targeted at them and many of them will still see it just because they refuse to believe it can be bad.This movie is of no importance. It has no meaning. Rarely do I want to leave a movie so soon after it has started hoping something good will happen. Nothing good ever happens. This movie made me want to walk out without even knowing what would happen. The characters have no redeeming qualities whatsoever and this is all on Dave Eggers, another writer in that whole gen-x wanna-be hipster genre that David Sedaris has so r@peed minds with. This guy has always been an over-rated lout and this story only solidifies that. I would like someone to tell me how anyone could enjoy a film where characters talk about happiness but never quite define what it is other than it being gone. Oooh, lets give them humanistic names to be even more clever!!!! Oh and the soundtrack? F*King sucked. Dumb b1tch from Yeah Yeah Yeahs sucks, has always sucked, will always suck and it was yet another worm to dangle for the hipsters having her do the soundtrack.I mean, I could not imagine a movie sucking this much. If you see it and you like it, you are an idiot. If you see it and don't hate it, you are an idiot. I forever lose respect for Spike Jonze, Katherine Keener, Katherine O'Hara, James Gandolfini and others for being part of this film. I will judge people by this movie. Because if you liked it, you are full of sh1t and stupid. Maybe a movie shouldn't be such a judge of such things but this one was that bad.Worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. Period.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was so bad that it forced me to write my first review on IMDb in hopes of preventing others from wasting time and money on this trash. Way to much violence! The behavior of MAX should not be laughed at. How can this be funny or entertaining? Basically biting, screaming, shaking and breaking everything he touched. Maybe if it was just a scene or two to setup his character, but I'm telling you every scene in the movie had to do with violence and disturbing behavior. I left the movie scratching my head and very confused. There has to be a better way of telling this story in a more entertaining way. Not funny, not cute, not even close to being a little bit entertaining. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE!!! and especially DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE WITH YOUR KIDS!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Depressing, overlong and uninspiring...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really looking forward to see this film, and from the trailers it seemed like such a fun, light hearted childhood adventure - just like I remembered from the book I read over and over again when I was a kid. I also have Being John Malckovich listed as one of my favorite films ever, and seeing how Where the Wild Things Are comes from the same director - you can imagine just how pumped I was.However, the movie itself was rather depressing and uninspiring. This could have easily been a short film, and instead it felt like it just dragged on and on. The kid who played Max was cute, but he couldn't get any real emotions out of me. He just seemed so sad all the time, and that just doesn't seem right for a would-be entertaining fantasy film. Also, once he arrived at the island, it just seemed like the movie started to drag. Many Wild Things were underused and had little to none characterizations. The ones that were prominent on screen weren't as inspiring or uplifting as I wanted them to be. Instead of being Wild Things, they were just angry and gloomy.So yeah, I know this was all meant as a metaphor to what was going on in Max's life in the real world. However, it didn't have the justification of being so long and cumbersome, and being outright depressing. Movies for kids are supposed to make you feel good about yourself at the end, not make you want to stick a bullet in your head...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie lacked the humor, life, playfulness, imagination, and other human emotions. Max should have been betrayed as a regular brat boy at the age of 7 or 8. I always liked wolves, and thought that a boy would like them too. If you like symbolism, he could a lone wolf. The book also uses words in a playful manner. For example, Max tells his mother in a playful but mischievous way, "I'll eat you up." In the book, the mother and son, seemed to have a great relationship, but Max was just acting like any kid would. When disciplined he imagines going to the wild things, which he treats just like his mother treated him. His parents didn't have any "dramas" in their lives as this movie portrayed, but he was reacting as any kid would when they are not getting their own way. Kids also tend to copy their parents' behavior, which was done nicely in the book, but not in the movie. Max's stomach started to growl, which made him want to go back home. Also in the book, he felt lonely and knew his mother loved him, which made him leave the wild things. The movie didn't show this at all. Becoming a king was also meaningful because all kids dream about being a king, queen, prince, or princess. The wild things were supposed to be his friends, and part of Max's mind, for they also said, "we love you so, we could just eat you up." This is also what adults say when they think a kid is cute, and Max probably heard that from adults. I would have rather seen a scene with that in the human world than the other added crap they included in this movie. The monsters bored me and were completely lifeless. Basically, Max was unbelievable, and crazy; which made the wild things unbelievable and crazy too. The characters that were added, were not necessary. The director should have spent the time expanding on the ideas included in the book instead of adding unnecessary and confusing situations that destroyed the heart of the story and the moral values that made the book a children's classic. I felt bored, let down, sad-hopeless, confused, and bewildered at the storyline/plot. What was the point of it all? How did the story become so complex? The simplicity of the book made it enjoyable for children and adults. The director tried to make a reason for Max's behavior to make the story more interesting, but it just made it into a movie that do one could relate to nor enjoy. Come on, really? What was the reason for Max's behavior? He was a kid. Just that. His mom? Just a mom. No adult 'dramas.' My suggestion is to just read the book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spike Jonze conjures a bizarre, disjointed film with one deadly element: interminable boredom</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's not much to add to the complaints regarding this so-called film amid the numerous negative "Hated It" reviews. However, I agree on one thing: this film is so disjointed and aimless it's "unbelievably" boring.I will begin with speculating on Spike Jonze's style and how his pretentious, self-important film-making attitude marred the adaptation of the film.First, how can Maurice Sendak approve of this film as a creative consultant and producer? He should be a lot more critical on the pacing and story structure of the film rather than collaborate with Jonze, co-screenwriter Dave Eggers, and other producers with his "seal of approval" irrespective of the final outcome. Tom Hanks as a producer in addition to four producing credits (including Sendak) seems like an unnecessary resume-padding, as well as lending a degree of "importance" to the film.Second, Spike Jonze felt so passionate about the adaptation of the classic, simple story that he and Eggers felt the story should be expanded into a very long, interminable feature film. This is where total creative control becomes expedient, at the director's insistence and his decisions supported by the producers who were impressed with his previous -- meaningless and equally pretentious -- films, to a disastrous result.Warner Bros. studio executives signed $100 million check to Jonze and his producing team, and they received what appeared to be a yawn-inducing, pretentious, and structurally disjointed tripe. There were the rumors of Warner Bros.'s anxiety that led to re-shooting part of the film which may have caused the year-long release delay.The film would work as a 40 or 50-minute short. Which should be tight in pacing and structure, and to the point.However, Jonze, Eggers, and the producers felt the story must be told through extensive expansion of the much shorter, classic down-to-earth story. So they worked on the script, Jonze directs, and what is the outcome of the final theatrical cut? An interminably overlong (over 85 minutes), frustratingly meandering, and occasionally depressing movie with the least sympathetic character portrait of the main protagonist Max.Because my frustration at the plodding pace amid non-existent "story" became intolerable after 30-minute mark, I fast forwarded and skipped to the final scenes with Max departing as the monsters wept and the artistic-silent ending.It is mind-numbingly boring, because Jonze chose to make it that way in a deliberate attempt to make one of the most expensive art movies, which negates the overall enjoyment of the movie.The rule is that, if the filmmakers choose to deliberately disrespect the audience by making the film interminably long and boring, not to mention pointlessly meandering and indulgent, the audiences' response will be generally negative by sleeping throughout the film's run or vacating the seats early and subpar word of mouth spread that dilute box office in-take.Spike Jonze doesn't care what anyone thought of this film in negative or unflattering terms. He cares about elevating his status as an avant-garde artist, general audiences be damned. Interestingly, he was once married to Sofia Coppola, whose film Lost in Translation earned my derision as the worst movie of 2003 for similar reason -- pretentious, tedious, and aimless.Good artists know how to make films that are riveting in story and pacing besides production values. Bad artists know how to make films that are perpetually self-indulgent to satisfy one's interpretation of cinema, in original or adapted storytelling.Jonze, who prides in total creative control without much input or consideration for the audience and box office appeal, laughs at those who criticize the film for its snail-pace and convoluted &amp; incoherent structure. It is about applying the layer of his "high-grade" artistic vision to the simple and concise children's story.The only justification for the film's existence with Jonze's style is when it's pared down to a tautly edited short, 45 minutes or less, with many of the absurdly extraneous scenes in the theatrical cut jettisoned. Jonze had made numerous shorts, and he took the route of adapting a simple short story following David Fincher's bloated, overdirected adaptation The Curious Case of Benjamin Button.They may be talented in slick visual arts, but when it comes to nailing story structure with even pacing, they often fail to impress despite the pretension of elevating the film to an art film status reflective of their "self-important artist" ego.The theatrical version would be suitable for exhibition in art-house theatres, because that's where unnecessarily long, weird, and pretentious films are generally shown rather than at the megaplex where parents, fond of nostalgia when their parents told them Sendak's stories at bedtime, dragged their children to "Where the Wild Things Are," only to discover it's an agonizing movie-going experience for their otherwise 'energetic' children.Jonze achieved cinema art by the essence of flipping the bird to the audience with what makes for a truly boring film experience that inspire the worst response imaginable to the filmmakers short of walkout: numbed butt on the cushioned seat, comfortable sleeping, conversations, fiddling with illuminated cell phone, and checking the watch."Where the Wild Things Are," despite spectacular f/x and pretty cinematography, cannot be justified for its absurd length in conjunction with trying to remain awake to follow the messy structure of a story with some embarrassingly stilted dialogue.Ideal for inducing oneself to good night's sleep by forced viewing of the film after a long day at work, school or somewhere. It is that stupefyingly boring.1/2 out of 4</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had serious misgivings about seeing this film. A remake of a short film of a children's book is asking for trouble. My mother wanted me to go with her. The cinema was packed with children. I thought I was in for screaming, fidgeting and Nintendos for 90 minutes. Luckily for me most of the children and then my mother were asleep after 25-minutes. Some stories are designed to remain on paper and never make the transition to celluloid. This is one of them. The physical make up of the characters were good but in the end this film is devoid of any real substance. Another piece of self indulgent Hollywood over-CGI'd offal shortly to be consigned to the bottom of the Marianas Trench of film making. I'll give it 1 for the characters and 1 for putting nearly everyone in the cinema to sleep. Avoid.</fullReview>

Look at the director's list of work - largely music videos and low-brow 'youth culture' entertainment...mm. The journey the film takes you on is meaningless, self-obsessed, narcissistic, violent, depressive nonsense. To add to that as it's not enough of a comment, the opening scene shows the boy violently chasing the family dog and terrorising it with a fork. Not only did this put me off the director it also put me off the boys character. I spent the film thinking, this lad is a selfish terror. His loving caring mum was no better feeding him cake and sympathy when he'd acted outrageously and not even apologised to her. Just how ego-fulled kids expect to be treated these days.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie sucks for the following reasons: 1. Max, the main character, comes off as a bratty, impulsive, manic child. I think he's a child anyway. For the first 30 minutes of the movie he growls more than he speaks. Perhaps this type of crazy is normal for a young boy, but I've never been one so I can't relate to his roller coaster emotions or behaviors. 2. It seems that "having a plot" was left off the list of things to put in this movie. Here's a quick rundown. The whole adventure begins when Max gets angry, growls, then bites his mother. (See, he IS part animal) He runs away and sails to the island where the wild things are. We first see one of the wild things, in a fit of rage, destroying the wild things' houses/huts. Why is he doing this? Who knows. After watching for awhile Max decides to do some house wrecking himself and runs out and begins destroying the huts too. The wild things are first a bit intrigued by him, then decide to eat him. Max tells them that they can't eat him because he's a king, and they believe him. So now we know they're wild and not too bright either. As king, Max has ideas about building a big fort (yawn) and having him and the wild things sleep in a big pile on each other (??) Things don't go according to plan because the wild things have their own issues of jealousy, hurt, anger, and disappointment between each other. Then they find out he isn't really a king and one of the wild things threatens to eat him. This, coupled with the chaotic state of affairs on the island, pushes Max to do what he does best when things aren't going his way, run away. He gets back in his boat and goes home. He walks in and hugs his mother; no words are said. The end. This leads us to number 3. Why is there no resolution to the conflicts in this movie? Max never confronts the issues that led him to run away in the first place and the wild things are left just as dysfunctional (if not more so) than when Max first met them. So we have no plot, mixed in with scenes of Max walking through bare sand lands with the wild things, and no resolution. This movie did, however, highlight one important fact of life. One must always have a plan of escape to use in case things in life get a bit dicey. Sure, confronting your raging emotions will probably lead to a better outcome in the future but it's just so much easier to simply run away, physically or emotionally. In addition to always having a plan of escape, it is imperative that you have someone else to blame for all your shortcomings and failures when escape isn't an option. This wasn't mentioned in the movie but it's good advice none the less. Arm yourself with these two things and you'll always have an easy way out of a situation. Overall, this movie was extremely boring.</fullReview>

The upset Max wets Claire's room with snow and then he does not obey his mother and bites her. He runs away home wearing his wolf costume and mentally travels to an imaginary world inhabited with wild things that elect the boy their king.I have tried to watch "Where the Wild Things Are" for three nights, but I slept in all attempts. Today I tried for the fourth time and guess what happened? Once again I slept. When I woke up, I decided to try again and I finally succeeded. What an awfully boring and overrated film this crap is! What is its target regarding audiences, adults or children? I believe neither adults nor children will enjoy this annoying and pointless film.

Everyone just hates each other and no one ever learns to be happy.The movie "A Bridge to Taribitha" was sad, but it wasn't the same kind of sad you feel at the end of "Where the Wild Things Are". I would not recommend this movie to any one. Kids have enough in their lives that can leave them sad or upset, the very least a movie can do is show them that there is some hope in the end.

		<fullReview>I have no idea what movie all those other people watched - the ones who gave it 3 stars and above - but I can say with the strongest conviction that it wasn't the same movie I watched.OK, 1st thing you have to know is this - I have been a fan of the book for as long as I can remember (over 40 years). The minute I heard about the film, I couldn't stop saying how excited I was. Then I heard Spike Jonze was doing it and the excitement level dropped. I then saw a video showing Maurice Sendak commenting on how he LOVED the movie and the excitement level went through the roof. After seeing it, I can only assume that the movie Mr. Sendak saw must have been a pre-production screener that was drastically changed after he gave it his blessing. I can't imagine that he would have allowed this travesty to be presented to the public.When it was over, I cried - not because it warranted crying, but because my beloved childhood memory was ravaged like a carcass on the Savanna. I actually started to nod off at one point. One of the worst debacles was the fact that Spike had Max run away and find a boat - rather than having him sent to his room without supper and having the room transform. Mr. Jonez, did you even READ the book? HOW can you remove such an important aspect?!?!? The best I can say is that the costumes were impeccable (hence the 2 star rating)! They really did their homework when designing them. My advice - stay home and watch it on ABC Family when it comes to cable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i took 4 boys aged 5-10 and they all wanted to leave. my 5 year old was scared and my nine y/o and his 2 10 year old friends kept whining that it was strange. i sat through all the whining because i loved this film. i watched in awe as each of max's personality traits were made into strange and wonderful beasts that i could relate to, that made me empathize with a kid and his emotional confusion. i haven't read the book since i was a child(many moons ago) and don't know if the movie follows the original so i'll thank both the author and spike jones for a strange and wonderful night at the movies. oh yeah, i'll be taking the misses next week sans kids. good job!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An odd, unsettling but not entirely worthless movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a big gulf between 'adapt' and 'reimagine.' The book this movie was based on was childlike, innocent raucous fun. This movie isn't an adaptation of the book. One could say it's a meditation inspired by the book. If there is a message in the book, it's basically, 'Come back when you want to behave. We'll still love you.' If there's a message in the movie it's basically, 'My personality is split into a group of warring monsters who are lonely and violent. And if you make friends with one of them it will come back to bite you in the ass. And if you try to organize things they will fall apart because basically you're a liar.' An interesting meditation on the theme to be sure, but I really don't think this is what Maurice Sendak had in mind. On the plus side, the monster costumes are really pretty cool, and the fort they build looks like a lot of fun. Hearing James Gandolfini and Lauren Ambrose voice the monsters is a lot of fun. The score is pretty nice, too. I don't regret watching this movie. But I can't imagine what kind of audience it was intended for. Too dark and weird for kids. I daresay kids would be bored to tears watching this. At the same time it's too disjointed and self-conscious for adults, swinging from overly precious to bizarre exercises in self-destruction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Made my kid cry!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Where the Wild Things Are" book artwork freaked me out as a kid, and now I'm even more freaked out. The movie is probably the most neurotically depressing movie with the freakiest looking characters I've ever seen. We left our kids alone to watch what we thought was a harmless kids movie, and later found our 10yr old crying. We still can't get her to tell us what she found so disturbing.I understand what the makers of this movie were trying to do. The movie is about a child who has major issues dealing with his home life. So he creates a made up monster world where he is in charge, and the monsters symbolically represent people in his life and his dark issues. But all the characters are so sad, angry, and neurotically depressing. The monsters are creepy looking with monotone adult voices. Everybody is moping or violently destroying things, ripping off arms, biting, yelling, etc... What fun!The dialogue and plot are what a scatter brained, neurotic depressed 5yr old might write. One of the sequences went something like this... "Let's eat the kid!" "Don't eat me, I'm a king!" "He's a king? Maybe he can make us not be sad!"Investigation of the dark recesses of child psychology is interesting to some childless adults with issues, and movie critics, but it's NOT FOR KIDS. My child said "I don't EVER want to see that movie again!!!" And neither does anybody else I know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How to Destroy a Children's Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suppose one of the pitfalls of being of an older generation is that one risks being exposed to the nostalgia of one's peers. The very idea of turning a children's classic into a film already risks perverting the book to one's own narrow vision of things. But attempting to make a feature-length film from a book of this brevity should be made a criminal act, on the order of masturbating in public.I should point out that my review of this film is colored by my own childhood experience with Where the Wild Things Are, which to me has always been one of the greatest of all children's books and became one of my stalwarts in the far-distant days of my own early childhood. So there was probably never any chance that Jonze would succeed in convincing me that this film should have been made.Particularly since he misses the most important point of the book: Max could be anyone of us, because all of us dressed up in costumes and got a little out of control and got sent up to our rooms because of it.But Jonze insists on providing Max with a back-story --and the most clichéd of them all, a lonely fatherless, friendless boy-- padded out with an entirely unnecessary older sister and too much information about a single mother (who could never look anything like our own anyway). And because of this, Where the Wild Things Are can never be about us --which was the entire point of the book.With so few pages to work from, it seems essential that the film at least capture each and every one of them --and especially the landing on the island, which loses the flow of the book (forcing Max to climb a cliff, instead of the book's genius of having the wild things already there, as if waiting for him).The film goes on to cheapen the Wild Things themselves -- giving them corny, old-fashioned and even nerdy names. Allowing them to speak in cartoonish voices and buffoonish dialog.The list goes on.All of this would have been slightly acceptable if Jonze had at least attempted to find inspiration from the breezy inevitability of the book's narrative -- as brief as that is-- and develop something that resembled an interesting plot. But he does not, and can not. The minor intrigues -- what happened between KW and Carol, who are KW's other friends-- seem lifted from a television series. And the larger scenes are too drawn out, lack focus and quickly become boring (I'm thinking particularly of the fort-building sequence).Soon enough, I found myself looking as often at the time as at the film. And finally gave up at 48:58. Sit through another 40 or 50 minutes in the hope that the film might pick up the pace and become relevant? No.Instead, I could read the book. Several times. And each time discover something new, each time re-exploring the world of the Wild Things--my own imagination-- just like the first time the book was read to me all those many years ago.If you haven't seen the movie, don't bother. (And no, it's not at all for kids either). If you haven't the read the book, then you haven't been young yet. Go read it now. Right now. Go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrible movie!!!! Don't take your kids.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's like a horror movie, but sad instead of scary. The music and cinematography are an assault on your emotions. The whole thing is morose and full of self-pity. This is not the sort of thing I want my kids to focus on in life. It was like torture, but I kept watching hoping it would get better. I felt like I had emotionally betrayed my kids by taking them to see it. My son was bawling. I don't understand why it gets such good reviews unless it's a case of The Emperor's New Clothes. I know it's cool these days to be cerebral and psychological and in touch with your inner self, but this movie is just BAD. Don't subject yourself or your kids to it! I wish I could get that part of my life back to go do something fun and uplifting with my kids, instead of spending it in psychological torture. I used to like the book. I'm not sure I want to read it to my son again anytime soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you loved the book as a child if you loved reading it to your kids don't put yourself or your kids through this miserable movie. If you love movies like "Punch drunk love" or "Lost in translation", "Adaptation" or you just like to consider yourself an intellectual above the common man's base tastes in films (and this is the most likely scenario) you will love this movie. First things First you DO NOT hire Spike Jones to direct a Kid's movie and YUP this should have been a kids movie, but its not. It's not that I don't get what Old Spike was trying to do I get it, I have a degree in Mental Health and another in Fine arts, I caught all the subtext but here is what Spike didn't get; this story doesn't belong to him to do with as he pleases it doesn't even belong to Maurice Sendak any more it belongs to those of us who grew up with it and our children. Spike Jones took something precious to all of us and molested it till it fit what he wanted with no regards for the lovers of the book. Besides which we are in a recession that is effecting millions and no one wants to go to a movie that leaves you feeling suicidal when the credits roll. Dear Spike Jones Next time you need a vehicle for your angst ridden misery stay the heck away from my childhood. And for those of you who were moved by this film and just got gooshy over it, get over yourselves , loving depressing movies doesn't make you smart or elite it makes you gloomy, and unpleasant to be around.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Was looking forward to this movie and finally got a chance to see it the other day and that really turned out to be a huge disappointment. If I didn't knew better I would say the movie was written by the boy who starred in it. In addition he was extremely annoying to watch, and for the entire movie, I just wished one of the over-sized teddybears would eat him and the movie would finally end. The story was very boring, the "monsters" looked completely out of place and not very well made. The kid, well I won't even go there as I'll probably end up getting banned if I do. If you liked teletubbies, you would probably like this movie too. If not I wouldn't recommend this film to any sane person.</fullReview>

They are 10 and 12 years old, very bright, and they said "Was there a point to that movie?. I know there was - but what? The monsters were fun to look at, but that is the only nice thing that I have to say about the movie. The story has been accurately told by other persons making comments. We all agreed it was incredibly boring. The kids figured they were supposed to learn some lesson from the movie, but couldn't guess what it might be.

		<fullReview>Just entirely too much stuff. The plot should have been the book, instead it's all this divorce crap, and childhood angst mess. Worse, all the monsters are stripped of their enigma and portrayed as boring ordinary creatures. I mean the drawings in the book are indelible and mysterious, the monsters are almost iconographic, then Spike Jonze gives the monsters girlfriends and hobbies. The book, Where The Wild Things Are, is a masterpiece, the drawings and the words are simple but every bit the stuff of genius. Its that simplicity that allows for the fantastic elements of Max's journey to easily flow. The movie complicates this simplicity with unnecessary dialog and additional plot, making for an inferior story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great visuals, but incredibly depressing story, and unfaithful adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** FULL SPOILERS AHEAD ***Most of us who grew up in English-speaking countries remember Maurice Sendak's classic tale of the naughty young boy Max who was sent to his room without supper, and proceeded to have a night of rumpus and fun with monsters and wild things of his vivid imagination. So it was with eager expectation that I popped this into my player last night to see what director Spike Jonze had come up with. I had only seen previews and trailers and was pleasantly piqued at the visuals, which seemed as faithful to the book as real-life depictions could be.Unfortunately, the visuals are pretty much where the similarities to Sendak's tale of childhood innocence end. The boy in the wolf suit is there on screen, but he is an extremely sad, disturbed, and troubled young child. Max grows up neglected in a single parent home, presumably has trouble making friends, and is shown throwing violent temper tantrums, and finally ends up running away from home. He shows all the signs of childhood depression and anger at his parents' divorce, not simply being a naughty boy. I did not appreciate the overburdening of the story with excessive adult themes. This is no longer a film for kids, but a thinly-veiled (and unfortunately, shallow) commentary on the disintegration of society, family, and relationships.The Wild Things who he runs away to make friends with and eventually rule over, are an equally despondent group of characters. Not the wild and playful bunch of rowdies from Sendak's book, these creatures are way too close to reality. Angry, bitter, and resentful, they resemble more of a group therapy circle! Throughout the film, I just felt my heart sinking deeper and deeper with every scene. The only saving grace for this film is the great puppetry, CG-augmented visuals and other special effects that bring some scenes of the book to life.Ultimately, this film tapped the joy out of Sendak's book, and I find it hard to imagine how this received his blessing and became greenlighted. It's rare that I actually hate a film this much, especially one that's based on a book so loved by so many. I really wanted to love this film, I really did. But ultimately, as evoked by one of the scenes, it just left me feeling like a black hole - burnt out, lifeless, and empty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Where the Wild Things Are</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where the WIld Things Are gave the local distributors here a hard time deciding whether to let it loose on the big screen, or not. The trailer was played for some time, and the posters went up, but slowly but surely the release date got perpetually pushed back, until everything got yanked off the screen. This is probably the first film here that had a Facebook group (now quite defunct) set up for movie fans to clamour for its hopefully eventual screening which didn't materialize, but got a sizable following that went on to organize a DVD collective purchase of sorts.At first I thought, it's quite the no brainer to market it because it's adapted from a popular kid's story written by Maurice Sendak, so the target audience would naturally be the kids, right? Not quite, as after watching the film, director Spike Jonze had weaved quite the mature tale here, sans any semblance of a cutesy nature that could be squarely targeted at its supposedly intended niche audience. Besides, Jonze is not quite the known entity around here, and a culmination of such factors made the distributors have cold feet. So it was what it was, and all we got was a local DVD release.Which is a pity of course, as I would have relished the opportunity to see the gigantic Wild Things here on the big screen. But I digress. This is probably a film meant for and speaking out to the spoilt brats out there, be they young or old. We follow Max (Max Records) the protagonist of the story as he gets his snow igloo broken by friends of his sister Claire (Pepita Emmerichs) before going on a whirlwind destruction of her room. That's a typical sign of trouble to come, but oh-so-identifiable with children as they hit out where they can, especially with his sister's absence. We learn that he's not quite the quiet boy he may seem to be on the exterior, and surely he throws a tantrum when he doesn't get the attention he needs from his mom (Catherine Keener) when she brings home a boyfriend (Mark Ruffalo) whom she has to entertain.Running away in frustration and anger (and possibly a childlike pettiness as well), here's where the story gets interesting as he goes into a fantastical world where Things inhabit, making friends with a bunch of them large monsters voiced by the likes of James Gandolfini, Paul Dano, Catherine O'Hara, Michael Berry Jr, Chris Cooper, Lauren Ambrose and Forest Whitaker even. They crown Max king of their land based on the lies cooked up by him about his magical abilities, in the hopes that he'll bring happiness to the group. Alas for all his ideas with his new playmates, he soon finds out that if one of them is emotionally difficult, and probably his best friend and favourite amongst the group, everyone does not get better off and any marked improvements they had made took two steps back. In some ways this parallels his own life and provides him that mirror, before gaining maturity in knowing what needs to be done best.The amazing fusion of live action and live sized puppetry combined with CG is what stands out in the film, especially when The Wild Things come out, moving and emoting as if they were truly real creatures. The fantastical landscapes made up of large deserts and beaches also makes the film quite the visually arresting piece that leaves you wide-eyed and marvelling and how seamless all elements seem to come together in presentation. While the story's quite the given that it's a literary classic quite familiar with many, Jonze has this adult like treatment in what may seem like a children's story on the surface, which probably made risk-averse distributors think twice about their bottom line, which is indeed a pity.But there's always the alternative DVD route to take to watch the film, and I'm glad I did. Don't let this slip you by, and perhaps one day we may see more market ambiguous films take to the cinemas here, given a strong and growing niche audience who can be counted on to support well made films that contain the whole works from competent acting to a story that moves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where the Wild Things Bite It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Really Spike Jonze? Really Dave Eggers? Really? Let me first point out the good things. The monsters look incredible. The creature designers should have won many awards. Also the cinematography is beautiful from top to bottom. And the kid is pretty good.Outside of that, here's what happens when you try to stretch a 48 page children's book into a 90 minute movie. Max is a kid. He's pretty much a little a-hole. One night, he throws a fit, screws up his mom's date with Mark Ruffalo, and runs away from home. After a poor lighting sequence he ends up on a dreamland island with a bunch of awesome looking creatures who, like him, just seem to be into frigging things up. What ensues is roughly 40 minutes of nothing. Nothing at all. They play and build a fort. They step on one another's heads and feelings get hurt. It's all the stuff that happens in a playground, except with million dollar giant Furbies. Then, when you're dying for a plot point, the favorite monster turns into someone's paranoid drunk dad, ripping off limbs and swearing that the sun has died. He tries to eat the kid. All the other monsters decide that poop just got real and the kid should sail back to reality. When the boy returns, we learn the most valuable lesson of all: If you frig up your mom's date with Mark Ruffalo, run away, then come back, you get cake! This movie was supposed to make me feel like a kid again, but all I wanted to do was grow up. Fast! I also wanted to punch that kid in the face. But mostly I wanted to know why Jonze thought that if you shoot a bunch of nothing happening that it all gets fixed by just turning on some indie music. Come on, man. Get it together.</fullReview>

Max is okay but he's really hard to like. He is done way to bratty to buy into his world. it also takes too long to get to the fantasy. I found myself getting bored too many times when I should have been excited.maybe this is due to the directing which was too artsy and to many angles in my opinion.

		<shortDescription>Well intended and successful in parts yet ultimately not very good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sure many children of the English-speaking world would have read (or have been read) "Where the Wild Things Are", the story of naughty yet imaginative Max who dreams about going to a far-off island where peculiar creatures (the "wild things" of the title) live. In an age where nostalgia-fuelled adaptations of the beloved books of Generation X by the quirkiest directors in Hollywood are the norm, along comes a cinematic reworking of Maurice Sendak's picture book.Director Spike Jonze has done the right thing by keeping the somewhat dark yet enchanting atmosphere of the original book intact. Instead of settling on the usual CGI creations featured in nearly all fantasy films these days, Jonze uses animatronic figures created by the Jim Henson Creature Workshop, giving the fantastical monsters a dreamlike and unfabricated feel. They contribute to a general feeling of magic realism; there is no attempt to make the whole film a storybook affair or an over-the-top Peter Jackson spectacular - it simply feels like a Jean Cocteau film for the 21st century.However, there are a serious amount of problems in terms of pacing, plot and characterisation that seriously mar the film. The dreamy element that makes the ambiance so successful ultimately ruins the actual foundations. The predicament that Max is placed in within the real world is soulful and engaging; he is very simply a misunderstood child stuck in a world that seldom seems to love him, and these scenes, acting as a snap shot of somebody's everyday life, capture a wonderful sense of wistfulness. Yet there ultimately seems to be a sense of continuity and plot progression in these scenes, and once Max reaches the fantasy land, the plot goes a bit off course. The monsters simply appear as ludicrous creatures with no set personalities, and there is a sudden shift from heartfelt drama to a series of random anecdotes with little direction; ultimately, the fantasy sequences could have been shortened and given a more concrete thread, as at 101 minutes, the film just goes on too long. The moment when Max decides to return home is completely abrupt, which equally does not help the situation of pacing and direction.In short, the artistic qualities of "Where the Wild Things Are" are good, yet it lacks much direction and structure. It's not too bad, but it's probably just something worth watching on TV one Sunday afternoon if it happens to be on as opposed to something worth spending money for on a cinema ticket or a DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do not be fooled by the promotion... it is meant for kids!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I must mention I had never even heard of the book this movie is based on before I saw it, so this could be a critique on the book itself.This movie is terrible... simply put. I said "terrible" and not "horrible" as I did not find it to be at all scary, not even for a four-year-old. The "monsters" are too silly-looking to be considered intimidating, and the whole "dark" representation of a child's fantasy world is simply unnoticeable. The main character is a kid who probably shouldn't have stopped taking his Ritalin, since he has become the most annoying thing this world has ever seen. From the first moment he appeared in the movie he made me think of "Nanny 911", and at no point could I bring myself to like this creature. He fights with his sister, her friends, his mother, and, basically, demands that the whole world revolves around him. When he can't get his way, he bites his mother, and runs off to a nearby park, where he finds a boat waiting for him -obviously- and sails off to a distant island... there he finds a few big "monsters" which are shaped like his dolls, and tells them he is their new king, so they do EXACTLY what he orders them to do... just like that!Anyway, the meaning of the movie is that kids should understand that not everything can be about them, that not having the full attention of others is not the end of the world, and that grown-ups have problems of their own... The really frustrating aspect of the movie is the way this "meaning" is derived, which is too silly and obvious! One of the "monsters" looks, acts, and talks exactly like the kid, another one looks, acts, and talks exactly like his mother, another one looks, acts, and talks exactly like his sister, etc... I can't imagine anyone over the age of 10 not being able to figure out precisely what this movie is all about after the first 10 minutes. Honestly, if "Dora the Explorer" was on the poster of this film, pointing at one of the "monsters", asking "Who is this?", it would have made more sense to me!In conclusion, it is movie for very young children, even though some parents may find it too scary for them. It is TOO BORING for any person over the age of 10 to watch, and I did not experience any sentiment during this movie, except anger for being so stupid I sat all the way to the end of it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll add my voice to the chorus of warning here: This movie is horrible. No redeeming value. It's the worst kind of bad. So bad that you can't even be amused by how bad it is. I can't remember the last time a film pis*ed me off like this for wasting my time and money. Guess the story didn't teach me how to deal with my anger at all. The characters are unlikable and showcase a range of mental disturbances, there is no plot to speak of, and it's visually boring despite whatever cutting edge CGI technology may have been used. Who bankrolled this? What a disaster. People watch films to be entertained. If a skilled filmmaker can slip a message into the the narrative with a light hand, fine. This film has no narrative, yet seems to be trying to bash you over the head at every turn with some kind of social/behavioural insight. Maybe I tuned out early and gave up trying to understand what the director was attempting to communicate. Forgive me, but I'm not willing to put much analytical effort into something that bores me this profoundly. Keep your kids away from this film and read them the book instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>hopeful, then disappointed, and finally depressed and happy it was over.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was depressing because the characters were depressed, dark and moody. The novelty of the otherworldly sets and imaginary characters wore off in about 15 minutes and the rest was at best only occasionally interesting and never intriguing. The plot was too trivial for adults and too dark for children. To my way of thinking, children's fantasies and dreams are rarely so dull and devoid of emotion. Their were a couple of horseplay scenes that broke the monotony, but these were only just enough to keep us in our seats. My wife and I were happy when it was over. If this movie was supposed to somehow help viewers to process the unhappy days of their childhood, and come out feeling healthier for it, then I'd say the scriptwriters and the director ought to take a couple more psychology classes before doing anything similar in the future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe I just don't "get it," but this movie was seriously lacking something. A plot, maybe? I wanted to like this movie, I really did. It had a very animated, handsome, believable boy in Max Records playing the role of Max. It had reasonably good character costumes. It just didn't "reach out &amp; grab" the audience. The kids in the theater were pretty mixed in their opinions as well &amp; didn't quite know why the movie seemed sad, even depressing. This is a movie I think you can afford to miss, I hate to say. Try renting the DVD of The Neverending Story instead. THAT movie had a plot &amp; really grabs the audience's attention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jonze strikes gold</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where the Wild Things Are is about as flawless of a children's book to big screen movie you can make. What a bold, yet in the end excellent decision by Spike Jonze to reach out towards all audiences. He could have made it more for the kids with sissy dialogue, cheap laughs and happiness throughout, but instead he aims it at everyone. This is for everyone who has ever read to book, everyone who has ever felt neglected, everyone who has ever had to deal with the turmoils that arise during childhood. I love how he paralleled the Wild Things with Max. It really gave the story a nice touch and while the ending was tweaked (and he obviously was going to tweak it) I think it works out for the better. I gotta admit I got choked up near the end so I can go ahead and add this to my list of "man cry" movies. Anyways, hats off to Jonze...he really hit a home run with this one. Beautiful, touching, imaginative, and in the sense of children emotions (feeling neglected, isolation, sadness, fear, togetherness, anger, etc.) realistic. Oh, and the kid who played Max...watch out for him in the future...I have a feeling we haven't seen the last of him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Calligraphic Camera Writes the Imagination</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a huge success, and I believe that it will reach that status now called "classic," being experienced over and over in whatever ways that classics will in the future.I'll let others note the purity in the way that sharp childhood is evoked. It is the emotional center of the thing. I'll be more interested here in noting the cinematic use of space. Jonze is famous for this, and how he can connect it to the folds in the narrative."Folds" in this context have to do with nesting of narrative elements. For instance the "real world" segments feature eating (twice), fort (twice), snowball fight, wild suit, pileon, pulling at toes, lost marriage, broken model of a heart, being king, son/sun dying and so on. The "wild world" features the same things twisted in ways that suggest the real narrative describing the inner character of Max. This "folding" gives us a place to stand and engages us more deeply, as a key narrative device. There is even a smaller inner fold where Carol (the Max surrogate) makes a model of his world, hidden in the desert. And another where Max enters KW.I am more interested in the spatial folding. Yup, the way that Jonze has decided to set up and elaborate a vocabulary of movement.Here's what we have, I think. I have only seen this once and will have to wait for DVD study to confirm it.The scenes I am working with here are the ones with physical motion, where both the camera and the subjects move: the dogchasing, snowball fight, the amazing encounter with the waves when approaching the island, the rumpus and then the dirtball fight. Frozen motionpaths are in the fort's appendage, the "pile," and indicated by the stickweaving in the global fort and houses.I believe these all use the same motion template. When someone invents a movie annotation tool where we can find and describe this, it will be easy to check and show. Right now it is an impression, but I got the feeling when watching that wave scene (in IMAX) that I would see the same motion paths in the forthcoming rumpus. Perhaps it was the appearance of the ululating sound that was used every time something got frantic, and by that time twice already. Perhaps it was the obvious reference to the Hokusai woodblock ("The Great Wave off Kanagawa"), where a wild wave becomes an actor, a wild thing dwarfing an iconic mountain, whose shape I thought I also saw on-screen.I would not be surprised either if Spike used a sigla to denote this motion (like Joyce does in "Finnegans Wake") and that the sigla was KW, denoting the actual paths, the K in plan and the W in the vertical plane. Thus, KW swallowing/eating Max, apart from the obvious vaginal association also takes on a deeply cinematic one, worthy of "Adaptation." I know the work on this was done in Melbourne. Could it be that this apparent one-man shop "Digital Rein" managed this? In an unconnected area, am I misremembering? I recall the phrase was "Let the Wild Rumpus Begin!" (not "start").Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The book "Where the Wild Things Are" was brilliant in it's simple truth: kids think they want to be the kings of their world, but really, to indulge in play, wild-ness, and anarchy all the time would be scary, empty and lonely. Deep down, kids need to be where someone sets rules and boundaries, sends them to their room without dinner when they misbehave, then when the point has been made, they need someone to bring them warm soup. Kids need to be where someone loves them best of all.This movie adaptation was creepy, trite, and over-psychologized. Max is alienated from his sister, has a dating mom and absentee dad to "explain" his wild behavior. How boring and faux-profound. Max is a kid. He's a boy. Boys are wild at times. They can be inappropriate, destructive. They can chafe at rules and fantasize about anarchy ? all without clichéd psychological motivations.This movie had great looking "wild things" (until they became so dull and dysfunctional that you didn't want to look at them nor hear their impotent whining), gorgeous locations (quickly felt like distractions), and lovely, fancifully built structures (that soon became quirky crutches to mask poor story-telling). But all of this production value fell flat under the weight of an unimaginative, un-insightful telling of childhood.The "wild things" should have been WILD -- a little scary in their hedonism. They should have been a fully realized kid-fantasy of indulgence and chaos. And Max should have followed and satisfied that fantasy to its sobering end - because only then can he learn and grow. And only through such an unfettered telling of this kind of story by Sendak, can we all imbue our own personal narratives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maurice Sendak's world turned upside down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How unfortunate that Maurice Sendak's Caldecott winning sorry book was twisted and perverted to something unrecognizable. This film is not for young children. Frankly, my 11 year old child had a difficult time with the way the storyline drifted from the book. As an adult, admittedly in my 40's, I would never have suggested this film for a fun "movie night" adventure, knowing Jonze's adaptation was so twisted. The child actor who plays Max does so well. He seems to convey many emotions with just a look. The problem is the storyline. Sendak created a Max that was mischievous, not one in need of in depth family counseling. The trouble with making something so pure and child like, up to date, new or fresh, is the unfailing willingness to project onto the characters situations that were not intended. The familial dynamic, for example, Max is a neglected little boy full of misdirected energy and fueled by an active imagination. Not one hint of the depressed, destructive, physically abusive behavior that is shown on the "big screen." Catherine Keener and Mark Ruffalo could have, just as easily been husband and wife, not boyfriend/girlfriend. Honestly, it left too many unanswered questions. Where was Max's father? Was he divorced from his mother? Dead? There's no clear storyline to explain why Max had begun to behave so violently. But we all sense it had something to do with the missing father. Max physically abuses his mother, after verbally abusing her. This is attributed to the presence of the mother's boyfriend in the home. Again, confusing, underdeveloped storyline. We are lead to believe that no one in this troubled boy's life recognizes or cares about him. He is a sensitive boy, absorbing his science teacher's musings about the sun dying and the human race falling victim to any number of calamities. Realistically, this would never have happened in the public school system. There would be a huge backlash and the teacher reprimanded. But, this just seems like a platform for Jonze's social awareness and activism. Adults recognize it. Children are confused by the laundry list of failures awaiting humanity. Finally, Max gets whisked away to the Land of The Wild Things. Finally Max has a say, he is in control. Although a very touching relationship begins to develop among Max and The Wild Things, the viewer isn't really as engaged as they should be, having been struck dumb by the opening portion of the film. The Wild Things are quirky and visually similar to Sendak's book version. James Gandolfini is heartwarming and, as an adult, I was heartbroken all over again. Soon, it becomes clear that things are going to be more difficult for Max, the King. Judith, in particular, adds a lot of dissension and frailty to the rest of the film. One of the other Wild Things says that she is "a downer" and it's laughed off. But, not true for the viewer. We wholeheartedly believe Judith will bully Max and eventually eat him, wild suit and all. The scene with the owls is particularly telling. "How do I make everyone OK? " The answer is not going to be clear. Ever. The underlying message is unclear and confusing for younger viewers. For tweens and adolescents, the message is muddy. Life is full of pitfalls. Make sure your decisions are sound. Either way, all in our party preferred the originality and pureness of the literary version. The "updated" Max 2.0 is not something the world needs. Truly, preview and be ready to have discussions before viewing with young children.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a sham. There was a lot of hype behind this movie. People from my generation were talking about this film really capturing the essence of the children's book? I couldn't tell you if it did or not. I'm not sure what this was.Watching 'Where the wild things are' was like watching paint dry. It was painfully boring. I understand that this is supposed to be about a child's imagination, but it still needed SOME plot. There was nothing. You're pretty much watching a bunch of hairy monsters bounce around and scream, much similar to watching a taping of 'The View'. My girlfriend and I rented this on blu ray, and we both fell asleep multiple times. I'm not even sure I'd recommend this to show your kids, because some of the monsters could be scary to younger children. The teasers, trailers and credits have Mark Ruffalo plastered all over. He's in the film for like 5 seconds. I'm not even joking.I'm giving it a 4 out of 10 because the CG was well done. The imagery of the film was also good. Those are the only redeeming qualities.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not wholly successful but still an interesting character study</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember that when this film came out that websites like Tumblr and other hangouts of people of a certain age seemed full of excitement. It was not a book I had ever read or even really heard of up till this point, but the buzz around the film seemed genuine and interested. That said, it gave me pause that everything about it was very much focused on the visual aspect of the coming film and not much about its content, so in the end I missed it in the cinema and never got around to watching it until very recently.Truth be told I wasn't sure what to expect ? I had heard it was a film for adults but at the same time I had heard it was a book for children, so what would the film actually be? It took me a good chunk of the film to answer that question, because for a good while the film doesn't appear to be doing much and it takes a while for characters to develop and flesh out. When they do it becomes more interesting because the various wild things are various manifestations of Max's own situation and his interaction with them changes him. So we have his rage and impatience represented along with what appears to be a more reasonable side of him while other characters mirror his real world sister, mother etc. As an idea it is clever and it has enough about it to hold the interest but it is a shame that it isn't smarter than the one-line summary of the idea and it is a shame that it doesn't have more meat to it.For an adult film there is a lot of playing and, while some of this works and is necessary, there are times in the film where not much appears to be going anywhere anytime soon. It also has an overly somber feel to it which spreads across the whole film; where it is warranted it worked but it mostly dragged on the film, making it feel slower and less interesting than it actually was. It is a real shame because the idea was good and mostly the film is good, but there are too many things about it that hurt it or limit it. Jones has to carry the can for a lot of that since this is mostly his baby; in ways he does a great job but in others I think he misjudged it.The cast are strong in terms of voice and their outfits. Although the detail is computerized, you wouldn't know it and the use of people in suits adds a lot of reality and weight to the characters that pure CGI creations would not have been able to deliver. In the middle of these is Records; he has a tough job because he is unlikeable for most of the film ? an annoying kid. This is the point I suppose and he does it well but it is a problem that he does it too well. Gandolfini is a great choice for the representation of Max's impertinent anger ? after all this is the guy who played the emotionally violent Tony Soprano for so long. His voice and his physical character go very well together. This is the same for Ambrose, Cooper, Whitaker and others ? they all do well and it is felt all the more when the film doesn't rise to their overall level.Where the Wild Things Are is worth seeing because it is a brave film that takes a good idea and tries to make a smart film rather than an easy one. It is a shame that it never fully realizes that ambition by virtue of being flawed, overly morose and spending too long having not much happen where it really should have appeared to do that while filling in characters between the silences with smaller moments. With these flaws it is still an OK film but it deserved to be more than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sadly disappointing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I had better say for the record that I have never read Maurice Sendak's much loved book of the same title published in 1963. It's just one of those that never crossed my path. The film, well, it didn't really strike a chord with me (which I'll probably get a lot of stick for) but hey, you can't like everything. But more of that later, here's a very brief summary first (summary haters please have a snowball fight while I write the next paragraph).Max in a high spirited lad with a very active imagination who has a habit of throwing a tantrum when things don't go his way. After an argument with his mother, Connie, he storms out of the house and runs away. The thing is, he also runs away in his head to a place across an ocean (yes, you guessed it) to Where the Wild Things Are. They take the form of giant furry monsters, for want of a better description, and Max befriends them. One of them, Carol, is just like Max, strong willed and prone to the odd tantrum or two. Max persuades them to let him be their king, but he soon finds that being a king is a bit harder than he first thought.Now, technically I can't fault this film, it's beautifully shot with some excellent special effects used for the 'Wild Things'. My problem begins and ends with the character of Max, if you can't identify with Max then the rest of it just falls apart I'm afraid. Don't get me wrong, I thought it was a fine performance from Max Records as Max; it's just that the character didn't resonate with me.It's a shame because I was really looking forward to watching this and I feel a bit let down by it. I grew up in the countryside, climbed trees, grazed my knees and did all the fun things children do, but at the end of the day I was always happy to go home. I guess that's where I differ from Max; I never had a need for somewhere to escape to. But I digress; I cannot say if it is a good representation of the book, I'm sure there are others out there who can answer that. For me, a bit of a disappointment and so not recommended.My score: 5.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not so wild about this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where The Wild Things Are sees Jackass helmer Spike Jonze take the reins and adapt the classic children's book by Maurice Sendak. The story of Max (Max Records), a disobedient and troubled eight year old boy who floats away into an imaginative world where he rules an island full of furry monsters somehow fails to deliver. The acid test for these movies is watching it with the age group it was aimed at (i.e family / children) and whilst the very young may be enthralled by the visual presence on screen (not least the famous monsters) older children and certainly adults will fidget uncomfortably way before the end. Jonze undoubtedly delivers a film with his ubiquitous vision and personal touch, but it's just too relaxed and sags badly in places. There isn't a great deal to hold the attention - the parallels between the monsters' behaviour and Max's own family situation are too fuzzy and not explored enough, and in the end the movie lacks a certain charm where we take it to our hearts and care for it. It's seems almost like a movie made where everyone behind the cameras were smoking joints, and it lacks the magic that could have been so much more in evidence if, say, someone like Spielberg had got hold of it. I didn't find it an enthralling experience, although clearly the movie has divided opinions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not familiar with the book, but the film was somewhat of a disappointment. It meanders along, with no real plot and nothing to really pull the viewer in. But the biggest problem is that the little boy who is at the center of the story is so unbearably obnoxious that the film simply becomes unwatchable. By the end, it appears that the main point we're supposed to walk away with is that the little boy is "out of control" because he's scared and wants to know that "everything will be alright." Well, a lot of kids are scared, but few of them are as grating as this little brat.But if the the main point was to show the reason for the boy's behavior, there were conceivably more interesting ways to get to go about it. But again, the little boy is so repellent that in the first section of the film, when he falls out of his sailboat and it looks like the sea might swallow him up...I found myself rooting for the ocean.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a mediocre movie at best. A 10-year-old acts like a 10-year-old and throws a tantrum because his mom is trying to get a little from her boyfriend while not paying attention to the kid. The kid, who is wearing a bunny suit made out of a filthy bath mat, runs away, finds a boat, and sails across the ocean. I must admit, it's a novel way of running away from home. I assume, however, that this is more allegorical and that the kid is actually lying in a gutter somewhere tripping on some PCP-laced snow that he ate in the first scene of the movie. That first scene is where you see the sister's stoner high-school friends.The next hour and a half is spent detailing the kid's trip where parts of his psyche manifest themselves as strange creatures with the dialogue of your average 10-year-old kid. Most of the creatures are tame save for one male creature named Carol that is rather violent and unstable. You never quite know if Carol is going lose it or not. Hey, if I was a guy with a girl's name, I'd have some anger issues too.I was half expecting the kid to wake up at the end having gouged his eyes out or splattering to the ground having thought he could fly, but that didn't happen. You'll have to watch the movie to see how it all pans out, although I wouldn't recommend it unless you have nothing better to do than watch paint dry.Ultimately I give it a 3 out of 10 for decent cinematography.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was an original and interesting adaptation of the classic book by Maurice Sendak "Where Wild Things Are", a short story that I loved as a kid. It was simplistic but beautiful and inspiring. When I heard that Spike Jonze was going to make the film adaptation of this book, I didn't knew what to expect, because I loathed the other films of Spike Jonze (Specially "Adaptation") but I loved his music videos. So I was expecting this to be more like his music videos rather than his boring and muddled feature films, and fortunately, I ended liking this immensely. This must be one of the most complex and fascinating films for children since "Labyrinth" and just like that movie, this is both whimsical and magical, but also creepy and strange. I loved it. I loved from the very beginning to the end. I loved the new take on the original plot from the books. I loved the visuals, the monsters, the music?I even liked the creepy or strange parts of it. I think that adults will enjoy more this than the children, but still, this is one of the best family flicks ever made. Probably kids would dislike it, or find this creepy and depressive, but I am sure that when they grow up they will start appreciating this. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Must-See for All of Us as An Adult</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone has a childhood fantasy. Thiz movie reminds us how to be a child, where we can escape into our own world. It comes from a Maurice Sendak's famous fable. One night, a little boy has conflict with his mother. And then he runs away from home. On his solitude, he lives in his own fantasy, interacts with the characters he made up, and finds himself the meaning of life. The movie is directed by eccentric music video Director, Spike Jonze. Jonze has directed many famous musicians like Björk, Beastie Boys, Fatboy Slim and other musicians. My favorite is Fatboy Slim's music video "Weapon of Choice". His honorable directing credits are "Being john Malkovich" (1999) and "Adaptation" (2002). Thiz movie takes us to a child's point of view which is simple and naive. I always like Jonze's hand-held camera techniques. It's very dynamic and effective to describe the surrealism in each of his movies. The boy is perfectly performed by Max Records. The boy's monster friends are voiced by many well-known Actors like James Gandolfini, Forest Whitaker, Paul Dano, Chris Cooper and many more. The other Cast members are Mark Rufallo and Catherine Keener as the father and mother. In the beginning, I have hesitancy that the monsters will be appeared too scary based on original concept. But after I have watched it, actually the monsters are very lovable and funny. My favorite scene is "Throwing Dirt" scene. The Score and Soundtracks support each other in every scene. In overall, it is not a perfect movie for children, but it is definitely a must-seen thoughtful movie for all of us as an adult.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's difficult to adapt a beloved children's classic for the screen, but I had high hopes for WTWTA anyhow; after all, it had all sorts of indie cred (Spike Jonze, Karen O of Yeah Yeah Yeahs), and the previews featured Wild Things looking for all the world as if they had stepped from the pages of the book and come to life. And they weren't even CGI! Factor in production design that faithfully captured Maurice Sendak's illustrations and Catherine Keener cast as Max's frazzled Mom, and you had the makings of a wonderful film. But it's not. What's most shocking is that Sendak was personally involved in the making of this film and that somehow, in spite of that, it runs so far afield of the strengths of his delightful book. Usually, adapting a novel, filmmakers have to prune, upsetting the novel's fans. For children's books, which are often short and told largely in pictures, filmmakers have a different dilemma: adding story to flesh out what's not sufficient to sustain 90-120 minutes of screen time. Sometimes it works, like in Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs, which, while not as charming as the book, still tells a good story with an interesting conflict. Other times, it doesn't work at all, like here, for example. Jonze and company apparently felt compelled to fill the middle of this film with scant and distracting character development for each Wild Thing, removing the essential mystery of the world young readers have come to love (and fear and reimagine) for decades; they piled on contrived, unintelligible and convoluted motivations for why the Wild Things follow Max and why they eventually turn on him, in the process making sense of a place that is best left to the unknowable laws and youthful anarchy of a child's imagination. By the way, for all the explaining they take pains to cover, they fail to explain why one of the Wild Things sounds like he's from Jersey and why any of the things they do in the tortuous middle of the film are "fun" or "happy" activities. In fact, more often than not, in trying to explain something, they just make it all feel more confusing and purposeless. I've read some reviews about symbolism and such. It's a kid's movie. My kids hated it. Any symbolism was lost on them . . . and me. The people responsible for this misstep forgot that sometimes the best cinema, like the best children's literature, is told in images, not in dialogue, especially dialogue as wooden, unimaginative, and emotionless as this film's characters offer for nearly 70 minutes, often at a level mixed too far below Karen O's lovely compositions to be appreciated. There are remarkable things about this film to be sure, and a student of film will find much to admire here. But as a story, as a narrative bearing the name of one of the most indelible staples of children's fiction, this thing is a lot of hard work to watch. It feels like a missed opportunity. Maybe it should have been a short; watching the whole thing is a chore, a bore and a snore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty, Boring Things</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spike Jonze's adaption of Where the Wild Things Are is a somewhat decent retelling of a classic that walks a fine line between beautiful success and disappointing failure, ever so slightly leaning towards the success for its younger audience. Jonze's ability to be both surreal and visceral makes the film a must see despite it's few problems. Jonze and cinematographer Lance Acord's imagery is absolutely stunning and beautiful to watch, capturing the imagination and beauty of the original illustrations completely. The settings and characters fuse together seamlessly, a hard thing to find in most fantasy films in which the setting never quite integrates properly. The bird nest-like huts and dazzling fort that the Wild Things create look like alien, organic installation art pieces that any modern art museum would clamor to have, and any child would be proud to claim their own. Carter Burwell's stunning score, mixed with the bittersweet vocals of Karen O (of Yeah Yeah Yeahs fame) further the dark atmosphere of the film, making the image a complete and impressive one. The acknowledgment of this darkness is the strength of the film. Jonze fully captures and plays upon the rare ability of children to hijack terror, turning it into a game, a friend, and a confidant. Every moment of the film brought me back to my childhood, where just like Max I was stricken with fear and grief over a small comment by a science teacher regarding the eventual death of the sun, or shameful after an outburst against my parents. Sendak's story is a simple one; powerful because in just ten lines its able to capture the innocent anger of childhood. Jonze and Dave Eggers understand the magic of this simplicity. It's an incredible feeling, something that only a director like Jonze could accomplish without superficial sentimentality. Despite its beauty, the film has some unfortunate issues. After such an enchanting trip to first meet the Wild Things, hearing their modern day language and cadence is jarring, in stark contrast to the imaginative look of their figures. The voices and dialog of KW (Six Feet Under's Lauren Ambrose) and Judith (Cathrine O'Hara doing Catherine O'Hara) are particularly distracting. I can see why Jonze and David Eggers made the choices they did (the Wild Things are supposed to be real examples from Max's 2009 life) but it doesn't quite fit. Judith especially, as self-proclaimed, is just a downer. Luckily, Paul Dano, Chris Cooper, Forest Whittaker, and James Gandolfini are able to create a little more depth and character with their voices, but it still doesn't do enough to make the dialog more cohesive to the rest of the film. The film also lags a bit, but not because its slow moving. Max's experience with the Wild Things is an allegory of his experience with his mother and family. As he discovers the perils and sadness of responsibility, he begins to appreciate his mother, even wishing upon the Wild Things, "I wish you guys had a mom." There are many moving moments as Max discovers this, specifically when Carol expresses his fear and frustration saying "everything keeps changing," while Max finds himself unable to comfort the Wild Things and prove to them that everything will be OK, exposing himself just as his mother and every parent before her has had to do when their child realizes that they aren't all powerful. But instead of sticking with these powerful moments and keeping it close to the parent child allegory, Jonze and Eggers throw in an awkward, odd, and vaguely romantic (or does it mirror Max and his sister Claire?) relationship between Wild Things KW and Carol. It brings a conflict into the fray that is never fully realized or resolved and feels uncomfortable in a movie devoted to the powerful unconditional love between families. It's not that the relationship didn't deserve a place, but Eggers and Jonze seemed to struggle with whether or not they thought it did, leaving the film disjointed and sluggish whenever the subject was brought up. Despite these flaws, the film retains visual magic. I immediately ran home and hugged both my parents in respect of all they've done for me and their power to still make things OK, even after 25 years. Younger audiences will have no trouble getting beyond the films flaws (if they notice them at all), and will be enchanted for the rest of their lives. I wanted to like you Wild Things, I really did. You just couldn't do it for me despite your beautiful face.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are very few movies I don't like. There are next to none that I give a low rating for. This is one of those movies. In fact, when asked what my worst movie of all time is, THIS is the movie I immediately name. I cannot possibly emphasize any further how horrible this movie was. There literally weren't enough negative words invented.I went to see this movie in neutral territory. I read the book when I was a baby and therefore might as well have never read it at all because I didn't remember a single thing. The trailers made me interested but otherwise this was not my first choice to see in theaters. I was asked to go with a group of friends in the spur of the moment and I was neither excited nor dreading it. At the end, I came out of the theater wondering why the heck someone hadn't been shot for making this obscene film.The movie is about a kid with an active imagination who acts like a freak of nature and does something really predictably immature to make his mother mad at him. He runs away, SOMEHOW ends up on an island with these creatures (I literally looked down for a split second. One second he was in a neighborhood and when I looked back up he was on an island). More or less, he completely ruins the creatures lives, and then dips out. He runs back home into his mother arms. The camera lingers on them for a second, and then the credits come up. My mouth was hanging open in disbelief.The first bad thing I noticed was the kid. Somebody clearly slept with the director to get their kid onto the big screen, because nobody in their right mind would ever cast this freaking kid. He was SO ANNOYING it was unbelievable. The very first thing that came out of his mouth, I wanted to smack him. They could not have picked a more annoying, horrible actor for this part. The kid from Tim Burton's Willy Wonka would have blown him out of the water. The next thing is, the creatures were HORRIBLY depressing. I mean, talk about Eeyore! They were all borderline suicidal, and the one Thing I did like ended up being this angry moody evil crappy creature. Our stupid Max "hero" destroys the creatures lives, and then Max just...goes home. That. Is. It. There is NO conflict resolution, NO happy ending...it just ends as soon as the little brat runs back into his mommy's arms. Silence...credits. If you WANT to be depressed, if you WANT another reason to hate the world, then watch this movie. Yes, the visuals are kind of lovely, yes, somebody threw a ton of money into the special effects. But is that really what people go to movies for? A visually pleasing depressing children's flick? If this isn't a film to breed criminals at a young age, I don't know what is. Whoever thought this was a good movie is an IDIOT.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great look into the psych of a Child</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I gave this movie an 8, I feel that it could easily be better. At a glance I wasn't sure about this movie. I knew the book from grade school, and although I am not too old, 31, I wasn't sure if this movie would work. I was under the impression that it was Hollywood just making another buck. I was wrong. I have read the boards and seen a lot of negative talk with this film. I feel this is because many don't see the film in the light that it should be viewed in. Many see this film and think that its not a children's movie. They weren't entertained. Well, no its not really a kids movie, but it is Kid Friendly. Children will be entertained, but there are very adult themed items going on. And judging from the reviews, I think it was over the heads of adults. Kids will like it because of the age of the boy and the Wild Things are eye catching. The films underlining message to me was that we tend to forget about the fears of growing up. I remember being so scared at the fact that someday I was going to die, what happens when the sun goes out, fear of breaking a permanent tooth, etc. Many adults look at childhood as a wonderful place and there is no worries on the mind of a child, but in reality there is more to the mind of a child then that. It seems like there is constant worrying about the present and future state of a child. This movie taps into all this but many are going to overlook it and think that Max just needed a spanking. Well, I am not one to oppose spankings if they are warranted, but Max did not need a spanking but attention. He should have had been given the attention way before he turned wild. If you aren't going to give a child positive attention, they will act negatively for it. I heard many left, or turned off the film because of Max. First of all Max's character is very misunderstood and is acted great. His acting should be looked at is a very positive manner. It had great energy and was portrayed with honest effort. The creatures were great. They hit on many different attitudes among people today. The music isn't for everyone. I found it great. I know some people that can't stand children singing, but I loved it. The visuals were great and the use of CGI was well done. Again this is a movie that many are not going to get and thats okay. I suggest watching it with an open mind and look at all the film. Don't get turned off by something and decide it is a bad film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Our Monsters, Our Selves</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me, this was a remarkable film. In it, I saw a most clear-cut display of the crucial challenge we parents face with young boys, how to handle that balancing act between creation and destruction. Emotions for a young boy (and arguably many a man too) are new and explosive, volcanoes that can erupt at the most inopportune times, and that is part of the problem.Max has an eruption in an all-too-familiar moment, when his single Mom is entertaining a suitor (a threat by most psych standards if not the Oedipal complex alone). He retreats to savagery, and an infantile attack (he bites his Mom). And then he runs away......and winds up in an imaginary place. There he meets himself in the form of Carol, and extremely talented artist (witness his mini-world that he creates, and thus can control), who like Max is prone to fits of distorted consternation. Carol's jealousy over KW mirrors Max's issues with his mother...and KW is every bit as tender, although less exasperated, as Max's mother is in "real" life.There is home-wrecking (literally as we meet Carol) and a return to the womb (in the safety of KW's stomach, as Max flees his own anger (embodied by a betrayed Carol). There is the allure of aggression, in the dirt-clod war..even as a kid I had a love/hate relationship with those. And now as a parent, so often I see my beautiful boys pushing a game from safety through silliness and ultimately towards conflict or destruction. Someone's going to get hurt...It is a part of "boy/child energy" I feel, and it is extremely well captured in this film. Even saintly KW succumbs, with how she reaches out to the sagacious Bob and Terry (she plucks them from the sky by flinging boulders at them). As for Bob and Terry, their owlish wisdom sounds like pure gibberish to Max and of course to Carol. Not far off the squonking of parents in Peanuts.Wisdom, control, these are things we need to learn for ourselves, and I did not find the film overly preachy in that stance. Nor did my boys, who by and large enjoyed the film albeit perhaps not as much as I did. One boy did comment on the fact that he doesn't like it when someone changes a story so much, but really the original Sendak piece is *so* short, and really so open. This film says a lot more, in both length and depth in my opinion.By the way, Sendak is one of *the* staples of 1st grade in our school. Not just reading the story, but then having the kids create their own monsters. Few are the kids who realize they can create themselves, or that they have a monster inside them. Not necessarily to be tamed, or even destroyed...but certainly listened to, and respected as much as it will respect other things. Things that go bump in the night...and in the day.The movie to me was as amazing as the fake tree house/fort they built in it. Thank you Spike (I actually thought it was done by Gondry before I rented it...his take would have been quite interesting as well, and he too would have respected the DIY aesthetic which well suits the amazing creativity born as a twin to childish destruction).9/10 Thurston Hunger PS Here's a link to an interview with Sendak and Jonze/Eggarshttp://www.newsweek.com/id/216997/page/1</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unique story, poorly executed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find it somewhat difficult to give this movie a rating in the standard way. I do applaud the intentions of those involved in its production. They strive to tell a story that many adults can relate to when reflecting on their own childhoods. On some levels, the filmmakers do succeed. In addition, the visuals are unique and stunning.Ultimately, however, the movie disappoints. Perhaps the reason it falls short is because of the hype. Can any movie ever live up to unrealistic levels of expectation? I suppose that is a question each of us must answer for ourselves.Max (the little boy) is typical of most of us when we were his age. He feels like he's alone. He believes no one listens to him. He lives with an older, teen aged sister and his single mom. His dad is not in the picture (the reason for Dad's absence is never explored). While Max, who lives in a nice, middle-class home in a middle-class neighborhood, does not appear to suffer materially, he does not get the attention he craves. He seems to lack for friends his own age. When he tries to interact with Sis or Mom, they only frustrate him.Max's frustration comes out in brief fits of rage. It is during one of those that - clad in what appears to be a woolen sleeper designed to resemble a wolf - Max runs away from home.The movie then transports Max (and us) to a strange land full of weird characters. As the characters are introduced to Max (and he to them), Max finally gets to realize his dreams. To these strange creatures, Max is a king. He has special, super secret powers. In short, his life now has meaning and he has control over it. Life will be just what he wants it to be.Things are never that simple and uncomplicated, of course. The rest of the movie deals with Max's gradual realization that no matter how good one's intentions are, hurt feelings, disappointment and sadness are all by-products of living day to day.While on the surface "Where The Wild Things Are" is a children's movie, it is not for children. At least, not very young ones. I cannot imagine a child under the age of 12 being anything but bored. Overall, the tone was too depressing. The SFX people created wonderful imagery in the make-believe land, but there was no sense of wonder. Only sadness. In my opening statement I wrote that I found the movie difficult to rate. I will resolve that by giving it two, separate ratings. While I give it a "4" overall, I will give it a "9" for it's effort to be a unique movie and tell an unusual story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe the horrible things that people are saying about this movie. I thought this movie was very good and very touching. I am just a dumb construction worker and I totally understood the movie. I can't believe that so many people couldn't understand the monsters represented Max's different emotions and psyche. Don't believe all the idiots who say this movie makes no sense and has no plot, it has an excellent plot. This is not a children's movie with a plot for 4 year olds, it is a movie about childhood that makes you use your brain but is still very entertaining at the same time. Yet, it never delivers any heavy-handed message which so many films do these days. If you go to this movie expecting an easy PIXAR like plot then you will be disappointed. Just don't come on here and trash it because you had to use your brain to figure out what was going on. And don't say that just because it has a PG rating that it should be as kids movie and should be simple, they give out PG ratings based on violence,sex and swearing not idiotic plot. In summation, if you don't enjoy thinking about movies and like to be spoon-fed your plots then don't go see this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lets eat him, oh wait, here is a better idea, lets make him our King</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is giant waste of time, and even bigger waste of opportunity.The music is pretty nice, the kid does a marvelous job, the wild things in themselves are pretty cool, the mother not being able to give enough attention to the child or trying to have a life and the older siblings ignoring him also provides a great set up. However, that is where everything falls apart because there is absolutely NOTHING that brings it all together. Nothing in this movie makes you laugh. Nothing makes you terribly sad or happy or worried or curious about resolution of facts. There are no facts. There is no story. There is a setup, a giant hour long snowball fight with dirt and rocks and giant creatures running wild and jumping on each other and then movie ends.At best it can be described a kid's fantasy. But a long boring uneventful fantasy. If you want to see how children dream, then check out "Bridge to Terebithea"! That movie would bring you to giddy levels of joy and then drown you in your own tears.This movie is terrible for following reasons: It really isn't a kid's movie because some sequences are too scary (who wants to be eaten by wild creatures?). It really isn't for adults because we need something besides a food fight to care about the movie. Also, as described above, the elements were there to create something magical but there wasn't enough plot of clever twists or emotional depth to bring it all together and opportunity was wasted.Good music though, but bad movie.</fullReview>

I get why people like the film. I've been to college/uni. Studied film etc. I can personally appreciate aspects of film other than the box office gross and star names. I just think that the genre of film that this is supposed to represent, lets be frank, it's been marketed towards kids and released in the holiday season to get maximum bums on seats, parents need to entertain their little angels.And herein lies the con. Yes the film is beautiful, the cinematography is awesome, the characters are amazingly well realised, it's got some great imagination and the acting is top notch.My kids though were bored.They were scared. Then confused. And finally sad. they never laughed, and if it wasn't for the pick and mix i think they may have lynched me.The film is soooo melancholy it's untrue. From the start to the finish there is no childish fun to the film of any note, and when there is, it has consequences.It's a man, intellectualising his childhood and it's reading material. Which is fine, i have no problem with that. But your childhood looks very different when looking at it 20 years later. And that interpretation is lost on children.I've given the film a 5 because it needs to be judged within its genre. And this isn't a Princess Bride, Never ending story or Labrynth. Not even close.If it had been marketed towards a more adult audience i would have been tempted to give it a 7. Instead i felt conned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After getting into an argument with his mother, young Max runs away from home. He runs into a nearby wooded area, that leads us into his wild imagination. He, dressed up in a wolf costume, sets sail to an island that is inhabited by these giant talking creatures, who then take Max as their king.The Shawshank Redemption and 2001: A Space Odyssey are both successful films that are based on short stories. Where The Wild Things Are is a new film from Spike Jonze based on a child's book that is extremely short. So short that one would think how on earth could it ever be turned into a film? One would have to go beyond the written and illustrated pages to make something like this work. It seems films based on stories and books that are relatively short succeed more than films based on books that are longer. There is more room for them to move around with.Jonze, who started off in commercials and has since had a very successful working relationship with Charlie Kauffman, is behind the camera for this adaptation. Along with Dave Eggers, they add much more depth and emotion to the story. I knew going in that the film would have next to no plot, and that's pretty much the case, but that's not what this film needs. In other words, much like 2001: A Space Odyssey again, this is more of an experience, than a film. An experience that is not all fun and laughter.Where The Wild Things Are is funny and heartfelt, yet also depressing and lonely. The advertisements make the film seems like a wonderful kids adventure. While the film does have bits of adventure in it, it is much darker and a bit more adult. The film explores relationships, loneliness, sadness, trust, love, etc. More than one might expect from a film based on a book that has very few words in it.Max runs away from home after his mother doesn't give him the attention he wants. Who can blame her, she is a single mother, working hard and trying to have a relationship. He finds comfort and acceptance in this world he creates with these creatures that at first seem intimidating, but once you get up close to them are harmless. Each one has their own distinct voice and look. The voice actors all do a great job bringing just the right amount of emotion to each one. Gandolfini voices Carol, Max's counterpart in the film. They have an instant connection. Both characters have to go through their own complex obstacles and learn from each other. Chris Cooper and Paul Dano supply voices for more Wild Things, each add their own little flair to their characters and it's Dano as the Ram, who gets the most laughs.In order for this film to work, you need to connect to these beasts. I did, and the film worked for me. I was having fun when they were and sad when they were crying. Max Records, the young boy, has to carry this film, being the only human on screen for 80% of the film. He brings that sense of innocence to the role, seeing his mistakes and growing up to try to make them right. The creatures are wonderful. I'm glad they didn't use CGI for the entire characters. The use of people in costumes, mixed with animatronics and CGI work beautifully and feel more real than anything Michael Bay can conjure up.The soundtrack is wonderful and the film has that emotional punch that will grab you. It might drag in places, but the overall experience is a good one. Be careful if you brings your kid though, I'm not sure if the content will be too much for them. There are some frightening scenes, and one in which a limb falls off. It may also be just too weird for some kids. Max literally hides inside one of these creatures. Where The Wild Things Are is a wild, weird fantasy that I look forward to see again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The book was fun, a little dark and odd, but enjoyable. The film is bleak and depressing, and occasionally frightening. How in the world this got a PG rating is beyond me. My 10 yr old was terrified to the point of tears when one of the monsters starts to flip out late in the film. This is a 10 yr old who's favorite film is Twilight, so she's no stranger to thrills. But I'm telling you, this is not a kids' film.Maurice Sendak's Newsweek interview turned my stomach. Apparently he doesn't mind one bit, in fact seems to enjoy, the idea that some children are frightened by this film. Google the interview, or find the link on wikipedia, you'll see what I mean.This is not a film that thrills like a roller coaster ride, this is a film that terrifies like a drunken stepfather removing his belt.The movie should have been PG-13. How can a someone make a purposefully terrifying film *based on a children's book*, somehow get a PG rating, and then get offended when parents find the film too scary for kids, hiding behind the justification of "artistic merit" and decrying American kids as "soft".IMHO, Sendak is a POS who had a miserable childhood, and this film shows it.</fullReview>

My first criteria for a good film. And the "wild things" could not be less wild. They mope and cry through most of the film (apart from their unexplainable love for knocking down trees...?). It's like a mystical CGI Breakfast Club. Too depressing to be a children's movie and too childlike to be geared for adults. Painfully bad dialogue and no real message at the end. He comes home, exchanges a listless hug with his mother (who apparently is not really that upset by his disappearance), is rewarded with cake, is still a little brat, and cue credits. Worthless. Absolutely worthless. Wish I would have taken my eleven dollars and bought some Valium, it would have had a similar and more enjoyable effect.

		<fullReview>This movie stunk. My wife and 4 yr old daughter got up and left at 15 minutes in. My 7 yr old son wanted to stay so the 2 of us did. But he later told me it wasn't a good movie, he just wanted to finish the popcorn. The moral of the story in the book, as well as key plot points like the fact that the whole adventure was supposed to be inside the safety of his bedroom, was totally lost in the movie version. We've read the book a million times, so we do know the regular story. But I had to constantly debrief with my son what was going on, and (SPOILER ALERT) that if he ever actually ran away from home, or tried to take a boat out by himself, that he'd be in real danger and he should never think that a kid that age should do that unless its in his imagination in his room. When the boy came back home in the very end and just walked into his house and his mom started crying and he ate and there were no words spoken about anything, I was livid. No debrief about running away from home. No "I love you." Not even an "I'm sorry." DO NOT take children to see this. The only redeeming quality is that we've had a nice talk about not standing on tables and screaming at your mother, not biting your family or tackling the dog unless you want to get bitten in real life, not throwing dirt clods at friends, and about all of the things that were done in the movie that should never be done by kids.All that said about it being terrible for kids to see ... it also was a boring and not entertaining movie for a grown up. I saw a friend with their kids on the way into the theater to see it and told them to not go. I recommend the same for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I simply hated it. Not sure how this is considered a children's movie. I was deeply disappointed. Please don't take your kids to see this. The movie is about broken families, depression, and anger ... with no resolutions to any of these issues. Additionally, there are some very frightening scenes. I left the theater feeling empty and confused.I was unable to figure out a moral to the movie since there were no resolutions to any problems introduced in the film. Maybe the moral is that life sucks and that's the way it will always be? Yeah... it WAS that bad.If you must see it for yourself, rent it. See something more worthwhile in the theaters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Where the Wild" has a very striking beginning, not only for those who has a child alone, but also so that was a brother or older sister who neglected her brother or father who can not give the necessary attention to child (a), it really grabs the viewer, much also for the great performance of Max Records, we all knew that the film it was not solely that, but he had an adventure behind, although at some point the message that the film passes is confused, Spike Jonze script is linear, photography of the film is great, as the characterizations of the monsters as fear and at the same time not really are great, as the soundtrack is also good mixing children's songs the melancholic, "Where the Wild Things are" is a film average to good, but it is beautiful to see, shows the world's view of a child without friends, about friendship, about the importance of family residence, and technically it it is also good (do not understand why there are so many negative reviews), is not a children's film is a film for you help learn how to interpret all the feelings that they have, do not watch "Where the monsters live" hoping to have a cinematic experience or a life lesson, watch for fun and have a different view about people, their relationships and the world.Forgive my English by google translator.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Rest of the Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Huggo's review on the home page starts telling the story halfway through, ignoring Max's desperate unhappiness about his parents' split, his wish to be acknowledged by his mother and sister, his lack of friends, and his fear that his world is splintering and the sun will die. Of course Max is acting out. Wouldn't you? The beasts he encounters are each a fraction of Max's conflicted feelings - love, loss, desertion, need for friends, anger - and themselves behave like both children and adults. The voices are marvelously done. As at least one reviewer discovered, this isn't a movie for little children. I scored it a 10 for being an intelligent movie for adults. If you have little kiddies, continue reading the book to them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Depressing, confusing rubbish. The cinematography is lovely (although I will forever hate the "you're-part-of- the-scene" jerking and weaving camera technique), CG effects are stellar, and the actors absolutely deliver, but the storyline is from Mars. I'm going for a pun and referring to the Roman god, Mars, because this movie is at war with everything - the original story, imagination, adults, siblings, giving instead of always taking...! If you're not one hundred percent paying attention to Max, you're against him. I kept wondering who was this move made for? Who is the audience? It's certainly not the little kids who are introduced to this venerable story in library readings or by loving parents, other family or similar. I have loads of fond memories reading this to my eldest nephew because he loved nothing more than to wrestle and we had great times growling and howling as we read the book together and then ran and wrestled to our hearts' content. So how on earth this story was taken and made into the complex, depressing, socio-anthropological "remark" that it is and only made me think of the dreaded "Lord of the Flies," story... I don't know! Fortunately the DVD cost me only $5 and it's going into the trash. Not even going to donate it to some charity. Rubbish it is, into the rubbish it will go. P&gt;S&gt; The DVD extra having to do with getting a dog to bark and run was MUCH more fun and rewarding to watch. That bit felt more like the childhood the book captured - lost in a world separate from the real one, than the movie did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About As Good As it Could Have Been</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was curious about this movie. It seemed to receive rather mixed reviews. Having read the book once or twice as a kid I was curious, plus all the wild things just looked really cool. For the most part I wasn't disappointed. It's about as good as I expected. Where the Wild Things Are has an interesting plot. It's different, for sure, but it's not different enough to catch your attention on it's own. Unfortunately, it wasn't presented very well. It involved mostly watching a bunch of fuzzy monsters having fun, as well as a short montage of fuzzy monsters building and a bit of arguing among the fuzzy monsters. While there were some character struggles, they weren't significant enough to make this movie anything more than what it was. The characters are done well for the most part. Max feels and acts like a child his age, and the wild things have their individual personalities that are relatively clear from the beginning. Unfortunately they never really go deeper than the clichés in which they embody. Nevertheless, they were still good enough not to ruin the movie. The visuals are probably the best part of this movie. The wild things themselves look super good, and their designs are unique and quite awesome. The other visuals are great too, which is definitely a plus. Overall Where the Wild Things Are is just good. It's not flawless, but it is well-done. The characters aren't horribly original, but they have personalities at least, the idea is interesting but not incredibly well-done, and the visuals are very good. Like I said, it's about as good as it could be. I can't think of any way to make this movie better or change any part of it. It was just good. In the end I'd recommend this movie, but don't expect some sort of underrated masterpiece with this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where the Ideas Are.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where the Wild Things Are (2009): Dir: Spike Jonze / Cast: Max Records, Catherine Keener, Mark Ruffalo, Pepita Emmerichs, Steve Mouzakis: Based on the children's book about emotion. Max is out of control and his lack of friendships allow him to retreat to his imagination. After running away from home he ends up on a remote island where he encounters numerous friendly beasts whom believe him to be their King. Interesting and detailed relationships within these creatures with director Spike Jonze backed with convincing creatures. This is not the inventive achievement that his Being John Malkovich is. Max Records as the boy is the one broad performance. We sense his need for friendship but he also begins to see where responsibility sets in. Why he isn't punished for running away is beyond me. Catherine Keener is too brief as his mother who tries to deal with her son's behavior. We see nothing of her until the conclusion. Mark Ruffalo is a talented actor underused greatly as Keener's boyfriend. He seems to disappear after Records runs away. Pepita Emmerichs should have had more screen time as Records' sister. Steve Mouzakis plays Max's teacher, which is nothing above standard. The special effects are top notch with these creatures and the world they inhabit but the story is nothing to go wild over. Strong message of self control but the film is way too intense for young children. Score: 6 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enjoyable fantasy that can be distinctly downbeat at times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Max is a lonely nine year old boy; he feels ignored by his busy mother and his older sister. After his sister's friends smash his snow-fort with him inside his anger gets the better of him. After an argument with his mother he bites her and runs away from home. He then sails away to an island where he discovers strange creatures. One of then seems rather like Max; he is a troll like creature named Carol who is smashing the houses of the other creatures. He is upset that female Wild Thing named KW has left. Max starts to help him and understandably the others aren't pleased and threaten to eat him. He tells them that he has powers and once was a king of the Vikings? this leads to them making him their king. As king they expect him to make things okay. Shortly afterwards KW returns which pleases Carol. He tries and initially things go well; they build a huge fort where they can all live and play games. Things don't go as planned though; feelings are hurt and jealousies emerge and KW leaves again; Carol blames Max.This film is quite delightful despite being distinctly downbeat at times. As it opens it looks as if Max will be an unlikeable protagonist as he is clearly out of control. The fact that he wears a wolf costume and bites his mother only emphasises this. Luckily once he gets to the island where the Wild Things live he gets more likable. The events on the island nicely mirror events in his life with Carol being the one out of control. The Wild Things are well designed; I like the fact that director Spike Jonze chose to use people in suits rather than the CGI that seems ubiquitous these days. This gives then a physical presence. Early on I thought this was very much a children's film but despite the young protagonist and the sort of creatures one finds in children's story's it does include grown up themes. There are moments that may scare younger viewers? most notably when Carol threatens to eat Max and he end up hiding in inside KW's stomach! The cast do a solid job; young Max Records does a fine job as Max and the Wild Things are voiced by a variety of well-known actors including James Gandolfini, Lauren Ambrose, Catherine O'Hara and Forest Whitaker. Overall this is a bittersweet film that I enjoyed far more than I expected.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lacking punch and drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Where the Wild Things Are" doesn't need much of an introduction. An adaptation of the classic children's book by Maurice Sendak, it tells the story of Max, a troubled boy who, after an argument with his mother, transports himself to a magical land of friendly monsters where he is king. After playing around on his make-believe island for a while, Max learns some lessons about the importance of love and compromise and returns home to his worried mother with a new sense of maturity.Indie darling Spike Jonze was an obvious match for this film and he does a good job of bringing the fantastical world of Max's adventure to life. The cinematography is great and, as Sophia Coppola would say, every shot looks like a photograph. The monsters are brilliantly brought to life using a mix of CGI and good old fashioned costume, giving them an interesting appearance and movement on screen which adds to the fantastic deadpan script. You won't find any silly kids voices a la Pixar here, instead the monsters interact like twenty-something flat-sharing Brooklynites bickering over who's left their dirty dishes in the sink. And this is where we come across the first awkward element of the film - if "Where the Wild Things Are" is for kids then a lot of the humour will be over their heads, and the slow pace of the story will bore them to tears. If "Where the Wild Things Are" is for adults then a lot of the humour will be appreciated but the slow pace of the story will bore them to tears.There's no escaping that for all the wonderful cinematography and funny script, the film loses it's way after about 30 minutes and just becomes, well, dull. Once Max arrives on the island there's no real climax and we're presented instead with little more than a string of scenes showing him play, sleep and explore with the monsters. The crux of the story - Max's realisation that the world isn't perfect and that all beings have flaws, including his mother, sister and (presumably absent) father - should have been built up more as this would have given much needed weight to the film. Given Spike Jonze's background in commercials and music videos I'm not really surprised that we have this problem; he's great at short, attention-grabbing visuals, but on feature films I just don't think he cuts it. I felt the same way about "Adaptation" - a film with great potential that was let down by a focus on aesthetics and no emotional backbone.Overall I was impressed stylistically with "Where the Wild Things Are"; the direction, cinematography, script and voiceovers are great and Max Records is very good in the role of Max, demonstrating a naturalness that's rare in child actors. On a less superficial level though I felt it lacked punch and drama; this is a film that could have been so much more but instead proves to be a textbook case of style over substance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not necessarily a kids movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Max is a rambunctious brat. He's imaginative and often wears a wolf costume. He plays around with his sister Claire's friends but they make him cry. He's angry at Claire and trashes her room. His mother Connie (Catherine Keener) is struggling and is dating Adrian (Mark Ruffalo). Feeling uncared for, he runs away wearing his wolf costume. He boards a small boat which then sails the high seas to an unknown land inhabited by large wild beasts. Max convinces the creatures that he is the king with magical powers who could even keep out the sadness.Director Spike Jonze has filled out a pretty thin story with a good sense of wonder and a lot of childhood angst. The kid fits the role quite well. I think the creatures are terrific especially as they smash things. It is the confused child's struggles that is the heart of the movie. It may not be for little kids but it is a fine movie about something deeper.</fullReview>

First-off, it is visually delightful, mixing stark realism with absurdist fantasy as only someone like Joze (and Zendak, of course), who understands the chaos-logic counterpoint childhood fantasy and real-world comprehension (the way kids rationalise experience through play) can manage. The puppetry (the 21st-century equivalent of 'H.R.Pufnstuf', which delighted me as a kid) is excellent, the voicework by 'wild things' Forrest Whittaker, the mighty Chris Cooper, Ms Ambrose (sigh!) and the late James Gandolfini is exemplary</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really wanted to like this film. An adaptation of Maurice Sendak's classic children's story, where Max, a disobedient little boy sent to bed without his supper, creates his own world - a forest inhabited by ferocious wild creatures who crown Max as their ruler. You could say that the film is built on a firm base. But it's also one big pile of self-obsession. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them. My rating is 7 out of 10 and that's being quite generous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jonze's Wild Thing of an Imagination Works Wonders</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A three hundred-thirty eight word book is successfully transformed into a feature-length movie of wonderment and the joie de vivre of childhood. More so than the limited themes of Maurice Sendak's award-winning children's book, director Spike Jonze's adaptation adds a depressive psychoanalytic spin of what it means to rule in a world filled with Things with "monsters" of their own problems.Max, the son of a presumed divorced household, spends his time alone. He seeks a more imaginative camaraderie that neither his mother nor his older sister can satiate. Max must confront his "inner demons" in order to introspectively overcome his anger and loneliness.Freud would have a field day with this film, and it is my certain belief that Jonze intentionally drove the plot in this direction. Each Wild Thing has a unique personality somehow tailored to Max's ego, and Max, as "King" of these Wild Things, must learn to make them all happy.The psychoanalytic spin is accompanied by a truly spectacular score by the Yeah Yeah Yeah's and wonderful Jim Henson animatronics. However, I find that this adult-themed tailoring is done at the cost of depriving the film of any tailoring towards children. While children may enjoy the film for both the visual awe of the Wild Things as well as a resonance with the protagonist Max, much of the substantive content will have gone over the children's heads.Again, I believe this is an intentional move on Jonze's part, and it had worked out in his favor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WHERE THE WILD THINGS AREThis is really not what I was expecting...The movie is about a boy who is having trouble at home. He feels lonely and has a few problems, so when he runs away and finds an island with the weird mythical creatures on, he can't help but feel he belongs there.I was fully expecting this film to be a really feel good family film, but it was actually quite sad. The boy is so annoying in the movie. His character is horrible. I did feel sorry for him at some points of the movie, but in general he was a little monster. The creatures he found on the island were also going through a few problems of their own and they looked at the boy to help them fix everything and mistook him for their king.The effects were very impressive in this. The costumes were very good and they creatures actually moved really well considering the size of them.The movie is actually quite dark and depressing. There were some very funny moments, but in general it is quite a serious movie. I have never read the book, but to be honest, I am not sure that I would read it. The movie was enjoyable enough, but I didn't like it enough to read it or go out of my way to see a sequel if they made it.The acting was really well done. Even by the little boy. Kids generally can't act very well... they are more annoying, but Max Records did a great job. I can't fault him at all.I don't know really what was wrong with this movie. Nothing really. It is good, but I was just expecting more, and I was expecting it to be different... but it is good and recommend it if you like dramas.I will give this film 6 out of 10."Will you keep out all the sadness?"For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maurice Sendak would be proud of this adapted version of his classic children's tale about a lonely boy named Max. Catherine Keener is terrific as his mother in her supporting role. The film is about Max tried to connect with his sister, Claire, who has grown into a teenager. So Max escapes to a magical world where he is king of the wild creatures or things are. In this film version, the voices are distinct with the creatures in big costumes. They are faithful to the book's initial image with their teeth and size. Max is wearing a wolf costume which never made sense to me. The film elaborates where the book doesn't to explain what happened on the island. The voices are done by well-known James Gandolfini, Catherine O'Hara, and Chris Cooper. I was surprised to see this film done in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia as a location. The film is true to the story about Max's quest to connect with the world around them as it is changing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Childhood is a dangerous place, and this movie knows it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Children live high stakes lives. Left on their own, they die. Parents provide not just guidance, but the sustained illusion that simply being and playing are enough. All will be well. And maybe that's true. Maybe that's why we like it when movies remind us what life looks like through children's eyes. Where The Wild Things Are is acutely aware of this longing and ? alarmingly ? exploits it as a vulnerability. This movie is for grownups. My parents divorced when I was Max's age. The ensuing custody battle was long, bitter, transformational. Suddenly my parents were normal people capable of spite and weakness. The "magic bubble" burst, and instead of quietly playing LEGO all day, Kid Remiel was now screaming horrible things at his despairing, lonely mother. He dreaded coming home from school with an intensity he'd previously not known a heart could muster, and words like "hate" and "rage" took on the muscular realness better left on a shelf until adulthood.Where The Wild Things Are will take you to your own version of that place. There was a time when a petty thing like not being allowed to stay up late felt like the worst fate imaginable. And there was another time when the grownups' world cracked open around you, and you had to come to grips with their pain and fear, when the bubble was at its thinnest.The prologue to Where The Wild Things Are is an emotional train wreck: a string of harrowing events that occur in minutes, feel like hours, and linger in memory for the rest of the movie. No one is killed or traumatized; nothing happens that would make the evening news. We simply see Max's protective bubble in the process of bursting. He "acts out" just a bit harder and louder than the other moms at your book club would tell you is normal. He trashes his sister's room, and bites Mom on the shoulder, hard. She demands to know "What's WRONG with you?", and his face says she may as well have bitten him back.And then: the land of the Wild Things. Maurice Sendak's original 1969 children's book is a mere 339 words long (I just counted). Instead of deciding what to throw out, the filmmakers had to grow a small story with big ideas into a feature length film that honors those ideas. The movie brings Sendak's monstrous cast to horned, hairy life with what looked to me like a combination of grownups wearing "big puppet" suits, and CGI for their facial expressions and stunts.This gives Max Records (the improbably named actor playing Max) a tangible ensemble of beasts to interact with. It's hard to imagine a green screen approach working nearly as well. But I don't want to sell the actor short. Records' performance is not just "good for a child actor". It's masterful, mature work. Oscar-worthy. He is just what we are told he is: an angry, confused child lost in a dangerous wilderness. Even when his face dominates the frame, responding to off-screen events, he is completely real. For nearly the entire movie, his is the only human face we see. There is not one inauthentic moment.The film develops each of the book's illustrated Wild Things into a distinct character, and pits their frailties against each other so as to make Max's presence among them the key to everything. The monsters collectively represent Max's psyche, splintered and refracted so each embodies a particular characteristic. Two of the Wild Things are more important than the others: Carol and KW. The film's various symbols are not intended to be a neat and tidy paint-by-numbers game, but it's fair to say that Carol (a male monster voiced by James Gandolfini) mostly represents the "here and now" Max (angry, confused, at war with Mom), and KW (Lauren Ambrose) is a combination of Mom and Max's sister.After cajoling the Wild Things into not eating him, and then making him their king, Max sets them to work building what looks like a wooden Death Star. Between construction sessions they play games, sleep in an intimate "monster-pile" formation, laugh, fight, and gradually come to see Max for what he is: a kid in his pajamas. For his part, Max plays the parent for his monsters long enough to see himself in each of them, and finally decides it's time to sail home and take responsibility for what he's done.It's the intensity of the fantasy scenes that keeps things firmly in the world of adults. These monsters are dangerous. Max's "fantasy adventure" is on par with an impulsive child's reckless sprint down a busy highway. He could really get hurt. Though Max befriends his monster companions, the sense of peril never diminishes. In the end, the Wild Things may finally tear off his head and eat him anyway, not because they are "wild", but because they are enraged and losing control.The film is bound to challenge parents. First, it is scary and upsetting. Perhaps worse, it suggests Max's reconciliation with his mom is mostly on his own shoulders, at least for now. It's unclear whether Max's father is dead or divorced, and since when. What's certain is that while Max's mom is a "good" one, he feels unappreciated by her and his sister, and threatened by Mom's boyfriend. Meanwhile, Mom is divided three ways: working full time, being a mother, and trying to rekindle her love life. It's messy, it sucks, and it's no one's "fault".Fantasy it may be, but this movie is real. I can't think of a book that has been more effectively adapted for the screen. Wild Things the book and Wild Things the movie feel like companion pieces that depend on each other. Watching the film helped me appreciate the book even more, and re-reading the book makes me want to head back to the theater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Huh, that was something</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard about this I thought it was going to be loved by a lot of people, but this was at a less educated time of my life. To my surprise it turns out this film was sorta mixed between viewers. Looking at it now I might be able to pick up why, but also be able to disagree. When I started the film I was greeted by the shocking scene of a boy in costume; that looks like a giant rabbit, holding a fork and chasing a dog. Luckily if you read the book in your childhood you'd know this was a callback to the opening in the book, because otherwise some could say he's a psychotic child. Anyways he proceeds to ambush his sister and friends with snowballs, but is utterly shocked how they destroy his igloo. Well what'd you expect? But it is halve and halve: he started it and the teens took it a little too far. Later that night, he gets into a fight with his mother while her boyfriend is over, and then Max runs out in anger. I find it funny that Max says " feed me women", even though it's completely disrespectful to anyone, still gets a chuckle out of me. Max finds a boat and decides to go out for a ride. Where do you find plain old wooden boats now a days anyway? So he manages to survive after starvation and probably hypothermia, and arrives on an island. He finds some monsters destroying some huts, and decides to join them. The main monster: Carol, says " he gets it", while The other monsters act the same way the average viewer would seeing iconic children's book character being turned into a live action film: huh? That's all I'll say about the plot for now, my thoughts: it's good, just...good. I mean, it's not bad, it does have questionable moments. Though it does ask viewers to think more about this film, which I appreciate. It does have symbolism, but what's great is that it's not entirely easy to tell what they are. In the end, it's a good movie, and it deserves to be watched, with friends especially.</fullReview>

I could care less about the characters, the plot was unattractive and nothing exciting happened in the movie. The actors might as well have been watching paint dry while the audience watched as well. Among all these bad films is one that I think about constantly. And unlike films that I love that never escape my mind, there is one film that for me just didn't work in any way shape or form. I hate this film to the letter. I would never suggest anyone see it nor would I even watch it ever again. You could not pay me to watch this film. This movie is based off the enormously popular children's book, which I read and had read to me as a child. I have not read the book in several years but remember a majority of it. When the movie was announced, I was skeptical that they could make a decent feature length film out of a teeny tiny kids book. When the film came out, critics all over loved it and said it was one of the best films of the year and the decade. These are very bold statements, and shouldn't be taken light heartedly. However, I decided to trust the critics and see the film, which was being shown in the IMAX. I saw it in IMAX because I have a firm belief that the IMAX can enhance any films experience because of the larger screen. However, the movie backfired big. Now, to be fair, I have listened to people that defend this movie and say it's a masterpiece. I think they are full of crap, but I respect their opinion nonetheless. After all, somebody's got to like the movie or else they wouldn't sell DVDs. I wasn't the only one turned off either. Parents were stunned at the thematic elements in the film and how it wasn't even in the same ballpark as a kid's movie. Kids cried and had to leave, and believe it or not, not a single person had a smile on their face when the movie ended. Not one. What was wrong with the film? How about a more simple question. What was not wrong with the film? The answer? Nothing. Everything was wrong with the film. The story was nothing like the book. How the kid got to the place where the wild things were was complete bogus and made up for the film. Then when he gets there it takes him five minutes to convince these beasts that he is their king, like these morons are going to believe him. Then the film spends over an hour showing the boy king and the wild things roughly playing around, building random and irrelevant things and piling on top of one another. The wild things all have adult type issues and seem to be bipolar throughout the film. The wild things were a combination of actors is suits and CGI. Some big name movie stars lent their voices to the wild things, which didn't make them any more special. Then after getting depressed because the sun is dying and one girl wild thing hates the main guy wild thing, everyone is up s**t creak. Eventually, the boy decides to leave because he is now bored of them doesn't say good-bye to a single one, but instead just sails away and returns home to where his mom has been worried sick. She doesn't say anything though and simply hugs and kisses him to death. The film ends with the mom falling asleep at the dinner table while the kid eats dinner. Safe and sound, she doesn't care where he has been because she's just glad he's home. This can in no way be defined as a kids or family film. It's too depressing. This is more like a thematic drama that's so depressing; you'll easily find this on the shelf for $5 dollar movies at Target. If one good thing came from watching this convoluted piece of crap, it's that I now know what to avoid putting into a supposed kid film. Ugh, this movie puts a real bad taste in my mouth. Whenever I see a copy of this movie on a store shelf for sale, I just want takes all the copies and burn them. This is one film that no matter how hard people try, I will never understand why anyone liked this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A trip down Nostalgia Lane</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where the Wild Things Are is a favorite childhood classic of mine, I've loved the book forever, I think much of my generation did. So when a movie was coming out I have to admit that I was a little put back, because it honestly didn't look that good to me. But there were a ton of excellent reviews on IMDb but I just waited till the rental and I'm honestly glad that I did. Pretty much lived up to what I thought it would be, nothing special or spectacular. While the film captures what we imagined as children, that was what it's flaw was as well. See, I was hoping that a newer generation would be introduced to this magical story but I think it was more meant for the adults who grew up with the story vs. the new generation who may have not read the book yet. It was sort of dull and lifeless, I don't know maybe it's because I'm grown up now but I'm pretty sure it's the movie because I know I'm not the only one who felt like this. Though the movie is done right, I think that the setting is what put it off and made this into a somewhat dead movie.Max is a lonely eight-year-old boy with an active imagination whose parents are divorced, wearing a wolf costume and chasing his dog. His mother, Connie invites her boyfriend to dinner. Max becomes upset with his mother for not coming to the fort he made in his room. He wears his wolf costume, acts like an animal, and demands to be fed. When his mother gets upset, he throws a tantrum and bites her on the shoulder. She yells at him and he runs away. Max reaches an island. Still in his wolf costume, he stumbles upon a group of six large, monstrous creatures. They think that he's very tough and one of them so they declare him to be the king of the land. While on the island Max learns about who he truly is and the creatures start to question if he is one of them.I'm really not trying to put the movie down, it just didn't feel anything special to me. I honestly felt that this was just more intended for the adults that grew up with the story because it was a trip down nostalgia lane. The costumes seemed a bit off to me and the celebrity voices that were provided didn't seem necessary. Also Max was too much of a brat in the beginning, even though it's like that in the book, it seems a little to the extreme in the movie. Mainly because we don't know his motive for why he would be acting up so badly. The setting was also so dead, to the point where visually the film became a little boring to me, I wanted color and excitement, after all, this is a kid's imagination! However, I feel bad for all the complaining because it still did have the same magic of the story. It brought the little kid back into us and even if it wasn't intended for the kids, maybe that's what it was meant for, to bring us back to a more innocent time where our imagination was limitless and the world was in front of us as a toy and the future held so much.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I, myself in my early twenties, although watch a lot of animated flicks. But I can't be make up my mind for which age group was this movie made for.The little ones will love watching the special effects and other icing on the cake. But to actually understand the allegory hidden in the story, you have to be an adult. There is a link between the kid's real life and a fantasy world.It can be a little tiring for the regular adult viewers (read, men). However beautiful photography can make the movie watchable. Recommended for that mother-child quality time; watch it together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't really know what I expected from this film. I didn't know anything about the children's book which this is based on, but I had heard that the book is mostly images and not much text. One might get the idea that it will be a visually cute but substanceless film. So I went to see this film without knowing anything much about it which opened for a objective opinion on the result.The beginning felt for me a bit blank, just nothing to grip me to attention. The film proceed in this kind of slow pace for quite some time. The tone of the beginning is kind of gloomy. A sad atmosphere is not a bad thing but here it doesn't work that well it just enhances a dull feel. The characters that we are introduced to don't feel really interesting at all. My hopes for the film at this point fall low. But luckily it gets better. After a dull opening the adventure at least somewhat takes of. The "wilds" shows up and the fun starts. The humor works very well some of the jokes and funny scenes are such that viewers of all ages can laugh at. After some time of fun the plot changes somewhat and so deeper points are brought up. Thease twists in the story are absolutely not anything unique, some things feel like the average important to learn things for the young viewers. Still even with that said the plot works well to keep one interested. Even though the story isn't anything groundbreaking it adds enough substance to the plot and characters to make the film very worth seeing. The sadness that felt dull and not working in the beginning comes later to become the strong point of the story. In the end a kind of average kind of stuff gets so well carried out.Technically the film is very good. The wild things look great. They look realistic even if at the same time look like big teddy bears. There face expressions and movements are so great that the most unrealistic characters in the film come to be the ones the viewer feels the most for. The acting is overall okay but some of the humans feel somewhat stiff. The wild things make an better performance and it can't just be thanks to the technical aspects. The music is well chosen. It might be the kind of tunes that one expects when you see the first picture of one of the wild things but it works great the create the right feel for the film. However one point of criticism I must stat is the camera work. They often use the kind of shaky camera and it doesn't work all that good. Especially in the beginning it causes the picture to seem pretty dizzy, The Bourne Supremacy kind of problem.Now to summarize my thoughts of the film. Where the wild things are is a very well made film. The visuals, humor and most of the characters work great. Still it lacks somewhat in substance. The depth that the film has is in the characters but the story is not more than alright. Still this is a review from a well pretty grown up perspective and kids will most likely find Where the wild things are a very entertaining film. However it does not have the magic that I think many thought it would. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film with an abundance of charm - and 7 foot tall monsters.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WTWTA is based upon the book we all read as kids but likely have no recollection of. It is about a kid named Max and his antics with giant mythical beasts. It was more a book about imagination and vibrant illustrations than it was the outline of a 90 minute feature film, yet here we are.In the film, Max is still a kid. His Mum, Catherine Keener is often preoccupied by work, and also doing a little dating. Therefore Max at times feels unloved and ignored, so once he hears a "positivity" speech given by his schoolteacher, along the lines of "we are all insignificant, we will all die, the World will die", and so on.Max is a kid as mentioned before, and has a kid's vivid imagination, wears outfits, and has adventures through the house and in the backyard. While attempting to gain Mum's attention, Max goes a little over the line and they clash, leading to Max making a bolt for the door and fanging down the street as his Mum cries in vain for him to return. In real life a kid like Max, in the US at least going by all reports would be on Ritinol or a similar downer, if only for Mum's sanity.Max ends up through the woods at the shore of what may be a lake, he comes across a dinghy, (no explanation is given as to whether Max knew it was there or not), and immediately sets off in a straightline offshore.Max is sailing (dinghy-ing?) for a looo-oong time, and there comes a storm that immediately shows us Max is on no lake, but a vast expanse of surging ocean. The next thing we know Max has washed ashore, where after a while he overhears some voices ahead of him, voices that sound no different to those at most barbecues or New York subways. As he nears the group the images come into focus and it is clear that these voices do not belong to campers or a Boy Scout group, even though they are in the middle of the woods in pitch black darkness lurking around a fire, but a bunch of 7 foot (plus) tall furry, and often horned and tailed behemoths, each weighing more than 10 Max's.Rather than do another bolt, the confidence provided by the ignorance of youth has Max actually go up to confront and meet the Wild Things, with false bravado to match he comes up with a long and rambling story that paints him as some sort of superhero adventurer, all while wearing a sheep-suit. So convincing is the story that the Wild Things anoint Max as their new pint sized King. After threatening him with being treated like an entree that is.It turns out that the wild imagination of a 10 year old sounds pretty impressive to a bunch of vaguely depressed giant humanesque creatures, no matter how far-fetched they are.The next morning brings the Wild Things into the light, so we can see exactly how cool their designs and effects are - they are like Banana Splits without the perpetual toothy smiles and zany outfits. They are all similar yet distinctly original, and they most definitely have their own personalities, hopes, aspirations, deficiencies and idiosyncrasies. As mentioned before they each speak like normal everyday people, which I guess if you believe enough to allow the thought of 7 foot hairy horned talking beasts, it isn't that far to go to think that they might sound like us too.During the initial stages of Max's "reign", things go rosy for all, and in one especially charming scene the Wild Things pile onto Max and each other, which even though it could end in a crushed kid, actually ends up apparently cosy and comforting, like a big sexless pile-on with a heap of big fat hairy guys.Of course being a movie the good times don't go on forever, and dissent builds in the ranks as certain Wild Things feel Max is playing favorites. Max pacifies the throng with the answer to many a preteen argument... A boundie fight. So we basically have a bunch of super strong giant beasts hurling hefty chunks of dirt and rock at each other, probably not a good recipe for a ten year old boy.The movie doesn't really build as much as elapse, with events moving forward without much in the way of climax or massive action sequences. Jonze is trying to make a film that shows what it is like to be a kid, only many of the kids have pituitary issues and an excess of body hair. This is where WTWTA excels, it is hard to explain but this film has an abundance of charm. The film doesn't bother trying to explain itself and also doesn't try to second guess itself by being too clever.Where the Wild Things are is simply a story well told. How this film ends isn't important, neither is the action and events within, this is more a film about enjoying the journey. If you shut your brain off to rational thought (giant monsters talking like tax drivers?) and just watch the thing perhaps you might just find this very enjoyable.Actually, my best advice is to think like you're a 10 year old kid again. Then you'll enjoy it far more.Final Rating - 7 / 10. Ignore the basic plot and simple storyline, oft times genuine charm is severely underrated in films. There is abundance of that here.P.S. My initial draft criminally overlooked mentioning the soundtrack music - somehow I think that without each other both soundtrack and the film would be the lesser for it.If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful adaptation of a beloved children's story...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1st watched 10/28/2010 ? 8 out of 10 (Dir-Spike Jonze): Wonderful adaptation of a beloved children's story by Director Spike Jonze. In this film version, a young 9-year old is having a hard time coping with changes in his family(like his mom dating a new boyfriend), and runs away from home after biting his mother. His imagination takes over in the movie, and he hops on a boat across a sea and journeys to an island inhabited by the wild things. The boy, Max(played by a real life Max, as well, Max Records), appoints himself king of their world(because they need one but ate their last few), but finds out it's not so easy to make everyone happy(but at least he doesn't get eaten). The movie is filmed from the child's point of view but there is also a lesson that is learned eventually and that combination makes the film work. The wild things are funny, cuddly at times, and all have different personality types. The main character, Karen, ends up appearing like the child's character and others look to match up to other real personalities in Max's real life(similar to the Wizard of Oz). The development of the real characters aren't there so it's really hard to match them up unfortunately, and that is one downside of the movie. Jonze does a good job of telling the story and not getting too sappy. The movie would be enjoyable for kids and adults, in my opinion, and so he hits all people. Bring a child, but enjoy it yourself also!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movies brings back memories of when you were forced to read the book version and didn't know or understand how to appreciate it.When you're younger you read it just because, but now watching the movie years later helps to understand the moral of the story. I connected this movie with my childhood when my privileges were taken away as a result of acting out, and I would throw tantrums and after sitting by myself and calming down I realized that life goes on or what I got mad about was not even worth getting mad at. This was just like what happened with the young boy in the movie Max Records. Also, whoever chose the musical artist for this movie knew exactly how to match the music style to the story itself and the whimsical characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen people saying this movie is not for kids and more for adults... I would like to make the argument that this is THE perfect movie for kids. I'm totally aware that it doesn't hold the same draw as 'Despicable Me' or 'Shrek' - If your child is expecting something like those movies or just has a poor attention span they probably wont get very far with this... However for a kid with stick-ability I can see this being a totally enlightening and enriching experience. I must have seen this movie for the first time when I was about 14 and it always stuck out in my memory - now I've finally got back to watching it again and writing this review. Although this movie may seem dreamlike it's also strangely realistic with its flawed but deep feeling characters and its life lessons that emerge throughout. Such as realization of the limits of efficacy - (nothing is going to be exactly how we want it to be). You could also argue that it's a film about being misunderstood which is what I think this film is to some people. You could also argue that its about many other things, but I reckon that's what makes this film pretty good in my opinion. Do we always need the themes of a movie spelled out to us?</fullReview>

We bought this for $3 at Best Buy, without knowing much, if anything, about it. Now I know why it was $3. I just don't understand what the purpose of this movie was. It certainly didn't seem like it would appeal to children, and I don't see how it would appeal to adults.

		<fullReview>Holy naked mole rat Batman, what was that? Never since Bridge to Terabithia have I felt so down after a movie. But this was a completely different kind of down. Terabithia shocked us and sent us off with a message of moving on and hope. WTWTA ends on the same gloomy note that dominates the whole thing. If its intended goal was to make the viewer feel the hurt and confusion of a kid that does not have his mothers full attention anymore then its a stroke of genius. Otherwise it is just a disturbingly depressing waste of time. There is zero development throughout the entire plot. When Max sails away from his magical island of either blatantly obvious (his sister plays with other boys) or just plain confusing (basically everybody else) metaphors for his inner workings I felt like watching a methhead stagger from a two hour session with a therapist back into a side alley where he will get his next fix. None of the monsters are any happier or have learned anything. The one with the female name is just bound to smash everything to bits again. If there was any development at all then it was for the worse: Chicken head lost his arm. Just like that. But hey, at least he could still joke about it and now has a swag stick poking out from his right side.The story got one thing right and that is purveying the moment when smiles turn to tears. Several times we are treated with happy music and playfulness just to look at a grimace of sadness or a 'joke' gone wrong the next moment. But instead of resolving those conflicts we are left hanging in the gloom.3 stars for the seamless merging of what looked like furry costumes with CG faces.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I took my 4.5 year old and he wanted to go home after the first fifteen minutes. At one point his body was actually shaking from fear even though he was tightly wrapped in my arms. The movie is way too intense and scary for a "G" rating. While it started out innocently, it quickly became a barrage of tense sights and sounds, hardly suitable for a child. Just when we hoped it would get better -- the violence grew worse and more senseless.Also, the scare factor is too much. My seven year old son, who is all boy, was scared from the movie. My eight year old niece had her head buried in my other daughters shoulder. Even my older daughter was shocked at it, for the age they are promoting this movie. I wish I would of known more about this movie. I would of made a different choice in what we saw today. To bad it could of been a family movie with some suspenseful scenes and excitement, instead it was a parade of blood and nightmares.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>....... and I didn't.Other reviewers have made the mistake, not unreasonably, of assuming that as a children's book, this is a children's film. It assuredly is not, being instead an over long allegorical film with only minimal plot line attached.The central character is the deeply troubled sociopath in waiting Max, the sort of mop haired urchin that American drama schools must churn out for films and TV, who frankly make me feel ill. He journeys - whether actually or in his mind is unclear - to a land inhabited by the "Wild Things", large hairy creatures who appear to lead listless and troubled lives - hey, could these represent Max and his family?? For the next ninety minutes they talk, and play games, all in doubtless a deeply "meaningful" way, before Max returns home. End of story.Allegory is a very powerful tool and can be used to great effect in both literature and film - Peter Greenaway's film "The Draughtsman's Contract" is a huge, puzzling allegory which after 25 years I still cannot work out, but it remains a stunning film on many levels. This film however is little more than pretentious rubbish. The most telling critique I suggest is that when I saw this film, of the 12 people in the audience 5 had left by 40 minutes in while the rest of us battled through to the end, each of us looking at each other as if to say "what was that about?" Avoid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"From one of the most beloved books of all time" to a terrifying, confusing, nonsensical film.'Where the wild things are', is the story of a young boy, upset with his mother and sister, he is being bullied and feeling unwelcome he runs away to a magical land where he can be king of the creatures that inhabit it. The main problem is that there are no signs of a real plot; the storyline is so complex it cannot be determined or understood.Now, obvious issues are instantly created, where did the boat come from that took him to the island? Why is he wearing a goat suit? Apart from divorce how did he get to become so mentally unhinged? All this character history aside, the majority of the film is set in a magical land, but is it a dream? Where have these things come from? Why haven't the men in black swooped in on them? None of this is answered and it leaves you with an overwhelming feeling of loneliness and bewilderment.It is however, if watched without the sound, beautiful, arty and full to the brim with imagination and creativity. The costumes are made to perfection and the acting from young Max Records is exquisite considering what he was asked to perform.Where the wild things target audience are children. That I believe is the over powering problem. The tones are dark, moody at some parts down right depressing. Children will not enjoy this film. If on the other hand it had a happy soundtrack drowning out the misery spewing from the creatures (including the goat wannabe child's) cannibalistic mouths, children would love to watch the overgrown teddy bears jump around. Spike Jonze is the director, therein lies yet another problem, famous for his highly complex story lines such as "being john malkovich", why he has decided to attempt a children's classic story is beyond me.Unfortunately because of what can only be Spike's willingness to expand his horizons', Maurice Sendak's all time favourite has been ruined.One of the most enjoyable parts of the film is the intro as 'The Arcade Fire's' Wake up song beautifully captures the tone of the film. With the lyrics "We're just a million little gods causing rainstorms turning everything into rust." This is the film were a demented child with a god complex, literally trashes things, upsets people (and monsters) and causes destruction at ever turn without any signs of remorse or discipline. Not one for the sane minded.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where the Wild Things are is not perfect, it is a little too long and sometimes rather slow too, though in regard to the latter the pacing may have been deliberate. But it is a very effective adaptation of a great story. Where the Wild Things Are is beautiful to watch, the cinematography is spellbinding, while the sceneries, character movements and colours are mesmerising for the visual senses. The soundtrack adds to the mood wonderfully, it never feels intrusive or generic, instead it is a poignant and reflective soundtrack.The story is a beautiful and affecting one, with a touch of weirdness perhaps, and the writing is very good that doesn't jar with the film's tone. The characters also add to the film's success, I can understand why people can't warm to Max but he is a complex character, I found him easy to relate to and is written adeptly. The supporting characters are weird but in a wonderful way, while the voice acting and acting are terrific especially from Max Records who is just exceptional. Overall, a beautiful, poignant and haunting film, depressing it is but that was intentional. 8/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i thought this movie was very cute and sweet. very slow going though. i mean every time i try to watch it through i fall right asleep. i think that's how it's supposed to be. it's sort of like a lulling lullaby with purposeful slow pacing to send you off to nod. and the monsters were like big, furry, stuffy, animals that make you feel safe and protected. like oddball friends.i grew up reading Maurice Sendak's books, and i can't honestly say i thought this did total justice to that wonderful book. however, i thought the director did a good job with this adaptation and it turned out rather sweetly, if not lacking a certain amount of excitement.sometimes excitement and thrills are not always required for a nice bedtime story. sometimes you want to be gently lulled to sleep with something sweet. after all, it does seem like we are turning our kids into excitement junkies. it's a little hard to get to sleep after the 'Transformers' get you all wired up.kids need to learn to appreciate a nice slow pace. it helps you to slow down your own thinking a bit. too much of a breakneck pace leads you to a fall and become a mindless wing nut. the pacing here creates some balance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure what Spike Jonze ever did to cast any doubt in my mind. Was it that the Sabotage video was so overplayed? That Adaptation was "Soooooo Po-Mo bro"? Was it that he worked with uber-cool Beastie Boys, Weezer and Daft Punk before most of us even knew who they were? Perhaps his association with the interminable Bjork? Or the f#cking Praise You video which played constantly for two years invariably accompanied by someone insisting "You know, they're all actors". His collection of films on the "Work of Director..." series was just too bloody good for me to believe he could do anything next other than drop the ball. Malkovich, Malkovich, Malkovich. The truth is, the only thing Spike ever did to annoy me was to consistently surprise me. I don't like surprises, but I can hardly hate him for being prevalent and influential can I? I've found value in everything he's done and though I understand his work will not be for everyone, it's certainly for me. And that brings us to his latest film Where the wild things are. The source material for which somehow passed by whilst I was busy not reading a whole array of other books. What's clear is it was something very close to the filmmakers heart. With Where the wild things are Jonze has captured the naivety and wonder of childhood in a way that the industry thought we'd grown out of. It reminds me of Roald Dahl books and films from my childhood like Labrynth and Flight of the Navigator. Even more so of Miyazaki's fabulous My Neighbour Totoro. There could be some sort of analysis made on what it all means and what this or that represents, the truth is it is all somehow grotesque and familiar and I'm sure quite subjective. Just let your guard down and give this one your time, it's a joy. Sure, recognising the voice of Tony Soprano is distracting but the cast overall is strong and dynamic. Catherine Keener has somehow ascended into the sub-zero realm of Kim Deal, all humans may have become obsolete next to those two, being cool as f#ck has never been exemplified quite so well. Let's be honest, Pixar and Dreamworks has gone stale, it's time more of us got back to black. Put simply, WTWTA doesn't feel CG and we need that now more than ever. When a triumphant ditty like this somehow falls on deaf ears it makes you think when a certain wild thing exclaims "We forgot how to have fun!" Thankfully not all of us did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let the wild rumpus begin.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This a beautifully crafted movie. The cinematography is great, the emotion is powerful, you like the characters, the acting is wonderful, it captures what childhood is like perfectly, and it is beyond a creative masterpiece. I simply love this movie, and I think it was one of the best of 2009. Now I may have loved it, but the fact is this isn't for everyone. It doesn't move at a fast pace at all. A child will love it, but only if they are willing to sit down and be patient with the movie experience. If the child watching is either a kid who likes action movies, or stupid slapstick family movies they will not like this movie. There is no explosions, and no slapstick. If your child can't go beyond those movie watching boundaries they won't fully enjoy it. If they can than I highly recommend this brilliant movie. It has taken a book with only like 7 sentences, (not completely sure how many exactly) and created 1 and a half hours of amazement. One thing I very much want to praise about the film is the amazing cast. The main child actor will amaze you when you learn that this great performance is fueled by a first time acting performance. Also the music is very good. Love hipster music it is just so enjoyable. The creativity here is also genius. Then we have the extremely likable characters. They all have great personalities, and relationships. The Wild Things are all characteristics of the the child who visits this world. One Wild Thing that forms a friendship with the most is sometimes a nice guy and other times a monster. This can be shone by his reaction to when one Wild Thing brings two creatures that aren't Wild Things, and he gets more than a little angry. The emotion is highly powerful, and the ending may likely get you in tears. The best thing about this movie is how it accurately shows childhood. It captures the anger that a little kid has inside him. A good example is when Max gets his snowfort crushed. Overall this film is one of the better children's movies to let your children enjoy.4 stars out of 4</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps one of the most obscure, visually stunning fairy tales of all time...perhaps way beyond its own comprehension</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where The Wild Things Are is just one of those films that I could sit around a table and talk about for hours and hours. Was it amazing...was it a huge 10/10 or was it a lack luster dud? Does it have a deeper meaning? Is there representations of emotions in the beasts? I don't know any of this. Here is what I do know...Where The Wild Things Are is absolutely visually brilliant. The special effects, and the beasts are brilliant! This film single-handedly shows the Jim Henson studio still has the sheer talent started by Henson. Instead of relying on CGI for the beasts there is something eerie, and stunning about the created monsters that come to life. Based on a book everyone is familiar with the true beauty of the film is in its visuals. The story isn't exactly epic in scale and I think that is where the movie stumbles. You have this breath taking beautiful, haunting dark fairy tale that begs for a Wizard of Oz, Alice in Wonderland type level of story but instead the story is simplistic and silly and really has no beginning, climax or end. There is no moral that is easy to see and the lead little boy is more obnoxious than fun.Relative newcomer Max Records plays Max, the little boy who runs away and discovers an island of strange exotic and eccentric beasts. Records certainly is vivacious and rambunctious almost to a fault. His character of Max is almost not likable and fits perfectly in with the beasts with his eccentric disturbed behaviour. James Gandolfini is absolutely brilliant as the voice of the larger than life Carol. His voice just simply embodies the character and is perfect for it. Same can be said for Catherine O'Hara who plays the voice of pessimist Judith. She is wonderful in her role. Chris Cooper, Lauren Ambrose, Forest Whitaker and Paul Dano are all excellent actors and their voice work is well done in the film but at the same time they are definitely over shadowed by Gandolfini and O'Hara, and the performance of Max. Small cameo roles by Mark Ruffalo and Catherine Keener are sorely underused as they are both great all around actors although Keener does a great job with the very short screen time she gets.If you take away the visuals from this movie what you'd be left with might be a 5/10 movie. I don't mean to trash the story because its sweet in many ways but this film needs to be seen for the breathtaking scenery both the monsters and the island they inhabit. There is just jaw dropping imagery. As many, many reviewers have pointed out this really isn't a film for smaller children and instead is more of a grown up fairy tale for teens and adults to enjoy. The film is probably one of the darkest 'fairy tales' I've ever seen, even darker than 1985 Disney's Return to Oz and that was dark!! This one has this feeling of sadness and despair but yet also this feeling of wild adventure at the same time. The hardest part of the film is becoming so attached to these characters and getting no true wrap up. My head swirled for sequel ideas really. Legendary music director Spike Jonze shows his skill in music videos by making this spectacle but also shows you need a strong story to create a true classic. Its fantasy, and fun, and frequently disturbing, plenty of anger issues amongst the beasts including Max and when its all said and done, much like the book the imagery will stay with you for a lifetime. 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's probably safe to say if you watch this one with your kids, you won't be spending a bright full day. A lot of negatives feelings toward the film come from the idea that it should be a childish movie filled with dreams coming true and a happy future in sight.Well just remember how it was to be a child. Have you forgot about those nightmares ? Or how often your imagination went out of control, bearing dark thoughts on life and people. Parents shouting a each others or at you and you would think it's the end of the world... Of course, now with maturity we deal with these things everyday and it's no big deal, relationship are still complicated but we somehow understand it, at least we accept it.Childhood is a place where everything is possible, every creation brings destruction and so forth, the simple cycle of life we don't grasp at this age. Adults seems so different while being the same, their actions are strange and yet they won't explain why they do the things they do so you have to imagine, from a kid's perspective.The simple idea of being acknowledged is a full time job as a kid and - as you do realize as an adult - it's hard, as you learn to control your emotions in relationships you will fall, and fall again until you find some satisfactory balance.Every scenes in the movie convey the childhood we forgot about, all the violent emotions, the sadness, fears and the struggle to understand and be understood. While some scenes/allegories might appear gloomy or rough, it's just the way you experienced it not the way you wanted it to be in your memory.Overall the film isn't "dark" but it's definitely not Disney-like bright which is refreshing with genuine touching moments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too dang weird</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My friend suggested renting this film, and it looked interesting because I remember reading the story when I was a kid. Both my friend and I had a tough time understanding the style of filmmaking for this movie. It appears the filmmakers tried so hard to produce an artistic and abstract style (which I do support) that seemed like it was marketed for kids but it has adult theme. The characters are so deep and weird that it's difficult to be entertained with nonsensical adventure and gloomy cinematography. Even the 3D animated characters are animated so super realistically (sort of like Final Fantasy: The Spirits within), that they're facial expressions don't seem to be animated and alive. I also felt the melancholy soundtrack was annoying after a while. And who are the intended audience? It's too depressing for kids and too nonsensical and boring for adults.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Suited for Adults that Loved the Children's Book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where The Wild Things Are takes the setting of the 1963 children's book and adds more story and detail to the simple tale. Although the book is well-suited for children, I believe this film is intended for teenagers and adults that loved the book at a young age. Much of the film might haunt children as I did not expect the level of tension and sadness that I received. The clever first twenty minutes are promising. It is a terrific alternative to what occurred in the book and certainly won't make any fans angry. In fact, the entire film will make fans of the book smile. This Spike Jones adaptation is true to its' source material and then some. The acting is surprisingly effective and the characters were nicely voiced. The technology, going back-and-forth between CGI and real costumes, gave the film a fantastic look but also gave it an independent-type feel. The flaws however are too big to dismiss. The events that occur throughout the movie are extremely forgettable which is sad because this is one of the most original films of the year. Once the credits started to roll, I felt much of the film was pointless in a way that not much occurred throughout the film. An under whelmed feeling. Nonetheless, I believe Spike Jones created a film that will hit the classic status years from now for its' originality, simplicity, outstanding characters, and imaginative world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film is CRAZY..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to figure out why anybody thought this was a story worth writing down, let alone filming. Let me get this straight: you're annoyed at your sister not helping you out after her friends jump on you in the snow, you're sick of your mom neglecting you because she's spending time with her new bf and you certainly don't want frozen corn for tea. So whaddya do? Why, you trample slush all over your sibling's room, you bite your mom on the shoulder and then you run away from home in an animal suit complete with tail. RRiigghhtt.. Wait, I haven't got to the best part. You find a boat, and you set sail for a MYSTERIOUS LAND, full of strange creatures which oddly enough, look like Fraggle Rock rejects. Because that's exactly what they are. Anyway, you elect yourself their king, and being the simple, gullible beasts they are, they go along with it.During your reign, you will instigate THE RUMPUS which is basically leaping up and down making a lot of noise, THE PILE UP where everybody jumps on top of each other before falling asleep in a heap and THE GREAT CLOD FIGHT which entails two groups of people, the baddies and the goodies, throwing hunks of dirt at each other. Among your subjects are Anthropomorphic birds, goats and buffalo, not to mention two weird owls and a huge 'dog' that roams the desert. You decide to build a fort that the whole community can live together in, and things start going very well. But soon in-fighting breaks out, arms get pulled off and your once loyal followers want to eat you.. forcing a hasty retreat into a friendly beastie's tummy..I am not making this up. The closest movie I can compare this too was The Neverending Story which was also about a young fella-me-lad getting involved in a fantasy world while changing it. That however, had a over-riding story where you genuinely thought things were at stake. This, on the other hand, is just a serious of random events where stuff happens, with charmless characters and stupid dialogue to boot. It's original, I'll give it that, but what's the point if the movie is far more weird than interesting? As the underwhelming ending faded out and the credits rolled, I was trying to think who it would appeal to. Kids? Furries? Zoophiliacs?! Who knows? All I know is I am plopping the DVD Where The Auction Things are. 4/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is deeply moving. I remember going into this film thinking, 'Am I really going to see this?' I love childhood stories, but the idea of this one being made into a movie was a little, eh, I don't know. Let's just say, I didn't expect to leave the movie theater with my mascara all over my shirt! This movie's take on a child's struggle with family and himself is very moving. I feel like this movie taps into a lot of feelings that children and adults experience but don't want to deal with. A lot of people said this movie was depressing and a downer. I think that the fact that this movie deals with struggles and issues that way it does demands for a more dramatic and emotional plot. I learned so much from this film and from each of the characters and felt very stirred by the emotions this movie evoked. I think this film is rather genius and a good one for people to experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this film with absolute admiration for the animators, modelers, character TDs, lighters, renderers, real life model makers, and everyone in the industry that worked on it. The CG meshed with the film so flawlessly, it was hard to believe there actually was CG. It was beautiful beyond belief, and is one of the most gorgeous films I've seen in a long time. Too bad the story was...well, what it was.To make a what, 20 page book into a feature length film, filmmakers need to take some liberties. Completely understood. Angsty kid hates his sister not sticking up for him, his parents' divorce, causes him to run away, ehh, alright. Goes to island of wild things, everything is awesome. Everything starts getting bad, then worse. Then no resolution.I'm not quite sure if this film was meant to be this dark and unresolved, but if it was, they did a great job. There's a lot of heavy stuff here - friends leaving, fighting, lying, the idea of "eating someone up" - is pretty dark stuff. Watching the degradation of this small ideal society was very Lord of the Flies esquire, which seemed to drag on way to long.I would recommend seeing this at least once, for the CG, cinematography, and compositions alone. Not a kids' movie though, by any means.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wild in a for-children way...which is fair enough. Inventive and warm.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where the Wild Things Are (2009)Well, the book is great beyond qualification. The movie takes the basic ides of the book and stretches it very far into an hour and forty minutes, and it's sometimes wonderful, but there are a lot of parts that need patience, or just complete submission. It's too long, period.The basics are this--a wild kid named Max leaves his slightly dysfunctional family and ends up in a make-believe island where friendly monsters reside. And he talks them into becoming their king. The family interplay among the monsters echoes the routines of regular people (and there are some direct echoes of Max's real family). It's kind of a cozy film, with very nice animal/monster characters you can totally relate to, especially in a kind of warm Jewish-American family kind of way (in the best sense, not the caricatures, but the kind of families that maybe the author and screenwriter and director is familiar with). It's not animated, but clearly some kind of special effects are at work to fit the characters together.If you are a Six Feet Under fan, and a Claire Fisher fan, the voice for the slightly rebellious (of course) female monster is the same actress, Lauren Ambrose. And there are other great voices from great actors, too, like Forest Whitaker and James Gandolfini.The deepest parts of the movie are quite touching and probing--asking in fact about loneliness, or the end of the sun, or trust. Big stuff for little kids. But it works. It's cute and subtle at the same time.Of course, the big lesson has to do with Max's real family, left behind. And this gets a fast resolution that is perfect because we know it's coming, somehow, and we're ready for it. And if our interest is in the monster land, our sympathies are with mom, and how life will get back to being okay after all. In some ways it's a brilliant, great movie--the attitude, the family dynamics, the basic story--and in other ways it's just too much too thin. You'll see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A complete misfire. Spike Jonze was apparently trying to make a family- friendly movie without giving up his position as independent cinema's darling, and the result is a movie that's neither a children's movie nor an art-house piece, but a muddled and confusing movie that achieves nothing. Obviously, Jonze had no idea how to stretch a very short picture book into a 90-minute movie, and so lame attempts were made to give each beast a personality, characteristics and make them interact with each other, and none of it works. There are definitely some lovely moments to the movie, nice designs and terrific cinematography, but 30 minutes would have been enough for all that. As it is, there's no real reason to watch the whole thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recall the book and remember enjoying it when it was read aloud in class. This film is definitely a stretch AND an "adult" adaptation...that being said, as an adult I question what the film is trying to saying.It was an emotional roller-coaster ride with Max and The Wild Things. I enjoyed seeing how the Wild Things turned out, they look similar to the ones in the book (as I recall), BUT as far as believability in the worlds represented in the film, there is none. Reality, or the beginning and ending felt absurd. How long is Max away in reality? An hour? Why does the mother stop running at some point? Why does she not continue her search outside, like any caring mother would? Inconsistency abounds in this film in the "real World" scenes. Does Max fall asleep and imagine all this? I think so, but the film shows him journeying...kind of a cool part in the film.As for Max's romp with the WilD Things, what was it about? It's full of conflict that is not clearly explained. It's a manic time, one minute they are having fun, running around, being wild, building a fort- the next they are arguing about something that only the Wild Things themselves seem to know about.What was it about????? I wanted to like the film BUT there is a HUGE Disconnect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spike Jonze has delivered a rather bleak and solemn look at adolescence and painted it with large metaphorical strokes to create one of the finer films I have seen this year. Max the King has set sail to another land where he comes across many large, and hairy facets of his troubled mind and spirit. These characters aren't cutesy stuff here. This is Max's dream, and in it there are some frightening things lurking about. The FX here don't overload the film. Jonze has taken a classic children's book and simply broadened the view in which Maurice Sendak did so many years ago. And he does it without pandering to the audience. He allows the child to really study the complicated thoughts in his head. Insecurity, abandonment, rejection and anger all resonate within the new world Max has sailed to. And why not? These feelings lurk in all of us, especially children. The voices are spot on and at times we feel that the actors are really inside those overbearing costumes. Jonze hasn't created a black mark against the book but actually gives the book more weight. Amazing what Sendak was telling us with just nine sentences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where the Wild Things Are is truly a masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We are accustomed to see family films which try to sell us an "attitude", a McDonald's Happy Meal, or a rancid moral lesson which only exists in order to disguise the commercialism of their authentic intention.So, it was truly refreshing for me to see a movie like Where the Wild Things Are, whose main strength does not reside on special effects, but on its reflexive tone and rich narrative, which is not afraid of approaching the complex vicissitudes in the life of a boy who is lost between the comfortable indiscipline from childhood and the disturbing realities of maturity with seriousness.In other words, Where the Wild Things Are ended up being a unique and absolutely memorable film experience.I have recently been complaining of all those family movies about boys who travel to a magic kingdom to discover they are in fact "special" pretty much.Where the Wild Things Are basically follows that formula, but it is so different on form and substance that it deserves to belong to a different category in order to reflect its unusual combination of honesty, intelligence and melancholy better.I think we could even consider it as a "family movie for adults".Thinking about it well, I do not think it is even a family movie; I think it would be more appropriate to describe it as an hypnotic psychological study of a child's mind.It was hugely satisfactory for me to find such a mature movie like this one, which relies on screenplay and atmosphere instead of in conventional humor and over-designed action scenes.The screenplay from this film is truly phenomenal, because it is full of fascinating emotional and narrative layers; the special effects are really extraordinary; and the Australian rugged settings perfectly complement the organic and elegant production design.In summary, Where the Wild Things Are deserves a totally enthusiastic recommendation, because it is unfortunately not very frequent to find a masterpiece such as this one.This film has definitely earned a place in my list of favorite movies, so I hope as many people as possible discover this gem.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Maurice Sendak's entrancing children's picture book from 1963, Where the Wild Things Are, Max, a lonely 9-year-old child has a tantrum and is called a "wild thing" by his mother who sends him to his room without supper. In his bedroom a forest grows and a boat comes along so that Max can sail away to a forest where wild beasts "roar their terrible roar", and "gnash their terrible teeth. Max uses magic to tame the beasts by "staring into their yellow eyes without blinking once" and becomes their king. Soon, however, he wants to be where someone loves him more and returns home to find his supper waiting for him, still hot.This classic book has now been transformed into the 100-minute feature film Where the Wild Things Are by Spike Jonze who wrote the screenplay along with Dave Eggers. The film combines real actors, animated puppets, and CGI effects with a background of indie rock music. Unlike the book, however, which allows us to transport ourselves into a little boy's imagination by using our own, the film loses its way through a heavy-handed literalness that drains away most of the magic. For example, the spell that Max creates in the book by staring into the eyes of the wild things becomes a threat to blow up their heads if they don't make him king and the joy of the ruckus in the book becomes a game of war with everyone throwing dirt clods at each other.Where the Wild Things Are opens in an undisclosed suburban location in the middle of winter. Max (Max Records) builds an igloo which is destroyed by teenagers after he starts throwing snowballs at them. Devastated, the boy takes out his anger on his sister Claire (Pepita Emmericjs) by wrecking her room. His anger takes on even more mass when he sees his mother (Catherine Keener) with a new boyfriend (Mark Ruffalo) in the living room. After biting her, she says he's "out of control" and he runs out of the house and she chases him to the woods where he yells and screams some more. It is then that Max sails away on his boat to the land of the wild things. Filmed in Australia, the forest and desert scenes are perfectly realized in the outstanding cinematography of Lance Acord and the creatures, representations of different animals that are at least eight feet tall, wear costumes that are almost exact replications of the book's illustrations.Max first meets Carol, the leader of the beasts whose voice is that of Soprano's star James Gandolfini. Carol strangely seems to lack consistency in his behavior. One minute he is sad, the next minute angry, throwing things at the others and destroying their shelters, an accurate representation perhaps of the anxiety that Max is feeling. Carol decides that Max should be the king of the extended clan that includes Judith (Catherine O'Hara), Ira (Forest Whitaker), a goat (Paul Dano), the bird-like Douglas (Chris Cooper) and KW (Lauren Ambrose), all sadly pessimistic and given to non-stop talking. One of the things they ask Max when he becomes king is: "Will you keep out all the sadness?" and Max promises to lead them to a life without sadness but is unable to fulfill his promise.In one of the film's best scenes, Max triumphantly sits on Carol's head holding on to his horns as he is told that he owns the kingdom. Unfortunately, nothing really happens in the forest that allows Max to discover the difference between healthy and unhealthy ways to express his aggression, and he does not express any feeling of regret for his behavior when he reaches home. Where the Wild Things Are works hard to have the viewer identify with Max and his fear of being invisible and succeeds at least some of the time. Missing for me, however, is the experience of growth or even the idea that something positive has been won, other than a chocolate cake.</fullReview>

Here are some excerpts from our reviews of "Where The Wild Things Are."Albert's Take: "Breathe easy, fans of the book: The movie's a faithful adaptation. And by that, I mean it's faithful to Maurice Sendak's unforgettable artwork." Don's Take: "'Where The Wild Things Are' is really two stories: one of the drama in the lead character Max's lonely and troubled family life, and the story within the fantasy world he creates for himself to escape it. While there is much to be praised in Spike Jonze's reimagining of Maurice Sendak's award winning children's book, Jonze fails to marry to the two stories in a cohesive way and the result is a disjointed uneven film that is at times too Seseme Street for the adult audience it appears to target and too dark and scary for the children who will ultimately be drawn to its cutesy characters."Please visit our blog and read our full reviews.

		<shortDescription>A Kids Movie For Grown-Up Kids</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE is a kids movie that isn't for kids. Let me explain...The short, children's story that this film is based on (written by Maurice Sendak) has been a favorite of many kids. Note, however, that most of those children are now grown adults with fond memories of the book. I can remember reading it myself about ten dozen times when I was growing up, so I have just as fond of memories as the next person. But this movie isn't for modern-day kids. And this is where much of the confusion will lay for those who decide to take their preteens to see it.The message of this film is deep. VERY deep. In fact, most kids (and probably some adults) will have difficulties capturing it. This is probably why Warner Brothers Studios had such a big problem with director Spike Jonze's final cut. It isn't a family movie, but the book most definitely is. This is a movie about the angst of growing up and into teen-hood. This lonely journey is often rife with internal turmoil, a dash of Oedipus complex, and the releasing of deep-seeded childhood emotions, and all of this is shown on some level via the artistic tapestry that is this movie. And it is done very well in the artistic department.Little known actor Max Records plays Max, this boy who's vivid imagination allows the rumpus to begin. Running away from his mother after a bitter argument (and a biting one), Max flees to his imaginary world Where The Wild Things Are. This analogy is taken to extremes as we see all of Max's emotions doled out by the Wild Creatures he's created. The most recognizable will be Carol (voiced by James Gandolfini) as Max's angry and self-indulgent alter-ego. He tears down anything he doesn't like anymore, and this is precisely how the young Max feels about the real world he's left behind. KW (voiced by Lauren Ambrose) is the Oedipus portion of Max, and much can be gleaned from this when we see KW carry in two owl friends who Max only hears squawking (indicating he doesn't understand his mother's friends). The other Wild Things are in various stages of redirection as Max tries to work through his rough emotional state. Should he remain King of this Wild Place or return to become a budding teenager with real-world responsibilities? Again, the message isn't in-your-face ? which isn't necessarily a bad thing ? but it's also very far removed from what most movie-goers will think of as a "kids film." Again, not necessarily a bad thing but, parents, be prepared to answer some tough questions about what the movie was supposed to be about. This isn't some insipidly, force-it-down-your-throat message, which is refreshing, but the message is so far down the rabbit-hole that you might not be able to explain it adequately to the younger amongst your family. Just something to be mindful of.The movie is loaded with violence, including ripping trees apart, thumping heads with dirt clods, and the yanking off of a monster's extremity. Be forewarned.Like I said, this is a kids movie that isn't for kids. It's for those kids who are now grown up and have fond memories of the book. So if you're a parent who saw the cuddly looking beasts and the young Max chatting with them, and thought that this would be a good matinée to take the kiddies to ...think again.Even so, the artistry of the film was absolutely astounding. It's also quite a sad film (some people were sniffling next to me in the theater). The darkness of the Wild World was initially foreboding but eventually comes to life as Max interacts with his internal creatures. The fort they build is something to make the mouth drop, and the desert scenes were flat-out gorgeous. Which is why I enjoyed it so much. That, and it let me remember what it was like to be a messed up kid again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, what a tough film to review. Its main focus is certainly not of a grand adventure, with some moral that's easily digested. With that said, this film isn't for everyone. In fact, in order to get the most out of Where the Wild Things Are, you really have to put yourself in Max's shoes. And if you can do that, then you're in for one hell of an emotional roller-coaster ride.The live actors in this film, of the virtually two that exist, are a perfect choice. Young Max Records as the film's protagonist excelled in a way that, I think, no other child actor could. This kid carries the film for a good 90 minutes, proving to be both likable and relatable. As a friend of mine said, he's "basically a stand in for your inner child and all those feelings that you thought you forgot." Catherine Keener is also terrific as the mother, playing the part of the "everyday mom" just about perfectly.The voice actors, too, are perfectly cast. James Gandolfini gives a powerful performance as Carol, ranging from kind and innocent to unpleasant and frightening. While all of the Wild Things are ids of Max's imagination, it's through Carol where Max views himself. However, as much as I hold Gandolfini's performance in high regard, it's Lauren Ambrose as KW who really stole the show; she's the character everyone most wanted to love and be loved by.As much as I love Where the Wild Things Are, I don't think my feelings on the film will be fully understood until a second or third viewing. Again, this is not a straight-forward, easily digestible fantasy adventure. In fact, the closest thing that this film has to a weakness is its being ? at least to some extent - more suited for adults than for children. Right now, I can see Spike Jonze's latest only getting better with age.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An open letter to Spike Jonze</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My review can best be summed up by this open letter to Mr. Spike Jonze, the film's director and the man most responsible for this travesty.Please, Mr Jonze, if it is at all possible I would appreciate the return of the two hours which I just lost watching your adaption of Where the Wild Things Are. If returned, I could put it to much better use doing more enjoyable things like changing the cat litter, chewing on tin foil and sawing off my own appendages with a butter knife. Further, if you wouldn't mind, I make the added request that you refrain from ever again applying your brand of "artistic vision" to any other of my favorite childhood stories. Whilst I am quite sure that there exists a select, small audience who appreciates your gift for completely sucking all of the magic and whimsy from the most memorable and special tales and turning them into soulless, spirit crushingly boring film adaptations, I and most human beings I know do not belong to that minority and would much rather that you never touch such a masterful tale of childhood innocence ever again. Last, and forgive me if this is too forward, while you are at it, please retire from film making altogether. I fear that if you ever were to release another film that it could succeed in actually being worse than Where The Wild Things Are, in which case you would surely be tried for crimes against humanity. Therefore this I ask as much for your own good as all of ours.Sincerely, the_jazzman</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just saw this recently on DVD, I wanted to check it out after all the good critical and movie goer reviews. Don't waste your time. If you want to keep your good memories of this adapted childhood favorite book, just check out the book again.Since the book was so short, the screen writers had to come up with lots of original material. Unfortunately, their idea of material basically adds up to nothing. Just because Spike Jonze is involve, doesn't mean he gets a free pass or that the movie is automatically good.I kept waiting for this movie to get good and have some kind of message, but it it wasn't done good. Sure the kid who played Max did a good job, but he wasn't giving a good script to work with. I can't see a kid or an adult enjoying this bland movie. Maybe if there was a point to this film, it would be enjoyable, but it was the most horribly boring film I've seen in a long while.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cleverly artistic, yet somber film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on a children's book written and illustrated by Maurice Sendak of the same name, Where the Wild Things Are has a simple plot (the book was 9 sentences long). The story, filled with illustrations, centers around Max, who plays around in his house creating mischief. As punishment, his mother sends him to his room without supper, so he runs off into an imaginative world of monsters (The Wild Things) where he crowns himself king and does whatever he wants to do. This film by Spike Jonze takes this story and expands it, with details, layers, and insight, showing us a projection of Max's psyche, and possibly more.The character of Max (Max Records) is played realistically and acts exactly how one would expect a young child to act. He enjoys playing in his makeshift igloo in the snow, imagines sailing in his tiny boat, throws snowballs, and sometimes, tantrums. He deals a lot with real life situations?his mom has a new boyfriend, his sister is too cool to hang out with him, he is occasionally lonely, and doesn't particularly pay attention in school.Once Max enters into the fantasy world of Where the Wild Things Are, he meets the ferocious Carol (James Gandolfini), a male monster who wants to eat him at first. There's the mother-like monster KW (Lauren Ambrose) who once was a friend of Carol, but no longer. There are these other monsters too who have various different personalities. Max befriends them, soon declares himself king of the land, and they play around, dancing, throwing mud clots, and building a fortress. It isn't all fun and games, however. Some of these monsters simply don't get along and some have temper issues and some feel lonely or ostracized.The look of the film has that old-school independent feel?there's some shaky camera and Karen O's (of Yeah Yeah Yeahs) songs bring a retro 60's charm. There are quiet moments of little to no dialogue. The world Max enters doesn't look CG, fantastic, or saturated, but the deserts, waters, and forests are like any other. And, the Wild Things don't look like realistic monsters, but are part animatronics and furry costumes?they are as real as one's imagination would allow them to be. Thankfully, this lack of CG works to the film's benefit. CG creatures, on the whole, have a tendency to feel distant, unreal, and not particularly huggable. The monsters here are generally like Muppets, and as such, there's texture and a human touch that CG creatures simply can't replace. These monsters are relatable, and their emotions and speech are displayed realistically. The film, in mood and tone, does resemble the rather Gothic look of Maurice Sendak's illustrations.For a film of this kind, this movie has multiple layers and it is never quite simple (although it can be enjoyed that way too). These monsters appear to be physical manifestations of Max's raw emotions, fears, wants, as well as specific people in his life. Likewise, the monsters don't talk like monsters, but regular people, generally adults, maybe even siblings. Some of them appear to be his view of his parents (one of them possibly his currently absent Dad)?there's even some jealousy and anger and arguments between two creatures that may reveal events of Max's family history. What is surprising is how downbeat much of the film is?it's no laugh-a-minute zany cartoon ride, that's for sure. Spike Jonze had mentioned in an interview that the film isn't so much a "children's film" as it is a "film about children". It is true that children increasingly face a world that isn't particularly kind. Much of the film indeed is like psychoanalysis, not unlike looking at a child's drawing and deducing his emotions as well as his past (that may have contributed to those emotions). This world is certainly a world that a child would see. What's fascinating is that many adults can look at this film and find a piece of their own past in there?maybe even deal with their own issues.Overall, I found the film to be emotionally intense, and one may feel that way too, that is, if one had read into it as I did. It can be taken at face value as a fun little adventure, too, of course. There are plenty of moments of monsters doing random oddball things that are silly and charming. I appreciated the way these monsters displayed solid emotions, which in a sense were all part of Max's emotions. Spike Jonze has made a cleverly artistic, yet somber, film. I appreciated how the film never fully spelled everything out to the audience, but we were given clues--and many of these moments were open to interpretation. There's a small part in the movie where Max is sitting at class where the teacher gives a rather depressing lecture about the power of the sun and how the sun will eventually die and all life on Earth will also be done once that happens. It seems to imply that there are certain things bigger than us that we depend on, and that the universe doesn't revolve around us. Maybe the scene is saying that although Max wants to be the king of the world, there are bigger creatures in his life he too must depend on, and perhaps he shouldn't hate the "sun," if you will. At least it's the way I interpreted it. ***1/2 stars out of ****.More of my reviews are updates at http://twitter.com/d_art</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a child I loved Maurice Sendak's 'Where the Wild Things Are.' It wasn't just the simple, yet charming story of a little boy escaping to a world of his creation, but the fact I could relate to it. I have read on the message boards that this is unrealistic, and children do not create fantasy worlds, this is so untrue. At that age I wasn't as rebellious and wild as Max is, but I did conjure up worlds of my own in which I would create an entire land with characters. Spike Jonze's ambition adaptation of this long-loved children's tale was ambitious to say the least, but he pulled it off perfectly. From the opening scene I was completely drawn in to Max's world, and I never wanted to leave. Everything about this movie is brilliant, from the amazing soundtrack, the creature effects, the acting (and voice-acting), and the camera-work. Jonze and David Egger's screenplay takes the basic story and expands it into a film about childhood, which funnily enough I would not recommend to children. It is dark, slow, and I believe most children may not understand the movie's message.Eggers and Jonze add so much depth to the tale, creating a world and life for Max (Max Records) to take for granted. His father is out of the picture, his whereabouts unknown whilst his mother (Catherine Keener), is busy supporting the family, and his sister is at the age where acting cool for her friends removes any bond with a lonely and tossed aside brother. Loneliness is a huge theme here, and we all face it, even when surrounded by people we live with and cherish. To be able to accept others, one must always be able to accept oneself. I will stop here, as going into all the plot details, and all the different emotions that are experienced and overcome will basically be detailing the movie scene by scene.The creature's: Carol (James Gandolfini), Alexander (Paul Dano), Judith (Catherine O'Hara), Ira (Forest Whitaker), The Bull (Michael Berry Jr.), KW (Lauren Ambrose), and Douglas (Chris Cooper) represent different parts of Max's (Max Records) personality. Each have their own personalities, and each are marvelously brought to life by an incredibly talented team of artists.This is one of the year's best films, it is a charming, poignant piece of art, and Jonze has done justice to his source. Don't be fooled into thinking this is a film for kids, this is something adults will get the most enjoyment from. A solid 5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I've taken more exciting psychology classes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anything that has Henson muppets/puppets in it should automatically be fun. This film is an epic fail.And yeah, yeah... I "get" the film. And I really have sat through psych lectures that held me more enthralled than watching a film featuring an obviously undiagnosed high functioning autistic boy (the meltdown over corn should be the biggest clue, the subsequent OCD in fantasy land with angst and the constant "it's not right"-striving-for-perceived-perfection by Carol/Max's alter ego is another). The best part is, the audience is never actually let in on it, you have to figure it out yourself.Happy part first: there is about a 5 second portion of the film that actually made us all giggle (2 kids, one adult, ages 9, 12, &amp; 38), featuring Richard the Raccoon. Richard gets tossed instead of a dirt clod and attaches to a nose. Figured that may be the turning point for the flick as it was about half way through and we were all hopeful that HERE'S where it gets better.We were wrong.The angst of all drags on. And on and on and on. The film ended with the angst dragging on. There was no climax, no conclusion. When Max goes running happily down the street back towards home all happy dappy, you're hopeful that he's conquered his inner demons and has reached the conclusion that we all have to make our own happiness and not be so dependant upon those around us to make us center of the universe. And then mom falls asleep while watching him eat and you can see by the look on his face that NOTHING is solved and that there is no closure. Max is going to continue to be a holy terror that one has to work to love, or even like. Never once through the film did I find myself connected to the characters, no sympathizing with any of them... I never got drawn in.So yeah, I "get" it. But that doesn't make it a good movie. It just makes it a long drawn out depressing waste of time trying to get into the head of the guy that made the film because he was attempting to be deep. Yawn. If I want deep I'll read Freud and try to get inside HIS head. Now *there's* a journey. Avant garde is highly over-rated, particularly when it's trying to disguise itself as a mainstream flick.And the poor kids STILL don't get it. Sadly, I don't think they care to. They just know what they like and what they don't.To give you a really good idea of our honest opinion of Where the Wild Things Are: we rented (thank goodness it was the $1 rental and I didn't actually cave and buy this!) this and The Spy Next Door (knowing that one would be ridiculous) at the same time. Comparatively speaking we stood and applauded The Spy Next Door just because it WASN'T this movie. And that one was lame at best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing and touching movie, but narrow-mindedness is blocking this.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All the people who do not like this movie and say it Max or the Monsters learn nothing are missing the point. You need to stop being so narrow minded to understand this movie. The first 20 minutes of the movie are keys to understanding all the scenes with the Wild Things, the monsters. The monsters are figments of Max's imagination, and going through what he is feeling. All his feelings are mirrored in the monsters. Allow me to explain.Max feels that Claire and his mom are ignoring him to be with their friends. He doesn't understand their relationships, he just feels alone. You'll find this is portrayed in Carol's feelings to K.W. He goes crazy when she's with Bob and Terry, her new and different friends. Max tells Carol he is out of control. Remember that? Max's mom said the same thing to him. Lesson learned.Max has a snowball fight and it doesn't end well when Claire's friends take it too far. Similarly, Max starts the dirt-clog war and someone else gets hurt because of him, and at first doesn't do anything about it, just as his sister did to him. But later he realizes it was a mistake and says he's sorry. Another lesson learned.The big lesson here is that family is important. He comes to realizes that through the monsters. When he returns home, his mother smiles at him just like K.W, who is mirroring his mother. Yes, he doesn't say sorry for running away and biting her, but their expressions say it all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You make everything....Snoozy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maurice Sendak's book, "Where The Wild Things Are", is embedded in the minds of most people of adult age because of the wonderful character and landscape designs that enthralled them as a kid. Plot? There really isn't much. Max gets angry, Max imagines wild world where he vents anger and pals around with monsters, Max longs for home, eats dinner. That story doesn't beg for cinematic interpretation. So, the first challenge for co-writers Spike Jonze and Dave Eggers was to make Max's adventures fill a feature length movie. The challenge may have been too much, as this adult needed more than the gorgeous design to get through 100 minutes of Max's world.The film "Where the Wild Things Are" is essentially a nine-year-old's adventure. The production elements, acting, music and design all lend themselves to telling the ADD-saddled story of a kid with issues. Max has problems at home. He's upset with his mother (Catherine Keener) dating a new man (presumably after her husband's death), he's upset with his sister not getting his back, he's upset with his sister's friends for mistreating him. He needs to get away. After acting out and biting his mom, he finds a boat that takes him to the island where the Wild Things live. You'd think if a book is thirty-seven pages long, you wouldn't have to make any cuts, but Jonze and Eggers make the boat trip somewhere outside of Max's house. In the book, one of the more memorable images is Max's room transforming to into a jungle. That magical illustration is lost here.So what's added to beef up the story? The opening is exciting, as Max chases his dog around the house in the trademark "Wild Thing" outfit from the book, and soon we see his vulnerable side as he builds a snow fort and watches it get destroyed by his sister's friends. When Max gets to Wild Thing island, they add a bunch of action you would find in a nine-year-old's adventure ? mud fights, they smash stuff, they pile on each other, they build a fort. I'd love to say all these events touched my inner child, but it all adds up to a meandering plot that never really engaged me.Under it all is the idea of the Wild Things making Max their king. Max's "reign" as king has different effects on the Wild Things. Some question his leadership, some are disappointed in his role, and Max lies and feels the repercussions. Jonze and Eggers probably do the right thing in keeping the story simple (as opposed to Bruckheimering it up), but at times I was just (I hate to say this about a movie that presumed 'hip') bored.The Wild Things are given individual personalities they weren't afforded in the book. Their leader is Carol, who is all destructive id, K.W. is the voice of reason, Alexander is the none-too-subtly devised goat, always condescended to and left out, there's a twitchy bird character named Douglas and a "couple", Ira and Judith, who mix parental adoration with pessimism. It is no doubt the purpose of fleshing out these characters to give them characteristics a young child deals with on a daily basis, either owning them or facing them.Voicing these beasts are James Gandolfini as Carol, going for vulnerability, but having difficulty escaping his Tony Soprano voice. I expected him to drop an F-bomb. Paul Dano is excellent as the sheepish Alexander and Lauren Ambrose is nurturing as K.W. The Wild Thing designs are a marvel, mixing Henson Creature Shop full-body suits with CGI-built faces, providing a wide variety of expressions. The two technical achievements are seamlessly combined. One misstep I feel the film made was not including the bodysuit performers alongside the voice actors in the end credits. You have to search deep in the scroll to find out who did all the on-set work with Max. They did a great job and I want to rectify that misstep here:Vincent Crowley ? Carol Suit Performer Sonny Gerasimowicz ? Alexander Suit Performer Nick Farnell ? Judith Suit Performer Sam Longley ? Ira Suit Performer Angus Sampson ? The Bull Suit Performer Mark McCracken ? The Bull Additional Suit Performer John Leary ? Douglas Suit Performer Alice Parkinson ? KW Suit Performer Garon Michael ? KW Additional Suit PerformerHard to believe this information isn't even available at IMDb.com! Sonny Gerasimowicz was one of the suit designers, too, and deserves special mention.Other tech elements are superior, too, as the production made full use of the Australian countryside where they shot. Deserts, forests, beaches and rock canyons all provide eye candy and the fort design and other visual FX blend in nicely. The music by give-him-an-Oscar-already Carter Burwell is great, working with Karen O of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs to provide a whimsical score, reminding us that even when the Wild Things act violent or outrageous, they're childish at heart. DP Lance Acord shoots the proceedings at a kinetic pace when necessary, and lush when called for.Acting first-timer Max Records is impressive as Max, in that he inhabits a bratty kid as well as flawlessly interacting mostly with expressionless puppets on the set. But perhaps it's the brattiness in Max and in the Wild Things that left me a little cold in the end. Few of these characters are sympathetic and there's no real dramatic thru-line to get involved in.</fullReview>

Even after the movie was over and the credits were going on...I had to wait almost 10 minutes because I was still crying. Call me a big baby, but it hit me in the heart in multiple ways.The only problem I had with this movie was that Carol and Judith were way too depressed and bipolar. It really isn't for younger kids. Adults are the ones who could relate to this the most or even for me; a teenager.Max Records who plays Max in the movie did a fantastic job. It was unreal how great he did.

From reading others' reviews, I surmise that if you were one of the unfortunate people who liked the children's book, this may have some nostalgic appeal to you. I, myself, read that book to several of my children when they were young, and found it depressing then and found the pictures to be somewhat nightmarish - not in the scary sense, but in the surrealistic sense.So maybe if you don't like the book, not liking the movie follows.But I started watching with somewhat high expectations, a favorable disposition, and a bit of zeal. It just sent me into the dumps.I would have given it a one except for the fact that we all sometimes need to watch something horrible and depressing so that we know how bad things can become. Part of the tragedy here is that there is no real tragedy and hence no justification for the nightmare that ensues.This is the first review I have ever written here. It is not a masterpiece of literature, for sure. But I felt compelled to warn people that some children will NOT like this film and others may even find it scary in unpredictable ways.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All I have to say is "BORING"! This is a great movie if you want to put yourself to sleep. My husband and I are big fans of CGI movies so we of course had to see this one, but the whole story was just bland. I found that the story left me confused and asking questions in the end. The overtone of the movie is very dark &amp; depressing. The characters I found to be quite dull, and the movie seemed to drag on. Like others have mentioned, this book was only a 400 word story and it seemed like the director was struggling to keep things interesting. I would suggest that this movie be watched at home on cable instead paying hard earned dollars to be board out of your mind!If you want a fun uplifting family movie, I would definitely pass on this one and read the book instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moving and Magnificent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went in with low expectations after reading some negative reviews. This movie blew me away. It moved me deeply. It is certainly one of the most original, unpredictable, unformulaic, gorgeous movies to come out of Hollywood in years. I find it almost miraculous that Spike Jonze was able to deliver his vision in such a truthful, seemingly uncompromised way. Chapeau, chapeau, chapeau to him.He and Dave Eggers expanded on the book by Maurice Sendak by giving characters to the Wild Things. It's a story about raw feelings. About feelings so painful, so intense, that they cannot be articulated except through wild actions, like monster tantrums. Hurt, jealousy, loneliness, pain, joy. How does a child deal with these feelings? How do adults cope? One may grow up, but the feelings are the same.Although people complain that not much happens, I think a lot happens emotionally. Jonze's achievement is his masterful control of tone. There is gorgeous, insane energy in the wild actions of Max, a child bewildered by a broken home (not in the original source). And then there is a lovely, melancholy but mischievous feel to the place where the Wild Things are. I find it a fascinating interpretation true to the core of the Sendak story. Nothing sounds canned or clichéd.When Max first finds them, The Wild Things are utterly bewildered, Big guy Carol is running around destroying things without quite knowing why (it's because of unrequited love). Max brings them a sense of purpose, some order and some lost joy. He does that by becoming their king and soon he learns that this degree of control requires responsibility and honesty. Maurice Sendak made up one of the most brilliant and durable metaphors in children's literature. Our feelings are volatile creatures that behave in wild ways. But what fantastic creatures they are! They all sound reassuringly like neurotic New Yorkers and were made by the Jim Henson people with great fidelity to the original Sendak drawings. This is the opposite, for instance, of what happened to poor William Steig's Shrek, who was defanged of all his charm and transformed into plastic merchandising by a big studio.The faces of the Wild Things are extraordinarily expressive, but what works like a charm are the actors who lend them their voices. I loved James Gandolfini as Carol. He has the voice of a lovable lug (one of the reasons he was so sexy in The Sopranos), and as Carol he brings out the sweetness and vulnerability in that warm, teddy bear voice of his. He was the only one I recognized off the bat, but the rest of the acting is extraordinary. Everybody's tone is just right, slightly off-kilter but emotionally true. Catherine O'Hara is a hoot as Judith (a shrew and a self described "downer"), Paul Dano, quietly tender as Alexander, who no one ever listens to; Chris Cooper, softly authoritative as Douglas, and Forest Whitaker, as Ira, deeply in love with Judith, and even Lauren Ambrose as KW is spirited and lovely.This is not a film for young children. It may be a film for children the same age as Max, the protagonist, who at the beginning seemed to me a little long in the tooth for such tantrums. But as he goes to where the wild things are, he becomes more like a child, more vulnerable and more powerful and he is more delightful. The kid is put through the wringer, like kids are when they feel any of those terrible things that Max feels, and the tone is dark but playful. I can totally understand Sendak's impatience with parents who complain about the movie's darkness. The story, and the film are about the hard truths of childhood. They are not a fantasy land for blissful escape. However, thinking of my young nephews, I'm not sure that they would not be scared by the chaotic strangeness inflicted on Max. But it is a wonderful film for adults, if you allow it to take you into its extraordinary realm of metaphorical feeling. It is more magical than anything I've seen in a long time. The one thing that got on my nerves was the hipsterish music by Karen O. The score by Carter Burwell (this man can do no wrong in my book) is fine, but all those cloying, cutesy songs were a little bit too much for me, particularly when inserted into scenes where the characters were talking. The cinematography by Lance Acord is amazing, the landscapes and the creatures are amazing. It is a deeply beautiful film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't even know where to start. Terrible movie about a kid from a broken home who shakes the dog, screams, and bites his mom when he is mad. He runs away from home, and visits a bunch of monsters who act out and hate just the way he does. Movie is sad, demoralizing, and extremely negative. DO NOT BRING YOUR KIDS TO SEE IT! I felt really bad for taking mine to see it - really bad! We all voted in the car on the way home and it was agreed by all that this is the worst movie we had ever seen - probably the worst movie ever made. I wrote to Warner Brothers to get my money back, although they cant give me back the two hours of my life wasted there. If you like this movie then I am really sad for you, if THIS is entertainment in your world, then you may not know how depressed and miserable you really are.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My husband and I had no idea what to expect. In the first few scenes we're introduced to a little tyrant (who is a great actor by the way) throwing tantrums about his home life and disrespecting his mother. Okay, "Home Alone" had a little of this in the beginning so... understanding the foreshadow and "set-up" aspects of film-making, we settled into our theater seats. For the next hour and fifteen minutes we watched one of the worst films we've ever seen. Look, we get all the psychological stuff, but come on... this was chaotic, violent and seemingly drug induced. The endless fighting, bickering and references to "beating someone's brains out" was outrageous and disturbing. The dirt clod fight took us to the exit. We left. (By the way when the film started there were approximately 25 people in the theater. When we walked out - there was only 4 people left in the theater).The majority of folks who accompanied children hit the exits long before we did. While this may be a more adult type motion picture, the trailer and poster certainly doesn't infer that. Very misleading.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Agree With Sendak: "Where the Wild Things Are" is quite unlike any film I've ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To take a book like that and be able to magnify and expand it to the length of a movie while keeping the essence and interpretive wiggle-room of Sendak's creation is the greatest achievement in film-adaptation I've ever seen. Frankly, I thought it was impossible. I thought there was no way Jonze could do that without making it feel dull, stretched thin, or without fundamentally changing some of the original story's core. It's kinda sad that so many people won't realize the hard work, talent, and.. well, sheer genius that went into translating that book onto the big screen. But that's the eloquent beauty of children's fiction. I especially liked how well it portrayed childhood. The sensation of the way it was filmed and Max's mannerisms gave me a huge nostalgia trip. It's almost saddening, how well of a job they did, because it made me realize how distant I've grown from my inner-kid. Of course, the vision of the book and Jonze's ambition wouldn't have been possible if the costumes, sets, and acting weren't superb. Jeez! Even a great acting job by a child?! Where the Wild Things Are is the kind of stuff that makes life wonderful to me.In response to one review saying that Jonze's film botched Sendak's story, there's a link to a video of Sendak saying how much he liked the film and that it preserved the integrity of his book on Wired.com.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie started out great and a great sense of gritty childhood but after a half hour in the world of the wild things I got bored really quickly. It looks great (well, in that hand held, long lens 'indie' kind of way) and the creatures were fantastic (I loved the design and how they were brought to life) but not a lot happens in the story. The kid, a great actor, is a bit annoying in a brat-like kind of way and I never really felt like he learned anything. I never knew what was at stake or who to root for so I disconnected from the story.If I was to summarize I'd say - this film looks great and feels fresh but the script is all over the place. If there's one thing I feel about Spike Jonze and people like Michel Gondry etc... they are genius behind the camera but not the pen (or the keyboard). If I were them I'd let writers like Charlie Kaufman take care of my scripts - the proof is there, he wrote their best films by far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As bad as the trailers make it look.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I should have trusted my instincts when the goofy trailers turned me off to this film. Then the glowing reviews started pouring in - I'm talking to you Entertainment Weekly - and I decided to give it a shot. The movie starts out in the real world just fine. The first 30-minutes or so reminded me of my childhood and had some good emotional moments. I had high hopes. Those quickly deflated when I realized that the "fantasy world" 3/4 of the film lacked any sort of compelling story or interesting developments. There is a build-up to meeting two owl characters and boy what a letdown THAT was. Add to that the other boring characterizations, and it really showed that the writers had no idea how to make their film the least bit interesting. So the movie plods on with a barely tolerable soap-opera storyline, and trashing their environment and felling old-growth forest are depicted as fun. (If this is supposed to be some child's fantasy, I wonder what will become of this sick developing mind.) The success rate for children's dream-world fantasy is appallingly low: Alice's Wonderland and Dorothy's Oz have few peers. In comparison, WILD THINGS is just depressing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where the Wild Things Are is wonderful. It is ironic however that although this film is based on a children's book, its full impact as a psychological metaphor of a frustrated and lonely child will probably be appreciated more by adults. Kids will see the beasts, but might not be able to associate them as allegorical extensions of young Max. Indeed, young minds will be mesmerized by some of the most interesting creatures to ever grace the silver screen. And the beasts are the draw to this very simple story. If it wasn't for the remarkable achievement to make them as real as life, the film might diminish greatly. The character development and humanness imparted to them was delightful. Carol was great, but the goat was absolutely fascinating. I haven't been so captivated by such illusion since I first saw the Wizard of Oz nearly 52 years ago when I was 8.The ending is wrapped up very simply, culminating similarly to the emotional conclusion found in The Yearling: A young boy matures into a young man. Bravo!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The WOW! of Wild Things</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good Evening,For Melissa's' 26th birthday I took her to see Where the Wild Things Are and it was a profound movie. We were stunned. Although marketed as a kids movie it is also most assuredly for adults. It addresses an area for kids that I have never seen in a "kids" movie and made it highly accessible to them as well. Specifically, rage and frustration when you have no say so about what is going on around you. Before Max goes to the wild side he finds himself in a situation that so many kids--and now adults--have grown up with (or know someone that has) and yet has never been addressed in a medium that kids can so readily relate to. There is much more to it than that but these are elements of the crucial axis that Wild Things spins on. I wept at the depth of it. The point of love overcoming fears that can often lead to the rage and frustration was beautifully downplayed so as not to diminish the realities of those scary things that often come our way unaware. It touched me to tears but not the sappy kind. The realness of it that was head and shoulders above any "ah ha!" that might be readily filed away.It is at the IMAX. I will definitely see it there again. It is not a Julie Tamore, Frank Oz or Jim Henson kind movie. It is a Wow! unto itself. Sweet Dreams, Lisa</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just got home from seeing Where the Wild Things Are in IMAX. I remember checking this book out of the library a few times as a child. It was one of my favorites. I liked it because of the adventurous spirit and imagination. The first half of the movie had that same feeling and brought on a sense of nostalgia. However the second half of the movie is somewhat of a downer.The cinematography was great and the little boy was a good actor. I just didn't like the filler story line. Granted the book only had 10 lines so they had to embellish the rest. I just didn't like the direction it took.I watched an interview/biography of Maurice Sendak last night on demand. He is an interesting person but has a very pessimistic view on life. He didn't seem to have very much joy in his life. It shows in the movie.</fullReview>

I know its an adaptations, but it does no justice to the book. Out of nowhere this kid is in the middle of some fantasy world with weird looking creatures. They make him their king for no reason and believe that the kid has some super powers. And then there is nothing really happening in the movie in terms of story, and all of sudden they realize that the kid has no powers. And the kid leaves.Almost everybody was in the hall was so frustrated with the movie, and I don't get how all the reviews on IMDb are so good. I believe these reviewers are hired by the producers or whatever to mislead us.Frankly, this movie does not make sense at all. Animation, direction, storyline, acting- everything is so screwed up.I was mislead by the reviews here on IMDb.So, don't even believe my comment.

		<shortDescription>Ambitiously unique and visually arresting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is something inherently ambitious about the mere thought of adapting Where the Wild Things Are from book to film. The beloved children's book is forty-eight pages long, mainly consisting of illustrations, and very few words. But somehow, Spike Jonze and his co-writer Dave Eggers managed to whip Maurice Sendak's story about a young boy named Max (Max Records), who journeys to a land ruled by the titular wild things, into a fully functioning feature-length film. And the results are simply staggering.Where the Wild Things is a unique film right from its opening graffiti filled credits. It does not set out to be an art house piece per se as some may want you to believe, but it does not set out to be the heart-filled big budgeted family film it appears to be from the outside. At the same time, it is also a total departure for Jonze, who before Michel Gondry and the man himself, was one of the few who could translate Charlie Kaufman's written word to film.For one thing, Jonze and Eggers have fashioned a storyline all their own, creating something that is only reminiscent of the book. The wild things have names here, and are more fully developed than the monsters jumping around in fun poses. Max's relationships, and what drives him to take his fantastical journey in the first place, have been greatly expanded. Max as a character himself, has been expanded. But in almost every way possible, the film stays reverent to its source material. It never deviates from the grand scheme of what Sendak was prying at in the original novel, and it never tries to come off as something much greater than it is. It was a simple story when originally conceived, and despite some rather emotionally heavy thoughts and ideas some children may be unable to process properly, sticks to being a simple story here too.But of course, the adaptation is far from perfect. There are more than a few instances where some of the fun Max is having with the wild things drags on for a bit, and other times where the tonal shifts were outright distracting. Ever since the film was forced into a delay, there were rumours of how dark the film was and how unfriendly it was towards children. Compromises were apparently made, and it shows in how jarring some of the editing it is. On a whim, the film jumps from being a whimsically adventurous fantasy picture to a deeply serious study of loneliness and the importance of family, and then back again. It never seems to find its footing in which tone it wants to follow, and frequently wallows in seemingly having no idea what it wants to be, true to the thought-process of a child or not. Unresolved plot points that factor in heavily to the story also work against the film as a whole, as do bizarre scenes added for what appears to be comic effect, or simply to baffle the audience as to why they were included in the first place. I imagine I am not the only one who thinks it, but it would be very interesting to see what Jonze originally envisioned for the film and how much of it was not retained here.But while the plot contrivances are a bit disappointing, the visuals are simply marvelous. The film has a very distinct look, and it is simply magical to watch it unveil itself throughout the film's running time. The camera sticks to Max's point-of-view for the entirety of the film, frequently filming from radically different and very intimate angles. There is a bit too much shaky cam work in some scenes (mainly involving running), but it is still done in a way that feels like it belongs (unlike films like Public Enemies where it just becomes an annoyance). The film boldly wants to be a showcase for child fantasy and adventure, and manages to convey these ideas for the entirety of its running time (even as the fantasy borders on the plain weird). Wisely choosing to use mainly puppet effects, the film looks more real than any recent fantasy film, and harks back to the days before special effects and all digital actors became the norm. I thoroughly enjoyed watching Records interact with the wild things, and found it hard to notice where the digital effects were added (outside of some bizarre sequences involving jumping or falling). Watching them move around and react is worth marveling at all on its own. These wild things just look so realistic and authentic that portraying these characters and this story any other way would have been an injustice to the audience and to the book itself.The voice acting is fairly well done for the most part. It was a little strange to hear a bit of a toned down Tony Soprano coming from James Gandolfini as lead wild thing Carol, but it feels very appropriate for how emotional some of his scenes quickly become. His soothing childish voice twists just too easily into something incredibly angry, and manages to have just enough personality to stay consistently animated and engaging. Paul Dano, Chris Cooper and Lauren Ambrose put in some amusing and heartfelt work, but Catherine O'Hara and Forest Whitaker just lack the same consistency. But the real treat is Records, a relative unknown, who carries the film like a seasoned actor. He commands the screen, and his gentle innocence and naivety is simply beautiful to witness.I wanted to adore Where the Wild Things Are like I do the original book. But the film is a flawed work that still manages to be visually arresting. There is a lot that holds the film back from eternal greatness, but more than enough that suggests it is still better than a typical cookie cutter children's film.8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome to the Wild!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There aren't many films made about childhood that don't speak down to the kids in the audience, this is one of those rare films. Where the Wild Things Are is quite simply a film about childhood, told in a deeply affecting way, speaking directly to the kid in all of us instead of speaking down at us.The film is based off of the classic children's book of the same name, following a young boy named Max, who after a fight with his mother, runs away from home to the land of the Wild Things (big furry creatures supplied by the Jim Henson Creature Shop). That's the story, plain and simple. Of course the biggest question is how well does a nine sentence book translate to a 90 minute movie? Surprisingly enough, splendidly.While the first 20 minutes set in the real world kind of run their course a bit, the film really picks up speed once Max is crowned King of the Wild Things and the film doesn't slow down till the credits roll. Director Spike Jonze should be commended for maintaining the very essence of the book while making something that is very much his own. The film is a visual feast. Jonze has created a gritty fantasy world, one that can be both beautiful, and foreboding, but it is within the characters that this film finds its strength.There are really only a handful of human characters in this film, the rest are the Wild Things themselves. Each Wild Thing has a distinct personality. Unlike many kids movies, the Wild Things are not caricatures of fake people, but rather they are real people deep down. The feelings, the emotions, the thoughts in which the Wild Things express, are more human than most human characters in similar children's fantasies. My personal favorite of the Wild Things is the hippy-like KW, voiced by Lauren Ambrose, but all have their moments to shine. And if an actor could get an Oscar nomination for voice-over work, I'd campaign James Gandolfini for Best Supporting Actor as the leader of the Wild Things, Carol. Then there is Max himself, played funny enough by a kid named Max Records. Records is simply marvelous as Max. He's at that ripe age where he isn't afraid to express his emotions and he is able to carry a film on his back better than many adult actors. It is through Records that we identify with this film. The childhood arguments. Games of pretend war. Being outgrown by our older siblings. Being hurt by our parents or our friends through the lies and pettiness of childhood. It is all there in Where the Wild Things Are.Where the Wild Things Are is simply put, a wonderful film. While I found the segments taking place in the real world a tad slow-moving, once we reach the island of the Wild Things, it shifts into high gear telling a beautiful tale laced with genuine heart.I give Where the Wild Things Are an 8 out of 10!</fullReview>

The children's book certainly did not contain the same level of anger. Glad that I didn't bring any small children to the theater for this one.Of course, the Tony Soprano voice-over should have been my first clue of the violence that was about to unfold. Don't get me wrong -- loved James Gandolfini and associates in the HBO series. But that series was not based on a children's book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw the film and Spike Jonze does not disappoint. He literally thrusts the audience into the world of max in the opening sequence. Immediately after the title cards were on screen I knew that my expectations were pointless. I just sat back and enjoyed the ride.The "all to real" world of max's life in the beginning balances out the magical, surreal qualities of the Wild Things Island. Spike Jonze has captured the child like innocence and created a voice in cinema that is rarely seen. While watching I felt at times that I was truly observing through a child's eyes and needed to cast aside my adult views of relationships and views. People have been saying that it isn't a romp and fun good time type of adventure film... Well it is. It is a much more internal adventure of self discovery from the perspective of the child.I commend Jonze for his voice in this film and would not be surprised at a few Oscar nominations. Director, Special Effects, Sounds, Music, Actor.... All were top notch.

		<shortDescription>Visually stunning but meandering and grim</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't say I hated Where the Wild Things Are and the film had a lot of admirable qualities but overall the pacing was very poor and the film was so weepy and grim that I started to resent it midway through. There's nothing wrong with a child's movie with a dark streak and I think a director like Tim Burton could have imbued the film with the sense of magic it sorely lacked. Spike Jones film is so depressive and mopey that adults may find it tedious and even kids of the right age (I took my 9 y.o. but would not recommend it for children younger than 7 or 8) will be bored to tears with the lack of any dramatic pull or levity. On the plus side the movie really looks awesome. The beasts are exceptionally well-rendered in costumes plus CGI facial expressions. The woodland and desert settings on the island are gloriously shot and really beautiful. Jones is an auteur and the film has a distinct visual style, very bleached out colors and almost a retro 70s sort of look to it. The acting is uniformly good, particularly Max (Max Records), his mother (Catherine Keener), and James Gandolfini voicing Carol, the raging, angry Wild Thing. On the downside, the wild things - particularly Carol, who is clearly intended as the counterpart to Max's rage at his divorced mother - spend so much time hurting each other's feelings, bickering about hurt feelings and outright crying, well ... I found it not just boring but also incredibly navel-gazing and pretentious. This film wasn't intended for kids. It is a whiny Gen-X meditation on childhood. And I'm a Gen-Xer. I just resent a film that's based on a book that's somewhat dark but mostly evokes a sense of wonder, instead trying to be a grim, serious take on childhood confusion and anger. The brittle indie rock soundtrack didn't help much. I'm not surprised to learn that David Eggers wrote the screenplay, since his breakthrough novel A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius was equally turgid, pretentious and dull. Far as kids go, I'll tell you this: My 9 y.o. girl loves Pee Wee's Big Adventure, The Nightmare Before Christmas, Wall-E and other movies that are for kids but have a dark streak. She has also walked out of every film I've taken her to (Monsters vs. Aliens, I Spy, the Incredibles, etc.) saying it's her favorite movie ever.She hated Where the Wild Things Are and went on and on during the car ride home about how whiny and annoying it was, and I can't blame her. The film ended and in my theater full of parents and kids from 3-12, there were no applause and really no conversations at all as the credits rolled. They should give you a Zoloft with your movie ticket. I don't even mind depressing if that's what you're going for - films like The Ice Storm and Donnie Darko come to mind. I just don't understand why you would take such a bizarre emo- approach to such a classic children's book. Where the Wild Things Are is certainly interesting but not at all entertaining and mainly a failure. I'd particularly caution parents against taking small children.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe as a young child watching this film wouldn't really interest me but watching this as an adult, when I can really understand what the film is about makes me realize how amazing this film really is. The director of this film is a very talented man and he can truly create a beautiful story and image. This film has deep meaning about families and the troubles of living and just growing up in general. As someone who commonly lives in his mind most of the time I can actually relate to Max and how he imagines this world to escape but even his imagination isn't perfect. It brings warmth to my heart to see something as artistic and beautiful as this. As a fan of the original book as a child growing up and as an adult this story has brought comfort for many years and I'm happy it exist. It's sad it didn't do much better at the box office like it deserves. With newer films by the same director like Her which is also one of my favorites I think the directors future is going to be very, very successful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is amazing, he tells the story of a problematic boy who suffers mainly from lack of attention. At one point he enters the land of monsters where every monster is a feeling, at least that's what I could understand. He goes on to not fear them little by little, when he returns to reality he is stronger emotionally. Each day in the world of monsters his behavior is improved with the emotions. Super ego, Lies, Fear, lack, anger, all this is working within a preteen. I think every child should watch this movie. The soundtrack is very playful, the performance of Max Records is perfect. We drown both in history that it seems that we are there living the scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's hard being a family</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to start by acknowledging the many negative reviews here. This is not a movie aimed at children. It is not an "adaptation" of the book. It is not a comedy or an animated movie. It's not uplifting, fun, or light.It is a great drama on the nature of family and love as seen through the eyes of a child. Everyone who had a childhood that was not complete sweetness and perfection should be able to identify with one or more of the characters. My 8-year-old has loved this movie for years, but not all kids will. And given its dark and sad take on how hard it is to be a child, I would not recommend letting a child under 12 watch this alone for the first time.Plot outline:Max runs away from home after another violent argument with his mother. When he finds himself among the Wild Things, he finds that they are a boisterous, belligerent, dysfunctional family much like his own. I would say they are roughly 10 or 11-year-olds emotionally, with KW slightly more mature. But unlike most families, there are no parents, just a group of argumentative pre-teens. That's why they need Max to become their king. Think of their environment as your middle school playground.Carol (James Gandolfini) is an informal leader subject to violent mood swings. KW (Lauren Ambrose) is the slightly older sister who is trying to distance herself from her immature siblings. Alexander (Paul Dano) is the quiet one who wants to be friends but it too shy to get deeply involved. Judith (Catherine O'Hara) is the skeptic who criticizes others but has trouble offering solutions of her own. Forest Whitaker, Chris Cooper, and Michael Berry round out the crowd as Ira, Douglas, and The Bull, respectively. Each one of them is an archetype of a youngster you probably knew when you were growing up (and you may have been one of them, or some combination of them). They aren't really "Wild Things" -- they are all just children finding their way in the world.The interactions among the Wild Things are played perfectly, just as childhood is / was / will be as long as we are human. Roughousing games turn into fights. Fights turn into jokes turn into laughter. Friendships falter, regroup, and falter again. Loneliness and the desire for love are interspersed with moments of togetherness.The metaphors in this movie are pretty well telegraphed. It doesn't require repeated watchings to understand that "Sleeping in a pile" is their version of feeling close and loved. Bob and Terry are the near- mythical older friends who are supposedly wise. Being a "king" means being a good parent. And as KW correctly says near the end, "It's hard being a family."*** Minor spoiler below ***In the closing scene, Max and his mother smile at each other, despite their terrible fight from the start of the movie. That's the one uplifting moment, when unconditional love shines through, even though it's hard being a family.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Third Film By Spike Jonze.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Less a children's movie &amp; more a film about childhood, Where the Wild Things Are is director Spike Jonze's third feature that concerns a lonely 9-year old boy named Max who has an imaginative vision &amp; quite a raging anger, the latter of what makes him run away from home after which he sails to an island inhabited by fanciful creatures known as the "wild things" who crown him as their king.Spike Jonze's focus here isn't on making the story suitable for all ages. Instead, the film is a reflection of the time when our creative imagination is rapidly booming while we try to get an idea about the world around us. There's a striking simplicity &amp; subtle maturity in the tale that will either leave people completely astonished or quite frustrated. And even though we know it's all part of imagination, we can't help but get drawn into its beautifully narrated story.Based on the 1963 children's book of the same name, the screenplay is steadily expanded into a 105 minutes tale with each creature given its name &amp; personality and brought alive on screen through performers in costumes, animatronics or CGI. Also, the voice acting is brilliantly carried out &amp; Max Records delivers in what was a vital performance for this film to be a success.Nicely directed, deftly written, elegantly photographed, finely edited &amp; beautifully scored, Where the Wild Things Are may not be as mind-blowing or extremely intriguing as Jonze's other films but is surely one effort that will remind everyone how beautiful childhood truly was. Spike Jonze has handled it with meticulous care &amp; although not everyone is gonna be enchanted by it, the creativity &amp; vision that went into its making still deserves an applause.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-Made, But Simple Story!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where the Wild Things Are is certainly a very good movie when it comes to the technical aspects but rather lacking when it comes to characterization and story. This movie also is pretty boring despite being very good to look at. I'm rating this movie high because I thought the monsters were very good and they were the ones with the true emotional depths.This film, based off childhood-favorite book by Maurice Sendak, is about a boy who runs away from home and travels across the sea in his fantasy imagination where he meets a colony of very tall monsters. There, he claims himself to be king and he brings the group together.I really despised the boy in this film. He is a self-centered, arrogant little brat but I guess that is what Spike Jonze wanted us to see. Max Records did a good job playing the spoiled kid. I thought the voices were perfect for the monster.Overall, this is an okay film but it's nothing special other than the technical achievements. The monsters were very good CGI. But this movie felt longer than the one hundred minutes. There were parts that seemed to go on forever. But, the little ones would probably enjoy this film a lot. I rate this film a very generous 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Living Mythology</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In May the legendary Maurice Sendak, one of the world's most beloved authors and illustrators, passed away. 'Where the Wild Things Are', his fifth and most famous children's book, was first published in 1963. It has since enjoyed decades of literary devotion (over 19 million copies have sold worldwide) and been repeatedly adapted for film and, in 1980, performed in an opera which traveled from Europe to America. In all senses, 'Where the Wild Things Are' is an example of living mythology.The book and consequently the final major adaptation ? a feature length film in 2009 ? revolves around the story young Max (Max Records). He escapes the trials of childhood and enters a world run by monsters who eventually make him their king; Sendak's interpretation of escapism and the desire to simply be big.Similar to the original book, the film challenges the usual lightness of children's stories. Max's journey to adulthood and the growing pains that go with it are not washed over.Where the Wild Things Are - Trailer Over the years several directors approached Sendak to adapt his book for the big screen, with little success.Then Sendak met director Spike Jonze. With a background covering the music industry, advertising, film and publishing Jonze was considered a visionary. His celebrity-heavy circle of friends also ensured his place in the spotlight. Icelandic starlet Bjork, rocker Beck, Fatboy Slim and the Beastie Boys are among his acquaintances.Jonze, Sendak and other members of the "Where the Wild Things Are" team enjoyed a decade long relationship. Best-selling author and hipster sweetheart Dave Eggers developed the screenplay. Jonze shipped in 300 specialists and housed them in the world's largest render farm in London.Masterful acting, computer animation and puppetry contributed to the monsters' organic texture, allowing the audience to relate to the emotions and nuance intended by Sendak. The overall effect and realness of the monsters added to the film's whimsical feel, where Jonze played with light and shade in a manner supporting Max's tumultuous experience.Sendak, a sickly boy during his younger years, was plagued by life's horrors; death and loss. By writing 'Where the Wild Things Are,' a book initially deemed as controversial in its portrayal of fanged monsters as beloved characters, Sendak let his benign demons out.Jonze's adaptation stuck to the book's message; it was honest, tender and got to the heart of the story. Becoming the king of your own fears is surely every child's fantasy. Both Sendak (who probably suffered the desire intensely) and Jonze have made this a believable target.Find all of our film and festival coverage, as well as our events and education at www.DohaFilmInstitute.com.

		<fullReview>I always loved reading this book as a child growing up so I was very excited when I found out it was being made into a movie. Overall I really enjoyed this movie from the start all the way to the end! The plot was as it should be and the actors they picked out were exceptional, both for acting and voice overs. Just like in the book the child was a brat and that was a big relief.Special effects were fantastic and the music they had picked out fit the movie so well. I have nothing bad to say about this movie except that it tended to get a little depressing but other than that it was very well done! I definitely recommend buying this movie to add to your collection and I am so glad that I did because this is one movie I can watch over and over again!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Young Max (Max Records) learns a lesson about parents for all kids: They don't have the answers to everything but their love can be boundless. Spike Jonze delivers the Maurice Sendak children's book without sending it into screenplay (or Disney-like) orbit. The Wild Things have lines here that mimic children speaking to each other while Max is their king without a plan. He rolls with it until exposed, but the Wild Things understand this... sound familiar? It's parenthood in a child's imagination figured out while being punished in his room. The best portrayal of children's feelings on film through an adventure of imagination., not unlike Spike's other film, Endless Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind. Brilliant</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where the Wild Things Are (2009)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll give this film some big points for style. It strikes a very unusual tone, has its own sense of pacing, and I've never seen anything quite like it. The closest analogue I can think of is FANTASTIC MR. FOX. But where Wes Anderson embraces the whimsy of the source material while maintaining his typical wistfulness, Jonze seems to be running as far away from whimsy as he can, leaving a big pile of melancholy. Funnily enough, my favorite section of the movie was the first 20 minutes, exploring Max's personality (quite likable) and family. Everything after that is an interesting exercise but feels very forced. From the hipster emo soundtrack to the casual dialogue to the all-too-obvious parallels to Max's home life, it had an air of self-consciousness that I couldn't shake. I respect what Jonze is going for, and there are moments where he succeeds admirably (the last 5 minutes are really quite sweet), but far too often (as in BEING JOHN MALKOVICH) it just felt like he was trying too hard, and trying too hard not to look like he was trying at all. Also, a lot of the voices didn't work for me at all (Paul Dano is wussy, whiny and annoying even when he's playing a giant goat thing).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My initial thoughts of this film is that it would be silly and cringey. But i was wrong. The thing that made it for me was the character focus on Max. Right from the start we see Max in the opening sequence right till the end. It didn't feel like the focus was ever lifted from him as the film was all about following Max on this special journey and i feel like we did. The actor who played Max wasn't bad as well, not as cringey as i thought he would be. I loved the huge monsters, they were cool. It was a sweet film and it felt raw, and i liked how there was a calmness to the film and all you could do is relax and see what Max gets up to. The ending was good as you could feel what it was trying to convey but i would have liked it to be a bit more uplifting. That's the thing about this film, it was slightly depressing throughout. But i think, in a way, that's what i loved about the film, it's emotion and drama. All in all it was a great surprise and a really good film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw 'Where the Wild Things Are' a couple days after a group of my friends went and saw it. A large chunk of the group were pretty disappointed with it.After the film had finished I walked home floating on a cloud of pleasantness baffled how anyone but the most cynical person could be negative about such a movie. I couldn't stop yammering about it or wipe the smile off my face.I don't really know where I stand in relation to the whole argument on whether it is a real kids movie. I know I'm not convinced I would have been quite as entranced by this movie 10 years ago. One of the many reasoning I've heard to disliking the movie is it having a bad message for kids. In that they can act up and get away with it. I both disagree with this and think it is completely missing the point. This movie is about what it is like being a kid not a fable to teach them how to behave.Max is no doubt a self-centered brat but he is also only 8. A kid who never thinks his parents are unfair to him and doesn't act irrational when things don't go his way doesn't really exist except in sugary sweet children movies. Like Max does in the movie when he observes the Wild Things acting in the way he did children learn to be responsible as they grow but that selfish impulse will always be there and certainly never really mastered until after the teenage years..This film explores the fun kids have when pretending. The favorites they play. Their cruel ganging up on mentality. Their stubbornness. Their jealousy at being excluded. It also shows that even if you are naughty your mum will still love you. It is a film with a free spirit and an imagination which is unlimited with the amazing special effects. Effects which never rob the film of its heart.I loved this film. Unconditionally</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a rendition of Maurice Sendak's slightly wistful but generally happy-natured story as it might have been told by Eeyore, A. A. Milne's donkey who saw nothing but gloom in everything. His exaggerated pessimism would seem an undesirable attitude for a children's movie to take; but then, this isn't really a children's movie.In the middle of it, unexpectedly, there blossoms a beautiful scene where the little boy (not quite as little as Sendak's) visiting the country of the wild things is shown a miniature landscape that one of them has secretly sculpted. Sticking his head through a hole in the middle (like Alice's rabbit hole in reverse), he finds himself surrounded by this imaginary world, where everything is as it should be and all the bad things are left out: an appealing fantasy. But then the voice of Eeyore weighs in to remind us that that won't ever happen, it's all moonshine; and in the end the movie sees to it that the perfect little world is smashed up; better that way, really.And so with the boy's ascendancy in the community of wild things. He declares himself king, and indeed, becomes king. But when he fails to make them all happy--as no king ever did or ever will--Eeyore's voice comes in again to remind them, and us, that he isn't a REAL king--presumably meaning not of royal descent--and so must leave. (The alternative isn't spelled out, but before he took on the kingship they had threatened to eat him.) Once he is exposed, even his best friend--the artist who wrecked his art or allowed it to be wrecked--turns against him. "What are you, then?" he asks. "I'm just Max," says the boy. "Well, that's not much," his former friend concludes; Max silently agrees; and the movie, seeing him through Eeyore's eyes, lets the judgment stand. No point in trying to be something you're not, even if you succeed at it; you won't be that REALLY; you'll still be what you started out as: Not Much; and you always will. You'll become an outcast and will never again be allowed on Sesame Street.For Sesame Street is what this movie recalls, along with assorted art-house movies: it's like a Werner Herzog film with Muppets, but also extremely moralistic. However, the moral keeps changing, as the story careers one way and another, and in the end it makes no more sense than the stories in Spike Jonze's other movies. To take the most obvious example: Max reaches the island of the wild things by stealing a boat and sailing across; and he isn't dreaming. The island is part of the same reality as his own neighborhood. So how can he be the first person to set foot on it? Were I to take the story as a coherent whole, I would have to interpret it as a case study of a nearly autistic child whose self-absorption climaxes in an attack on his mother. This precipitates a total break with reality and catapults him into a hallucination in which he meets others of his kind and even achieves some stature among them but in the end is turned out even by his imaginary friends. He resorts to his mother--his victim--who he can be sure will care for him in spite of the threat he poses to her; but in her weariness, brought on by worry and overwork on his behalf, she drops off just looking at him.Now, logically, at this point I'd expect him to turn on her and on his sister and do to them what the wild things had nearly done to him. And when the police arrive and find him among the gnawed carcasses, he's permanently detached from reality, but happy withal: he's proved to the wild things he really belongs with them and they've welcomed him back to the island and he can live with them there forever. No such ending appears on screen; but maybe it's one of the deleted scenes on the DVD.This movie looks like art. It has indie film acting, art film landscapes, and university radio station music in some nursery-cabaret mode. It also has giant, literal incarnations of the Sendak drawings, so designed and operated as to appear almost real: too real, as far as I was concerned. And like much art, or seeming art, it isn't meant for children. I would surmise that it's aimed at adults of the type who like to see children realize themselves. Should any of them have been attracted by its artlike trappings, I think they might question whether the messages of this movie--don't imagine what might be, resign yourself to what is, and to the little you are--will nurture anyone's best possibilities.Or, as the first Eeyore put it: Over-rated, if you ask me. Silly stuff. Nothing in it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In response to "robertvaughan"'s review, I personally am in full agreeance with the critics (in contrast to 'robertvaughn') who made note that this film was a boring piece of work with a very slow pace. My wife and I literally had to force ourselves to sit through the work, with both of us completely bewildered as to what the plot was about (and this coming from my wife was quite amazing, considering that she read the original work and absolutely loved it).If THIS story line is anything about the typical young boy's "psyche" (as so aptly put by several other reviews), then we as a world have quite a lot to worry about with the new generation of children that are currently growing up. Psychiatry anyone? And, to top it all off, *spoiler alert*, the boy who runs away from home and causes distress to his mother gets rewarded with a piece of chocolate cake in a way to say "That's OK, go ahead and be a delinquent!!". Talk about responsible parenting - sheesh!! Why did I give the score a vote of 3 out of 10? One point for the costumes, which were brilliant and (apparently) depicting of the characters from the book. One point for the terrific cinematography and wonderful scenery used throughout the film (the IMAX version would've been exceptionally impressive). And one point for the main actor who actually played a decent role (with Max's emotional journey) for being given literally no plot to work with in the first place.Please, for your own sake, be sure to invest your time of 101 minutes, and any money that you would've spent on this film, elsewhere. We're both glad that we'd waited for the film to reach subscription TV, but the time investment is gone, unfortunately.....</fullReview>

Of course they had to invent a story, but if you don't like being in a bad mood don't see this movie. The book leaves you happy, whereas the film doesn't. When I first saw it in the cinema I liked it quite a lot, but when I saw it again on DVD I kind of freaked out that every bit in the movie was based on some kind of psychological trauma. This gives it a serious feeling which is not good for kids. Anyway it is pretty well made and they don't overdo the special effects(I thought that they would make all the monsters by computer), but somehow it doesn't leave you satisfied.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, I just watched this movie, and I'm just not feeling it.I totally get what people are saying about it having a deeper meaning-- every movie/book has a deeper meaning. But this is a children's movie, where the the meaning should smack you in the face, and where the morals and lessons should be painfully obvious. I mean I got it, I could see what they were aiming for, I could see what the "Wild Things" represented-- but a child? Do you honestly think they would be able to see the deeper meaning of this? I don't think so, what they see is what they are shown. And what were they shown? A neglected boy acting out against his preoccupied mother, lashing out by biting her and then running away to where wild beasts destroy things and fight to show their feelings? What did it teach kids? How in any way did it show them the proper way to express themselves? Uh... No.I don't know. It was very weird, that's the only way I can describe it. I remembering seeing the preview and having a flashback to reading the book as a young child. To be honest I don't really remember much of it, just bits and pieces, but when I saw that preview, I swear, there was a nostalgic pang inside my heart. Because that book represented a time of my life I can never get back, and though I can barely remember it, it still stuck with me all these years.But the movie, does it have that same forever lasting effect? Will children look back on it and feel that same pang? I'm afraid not.Bottom line: If you have a child, just read them the book. You'll get much more out of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A child's ability to transcend this physical reality to its innermost, dearest is at display in Spike Jonze's film. Inspired as the story may feel and seem, it's disappointingly flat, and it doesn't capture the high emotions that could easily have pierced the viewer's heart. It certainly doesn't overwhelm, and the draggy elements of the story feels unnecessary and tame. There's also little room for acting chops, as it's only Max Records in the main character that's got anything to show (and Catherine Keener plays a small part as his mum), the rest is partly animated people all dressed up in costumes. WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE doesn't live up to its title, and the emotional impact stay at shore, as I felt lost between land and sea, and hoped for something with more impact to arrive, which it sadly didn't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My two daughters liked the book but found the movie long, depressing and "did not make sense". This book takes about 5 min to read...yet Spike Jones tried to turn this into a 2 hour movie. Anyone who has read the book...should already know the ending.What puzzled me about this movie is why it greatly exaggerated and swayed far away from its original story line. The movie turns into some dark examination of a child's behavior during a attention deprived lull in family life. The writer of the Movie decided to start attaching all kinds of parallels for child tantrums to the wild things.Graphics, costumes and sets were very weak. I think Seasame Street had a better production than this movie. The plot plods slowly in multiple directions as if written by a sleepy 5 year old.This movie will test the adults ability to stay awake while trying to imagine what the point of the plot is? Barely worth the $1 Redbox rental. But you are better off checking out the book for free from your local library, and let your child imagine a story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not what it should have been</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I saw this movie I had heard two conflicting reviews. One was good, one was bad. I prepared myself for a bad movie, but went in hopeful. I can't say it was a bad film. It wasn't. In fact I thought it was good. What I didn't like was the direction it took.Max is a lonely kid. His sister pays little attention to him. His mother is busy and has a boyfriend. The father is not in the movie. There is no explanation as to the father's absence, but it is not needed.Max acts out because he feels that his mother is not paying enough attention to him when she brings the boyfriend over for dinner. His actions lead to him running away and ending up in the land of the wild things. Just like in the book he becomes king of the wild things. After that the story takes a turn for the depressing.The wild things all have issues. One was lonely, one felt he was being ignored, and still another gets angry at Max because she thinks he's playing favorites.The film is well made. The shots are beautiful, the wild things are magnificent and Max was well acted. I believed his performance and felt for him. The problem I had with it was that it was depressing. It stated certain truths, but left me unfulfilled. The sadness that there was in the movie didn't exist in the book. The film was based on a children's book, but it is for an older audience even though some children could relate to some of the situations.While I think it was a good film generally, it was a bad adaptation. It lost the spirit of the book. There are many serious films about the problems and challenges of childhood. I don't think this film should have been one of them. It should have been a film about a child acting out, running into a fantasy world, realizing his mistakes, and coming home. It was a movie about a lonely child who tries to help a bunch of whiny, mopey, sad, monsters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is dark, deep, and funny. I don't think it's really for children though. It seamed to have a deeper meaning then it appears. The movie makes you think, I like that. The art is beautiful. The beast were done amazingly, just how I see them in my head. The characters all have depth to them, good job, how un-Hollywood of you. I just loved the sets, and think they should come build me a home like their fort.(It was fun picking which O'Doyle is who) The funny was funny, and you know how I HATE funny. With all this said it still left be a bit wanting and so I give this movie a 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of I had no background what the movie formerly originated, but to me it was like recalling Pan's Labyrinth or Bridge to Terabithia?which the two essentially had nothing to possess in similarity as to theme or flow of the story. They are akin to the sense that they are both fantasy. In the deepest sense also they are similar as to children's inexplicable magnitude of imagination. This latter one however can be argued by many viewers depending on their interpretation. That is why I loved very much how Pan's Labyrinth showed that kind of surreal delineation so as well with Bridge to Terabithia. Where the Wild things are could have been better except for little things of course. I didn't like the actor (Max Records)?well this is pretty subjective reasoning, but what I most precisely refer would be the character: Max. I got the feeling that he's the type you'll get bored with all those petty lies he babble and boast in front of you. But I deem that I just don't find his character that interestingly convincing. Well if we are to talk about his behaviors and attitude, it can be well mitigated by tracing how his current family is made of. His sister for example is too pre-occupied with his friends. Her mother is even bombarded with work stuff and is even elsewhere with her boyfriend. It's all alone to poor Max how to keep himself taken. And because of emotional distraught, fatigue, hunger he got into this weird island bravely all on his own. The parallel thing is that, this has the same ideological interpretation with Pan's Labyrinth's Ophelia and Bridge of Terabithia's Jess. They got into their own world, and we viewers sit there and watch them go to the trouble of their longing hearts. The conclusions were also typically similar, for a standard family-themed movie. It is to my discomfort however that the mixing of the sound was too "childy", that word doesn't even exist. The movie for me was too much into compelling kids rather than pulling a major percent attention of older age, probably I just get weary of such stuff. Well this doesn't qualify as an objective criticism, but to answer for that I say the movie is good in other aspects. The story was pretty genuine, graphics and effects were brilliant, the wrapping was good. All in all a family-coursed movie that can nip your interest on its own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>EDITEDVisionary director Spike Jonze brings Maurice Sendak's beloved children's book to the big screen with the help of hipster icon Dave Eggers, who teamed with Jonze to pen the adapted screenplay. A mixture of real actors, computer animation, and live puppeteering, Where the Wild Things Are follows the adventures of a young boy named Max (Max Records) as he enters the world of the Wild Things, a race of strange and enormous creatures who gradually turn the young boy into their king.Staring, Max Records, Catherine Keener, James Gandolfini, Paul Dano, Catherine O'Hara , Forest Whitaker , Michael Berry Jr. , Chris Cooper , Lauren Ambrose , Pepita Emmerichs , Max Pfeifer , Steve Mouzakis , Mark Ruffalo.Directed by the Visionary Spike Jonze, who directed Being John Malkovich and Adaptation.this is a fantasy drama movie based on a children book of 1963 by Maurice Sendak. the budget of this movie was surprisingly high, a 100 Million. this movie is a mix of live action, CGI, animatronics and performers in costumes. the weird creatures are called Wild Things and some actors did voice overs for them.this movie tells story of a child named Max who one night misbehaves with his mother, runs away and sails away to find an island with these weird wild creatures who makes him their king. Max seems lonely and depressed. he watches tension growing between that group of monsters and assure them that he is a King with great powers that will re unite them, but that is not true. you will see great amount of violent behaviors in this movie. smashing trees, throwing rocks and what not. depressed angry behaviors. to some extent i thought it was a bit too dark for the children, i haven't read the book but if its according to that them i don't have any problem. it might scare very young Children and generally the whole look of the movie suggests its not for young viewers. 10+ years would be fine.many viewers didn't liked this movie at all while on the other hand many Critics kept it in their Top 10 of the year lists. it is one of the year's best and i may keep it in my Top 25 but not in Top 20. this was the kind of movie that was meant to deal with polarizing reviews.Direction was good but not the best. screenplay was well written. plot was a bit uneven in the beginning. the whole imagination and vision of the director is appreciable to be exact, i liked it. good and lovely cinematography. i loved the songs that were used in it, outstanding songs. i remember playing the trailer over and over again just for the songs. out of Jonze's 3 movies, this is the weakest but still good.it was really sad, dark and just too depressing but emotionally engaging. it brought tears into my eyes towards the end. well see this movie just for his vision it is different and i appreciate that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful, tender &amp; bitter-sweet tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the boldest and most truly beautiful films I've ever seen.It's safe to say there is a reason that the reviews for this film is split (as they always will be for adaptations of such beloved children's books). If you were expecting a fun and vibrant, colourful tale of a run-away child frolicking about in the woods with a bunch of friendly monsters like a Dreamworks animation then this may not be the film for you. This is more at the Pixar end of the scale, and then some.These are not entirely care-free monsters, they have their troubles just like the rest of us, and the young child Max has more than his fair share of rage and confusion inside him. The tale is brooding and dark but above all has a truly human tenderness and beauty to it which shouldn't be missed.Combined with the visually stunning effects and palette, created using a combination of CGI and puppet suits, a perfectly fitting sound track from Karen O &amp; The Kids and great acting by Max Records as Max this is not a film to be missed. To take a 9 sentence children's book and turn it into a film is bold enough, to take it in such a direction in a Western market is incredibly bold.If you're not afraid to challenge yourself just set all your expectations aside and be ready for something unlike any other family film you've seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I agree with the person who said if they took their kids to see Saw 6, it would be less depressing than this movie. I thought the book was cheerful fun when I was a kid, leave it to Spike Jonze to turn it into a raised in suburbia nightmare...complete with sad monsters who act like they are high on something. Half of them sound like Kim Gordon. I guess this is supposed to be dark and introspective, like Max is taking the people in his life and giving their traits to these monsters, but that isn't developed enough in this movie for me to see it. It's depressing. The music and scenery are sort of nice, but I wouldn't make kids watch this crap, unless they are on a lot of antidepressants already. Childhood is supposed to be fun, like the book...this is dull and lifeless. I hoped for a lot more! :) For "deep" hipsters only!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A treat for both parent and child.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having not made a feature length movie in 7 years, and with writing credits of nothing but the explicit and darkly comic television show 'Jackass', Spike Jonze would be the last person on earth anybody would pick to adapt the beloved children's book 'Where the Wild Things Are' and in places, they would be right, but overall, Mr Jonze shines. A well known children's book such as this was always going to be made into a movie, but whereas most similar projects play it safe and dumb, 'Where the WIld Things Are' embraces the similarities between children and adults and connects the two greatly, making a movie which is not only a pleasure to watch for kids, but also brilliant for the adults who have been dragged along to see it. Do be warned however, although this is based on a children's book, considering that book was a mere 48 pages long, this movie attempts to fill in a lot of the blanks and so, there are some quite dark segments which may upset some very young children. The movie largely takes place in the mind of young Max, played by Max Records who definitely embraces the roll greatly, putting in an inspiring performance. Max runs away from home after an argument with his mother (the great Catherine Keener) and seeks solitude in the land of the wild things. The wild things themselves can be quite startling at first, each a bloated and giant sized version of a well known animal, but these are key characters and we soon see how nice they genuinely are. The dialogue structure and chain of events is definitely made for a young audience, with few complicated terms or situations, but there are however, plenty of hidden analogies which adults can freely and easily pick up on. The voice acting is tremendous as each of the relatively big stars (James Gandolfini, Forest Whitaker, etc) take to their characters with startling enthusiasm and we really feel at home with the wild things. Also, what's nice to see is Spike Jonze doesn't let the subject matter or the target audience hold him back, he very much does his own thing with this project and uses tints and contrasts well at different points in the story, bringing the ambitious and fantasy-driven tale to life with great enthusiasm. Jonze definitely threw his heart and soul into this movie and it shows as the finished product is not only unique in the world of children's movies, but also classifiable in the realms of more grown up and serious films too meaning this is a pleasure to watch for almost all ages. To conclude, 'Where the Wild Things Are' is a treat for everyone and whilst satisfying it's target audience well, it will not disappoint Jonze's current followers either as it maintains the look and feel of an indie film. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A whimsical journey of realisation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the moment I put on this film, I felt like I had been transported into the life an 8 year old boy who saw the world through very different eyes.Young Max has a very fanciful view of the world in which he lives. He desperately seeks to exist in the fantasy scenario, born of his juvenile visions.Max, cloaked in his favourite Wolf costume, clearly feels alone and to a certain extent rejected by those who surround him. This is probably why he has developed such an active imagination. The forts he builds are his way of sheltering himself from the harsh realities of the loneliness he feels, providing him with an element of comfort and safety. Max is the king of his fort.Near the start of this masterpiece, Max has an argument with his Mother when he feels a sudden rush of emotions that he can't quite assimilate. As a result, he runs. He runs as far away from the confusion as his Wolf legs can carry him.Max escapes reality and discovers "where the wild things are." In this extraordinary place, he finds a little piece of himself in several curious looking creatures. He meets, Carol, KW, Judith, Douglas, Ira, Alexander and The Bull. Each character exudes a separate piece of Max's personality and they can never quite seem to live together as one. This is Max's moment to lead them as King of the land and bring them all together in a giant fort where they can all sleep in a "real pile." Heaven! I won't tell you much of what happens during the film because it is a beautiful journey. To discover all of the wonder and amazement of this world is a real treat.Spike Jonze has somehow managed to immerse the viewer in a fantasy world that feels so real. He has produced a miraculous film where all of the individual components fit together in a perfect manner. The use of hand-held cameras really makes you feel a part of the discovery and the music used throughout the film could not have been better matched. The voice acting from the likes of James Gandolfini and Forest Whitaker is absolutely brilliant. The performance of, at the time, 12 year old Max Records is brilliant in it's innocence. Excellent casting. Everything about the film makes me smile. From the locations filmed to the costumes to the script.This film can teach us all something and I am so pleased that Jonze had the nerve to make such a film. A beautiful work of art that leads you through a range of very, very real emotions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where the wild things are is the adaptation of the worldwide known kids book written by Maurice Sendak about he adventures of a young boy named Max who, after being sent to bed for misbehaving, imagines that he sails away to where the wild things are. Max is loved by the wild creatures who make him their King, though he soon longs to be back home with his family. Directed by Spike Jonze, he manages to tell us a very tender, heart- breaking movie with a very wide age range, the movie can be seen by kids all ages passing through teens and finishing with adults and everyone will enjoy it. The cast is very good, Max Records, the kid in Max role, delivers us a great performance, the cast of voices for the monsters including Forest Whitaker, James Gandolfini and Catherine O'Hara is excellent. Catherine Keener as Max mom is quite decent and the short appearance of Mark Ruffalo as her boyfriend was pleasant enough. In conclusion, Where the wild things are is a entertaining and enjoyable movie everyone will love. Fully recommendable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a Hollywood Fairytale, Better!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spike Jonze's new film, "Where the Wild Things Are," is a definite departure from the traditional Hollywood formula. One could say that Jonze started creating the film when he was a child, and only recently decided to bring it to life. He said (in interviews that) he read Maurice Sendak's "Where the Wild Things Are" every night during a period in his childhood. He claims to have reread the book in 2003 after his breakup with Sophia Coppola, and was immediately catapulted back into Sendak's world. "Where the Wild Things Are" is a movie that a director could only hope to make, knowing that s/he would fall short of successfully encapsulating childhood in film. Jonze triumphantly succeeds in capturing the elusive element of childhood through the lens of young Max. The movie's most thought-provoking and visceral moments are still and silent. Max lies under his mother's office chair and plays with the pantyhose seam running over her toes, Max breathes heavily in frustration while in his bed, and the most piercing moment: Max's mother watching her son eat at the kitchen table, both completely at peace. The movie follows no particular plot line but parallels Max's wild emotions and imaginative journey. The film probably won't sink in with the majority of audiences because it does not follow a traditional narrative structure, and its unconventional character is "untamed" so to speak. However, the film can be understood on an artistic and intellectual level. Aesthetically, the film is beautifully constructed. The lighting creates a depth and warmth associated with nostalgic sepia tones. The wild music was indescribably perfect. Each song paralleled and intensified Max's extreme emotions of anticipation before throwing the snowballs at his sister's friends, joy when dancing with the wild things in the forest, and sadness after the war. Max is brilliantly played by young Max Records whose eyes are truly the window to the childlike essence of the character. His incredibly round eyes open wide and unflinchingly when burdened by the darker complexities of the world. They subtly change to a more squinted look when he tries to filter out the world and make sense of his well of emotional responses. He explains Carol's behavior to KW, but is really explaining his own behavior when he says that Carol isn't angry, "He's just scared. He doesn't mean to be that way," after Carol has run off on a destructive rampage. Jonze is able to convey Max's emotions through the deft use of lighting, music, and acting, but especially through the camera lens. Jonze occasionally makes use of using Max's perspective, but this seems trite. Jonze's camera direction seems it's as if Jonze told cinematographer Lance Acord to chase after Max without a tripod and get the best footage he could.That technique resulted in continuous frenzied fragments of the shot. Somehow this created a wealth of emotions for the viewer who pieced together the shots as emotion rather than plot or images. A particularly touching example is when Max yelps in animalistic joy with the wild things in the forest. Acord seems as though he was also participating in the rolling and jumping, and forgot that he was supposed to be taping. The broken shots and warm lighting set to the simplistic screeches and yelps of the wild things are beautifully rendered. The wild things serve as an ingenious allegory to the characters in Max's real life, and even to Max himself. They follow an outwardly illogical, Freudian pattern of behavior but are really uncontrolled, emotional manifestations of his mother, father, sister, sister's friends, and himself. Through his journey, he reaches a bittersweet reconciliation with himself. Jonze's film may not succeed in theaters because of its deviation from the conventional, but its visceral impact will connect with those who ? like Max ? love too much, cry too hard and laugh simply because they are alive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Where the Wild Things Are"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Where the Wild Things Are" couldn't possibly match public expectation compounded over time with interest. The film has been in development under Spike Jonze for the better part of the decade, with studio interest in the property dating as far back as the early eighties. Disney, Universal, and Warner Brothers' thirty-year game of hot potato has finally landed in American cineplexes, but as with any product gestated over comparable length, ends up unfavorably compared to an ideal preconception. "Wild Things" is imperfect, but nestles into a peculiar crevice where it doesn't disappoint, either. It's as faithful an adaptation as one could reasonably expect of a ten-sentence story, and Jonze's vision of Maurice Sendak's classic children's book is fierce, unflinching, and mature. The director takes particular care in elaborating that "Where the Wild Things Are" is not necessarily a film for children; it's a film about children.Enter Max (Max Records), as emotionally inscrutable an eight year old as, well, any actual eight year old. In contrast to your Pinocchios and your Charlie Buckets, Max embodies an astounding emotional range, compliments Records' chameleon-like propensity to adapt at a moments notice to being fearful, shy, boasting, ebullient, or enraged. These traits get passed along to the temperamental wild things as well, whose petty squabbles and secret loves substitute for traditional plot points in driving the movie forward.Certainly a novel premise, Jonze deserves a lot of credit for attempting the unconventional and the uncommercial in directing his first indisputably mainstream picture, even when it doesn't quite work. There are moments of transient beauty and touching affection, but watching the monsters emote can be an uninvolving experience just as often. Maybe it's because Max recedes into the background during some of these sequences, or because the creatures don't seem like products of his imagination so much as they do Jonze's or Sendak's. It may just be that "Where the Wild Things Are" suffers under the duress of being strung out on the rack and stretched to satisfy the requirements of a feature film.Still, "Wild Things" is a difficult film to criticize given its incredible earnestness and Jonze's clear, unifying vision. As evidenced by some of its most favorable reviews, there will be those with whom the film will form an intimate bond and deeply move. And, as evidenced by the lukewarm Rotten Tomatoes consensus score, there will be just as many that won't see anything of themselves in Max or the wild things, children who will be frightened or bored by the director's approach to the fantastic, and still more on whom the film will leave no impression whatsoever. "Wild things" is deeply personal and subjectively polarizing from its conception, but to dilute its appeal would be to compromise its artistic integrity.I see the greatness in "Wild Things," and envy those who made a complete connection with the piece. There are moments that strike nostalgic chords in me, tapping the raw emotional experience of my childhood, but are hardly omnipresent. My critical analysis is ultimately futile, ridiculous even, in its attempt to define a movie about feelings using blunt logic. "Where the Wild Things Are" is Max's world, Jonze's proxy, and if that comes at the expense of feeling sometimes inaccessible to me or the general audience, the director makes no apologies for it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many critics, commentators, or simple serious film goers believe we live in a time of decadence, a decaying time when serious, groundbreaking, ambitious films are harder and harder to find. I disagree. It is possible that in no other time since film exists did we have so many intelligent and sensitive filmmakers working. Among several threads, usually built around cultural roots (the Mexican, the korean), we have a number of contemporary creators who collectively and individually created new solutions, innovated in lasting ways, while producing a highly personal and sincere kind of film. Jonze, Gondry, Kaufman (maybe we can extend this to Medem). I find "Malkovich" and "sunshine" two fundamental milestones of this kind of film. If you consider Medem, a couple more works should be considered fundamental.What is it about? Links, connections, mind exploration, imagination rooted on how imagination works. Portals, transitions, muddy grounds for uneasy minds. This is essential post modern cinema stuff. As watchers, we become spectators of someone's mind, visitors of that mind, many times, like here, literally visitors. This film invests that notion with the idea of the creation of a whole complete world (borrowed from a book), filled with perfectly defined characters, each a fraction of the whole self. Self reference. this, we have Jonze, who renews a certain lyric idea of cinema. Carter Burwell helps; a lot. Jonze does not press on the irony key, like Kaufman does, nor does he become cynical, like Gondry does. He is a lyrical, he invests all his creativity on the poetic envisioning of things, of the world itself, of how it unfolds. The structure in his films is perfectly revealed to us, and leaves no doubt. So we concentrate on the textures of the world, on how feelings ache, on how painful it is to be every fraction (character) of the world he proposes. Malkovich out did every thing, and created something unique. This is his next great thing.Here, the collective effort of a single mind is visually invested in the creation of a structure, an architectural structure, the fort Max builds in his imagination. In how we watch that structure grow, we watch Max develop his imagined connections with his invented selfs. In a way, the structure, and the vision of that structure (the model) is a world within the world Max creates, and it becomes a character by itself. Landscapes: desert, forest, sea; set the needed moods.This is a highly sensitive world, like the inside of a body, where everything you touch has the highest impact, like the inside of KW, where Max hides. It's a world of doors, windows, connections. Sex.My opinion: 4/5http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Wild Things of Human Nature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit, I went into this movie expecting a certain kind of retelling projected in my mind and carried from age 4, when I first read the book?and I couldn't imagine a better way to transfer the children's classic to celluloid. You know a film has a left an indelible mark on cinema when you think it's good or great, and yet you can't quite categorize it. The movie is truly in a category unto its own. If I had to place it I would describe it as a fantasy movie that touches on certain aspects of the human condition. A sort of American-style magical realism on film. Or, to use a parlance of our times, it's The Never-Ending Story-meets- Hook. Everything about the picture is top-notch, with the visual presentation being the most outstanding aspect. I would be surprised it if it doesn't receive Oscar nominations for costume design, art direction, set design, and perhaps even for best writing ? adapted screenplay). From the moment Max first makes his way to the fantastic island home of the "wild things," we are transported into a crisp, autumnal, vivid, picaresque, and yet simultaneously subdued landscape. And the meshing of full-body costume pieces with nearly seamless-looking, CG mouth movements and facial expressions of the creatures is truly remarkable. As for the acting, first mention goes to the voice actors. It is commonly taken for granted that voice acting is easier than live acting. But to say anyone or any actor could play the characters in this movie is a stretch ? it's easier said than done, no pun intended. The voices delivered by Chris Cooper, Paul Dano, James Gandolfini, and the rest are so nuanced, they convey just the right emotion and correct amount in the tonality of dialogue. And I was impressed by the young Max Records. He was quite believable as Max (character has the same name coincidentally), and I think a lot of child actors would have wanted to over-act and show too much emotion or scream too loud. But I felt he showed just the right amount, and managed not to go over the top in physicality and line delivery. Catherine Keener, being the exceptional actress she is, was excellent in her limited time as Max's mother.The only negative thing I could claim for this film is that this is not your typical children's movie or average children's book adaptation. It's quite depressing and melancholy calamity) t times, and manic in general (many instances of play quickly turning into calamity). Yet concurrently this is what drives the main message home at the same time. Once you get used to the wild things' fantastic, larger than life frames, the monsters appear more human than creature, and quite childish in the way they behave and view the world ? perhaps even more so than Max. They are big and powerful, and yet they don't seem to appreciate or fully understand their own strength, and easily misuse and abuse it. They love to play, but they throw tantrums, and appear to believe the only way to solve their problems is to eat or hurt the thing they think is making them suffer. Carol is the worst example of them all ? he's the most powerful and the least mature, and is prone to tantrums and fits of rage as well as being the most gullible ? but in the way a child is na?ve and easily convinced. To be fair, some are more calm and mature than others. But they are all like children in the bodies of ten-foot tall beasts. Probing further, the monsters can be interpreted as representing human nature and the struggle that is the human experience. They embody some of our most primal fears and simplest desires: fears of loneliness, rejection, of the unknown, of sharing, and the desire to be accepted and loved, and ultimately, to be happy and without fear or worry. They also remind us of how we often resort to childish aggression or self-victimization, unleashing our pain upon others or placing the blame on them when we feel we've been wronged or we don't get what we want. And what's more, they remind us of those who possess more power than they know how to deal with responsibly, and consequently misuse it by destroying things or hurting others unjustifiably. It's not such a stretch of the imagination as to liken the wild things with their massive, but poorly controlled strength to world leaders using their militaries unethically or executives unfairly punishing their employees, or someone with a gun who kills an animal or a person out of rage alone. Of course some wouldn't read all of this into it, but I believe these are at least some of/related to the moral messages and motifs intended by director Spike Jonze. (I don't include author Maurice Sendak, because I read an article on IMDb.com recently in which he said something like 'though I approve of Jonze's interpretation, the story was originally inspired by my crazy and fear-mongering immigrant relatives I had to deal with when I was a child'?and that basically Jonze and others have extrapolated from the story much more than he intended originally.This is certainly not a movie for everyone and yet anyone can relate to it on some level/s. It's understandable that not everyone would like the style or even the genre, but anyone can learn from/relate to its themes. Definitely recommended viewing for any fans of the book, parents, children with their parents, or anyone in need of a reminder to have fun and hold fast to our inner child, but at the same time, to play nice, and to restrain oneself from taking anger out upon others and/or abuse one's powers, whatever they may be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lightly-worn, childhood-authentic existential fable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wouldn't know about the book, which I haven't read, but Spike Jonze's film of Where The Wild Things Are is a fairly simple story. Max, a boy temporarily isolated in childhood, immerses himself in his alternate dream-world to escape his troubles: the end of the world; his puberty- alienated sister; the threat of his mother's independence of him in the wake of an unexplained paternal absence. Having exhausted his imagination he returns to the reality of home.When Max first encounters the Wild Things the scene is post-apocalyptic, yet Max throws himself, unperturbed, into the melee. The child's-eye view of this abominable scene immediately neuters it - we must reset our ability to judge. Max's adventures continue Pinter-like, i.e. without rhyme or reason but creating space for emotional exchanges, until the claustrophobia of this behavioural parity drives him back to the real world.The brilliance of Spike Jonze (and Dave Eggers)'s film is in their refusal to nuance the extraordinary solipsism that constitutes the bulk of the film with moralising or even explanation. There are symbols and references that resonate for the older, or, dare I say it, more erudite viewer. The beach, for example, is a strong visual denominator, recalling the crushing existential-apocalypse denouement of The Planet Of The Apes. It's also indicative of the passing of time. Can you tell how long Max spends in the land of the Wild Things? It might be only an evening but then could Tom Hanks tell how long he spent on the atoll in Cast Away? Or does it matter to Steve McQueen the actual span he fights to release himself from island incarceration in Papillon? Indeed Max cannot tell how long his adventure is. The adventure lasts as long as he needs it to. Yet, as is so often the way here, Eggers and Jonze choose not to make the point or create the epiphany. The boy doesn't clock the experience as dream or flight of fancy. He doesn't get home to admit to 'learning something today'. This is simply another experience in the easily digested diet of phenomena that such a child consumes, and is rendered as such.Yet for the audience, the experience, at a remove, may be more significant. I can imagine that some may be put off by the American Indie vernacular creep that may have been fatal to Wes Anderson's Fantastic Mr Fox. However the combination of everyday exchanges and the almost total abstraction of the location and characters packs quite a punch. A strong, poetic film from Jonze in the tradition of Electroma rather than (for example) Being John Malkovich. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will evoke feelings rarely seen in a 'kids' movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spike Jonze isn't like other directors. Between making music videos for the likes of R.E.M., Beastie Boys and Chemical Brothers and producing TV show 'Jackass', he finds the time to fit in the occasional thought-provoking movie like Being John Malkovich and Adaptation. Wild Things, his third feature film, is no exception. His vision of Maurice Sendak's beloved children's picture book is dark, complex and decidedly mature. Layered with rich subtext and fierce emotion, Jonze and screen writing partner Dave Eggers infuse the proceedings with a scariness and unpredictability that will evoke feelings rarely seen in a 'kids' movie.Visually it is sensational; the landscapes are harsh yet stunning and the use of the rising and setting sun is inspired. Most impressive, however, is the Wild Things themselves: Carol, KW, Douglas, Ira, Judith and Alexander are sometimes frightening (take one of their first scenes where they circle Max with the threat of eating him for example), sometimes depressing, but always beautiful. Filmed with people in suits then tweaked with seamless CGI faces, this blend creates amazingly life-like characters which are hard to look away from. Their emphasised facial features are a doorway into their personalities and allow the viewer to connect with the creatures like never before.The monsters are given extra oomph by some terrific casting. It's hard to imagine anyone other than Gandolfini voicing Carol, he gives the aggressor of the pack such a broken emotional shield that when he is on screen you feel scared and sympathetic at the same time. Whitaker is humorous as the simple Ira, O'Hara provides Judith with a nice level of cynicism, Cooper's sombre tone allows Douglas an air of calmness, Dano offers a couple of laughs as the neglected Alex and Ambrose's KW is spot-on as the big sister figure. Elsewhere, in flesh, Keener is wonderful as always as Max's mother and the newcomer Records is solid as the confused young protagonist, if sometimes slightly irritating.I would be surprised if many children enjoy this as much as the brightly animated comedies they are used to seeing with Mum and Dad, but guess what, you will.4 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Essence of Childhood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spike Jonzes interpretation of "Where the Wild Things Are" is a heartfelt film that captures the essence of what childhood means and the way a kid, in this case the nine year old Max, feels and perceives the world. Jonze refrains from forcing a conventional story-structure upon Sendraks wonderful and magical trip and instead focuses solely on feelings.The desperation and loneliness of a child that just begins to try and understand the complicated world of the grownups are as perfectly captured and reenacted by the personalities of the wild things as are the feelings of joy, excitement and playfulness, the very feelings that nobody will never experience for a second time and are reserved for the kids when they discover the world they have been born into for the first time. Max Records gives a splendid performance as little boy Max and helps as much to make the gigantic wild things real than the superb computer techniques, if not more. Opinions about Jonzes film are going both ways in the forum and to some degree I can understand the often stated critique, that only people who want to like this movie are able to do so. It is probably true that to appreciate what Jonze did with Sendraks book one has to want to see the beauty in it, even in the sad and melancholic direction that "Where the Wild Things Are" often takes. Because just like the film, Sendraks book is not one of those happy and careless books for children that pleases simply with colors, monsters and a happy end, but rather a bittersweet take on a children's way to cope with the problems and tasks of the 'real world' that all too soon become what life revolves around. For those who have not yet forgotten what it was to be a kid, how it felt like to build forts in the snow, how it felt like to be yelled at, how it felt like to know exactly what one is supposed do and do exactly the opposite and for those who remember how to roar like a real wild thing, for them this film was made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The phrase 'a picture is worth a thousand words' has rarely felt so fitting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This adaptation of Maurice Sendak's children's book expands on the story of Max (Max Records), a naughty and imaginative boy who escapes the punishment of his mother (Catherine Keener) by journeying to a fantasy land. In this version Max's parents are separated and he does not get along with his sister. One night when his mother's boyfriend is over for dinner Max causes a huge ruckus and ends up biting his mother on the shoulder. He runs out into the darkness of the neighbourhood and transports himself by boat to an imaginary island. Surviving the rough seas, he eventually meets a number of giant furry creatures. They are initially very hostile towards him but he quickly convinces them that he is a king with magical powers and they are awed by his presence. The friendliest to Max is Carol (James Gandolfini) but Max soon learns that Carol and the other creatures have their own disrupted relationships.The opening frames to Spike Jonze's Where The Wild Things Are suggest a much darker and almost grittier tone than one might initially expect for this adaptation. The rapid tracking shots of Max screaming wildly as he chases his pet with a fork in his mouth is indicative of the harsh realism consistently displayed throughout a number of the house scenes early in the film. Even throughout his most fantastical films, like Adaptation and Being John Malkovich, Jonze has crafted a sense of humanity and this film is no different. While one can respect Jonze for the level of maturity that he brings to much of the new material though, this is still an adaptation of a children's picture book. The dark tone that he sets for these early scenes could be slightly overwhelming for much smaller children.The expansion of the original story has meant that many new details and insights to both Max and the monsters have been included. The film notes that Max's parents have been separated and briefly touches on his uneven relationship with his sister. The monsters themselves are all personalised as well, with their own habits and flaws, some of which echo Max's own traits. Carol regularly smashes things when he gets angry, while a goat-like creature named Alexander complains that he is regularly ignored by everyone. There are a number of unresolved relationships throughout the film, leaving the middle section rather loose, including an ambiguous conflict Carol has with two owls and his relationship with one of the other monsters. Despite many of these new elements and the expanded characterisation, the film amounts to largely the same message as Sendak's book: that there are more problems to be found in running away and a realisation of belonging. Though some will argue that the film upholds the essence of the story, Sendak's book said as much in the very simplest form. The drawings of his book are simple yet immediate enough to spark the imagination for young readers to immerse themselves, like Max, into the world, instead of having it entirely visualised for them. Perhaps this is what has allowed the book to endure over the years. The phrase 'a picture is worth a thousand words' has rarely felt so fitting.Regardless of its shortcoming, the film benefits from a stellar cast of actors and voice talent who bring these characters to life. Max Records is particularly natural as the young boy and the emotion he shows at the beginning of the film is utterly convincing. James Gandolfini ? a talented actor ? is also strong really embodying this massive furry creature ? who shifts thoroughly in emotions from sheer anger to warmth for this child. The monsters were made from costumes as opposed to pure CGI meaning that all the actors voicing the creatures had to wear these mammoth suits. It is a unique and rather nostalgic idea given so many of the visual effects bound films today and also because many of the costumes have been aptly modelled towards the drawings in Sendak's story. The film, which was mostly shot in Australia, is also particularly beautiful through the photography of the woodlands and the beaches.Where The Wild Things Are has a number of strong qualities, particularly in its aesthetics and its costume design, but one has to question precisely who this film was aimed at and what was to be achieved through its visualisation. Though it expands thoroughly upon the characters of the story and achieves a darker tone, it seems as though the overall message of the original story is being repeated, no matter how seriously Jonze would like the audience to invest in these creatures and their social problems. Many may have longed to have Sendak's world visualised for them, but perhaps the original intent of the picture book should have been felt in leaving this world to the imagination of its young readers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Imagination Is A Powerful Deceiver</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let us all thank Spike Jonze for bringing Maurice Sendak's children's book,'Where The Wild Things Are' to the screen. When I saw the trailer for this film &amp; saw Jonze's name as director,I did mental back flips (if you've seen his previous outing,'Being John Malkovitch',from 1999,or the many video projects for bands such as R.E.M.,etc., you'll know what I mean). Jonze directs from a screenplay co written by Dave Eggers (who also co wrote the tangy screenplay for 'Away We Go'),adapted from the book by Sendak. The story concerns Max, a young boy of about 8 or 9,with an over active imagination,and a possible touch of ADHD. When things get too challenging for Max,he strikes out &amp; damages things. After one of his many fits,his Mother (an always welcome Katherine Keener)sends him to bed without supper. Max runs out of the house &amp; ends up hiding out in a other worldly existence of his own imagination,inhabited by his "wild things" (voiced by the likes of James Gandolfini,Catherine O'Hara,Paul Dano,and even the great Forest Whitaker). The "wild things" were built by Jim Henson's Creature Shop (creators of the Muppets,Sesamie Street,not to mention several other feature films,such as 'The Dark Crystal',etc.). This is a film that some children will treasure,and others may be a bit put off by (some of the wild things can be a bit scary for very small children). Does Max make amends for the naughty things he did,or will he continue to act out? Check it out for the answer. Rated PG by the MPAA for thematic material &amp; a rude word or two.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Oddly moving and genuinely innovative."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spike Jonze really made the most of what he was given, seeing as the original story was only ten sentences long. Despite its short length, "Where the Wild Things Are" was universally acclaimed and praised for its psychoanalysis of childhood anger and beautiful art when it came out over 45 years ago. After watching the movie, I think it's safe to say that Jonze not only does justice to the book, but creates something much deeper and more mature out of the classic work. I can definitely see why more adults were in my theater than children - besides appealing to grownup nostalgia, the story has aged and evolved alongside its readers. Jonze and Eggers managed to flesh out the plot to include darker and broader themes; sometimes I was surprised that I was watching a children's movie. As for the art, the movie honors the monster's original designs and uses CGI to great effect, making the facial animation incredibly realistic. It's weird that I've related more with these creatures than some of the actors in other recent movies. And speaking of actors, Max Records is on his way to becoming a star. Oh, and Chris Cooper, James Gandolfini, and Forest Whitaker are in this. HOWEVER, this movie isn't for everyone. Watch it with an open (and preferably youthful) mind or don't watch it at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie, even if a bit odd</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had not read the book recently before seeing this, so I had no idea what to expect. I haven't read this book since I was in maybe second grade, so I did not remember the book at all. All I remembered was a kid and some monsters. Maybe the movie would be more clear if I had read the book? But regardless, you have a movie about a wild child who runs away from his mother and ends up in a land with various monsters. A lot of people seem to dislike this because there really isn't much of a plot to it. The movie really does a good job at adapting a 10 sentence story. There really isn't much of a point to it, besides a child's imagination getting the best of him.The movie is visually stunning, it took them years to make this movie, and it was definitely worth the wait! If you're going in looking for something that has a deep meaningful plot, maybe this movie isn't for you. The plot is rather shallow, considering it's a really short children's book, but it does a great job at stretching it out.For some children, this movie may not seem appropriate. There is some scary scenes in it involving the monsters, and a rather gruesome moment near the end. However, there is some symbolism to it. It shouldn't terrify children, and should be fine for children unless they are scared easily. If monsters and such scare them, then I don't suggest taking them to it, cos they do get kind of ferocious at points.All in all, if you're looking for a movie that'll get to all your emotions, this is a great movie to see! I actually cried, and you'll have to see the movie to see why! But this movie will have different meanings to everyone, younger children may not see what the adults see! And if you don't get it, you just didn't pay too close attention!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where the Wild Things Are is an astute observation of the psyche of children in the modern world and how they deal with emotions and situations like divorce, isolation, neglect, conflict, fear, boundaries, empowerment, sympathy and love. Spike Jonze and Maurice Sendak were obviously not afraid to take risks when they came up with this script. I will only say this once THE BOOK IS FOR KIDS, THE MOVIE IS FOR PARENTS! It has offered a parent like myself a new avenue of enjoyment, because after reading the story countless times to your child, it is hard to keep enjoying it and to sound enthusiastic when you're reading "The night Max wore his wolf suit and made mischief of one kind . . . and another." for the one billionth time.The visualizations that Spike Jonze has created are breathtaking. I applaud him for not solely relying on CG animation like most directors do and the cinematography is absolutely astounding at times. What I love the most about this film is how the Wild Things are portrayed. At times they felt like a conveyance of Max's emotions and at other times they seemed to represent family members. This film is a wonderful statement about the power of imagination and how every person in that child's life, as well as everything in his environment, has such a profound affect on them. It's also a reminder that we need to think carefully and always put our children's best interests at the center of almost everything we do as parents.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Touching in some very unexpected ways, a great experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The mixed reviews for this film are entirely understandable.; it's hard to know how to react to something without an easy point of comparison. For my part, I need to applaud the originality; it may not be enough to call it mind-blowing but, combined with a solid cast and extraordinary special effects, it makes for a highly enjoyable experience.The only arc with which Hollywood can sell a child-protagonist to adults seems to be the coming of age story. All the other problems, conflicts, and adventures that might concern children are strictly the province children's movies. Where the Wild Things Are does NOT fit that pattern. Max (Max Records) is nine. He talks like a nine year old, thinks like a nine year old, and acts like a nine year old. This is a movie about a nine year old boy's imagination, and if that isn't engaging enough for you then you're missing out.The film could be properly said to be inspired by Maurice Sendak's book rather than based on it. Max has a fight with his mother and flees into the darker parts his imagination, the specifics diverge from there. Naturally, the wild things need a bit more to say and do to fill 101 minutes, but the resulting narrative is more than just filler. These creatures are fully realized characters, both through stellar voice acting and the best melding of puppetry and CGI ever achieved on film. Together, they and Max act out his troubles and insecurities while he gets to know them, and himself, better.As I said, this is a film about a nine year old. The plot doesn't centre around slaying monsters of saving the wild things' home. The great quest is, appropriately, building a fort. This is why the film is for adults and not kids, it's about the characters and what they represent. All of the wild things serve as stand ins for both Max and the people around him, but his most significant connection is with Carol (James Gandolfini proving his sensitivity isn't limited to mob bosses), who shares his feelings of abandonment, and its accompanying rage and powerlessness. The comparisons are a little simplistic in much of the film, and the plot's scarcity shows through at those times, but there's a refusal to provide any easy answers that keeps things from becoming trite. This movie succeeds in being touching and, more importantly, doesn't rely on Hollywood's standard bag of tricks to get there.Who should see it: Anyone who believes that kids have something to teach us, people who love great special effects, fans of the bookWho shouldn't see it: Kids, people who think adherence to the source material is a measure of perfection, anyone of can't appreciate monsters being more than monsters</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie very much even though I am aware of its flaws - mainly an excessive schematism in the portrayal of the wild things themselves. With no choice but to move beyond the perfect primal simplicity of Sendak's book, the movie turns them into almost a catalogue of juvenile neuroses. The angry kid, the low-self-esteem kid, the mouthy kid, the loner - it's an elephantine Seven Dwarfs. Every incident is telegraphed as a Freudian symbol, so that the movie never becomes a wild thing in itself. But while the design may be linear, it's also deep - in addition to nailing the unsolvable messiness of childhood, the Max-as-king charade provides an unforced commentary on grown-up dilemmas from nationalism to xenophobia to love itself. So while the softening of Sendak's finale is a bit suspect, it's also emotionally devastating - the chicken's false stick-arm is a piercing symbol of the mistakes that can't be undone, and the angry thing's final helpless yowl can mean whatever you want it to mean. And I'm positive that the Henson folks' incredible character designs - you can feel them, you can smell them - compounds the impact.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely not for the young, but for the young-at-heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where the Wild Things Are is quite possibly the deepest adaptation of a mere children's book in the history of film-making. The 1963 picture book was expanded to become this massive production full of lush scenery, incredible special effects, heavy drama, and an overall nostalgic (yet dark) look at childhood. What makes this movie work is the incredible directing talent of Spike Jonze, one of the best directors of any entertainment medium in the last two decades. However, this movie is not for children in the least bit, its for those who remember how tough it was to be a child, especially when the chips are against you. Forget the PG rating, this movie has the indie flavor, the indie atmosphere, and the indie complexity that you would expect from circulating film festivals everywhere. When you mesh a big budget with Spike Jonze, expect beautiful magic, just not the kind your children should watch.The movie is about a very angry boy named Max (Max Records) that is haunted by loneliness and the disappearance o his father. He has a very active imagination and wants everyone else to be forever embedded in his imaginary world. After an angry encounter with his mother (Catherine Keener) he runs away from the house and enters a world full of lush scenery, massive monsters, and enough land to construct whatever his heart desires. He quickly gains approval from the monsters around him as they try to build a brand new community full of passageways, forts, and secret entrances. However, this new world is full of the same problems that he encountered in the real world, except it's more dangerous because of the massive monsters that carry a hint of unpredictability.Where The Wild Things Are contains very few actual actors and actresses, with much reliance on special effects and massive puppets; but the entire effort works perfectly. Max Records himself does a great job portraying an emotionally torn little boy with layers of emotions. Part of it has to do with Spike Jonze, but most of it is because of this little boy's incredibly mature acting skills. The voice acting throughout the second and third half is just as incredible, as they range from the ever-reliable Catherine O'Hara, to Chris Cooper, to James Galdolfini (Yes, from the Sopranos). There's actually a small amount of Best Supporting Actor buzz attributed to Galdolfini because of his ability to bring the main monster Carol to life.Spike Jonze is one of the best directors in the business, and easily is the main reason why the film works. Check out his prior experience: Being John Malkovich, Adaptation, and amazing music videos of "Sabotage," "Buddy Holly," "Undone," "Weapon of Choice," "Rockafella Skank," "Praise You," "Its Oh So Quiet," "California," and much more (I suggest you take a trip to YouTube if you have not seen any of these videos). Spike Jonze is the best music video director I've ever seen, and after this movie, is also one of the best film directors out there. He quite literally brings the story to life, and perfectly blends the special effects with the scenery and the young actor. There is virtually no distinction between what is happening and what is post-production, it just looks that good.There are sweeping shots of endless ocean, endless sand oceans and endless forests. Some of the visuals you'll see in this movie are virtually indescribable, especially when they start building a new home and fort. The movie looks fantastic, and is undoubtedly one of those films that absolutely needs IMAX and eventually Blu-Ray. The cinematography and directing is top-notch, and carries the movie whenever there's any sign of slowdown. Jim Henson's Creature Shop is one of the main reasons why this movie works, as their contribution in terms of animatronics, puppetering and the effects associated with it were spellbinding.What really drags this movie is the mere grim material, especially considering that it was a children's book that celebrated childhood while having the subtle moments of youthful angst. This movie is pretty much running on youth angst, as even the monsters show heavy signs of anger, torment, and violence. That's what makes this movie one of the darkest PG movies in a very long time, and one that distances itself from the average family fare. The movie becomes a celebration on how easy yet confusing it was to be a child in a grown-up world, and even when you can transport yourself to your dream surroundings, these feelings of loneliness, depression, anger, and confusion linger. It's an adult movie about a kid, and this kind of combination is quite dangerous if you want to make money, luckily Spike Jonze is one of the few always willing to bend the rules and put art ahead of success.Bottom Line: A fantastic-looking movie full of the themes and tribulations that was experienced in such few words in the original book by Maurice Sendeck, Spike Jonze blends excellent cinematography with flawless direction in order to bring the imaginative book to life. Pulling off great performances from the kids, adults, and puppets, Where the Wild Things Are is an indie movie at heart with the budget of a blockbuster. The five-plus year wait to bring the movie to audiences everywhere came with good reason, as no studio company wanted to budget and distribute a PG movie that isn't for the whole family. The dark material may hamper the lovely memories of the childhood imagination and fragility (and the movie itself), but overall it's an experience that should be seen at least once. Where the Wild Things Are is one of the best films of the year, and easily better than the average PG flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wild and deep adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***possible spoilers*** Adaptations are a tricky business, as you never want to carve out typical Hollywood fare from a beloved tale, especially one as ubiquitous as Where the Wild Things Are. Spike Jonze already did a movie about adaptations, so he should be well aware of the task was.What Jonze does with Maurice Sendak's story is simply amazing, as it manages to capture its themes and expand on them. The film is something of a coming of age story and deals with Max wrestling with complications in his life as opposed to just causing a little mischief. Jonze has taken a simple childhood lesson and turned the story to a portrait of dealing with the difficulties of growing up.The film has a simple exposition, which is probably a tad short. We learn quickly that Max's father is gone. We learn that he has questions about the world he's living in and how long it will last. Most importantly we learn he has an active imagination that is sometimes welcomed by his Mom. Jonze creates a good foundation for Max's reason to sail away to the world of the wild things.Once we enter this world, we realize that it's more than a world where Max lets his imagination run wild. It's much more than a wild rumpus. The characters are visually arresting while they each possess unique mannerisms that Mas starts to recognize. He latches on to one like a father, possibly because of a figure he's searching for. There's one that they don't listen to, much like Max feels in his own world. All these traits unfold throughout the movie.But it's Jonze's little details that make the movie something of a literary feat. Max is always trying to grasp the crown. Jonze clearly understands the power of imagination in children and how it is a world that the child can take control of when everything else in their world seems beyond their control. Yet Max learns there's limits to that as well. It's a very thoughtful take on the story."Where the Wild Things Are," as viewers have noted, is not a straightforward children's movie, as it delves into much deeper issues. It's great for children if their ready for the serious tone of the film and aren't going for a pure fantasy. It has it's fun moments too. The story is not as clear cut as typical films, but what can you expect from Jonze. There's a certain element of this film that shows things unfolding and happening while not having a typical plot structure. Max grows from simple interactions with the wild things and it's the interplay between the characters that's important.It's an incredibly brave and somewhat complex take on the original picture book. For Jonze, it's a very strong 'adaptation.'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I normally advocate thinking about a movie's themes. . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>and dissecting every element, and I was all set to do that with this movie. In fact, once it became clear that the monsters were likely representations of the Max's real family, I found myself looking at each one as Max (Carol), his sister (the one with the owl friends), his mom and his unseen dad and all that. But the longer the movie went on, the less clear the designations became. Part of this is the fact that, since so little of Max's family life is portrayed, the monsters become more fully developed than the "real" characters and began to eclipse them. Because of this I worry that repeat viewings may only highlight this unevenness rather than clarify the filmmaker's vision, and it would be a shame if some faulty structural elements ruined the experience of this movie, since it really delivers the emotional goods. I doubt there's been an American kid's film this melancholy since the Neverending Story.I think what really sold me on the movie was the science teacher's almost giddy depiction of the end of the solar system upon the death of the sun while the children listened on in silent horror, a fear that leaks into Max's monster fantasy. As a long time Woody Allen fan it reminded me of young Alvy Singer's dilemma in Annie Hall (he doesn't want to do his homework because he learned the universe is expanding and will someday break apart), although I'm not so certain that Max truly fears the end of the universe as much as the end of his family, which to a kid would seem like the same thing.Another interesting thing is the fallibility of the monsters Max has imagined. To allude to Woody Allen again, in Crimes and Misdemeanors, there is a (suicidal) philosopher who posits that no religion has ever created a completely benevolent image of god(s). If we create our gods--be they Zeus, Superman, or Carol--with our imagination, then what does it say about us that human folly so often is included in our myths about them? Perhaps, as the movie seems to point out, loving each other isn't always easy, but we do it anyway. And maybe that's a better image of benevolence than even our wildest dreams can conjure up.The bad: Did a movie about monsters really need to try to fake reality through shaky cam? It was fine in the opening shots, but not in the fantasy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sweet, endearing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spike Jonze&#x2019;s endearing Where the Wild Things Are is as genuine and sweet as you remember the book being. Imaginative in design and efficient in execution, the film takes what was a sparsely written book and delivers a detailed, creative, and delightful story that&#x2019;s suitable for both kids and adults.A young boy named Max (Max Record) is full of anger; he feels misunderstood and unloved, even though it&#x2019;s not apparent to the rest of us that he&#x2019;s being neglected or abused. Max just hates because he hates, and when he&#x2019;s confused or insecure, he rages against everything. After bitterly acting out against his mom (Catherine Keener), Max runs away from home (in a slight departure from the book), finds a boat, and sails a wide, endless sea to an isolated island full of strange, odd-looking creatures.The Wild Things are essentially exact replicas of those found in Maurice Sendak&#x2019;s 1963 book. Actors inhabited large costumes, and the facial movements were added with CGI; the result is that each Wild Thing is individualized, with a strong personality.On the island, Max finds the Wild Things in the middle of destroying their own huts. Well, specifically, one Wild Thing, Carol (James Gandolfini), is wrecking the huts, throwing everyone else into a bit of a tizzy. Max, clad in a wolf costume, restores order by telling the creatures that he is a king from a far-away land; the Wild Things respond by making Max their own king.The turmoil affecting the monster tribe is complicated, and Max&#x2019;s arrival merely forestalls additional confrontations. Carol believes that Max is a true king, but even that belief doesn&#x2019;t alleviate the tension in the group. There are six Wild Things: Carol, Judith (Catherine O&#x2019;Hara), Ira (Forest Whitaker), Douglas (Chris Cooper), Alexander (Paul Dano), and KW (Lauren Ambrose), each with his or her own personality.It&#x2019;s not clear whether the island and its denizens are meant to be real or merely figments of Max&#x2019;s effervescent imagination, but it&#x2019;s plain that the Wild Things represent many facets of Max&#x2019;s personality and others in his life. Carol is a leader and wants to be beloved, but he misses his true love &#x2013; KW &#x2013; with whom he&#x2019;s had a spat and who has temporarily left the group. Carol is analogous to Max himself, and KW is Max&#x2019;s mom. Alexander is usually ignored by the others in the group, just as Max believes he is treated by his peers. Ira and Judith, who love each other, are twin sides of the same coin: Max&#x2019;s mother. Ira is kind and loving, even deferential to Judith, who is openly antagonistic and negative and not a little bossy. This is how Max views his mom, one reasons; she is a woman who both loves him and controls him, a woman who is equal parts yin and yang. This is not, however, how we the audience see her, because instead we see a woman frustrated on multiple levels.Pop psychology aside, though, the set pieces are tremendous. From the sweeping vistas of the paradisal island, including a vast desert, a thick forest, and golden beaches, to the one big project that Max and the Wild Things complete &#x2013; a huge living quarters with miles of tunnels leading all over the island. Jonze really went the extra mile to replicate the beautiful illustrations in Sendak&#x2019;s masterful book.Where the Wild Things Are is dark and deep, but it also makes your heart ache and soar. Jonze has managed to capture the essence of a beloved book &#x2013; no easy feat &#x2013; while producing a wholly entertaining film. Some scenes may be a little intense for very young viewers, but the rousing majesty of such unbridled imagination &#x2013; both Max&#x2019;s and Spike&#x2019;s &#x2013; lead to a satisfying conclusion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a masterpiece that I didn't like much. It really isn't for children and perhaps my greatest criticism is that this movie didn't know which audience it was trying to reach. I would say leave your kids at home ..... some kids won't have clue and they will be mildly bored. The ones that do may be traumatized by the themes.I have never seen childhood captured so raw, ugly and beautiful. For that it is a work of art. The cinematography is also magnificent.Another aspect I didn't like was the ending. Besides "love your mother", the lessons max learned are hard ones and even Buddhist monks have a hard time smiling right after truly understanding them. The happy ending was expected and financially necessary, but it would have been nice if Max gave more signs of the mental changes this movie depicted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, you should know that I'm 28 years old and I read the book way back when I was a kid.The review What a great movie! First things first. I thought the adaptation was spot on. The story was relatively unchanged, with the exception that Max runs away from the house rather than going up to his bedroom after the confrontation with his mom. I did like the change though. He was running "wild"-the theme of the movie. To my great surprise, the wild things looked pretty much EXACTLY as they do in Sendak's illustrations. Spike Jonze really brought the book to life and by gd he deserves some mega credit for that.The original storybook was some 10 sentences long. How could they possibly make this into a feature length film? When the movie started, I was so nervous because I wasn't sure if this was going to be corny or not. The opening scene with Max and the mother was done very well. I again didn't feel quite right when we were about to see Spike Jonze's wild things. There were kids behind me and I'm thinking "I hope they don't scream in my ear".Then the wild things turned out to be genuinely nice "people" and, to be honest, they were kinda funny. I think the light-hearted humor and the fragility of the "wild things" really de-horrorize the kids in the audience. The ones behind me seemed to be giggling every single time a rogue ball of dirt smacked one of the monsters in the head or when one of them jumps in the air and smacks his head on a tree limb. So I do say that THIS IS INDEED SUITABLE FOR KIDS.What do I rate it this movie? 8.5</fullReview>

This PG movie is more about childhood struggle than an entertaining movie for young children. It follows the adventures of Max, who is struggling with his parents' divorce. After he clashes with his mother and runs off, Max is transported by his imagination to a vast forest and sea.The voice acting, puppetry, and computer animation is masterful that transports the audience to Max's imagination. The audience is empathetically faced with the strange creatures that represent Max's own conflicting emotions. After Max is crowned King of the Wild Things and learns that ruling his kingdom of personified emotions is not easy, he returns to the love of his mother. The audience experiences his conflicts and the healing of a parent's connection. By Dr. Diane Howard, www.dianehoward.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well made film, but very depressing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where The Wild Things Are is about a kid named Max who has a very active imagination. After he has a confrontation with his mother, he runs away from home. He finds a sail boat and travels to an island that is populated by very large, but friendly creatures. They make Max his king and the rest of the plot sets off from there.Where The Wild Things Are was a actually based on a classic 1963 children's book by Maurice Sendak. It's a picture book that can easily be read in a 2 minutes. It's literally only nine sentences long , but the movie is 94 minutes, which is about 10 minutes per sentence. It was adapted by Spike Jonze and Dave Eggers. This was probably really difficult to expand the plot of the book because everything in the about the book was so simple. The wild things have actually names in the movie, which the book had no time for. They spend a good deal of the film building a fort, which isn't in the book at all. All these added plot lines tend to somewhat change the story, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The book would be perfectly acceptable to let a child read, however the film was much darker than I expected. It's just a very depressing movie, overall. There's just so much in this movie that children might not understand and might even frighten them. It really isn't a family film. It would probably be best enjoyed by adults who loved the book. Spike Jonze is also the director. He's previously done Being John Malkovich and Adaptation. Both of them are amazing film. I will say this movie is a very well made film.The performance in the film are of course very good, as well. Max is played by Max Records. I thought that it was cool that they actually got a Max to play Max. Anyway, he was great in the film. You really had to love his character because he's the only person on screen for more than an hour. He did very well delivering the jokes that he was given and in the more dramatic scenes. He may have been a little too crazy in the beginning of the film, but that's just a minor nit pick. The actors that were doing the voices for the creatures weren't just doing voice work like you might see in some animated movies. They were actually acting together on a stage. Because of this they were to show just as much emotion and personality in their characters as the human characters. Everyone else was great in the movie, except for Mark Ruffalo as the boyfriend of Max's mother. I actually think that Mark Ruffalo is a great actor but he was just underused in this. He literally only says one word in the entire movie. That's not really a complaint, I just found that funny.My favourite thing about the film are the visuals. The films looks great, especially with the wild things. I couldn't tell if they were puppets or CGI or motion capture. They were actually made by Jim Henson's workshop with CGI facial expressions. I thought it looked very realistic for CGI, especially in one crying scene. There were also several scenes in the desert which looked amazing. I thought that was green screened but they were actually filming that in Australia.One thing I didn't like at all was the soundtrack. It seemed to be mostly children's music, but since I don't feel it was a film for children, I didn't really think it fit with the visuals.So that's it, Where The Wild Things Are is a very good movie, but it is also very depressing. I recommend the book to be read before or after the film. I'm going to give Where The Wild Things Are an 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems like Where the Wild Things Are either moved you to tears or made you extremely frustrated. The whole movie seemed kind of a jumble, a sort of unfocused picture that meditates an adults view of losing one's innocence and realizing that no matter how much you try, bad things are always going to happen. But there was an underlying plot and a reason for how the movie is wild and unpredictable. It's sometimes how life as a kid is. The soundtrack is also extremely moody and beautiful. The movie itself is beautiful and there were sequences where I said wow because of the stunning scenery and the facial expressions of the Wild Things are astounding. For the most part, it's a really, really sad movie, but is also a celebration of everything about childhood. Don't come in with expectations of what this movie is going to be. Just go with an open heart and you might really pick up the meaning of it all. I know I did</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Wild Things Are Wildly Amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Children's films, in the matter of live action, have taken a backseat in the past years to CGI Animation as the only means of enchanting children and entertaining them. As animation becomes more prominent, attempts at encasing the human emotions such as love, anger, regret, etc. have been poorly illustrated in films like Land of the Lost, Race to Witch Mountain, and Marley &amp; Me. Spike Jonze, the prestigious director of Being John Malkovich and Adaptation has created one of his most innovative and personal portraits to date. What Jonze achieves here with Where the Wild Things Are is beyond anything seen yet by this director. Though the film requires much of the viewer especially for younglings that will see it, audiences can find appreciation and heartwarming nourishment in each of the characters.Based on the short children's book of the same name, the film tells the story of Max (played ferociously by Max Records) a 12-year old boy that yearns for love and attention from his workaholic mother and emotionally vacant sister. When a dinner goes 'out of control' one night, Max runs away from his problems and enters his boldest imaginative adventure yet. His encounter with the 'Wild Things' give young Max a mature and new insight on life and how to decipher each occurrence along the way.The deepest aspects of the film lay with the powerful screenplay by Jonze and Dave Eggers. Their authentic approach to each character inhabits a genuine spirit which enables us to tenderize our feelings for them. Likewise, the narrative goes above and beyond its call of duty and gives us every necessary aspect to pull us through this tale.The technical aspects of the film are some of the best of the year and more to say this millennium. Cinematographer Lance Acord is in top form this time as his inspirational shots of mother and son telling each other stories or an unadulterated walk through the dessert prove to be more magical then ever expected. Carter Burwell along with Karen O. provides the most illustrious musical score of the year so far. Production design by K.K. Barrett is enthused and effusive withholding the subtle restrain of an impossibility of a extraordinary tale.The revelation is the discovery of Max Records who exceeds any type of expectation. Max Records delivers the best child performance since Freddie Highmore was discovered for Finding Neverland. He inhabits a beautiful innocence and an undomesticated talent that can carry him into one of our finest working young actors. His scenes with 'Carol,' voiced tenderly by James Gandolfini, are some of the best scenes of the year. Catherine Keener who's resume includes an Oscar nominated performance in Jonze's Being John Malkovich is brief but effectively brilliant in her minimal time. It's the kind of work that can define a film for many people. Records and Keener's performances are all Oscar worthy.Concisely, Where the Wild Things Are is the most inventive film of the year thus far. It should be along side any nominee this season for Best Picture, in the end however, I have my doubts. It's a 50/50 shot for it but completely worthy. Hold on to every childhood memory you find dear and experience this illuminating film about love, anger, regret, and all the entities that go with it.****/****</fullReview>

This movie was not meant for children.My friends and I thought it was AMAZING, even though the plot was changed and not exact to the book I grew up with i thought it was very well done.

		<shortDescription>Spike Jonze's latest reminds audiences of the wild thing in all of us</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like many other people, I was eagerly anticipating the movie version of Where the Wild Things Are and I'm glad to say that the wait was definitely worth it. Every once in a while, a kids/family movie comes along that really tugs at your imagination and heart. This decade, we've been lucky enough to be blessed with two such movies, one being 2007's much overlooked Bridge to Terabithia; Spike Jonze's latest creation is the other. In an era where the majority of children's movies are little more than light, mildly amusing fluff, Where the Wild Things Are brings depth and perception rarely seen in any movies these days, let alone in a movie supposedly intended for kids.Of course, it is suitably entertaining with a variety of actions scenes, including the famed "wild rumpus" featured in the source material by Maurice Sendack and an energetic "dirt-clod" war. However, what makes this movie so memorable is the attention to genuine human emotions and its insight into the true thoughts and feelings of children. This is most evident in the spectacular scenery and the masterful cinematography, which truly transport the viewer into the imaginary world created by the 8 year old Max, our protagonist. A few die-hard fans of the book have complained about changes Spike Jonze and Dave Eggers, the screenwriter, have made to the childhood classic. These complaints are, at least in my opinion, baseless. This film does a fantastic job of expanding on the 10-sentence book and bringing Sendack's world to life. Using mostly subtle browns and grays, Jonze instills a magical quality to the land of the wild things and the wild things themselves look faithful to the highly detailed and artistic illustrations in Sendack's book. Best of all, it never strays from the themes and spirit of the original book.The cast is, as a whole, quite impressive despite the fact that the majority of the actors are only voices. There are a number of names the average moviegoer might recognize, such as Catherine Keener as Max's worried but loving mother, James Gandolfini as the voice for Carol, the most prominent of the wild things and Chris Cooper as the voice of Douglas, another wild thing. Other voices are provided by Lauren Ambrose, as KW, who bears perhaps not-so-coincidental similarities to Keener, both in voice and personality; Catherine O'Hara as the grumpy Judith; and Forest Whitaker as Ira. Mark Ruffalo shows up in a barely noticeable, rather thankless role as the nameless boyfriend of Max's divorced mother.However, the real star of the movie is, at least in terms of the actors, Max Records. As the main character, he displays great range, but he is always convincing as an ordinary yet angst-ridden kid. The role requires Records to convey a huge variety of emotions, and perhaps the most challenging obstacle for him was to gain the audience's sympathy regardless of his character's rebellious, occasionally destructive nature; at the same time, he must convince all the viewers that he, as Max, is, in some ways, the child within all of us.Last of all, I want to mention the simple yet heartwarming score. Never intrusive, the background music composed by Carter Burwell and Karen Orzolek weaves into the story flawlessly, often bringing out the atmosphere and emotions of a particular scene.Raw, intense and, ultimately, uplifting, Spike Jonze's Where the Wild Things Are is a triumphant celebration of human emotions and the power of imagination. Bravo!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't be fooled by the beautiful animatronics or the dreamy cover photos. 'Where the Wild Things Are' takes Maurice Sendak's book, which many of us remember nostalgically as being a story about imagination, misunderstood youth, escapism and the fleeting yet powerful nature of childhood emotions, and turns it into... a trite tale about emo furries on a bad weed trip.It's not entirely without merit - if you're deaf, or not a native English speaker, I recommend you leave it without subtitles and enjoy some pretty fantasy scenes. If you do watch it with sound, be prepared to endure a painful two hours of meaningless blather as director Spike Jonze attempts to fill every potential dramatic pause with memes from fickle American pop culture. This has the effect of turning a timeless classic into something that is already looking as dated, artificial and cringe-worthy as Peter Andre's abs.I read somewhere that there were concerns about the film's suitability for children. "Whoa!" I thought. "Perhaps this is going to be challenging! Gritty! Dark! Sinister! Perhaps it will have echos of Roald Dahl or Tomi Ungerer, or hell, even 'Labyrinth'" (as a six-year-old, I remember being enthralled/terrified by Bowie in tights). Yeah... not so much. The reason, I discovered, that this film comes with a warning is that it's phenomenally boring, and as every parent knows, boredom is a serious condition among kids. It left three adults and two children, 6 &amp; 9, utterly unimpressed.If you've always wondered what Mr. Snuffleupagus would look like crossed with suicidal Neil from 'The Young Ones', here's your chance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hated this film so much I just had to review it. I am amazed that so many critics have apparently failed to consider the film at face value. Consider the following plot break down: A boy runs away from home and travels by boat to a place that looks a lot like Australia. There he meets a handful of neurotic American monsters. They play some rough and unfriendly games with each other. They listen to a lot of modern folk music, most of which seems like happy music. However nobody has very much fun. In fact most of the time they are all miserable. The boy leaves.Is this a fable about the inability of people to get along in a remote place? Is it about how much Australia really sucks? Or that freaks and monsters will never be friendly to you? Other parts feel like an endless video clip. The boy doesn't seem to really learn anything. He was an unpleasant character and I kept hoping the monsters really would eat him, in the most gratuitous way possible. Overall the film was a wallowing, negative experience, mitigated only by the fantastic costumes and the beautiful sets and scenery. Add to this I don't really like the whole modern American folk music revival thing and the music played almost constantly the whole way through.avoid!</fullReview>

I'll be holding onto this film forever, it allows enormous discussion about human nature, even though I said it's about kids When I say that it's really about human nature, we're all kids.

It was honestly an amazing, moving &amp; powerful film. I have never cried at a film since "My sisters keeper" a while ago, I thought this would be the last film that would make me cry. I can honestly not say how much I adored this film, I could really relate to it as well from when I was younger, at the beginning I felt like I was Max, and felt more like him throughout the whole film. If you are considering seeing this movie GO AND SEE IT! You are guaranteed not to be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For an hour and a half, Spike Jonze made me feel like a kid again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Script-wise, this really is somewhat of an anomaly. Its actual plot, as I explained, is fairly simple, and it spends most of its time in Max's head, or more specifically, in the magical world he's created ? it might be one of the longest narratives that take place in the dreamscape of the human subconscious. The film starts off with a bang, portraying just what it feels like to be a kid, ignored by his mom and sister, no one to play with, and left to go on adventures in his imagination by himself. I love the fact that Max is a genuine, full-fledged child, quite unlike the wise-for-their-age depictions of children that we often see in movies: he cries, he screams, he has tantrums, he thinks that the world revolves around him, his imagination runs wild and he doesn't think of the consequences of his actions. All of these elements and emotions are crucial for understanding of what we see Max experiencing with the Wild Things. I was really impressed that the film didn't take a simplistic approach to the monsters ? Jonze and Eggers could have gone the direct route, had every monster represent an aspect of Max's life, be it his absent father, his busy mother, his sister or the friends he doesn't have ? but they are too smart to do that, and instead, the Wild Things as a collective serve as an extension of Max's inner emotions. They also cry, scream, have tantrums over trivial things, think the world revolves around them, and of course, they too run wild ? literally! It's just such a majestic and beautiful allegory as, through the monsters and their own conflicts and feelings, Max starts to realize that actions do have consequences and that he made a mistake.Aside from its incredibly rich emotional palette, the film is also a technical marvel. The cinematography is loose, lively and, well ? wild; Jonze goes the indie route despite his major studio budget and shoots low-key with lots of frantic, hand-held shots, coarse jump cuts and just a very loose visual style altogether with the camera jumping around, tracking different characters and, like Max, having a difficult time to capture the full picture thanks to the chaos going on. The production design is also spectacular and really imaginative; almost all of the imagery in Max's imaginary world is inspired directly by subtle visual cues from his real life: the straw ball on his bedside table becomes a massive fortress, the model in his room made of egg cartons becomes Carol's model of his dream city, and the list goes on. The entire package is topped off by a simply magical soundtrack with original songs by Karen O from the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and frequent Coen Brothers collaborator Carter Burwell that totally captured what the film was about, the childlike nostalgia. Another really impressive technical achievement is the creation of the Wild Things. I have no doubt that most directors these days would go the full CGI route; Jonze, the classicist that he is, insisted on using physical, tangible models ? suits created by the Jim Henson company. Originally the faces were meant to be animatronic but the heads proved to be too heavy, so Jonze and crew opted to create the faces in CGI ? and it couldn't have paid off more. I am a huge supporter of traditional puppets and animatronics, but the Wild Things need to convey so much emotion, and animatronic faces would have just felt lifeless.With this film, Spike Jonze has achieved something truly incredible: for an hour and a half, he made me feel like a child again. And I don't mean superficially ? he didn't just make me sympathize with Max and feel for him; Jonze genuinely made me remember what it was like for me to feel what Max is going through. Obviously, my circumstances are different than his, most people's are ? my parents aren't divorced, I don't have older siblings, and so in regards to that, perhaps I've never really felt Max's pain. But I still saw a lot of myself in him. I used to pretend that the carpet was lava, too. I used to play with LEGOs and build models and forts and feel that my parents were too busy to give me the proper attention that, at age 10, I felt I deserved, especially with two younger brothers hogging it from me. I, too, imagined fantastical creatures and lands and wrote stories about them. The film portrays enough very general and universal feelings and emotions a child often emulates that I think anyone can potentially have the same nostalgic reaction. In all, Jonze's film is a totally unique emotional experience unlike anything I've ever experienced in another film; I was transported to a time that everyone always looks back on in nostalgic longing, and, perhaps for the first time, I realized just what it was that I felt back then, and how it influences me now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where the Wild Things Could Have Been</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite its near-universal familiarity and prevalence in my grade-school classrooms, I have never actually read Maurice Sendak's "Where the Wild Things Are." After having seen this clearly high-budget film adaptation, my curiosity has been piqued exponentially. Director Spike Jonze (who also co-scripted with Dave Eggers), like heir apparent Michel Gondry, has a track record of music videos and feature films of eccentric distinction (sometimes to the point of pretentious distraction), which makes him an interesting match for the material. And while "Wild" has its share of stunning visuals and exhilarating displays of imagination at play (one of the film's key themes), its somber tone and earthy color schemes come off as alienating, and even oppressive at times. Furthermore, in adapting a short children's story to feature length, Jonze and Eggers found the screenplay on the basis of imagination's power to liberate, excite, and destroy--an admirably abstract and challenging concept that ultimately turns problematic in giving the plot any sort of trajectory; given its length, "Wild" is a meandering picture, and jerkily transitions from beginning to middle to end. While there are passages of beauty on display, and some well-rounded (and very human) "Things" to relate to, its youthful energy can only carry it so far. "Where the Wild Things Are" is a good film with reservoirs of greatness that go untapped.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anybody who wants to see this remembers reading this or having it read to them when they were younger. I know that I had Where the Wild Things Are read to me so many times that I can still remember most of the lines by heart. I am pleased to say that Spike Jonze and Dave Eggers have done an excellent job of adapting the movie for screen with elaborate set pieces, well constructed characters, and good acting. It's not easy to make a feature length movie out of 300+ word book, yet these two have succeeded.Unless you've been living under a rock, you probably already know what Where the Wild Things Are is about it. Still, it's a bit different from the book. It's about Max, played by great newcomer Max Records, an outrageous kid who has a wild imagination. After insulting his mother (Catherine Keener) in front of her new boyfriend, Max runs away to an imaginary world in which he is the king of the Wild Things. These Wild Things are brought to screen perfectly. Only their facial expressions are computer animated. The Wild Things are voiced by actors such as Paul Dano, Forest Whitaker, and James Gandolfini (minus a New Jersey accent).First and foremost, it's important to talk about how great a director Spike Jonze is. After reading many articles, I realize how fatherly Jonze is to his cast members, making sure that they are comfortable and being helped with whatever they need. His beautiful work is evident in Max Records who is forced to cry in one scene. I don't know how many child actors can actually cry on camera and it surely can't be easy to make a kid do it, yet Jonze has completed the task without a problem. The beauty of the film also lies in his great ability to direct with elaborate and almost artistic set pieces filmed in Australia. The characters prance around in what feels to be so fantastic that it almost makes you feel emotional.There's also a ton of small things that are great about the film such as its soundtrack by Karen O and the Kids and Eggers' writing, but there is one bad thing: it runs a bit long. While it's fun for about an hour and fifteen minutes, it becomes hard to hold an audience's attention for a story that seems to go nowhere. I will admit that there is very little to the plot after Max enters the fantasy world, but Spike Jonze dodges this by creating shots that are beautiful while Eggers includes witty writing.By the end of the movie, the audience was in tears and was howling at the screen along with the Wild Things. I would be the first to admit that I joined along. All my memories from my childhood rushed back to me in a moment where I just let loose and began to cry. Spike Jonze has created a film so moving that it's just impossible not to get emotional. It may not be one of my favorites of 2009, but it would be easy to return to it on DVD and I would definitely see it again. Let the wild rumpus begin!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've got to say I completely underestimated this movie. I went into the theater thinking it would just be another movie you just see once then never really talk about it again. Boy was I wrong. This has got to be one of the best movies I've seen all year. Just the look of the movie I thought was great. I thought it was amazing how they portrayed the characters and environments from the book and turned a 48 page book in a spectacular movie. The character that played max did a terrific job, I don't think it could've been played any better. From beginning to end it was a great movie experience. I will definitely be going to see this again and I really look forward for this movie to come out on DVD. If you haven't seen where the wild things are yet you need to get out and see it before you miss out on one of the best movies this year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A poetic, adult journey to our innermost complex childhood mind.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some reviews claim this is a boring movie. I claim they are either boring people, or simply expected that Max would be taking a trip to Disney's Narnia. Sorry to those folks, but this is a vision of artistic brilliance - a poetic, adult journey to our innermost complex childhood mind.This beautiful film is (in my opinion) told from the perspective of a young boy with some sort of psychiatric/behavioral disorder (could be any number of things such as A.D.D./Bi-polar/Oppositional Defiant Disorder/Explosive Child Syndrome), and looks at how difficult it can be to deal with the growing pains and change that a 'normal' child has to deal with (such as the pressures and anxieties a child is faced with as they learn about some of the harsher realities of the 'grown up' world), and how a child with his types of challenges copes with these changes and realizations. It then delves deep inside his subconscious mind as he interacts with the 'Wild Things' as the many parts of his various compartmentalized emotions/personality traits.While the fantasy aspect of the film may appeal to younger kids, and the 'misunderstood kid' aspect of the film may appeal to angsty teens, this film will be most meaningful and completely understood by adults. The reason is that while kids, teens and young adults may be mired in the complexities that are 'growing up', it is only in looking back from having completely lived thru childhood and having the perspective that time and distance offers, that one can truly capture the depth of meaning in this film.This is best represented in the film by a single shot, wherein young Max is laying down under his mother's desk as she works, and we see this from Max's perspective on the floor, looking up at his mother thru the angular features of the bottom of her desk. The sequence continues with Max gently pulling at the frayed toes of his mothers' stockings. There is something so genuine and loving about this sequence. Something that instantly creates a longing for our own similar childhood moments.The brilliant script is made up of what feels like many short and poignant vignettes, with deliberately paced, pithy dialogue. There is not an extraneous word or a wasted moment in the entire film. Director Spike Jonze visually recreates in exact detail and perfect rendering, the creature illustrations by Maurice Sendak. This, along with extraordinary choices from the creature voice actors, give the creatures their strikingly human characteristics, which in turn, allow us to believe in the wild things as much as Max does.The creatures are absolutely remarkable. Spike Jonze is one of the few (along with Hellboy's Guillermo del Toro and Lord of the Rings' Peter Jackson) out there who understand how digital effects should be used. At this point in time, despite the amazing things that can be done with digital effects today, 100% digitally created characters are just not believable. We know that they don't exist beyond their pixel count, therefore we just can't care about them the way we do about real people or creatures that actually physically exist. We can create emotional bonds with real things, such as E.T., Kermit, the original Yoda, Big Bird, Chewbacca, etc... and Spike Jonze calling in Jim Hensons' Creature Shop was the only way this could have been pulled off. The audience HAS to believe and care about these creatures as much as Max does. And the use of digital effects for the creatures' faces was flawless. Again, it simply HAD to be. The final shot of the creatures' in the film is incredibly emotional, and I bought it hook, line and sinker because I cared about the creatures -- because I believed they were living, breathing things as much as Max believed it.Take this journey as soon as possible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really don't have a clue what the message of this film was or what it was supposed to be, but what I got from it was The message to adults - if you decide to forget your child for a few hours a night to spend some time with someone else because you deserve it and if you decide to discipline the child when they throw a tantrum, then said child will run away from home.The message to the children - if your parents don't give you any attention, throw a tantrum and run away to fantasy world in some forest then return home as your parents will be happy you came back and never look away from you again.Load of crap! The three I've given it is for the solid performance of the child, he definitely has a future.

		<fullReview>I never really use this word to describe a film. But if I were to pick one word to describe Spike Jonze's magical adaptation of Where the wild things are, that word would be wonderful. It is. I haven't seen such a film is such a long time. Everything about this movie is fantastic. The performances,even the voice works,are fantastic. Newcomer Max Records gives the best children's performance I have seen in years. He is so good as Max, the main character.Spike Jonze, as we should all know, is a fantastic director. He did such a beautiful job with this movie. He turned this nine-lined story and turned it into a deep, sad, and wonderful film that has great visuals and a ton of other things. I really wanted to see this because the book is a classic and because Spike Jonze directed Being John Malkovich, which is one of my favorite movies. This movie gets really dramatic and powerful in the last twenty minutes. I can't wait to see it again.We should all know the story plot. Except not anymore. The film revolves around a young boy named Max(Max Records). He doesn't exactly have a good life. He never has anyone to play with. His mom(Cathrine Keener) ignores him because of her new boyfriend(Mark Ruffalo). So one night, he has enough and runs away. So Max sails off to God knows where and ends up meeting these depressed creatures. Called Wild things. Including Carol(James Gandolfini),a goat, the smallest creature, named Alexander(Paul Dano), KW, Carol's love interest of some sort(Played by Lauren Ambrose), a smart alec named Judith(Cathrine O'hara), and many more. HE BS's his way to becoming king, and many other things happens. This could perhaps be the best film of the year. It is so heartfelt and touching and beautiful. I haven't seen people do such good job as a voice since Eddie Murphey in Shrek. Where the wild things are is a fantastic film. It shows a real side to children. You know,tamptrums and all of that stuff. Where the wild things are, in short, is wonderful.Where the wild things are:****/****</fullReview>

Where is the light hearted, imaginative, wonderful book that this movie is (not based on) named after? Just because you can write a metaphorical script for anything, doesn't mean that you should.I found the movie disturbing, dreary and dismal. There is no color, no happiness to speak of and the entire time you're watching, you're wondering if max is going to die. Not a faithful representation of the book.

		<fullReview>I must say, I was really shocked at how bad I thought this movie was. I might have rated it as low as a two or three had it not been for the amazing costumes and set designs.First off, is Max supposed to be some sort of hero? Or even likable for that matter? He's a spoiled, rotten, jerk of a kid. Sure I felt bad he got his fort destroyed, but look how he reacted later. What did his mom ever do to him? And then in the fantasy world he's a jerk to the monsters and throws stuff at their heads. Nice.Beyond the unlikable main character, the story is very lame and goes nowhere. I understand that there was not really much of one outlined in the book and they wanted to stay true to it, but whose to say you have to do absolutely nothing? Couldn't the character have done something? I mean, even gone on a short journey or something simple like that. Instead they all just treated each other like jerks.In the end the mom just consoles Max and everything is hunky-dory. She should have sent him to his room to think about how dangerous it is to run away from home. I would not recommend anyone to see this despite the great visual achievements.</fullReview>

It is morbidly depressing without a redeeming quality. The plot on the island is almost non-existent. Evidently you CAN'T take a 10-sentence children's book and make it a full length film.

		<fullReview>Where the Wild Things Are is another perfect example of a great idea being stretched too thin. What you've got here is a 90-minute movie based on a 48-page children's book that had 10 lines of actual text in it to begin with. The film gets pretty thin and redundant in the middle. After a while, monsters banging into trees, knocking stuff over, and jumping on each other get a bit old. We get it already. The kid wants to have fun, but then when he gets bored misses his family. Alright, so that's a quick summing up of how I feel about the film adaptation.Alright, so is the movie bad? No. It's done pretty well. The visuals are great. You really don't think about people being in suits playing the monsters. You actually completely buy into them. I was even told after viewing the film that they used CGI on some of their eye and head movements, which totally blew me away. You honestly couldn't tell. The landscapes and sets look great, as well. There are absolutely no problems with the special effects or visuals.Max Records, playing the little kid Max, does a great job. His childlike anger and story-telling to the monsters is completely convincing. His energy and charisma comes across as genuine. He's definitely impressive in the role.I think adults who read the book when they were younger are going to be much more into this film than anyone else. It just seems like it's more of a fond memory movie than something for teenagers or children today. I would imagine that most children under the age of 10 are going to be scared of the movie, especially towards the end when it gets pretty dark.I just found the movie kind of a letdown and not as satisfying as I thought it could be or probably will be for a lot of people. Don't be surprised if you leave the movie theater feeling a bit unfulfilled. Or sick from the camera bouncing around all the time. Did I mention that? They do the shaky cam thing throughout this movie as well. Be sure you have your airplane barf-bag with you upon boarding.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had more excitement and anticipation for this movie than the Star Wars prequels. I mean, I had a lot of personal investment in this movie. The trailer(s) are SO misleading. I understand that trailers are to hype people into going out and seeing said movie. Hence, why some snoozers will display every piece of action in the film (in the trailer) to draw a broader general-public-ADD audience.I was expecting this to be a celebration of imagination and the mind of a child. I wasn't expecting this to be a long drawn-out sob-fest. The dialog is horrific, even if it's being conjured in a kid's head. The creatures and the island are awesome! Those two things alone are worth the price of my admission. I just don't understand why they'd take this PG movie and make it so dark and dreary. The source material isn't the brightest, cheeriest thing I've ever seen - but it wasn't full of angst. That was this movie's problem... there was an overwhelming amount of angst.Even the 'fun' scenes had a touch of emo-melancholy bull-crap that ruined itself.I foresee a bunch of shoe-gazers/emo kids getting hoodies/purses/backpacks/tattoos riddled with these characters. If this movie is a celebration of anything, it's the celebration of mindless dark/emo twists on children's stories - which happens to be quite the trend now (just wait for Alice in Wonderland)...Thanks Spike and Co.This film may have received the author's blessing - but I stand firmly against the mood of this film. All it needs is more silly and less serious. Is that too much to ask? I mean, this isn't a courtroom drama. This isn't The Lovely Bones.. this is a Children's BOOK! It's a book about rebellion, and the return back to family. Though those are a bit serious subjects in nature - they aren't displayed in such an emo way.I'd hate to consider myself a 'book purist', but what I enjoyed out of Where the Wild Things Are is completely exempt from this film.I'm giving this a "6" for it's technical achievements. Jim Hensen company will always have my respect. I just wish they would've found a way to keep the animatronic heads.All and all - don't take your kids to see this. Well, hold on... if you have a kid with a swoop haircut with scars on their forearms/wrists, you should bring them to this movie. They'll enjoy it, then stand in the rain for a hour to think about it.*sigh*</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had been anticipating this movie big time. I had almost forgotten about the book from when I was little until rumors and images from this movie started popping up. I first thought "Oh yeah! I remember that book! It was awesome!". Then I thought "Wait a minute....wasn't that book like ten sentences long? How do you make a movie out of that?" Then I saw the first trailer. It blew me away and made me super excited to see this movie. I showed one of my friends the trailer, and his response was "That..... actually looks really cool." I found myself humming the music from the trailer (which by now everyone probably knows is Wake Up by Arcade Fire). I liked the song so much I downloaded it. The song sounds very epic and tragic, yet somehow hopeful. Funny, that's how I would describe Where he Wild Things Are.From the moment the first tiles came up, (which look like they have been scribbled on by Max, the main character,) I knew that this was going to be very unique. You probably know the story, so I won't go into that. But once Max gets onto the island, the movie changes drastically. It's funny, shocking, moving, and truly one of the best movies I've seen all year. It is a kids movie, but it is done in a sort of old school way. While it also uses new techniques.The wild things look great, and the voice acting is funny and even scary at times. People are saying that this is a "hipster movie". I'm not really sure what a hipster is. I'm assuming they are goth ( or emo, whatever stupid name quiet, different kids have now.) I don't think it is at all. It is a kids movie that is smart, imaginative, and very refreshing. It's a big metaphor for being a kid, and dealing with the tribulations that come with being a kid.As far as age recommendation, I'm not really sure. I'm sixteen and I loved this movie. I would say if you are a teen or an adult who just likes cool, different, even a little bit trippy movies, go see it. If you are or have a kid who is imaginative and won't be turned of because this movie doesn't follow the Pixar rules (don't get me wrong, I love Pixar), then take them to see it. Spike Jonze knows what he is doing.Inside all of us is a wild thing. :-#</fullReview>

There is so much depth to this movie, but one can really enjoyed it at any level, but the more levels that you are able to enjoy it the more powerful the movie can become.

I mean they showed several minutes of close up shots of Max playing with his mother's toe and pulling on her pantyhose, from a position under her desk that would give him a view of mother's crotch.And Max's constant search for a "womb", i.e. igloo, tent, "secret small hiding place with secret door" in the Wild Things fort, hiding inside of K.W., then her pulling max out, covered in slime like he had just been born.Great film to show a Psychology 101 class...I, as another reviewer did, registered to this site, for the sole purpose of writing my review for this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Where the Wild Things Are, the movie begins in earnest the audience is thrust into the world of a small, lonely boy. Rejection abounds and his interactions feel almost dream like while playing with neighbor children. I'm recalled to bitter sweet childhood memories of sad/happy times. Or perhaps, more likely, the memories of another movie with the bitter sweet childhood memories I think happened? The opening act caught me and I held my breath waiting for the beloved childhood book to unfold. Instead interminable boredom set in shortly after the monsters appear bringing with them a host of personal problems ala (forgive me for this) The Sopranos. Poor Max becomes quickly saddled as therapist and confident to a host of trouble monsters. We have the broken couple, the perennial bully victim and the crazy neighbor lady among others. The story drags on in and over days through a week and into forever until, at last Max leaves for the, by this point, almost pointless motherly embrace. The monsters' problems remain unresolved and you can only hope medication and therapy will be made available.I've read several reviews which grant the required qualified praise and I'm sure we'll see awards galore for this picture. If Max Records is very lucky he'll be passed over and we won't have to read about his many troubled years ahead. The movie will be embraced and hopefully, forgotten.Parents give your little ones a gift. Take the twenty dollars you would spend on this movie and buy them the book instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good movie... but not one to bring your kids to.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say that i don't really know how to feel about this movie. From the point of view as amateur film maker, i loved this movie. it was visually stunning, remarkably well-acted, and it had a plot that had substance. From another point of view, that of the child who loved this book, I feel betrayed and let down. The book was a little dark, but the movie went above and beyond to shove anger and depression and fear down the viewer's throat. I understood the movie and thought the concept was very well executed, but this is not a children's movie. I work at the movies, and was able to preview the movie the day before release. I took my 9 year old twin sisters to see it. We had been looking forward to it for weeks, and when we left the movie, they were scared and teary eyed. (Spoiler) One of the wild things gets his arm ripped off when Carol (one of the wild things) has a temper tantrum of sorts! This is why betrayal is a word I would use to describe my feeling toward this movie. I feel that they ruined the book, a beloved CHILDREN'S book. I feel betrayed by the fact that they are advertising the movie as one that children under the age of 12 can see, and that simply isn't the case. Bottom line, this movie is good, but you shouldn't take your 6 year old to see it.</fullReview>

Then returns later that night to his mother who STILL made him food, even though the kid is a total d-bag.Unless you can see this movie for free, don't see it.If you can see this movie for free...

		<shortDescription>Beautiful SUPERB special effects -- Island of Retarded Monsters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the first 30 minutes you get to met Max. Max needs serious psychological consoling and probably medication for his manic depressive wild mood swings. Max bites his mother, runs away from home, finds a boat, sails away, ends up on the "Island of Retarded Monsters".The good point is the regular lingering menace given off by the monsters (in the same way you would feel as if you were the smartest child born into a home of violent mentally-unstable mostly-intoxicated retards who tend to be nice for the most part and evil to the core when they are angry or confused).That at least retains the "monster" part of the monsters despite the short average-sounding human names in the movie. In fact, most of these monsters you could grow to love one-by-one (when they are not being violent threatening retards) if they were separated from the bad influence of each other. As a gang though, the uncomfortable air of menace is constant.I figure the story was a way of the author retelling his troubled childhood growing up in a home of violently abusive incompetent alcoholic retarded dimwits who were in such a constant state of stupor it was a wonder any of them survived (not that the burning bones of the previous failed "king" AKA "problem solver" AKA "stranger not born into the psychotic redneck clan"). The special effects though are SUPERB, despite the whole story being SLOOOOOOW and depressing for the most part tale and also being like a week living with the Texas Chainsaw Massacre family or the Charles Manson Family after they've freshly murdered a stranger passing near their property.Also note that it appears that Max and the Retard Monsters never needed to eat (the retard monsters being filled with magical sawdust or sand for some reason) or drink water or poop for the entire time of the tale. I would've given this a much lower rating if not for the acting quality, the special effects quality, and the quest for finding out what made the story work or author write this tale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watching as an adult you are taken back to your childhood days of escapism, and adventure and it's all blended with fun, drama and conflict!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Where the Wild Things Are" is a film that kids will stand up and cheer for I as an adult haven't yet read the award winning 1963 short story from author Maurice Sendak which I plan to do so though. Anyway this film is good enough that an adult will also get some enjoyment out of, as the way it's done and blended with humor and most important of all the theme of escape yet most notable it has enough conflict and drama that all of us can relate to. And clearly as you watch from the beginning and see the need for escapism you think back to your childhood when you were bored and you thought nobody understood you, as just like Max you wanted to run away to your own little world and make new friends even if many were strange(like the film's creatures).That's clearly what this film did as a young boy Max(Max Records) who appears out of control and is running around as he's displeased with the way that his older neighbors treat him. His older sister ignores him, plus to top it off he can't get any attention from his mom played by Catherine Keener. So after he's sent to bed one night with no supper as his eagerness got the best of him as Max even bit mother! He runs out the door thru the streets and over by the trees into the woods. And all of a sudden a boat that's private and personal appears and it's off to sailing to a new land for Max thru the rugged and rough seas! Once arriving and awakening he finds these woods are where the wilds things are! he meets the strangest looking characters who are hairy and even monster looking. The most notable and his best friend during the whole escape stay is Carol(voiced great by ex "Sopranos" boss James Gandolfini). As from the get go after talking Max convinces him that he's a special king in his new world and Carol agrees to be his guardian beast of the jungle! Max also meets odd looking creatures named Judith, Alexander, Bull, Douglas and Ira. Along the way this is an adventure come true for this little boy who builds his own club tree house and has the most fun cuddling and playing with his creature friends.However like any kids adventure conflict and disagreement is present as Max will bring tears to his best friend Carol. As the days of swinging from trees can't last forever you even are touched when you see the tears and emotions from Carol as you think back to when you said good bye to your best friend after playing with him. So it's sailing back to the norm for Max who experienced a great journey of adventure and escapism that all kids should enjoy and most of us as kids had our own little fantasy and daydreaming adventures like Max.Really a pretty good film to see as you as an adult will enjoy as you will have flashback days to your childhood when you felt you were another Max and had wild adventures in your own land with strange creature friends as many can relate to imaginary friends(remember!)and this adaption from director Spike Jonze was well done his sets and mixing of adventure with drama and emotions make an adult like it especially the big over sized creatures! Really a film that takes so many back to memories of their childhood as all of us had our adventure and loved to escape with imaginary friends you may feel like your watching something of Jim Henson. Though as it ends you feel a little touch of "The Wizard of Oz" as Max returns safe back home as he hugs mother he still feels their is no place like home and that all adventures must end just like Dorothy's adventure in Oz did. Still overall a film to watch that helps you revisit your childhood days and it lets your imagination run wild.</fullReview>

One my consider making the animal more realistic and beautiful instead of making them like KFC doll. The acting was not even good if there was any. The only part that I liked was when the kid goes inside the beast mouth to hide. Kind of cool. It might be some yoongi or nostalgic movie but still believe was not worth watching it.

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Film I've seen in years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was 4, I read this book all the time. The imagination of this place drew me in and I never wanted to leave. This film is a prefect example of one of those rare films that surpass the book. The story is amazing and pulls you into this fantasy world a lot more than the book. The acting is superb, even on behalf of the child actor who played Max. The characters show great personality and it is quite comical sometimes, even for those older that 10 (I'm 17). I must say though that the movie can be quite dark at some elements. There are some scary points or points when the wild things become angry that could frighten a child and this is a movie that should be considered for a re-grade at the MPAA (I'm not a person who believes in censoring or anything ,but this movie will scare the crap out of 6 year olds). The movie also takes a turn for the depressing, so be aware of that (this is the third movie to ever make me cry). But it is simply amazing and is well worth a watch. It's my new favorite movie so stop reading my review and go see it!!!! This movie earns a well deserved 10 out of 10 (Don't go, I'll eat you up, I love you so)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Teenage/Childhood MASTERPIECE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw the movie tonight in my homemade costume that seemed to create a lot of attention with people and their cameras.There's only one way to really like and understand this movie, and it's to be a teenager and/or a child. Most adults, as a fact, will not "get it" and its true ingenuity. Some do, but our theater was packed and most of them were kids or teens. At the end there was even a standing ovation and it was like everyone was family in the theater for those credits. It was absolutely amazing. It'll make you feel like you want to be that age again, along with the excitement, depression, and love all involved in it. Of course it drags on at certain parts, and it has really not much to do with the book, as was opposed by many here and on other sites, but when you turn to look at the person next to you after the film is over, I can almost guarantee that you're going to smile and give him/her a hug as if it were the only moment in the world with a point. I don't see it winning an Oscar, but already it has and will capture the hearts of millions of kids, teens, and even some adults, around the world. It's the story of a lifetime in childhood that only those that envy to be/are children will learn to truly appreciate no matter the age or size.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The look was fantastic. The voice talent was fantastic. The kid who acted in it did a great job. It might be well directed. But the plot, characters, and themes, well . . . sucked.Or maybe I'm looking at it the wrong way. Maybe it's a cautionary tale of how a mother should grow a vestigial backbone and learn the merit of at least a tiny amount of discipline lest her son grow up to be a despicable brat. Maybe it's a tale about consequences for children who do stupid, dangerous things on bratty impulses.I took the film to portray the opposite, though, and quickly was regretting the choice to see it. Walking out of the theater, it is usual to have the "So, what did you think?" conversation. "What a piece of crap" succinctly sums it up for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Children's movie about the subconscious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a children's movie about the subconscious that even adults can get into. It's about a boy that delves into his subconscious in order to deal with neglect and the longing to fit in. And each character he has a chance of connecting with has a persona that is from him or others that he knows of. What got to me was the connection between Me and Max, cause just about every adult had a childhood. And how the news of brutality can really effect a child and his or her thought process. It's kind of a depressing story, but a story that still has a bit of hope at the end. The relationship with Max and the Beasts is actually quite intricate if you delve more into it the characters themselves. I can understand why this movie wasn't a box office hit, but it's still worth a watch fr sure.8.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charming Rendition of Sendak Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a superbly well-acted and energetic romp into childhood imagination. If you're familiar with the books of Sendak, you know what to expect: a boisterous main character hell-bent on playful wildness, elaborately imagined playthings, escapism, self-discovery and love. There is a more developed story in the film than I remember there being in the book, but it kept things moving.Sometimes the plot seemed so far-fetched that it was hard to empathize with any of Max's wild things--for example, I didn't quite understand the drama between the characters K.W. and Carol. It was, however, fun to watch the young actor playing Max scream enthusiastically, or howl like a wolf, and even sad to watch him cry. He does a fine job and is headed places if he continues.Cute soundtrack by Karen O, lead singer of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, which is also uplifting and playful, featuring an overlapping of children's vocals to echo the themes of play/innocence in the film. A great film for kids/families, as well as for anyone who enjoyed the book as a child (like me). You might have trouble keeping the attention of younger kids, though, I think, unless they are very familiar with the book and thus more interested.</fullReview>

I was amazed by it, especially with the range of emotions that they were capable of producing on the faces of the large creatures.For an adaption from a beloved book, then they actually pulled it off quite nicely, and the movie is appealing to both children and adults alike.If you aren't familiar with this story (book) already, then you should watch the movie and then catch up on the book later on. The movie is really spectacular, both in story and visually.The characters (and that include the creatures) are really well portrayed and given so much character that it is hard not to love and adore them. And hats off to Max Records for his performance in "Where the Wild Things Are", because he really did a great job.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I finally sat down and watched this movie last night after I happened to see it at the store the other day for $7.99 on Blu-Ray. I've been meaning to see this film for awhile because I enjoyed the book as a child and I've enjoyed Spike Jonze's work particularly with musicians.After hearing a mixed bag of reviews, I went into this film with an open mind; and I must say I really enjoyed it. The first scene with Max wildly screaming chasing his dog is a pretty good indication of the intensity for the rest of the movie. It's not a cute kind of wild, it's the kind where you think, "wow, that kid is a handful..." and you may think yourself fortunate for not having to raise him. That being said, I wouldn't call this a kid's movie by any means, but it's not entirely dark either.It's more of a story about raw emotion; whether it's fear, hope, anger, sadness, euphoria, or ignorance. If you're interested in seeing this movie, then give it a shot. It did a good job provoking emotions from me. Just try to go into it without any expectations of what it will be. The production design and visual effects; both CG and puppetry, are quite amazing. That alone is worth the time watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A visual triumph but narrative mess.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the same way that the amazing cast of "The Men Who Stare at Goats" prompted you to try to love the film, the singular visual artistry of Spike Jonze pushes you to try and love this film. In both cases you wind up somewhere between adoration and indifference. As expected, Jonze' does a brilliant job of building transcendent moments from music and wide angle shots with striking visuals in the foreground in this case the character Max walking across beaches, deserts and forests in the company of 7 foot puppets. The combination of the puppetry and computer animation truly brings to live Maurice Sendack's illustrations and the Jim Henson Company is to be congratulated. However, Jonze cannot be fully lauded for his visual sense as often he uses flat lighting to convey a sense of fantasy which comes off just looking like the film was under-lit. The main problem with the film is captured in any scene where these fantastical creatures talk. The wild things world is filled with petty jealousies, pointless low-grade violence, office politics, mopiness, unfulfilled promises, emotional blackmail and, as the character "KW" says at one point "...it's...you know...complicated." In short, Max ran away from home, braved the open sea and discovered a new world which was pretty much the same as this one. You leave the theater wondering what exactly was Jonze' and Sendak's point.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An adaptation of Maurice Sendak's classic children's story, where Max, a disobedient little boy sent to bed without his supper, creates his own world--a forest inhabited by ferocious wild creatures that crown Max as their ruler.So let me just say this: I was a big fan of the book when I was a child. It was very entertaining and hearings of a movie sounded interesting. The trailer looked alright, but I was expected more a kid's movie. But that's the good thing. Where The Wild Things Are has heart, adventure, and adult material hidden within. Of course, the movie still is a kid's film but even the director stated that he wanted this labeled as a non- kid's film. The film starts off wonderfully and anticipation for the rest is high. When he does get on the island; things can get a little "kid's territory" but not to worry, because it has a balance for both. The acting was well although the movie basically had just one actor. The special effects were good, the CGI monsters looked very well done. Then we have the magical score. This is one of those rare movies that made me go out and by it, because it was that special. The songs play their part and at times, I admit it was haunting. It brought us back into our childhood days, where everything was so subtle and innocent. It brought us back to when we wanted to go wild. And that's the film's purpose, to bring out a wild side to us. And that's why I loved it. It didn't have to be serious to bring out it's wonderful message, but sublimity is key. With it's beautiful, haunting score, the film plays out well. Kids and adults alike will find it a magical experience. Warning: the film isn't for everyone. Of course, I mean the adults. Some wouldn't want to look past the kid's land and farther to the meaning and sublimity, but whatever suits you. Where the Wild Things was one of the best movies in 2009. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let the Wild Rumpus beginning!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Development hell has been the curse of many films, delaying films, bringing in countless directors, writers and actors who leave for various reasons. The same thing happened with Where the Wild Things Are, with debates on where the film should be animated or live action and Warner Brothers feared that the film would be too dark and scary for children.Max (Max Records) is a hyper-active, unruly child with a big imagine. His parents are divorced with his mother (Catherine Keener) struggling with work. He is petty and unmanageable when he does not get his way. After disrupting his mum's date Max bites her and runs away. When he runs away he ends up in a strange land, with a range of unusual creatures. Max is made their king after claiming he had magical powers. Max forms a strong relationship with one of the monsters, Carol (James Gandolfini), but there are big stresses when it comes to kingship.Spike Jonze is a smart director and he has ambition. He basically made a big budget indie film. Throughout the film Jonze kept a downbeat tone, making a film about a child and his relationships. This a film about character development and how characters change over the course of a film. Jonze is bold because he avoided CGI as much as possible, having men in large costumes and animatronics and only used CGI just to help with the monsters some expressions. The film looked like it was a fantasy film from the 1980s, and I mean that as a compliment because it is refreshing to see old-fashion techniques and I agree with Jonze's philosophy.Jonze and writer Dave Eggers had to expand a story that was only 48 pages when it was a children's book. The characters evolve. Max in the beginning of the film is unruly and it can either be seen that he has behavioural problems or simply struggling to cope with his family issues. Carol act as both Max's guardian and mentor and a mirror of Max, turning Max from being the parent to a almost parent like figure. The other monsters have their own personalities, Judith (Catherine O'Hara) being a downer and often confrontational, Douglas (Chris Cooper) who is a loyal to Carol to the point that he is willing to do some destruction to keep him happy, Alexander (Paul Dano) the goat who is ignored and depressive, a little like Marvin the depressed android and K.W. (Lauren Ambrose) who is a loner but properly the most sensible of the group. Max is able to bring happily to the group and live out a his childish fantasies, with the monsters making him able to fulfil them: but struggles when he starts to play favourites.Jonze uses hand-held cameras to great effect and the score by Karen O and Carter Burwell was fresh, different and match the film. But I do have to say Where the Wild Things Are seem to be made more for adults then for children, partly because of the tone and darkness, but mainly the plot and story is more adult. Children would expect a more adventure based story.Max Records is a strong lead and a talented young actor. He starts off as a natural child and stays like that, whether he playing, making stories or having a tender moment with his mum. Even thought Keener had a small role she had a good relationship with Records and you would really believe that she is his mother. Jonze, like Wes Anderson, made his voice actors perform rather then stand in a recording studio and say their lines about 20 times. The voice actors are solid, with Gandofini being the highlight.There are interesting ideas, but I would have like to have seen more about the history of this strange world or explain why some of the world is dying: it could have lead to a more dramatic story. Some of the monsters could have been more developed and were just background characters and there are throwaway moments that did not go anywhere, like the giant dog.A solid 7.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is about a naughty young boy who ran away from home after misbehaving very badly. He discovers a land of wild creatures, where they crown him the king.While watching this film, I kept wondering where was the fun and where was the entertainment. The first twenty minutes, which tells how Max misbehaves at home, is already thoroughly boring. After arriving at this fantasy land, things just get steadily worse. The sets are monotonously coloured, everything is brown. By everything, I mean everything from the animals, to the houses, to the trees and even the colour of the desert! I have never seen such a monotonously coloured children's film. The plot is so thin, it never develops to anything exciting, gripping, educational, emotional or entertaining. It just shows Max and the animals playing around, throwing dirt balls at each other, arguing with each other or walking around in jungles. I simply refuse to believe that any child can be entertained by this tedious mess. I find "Where the Wild Things Are" so boring and monotonous, with no entertainment value whatsoever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching this agonizing piece of Hollywood-trash from start to finish, I really feel like writing a loooong, elaborate, eloquent rant, warning others not to repeat my mistake, not to give this deceitful flick a chance at the movie store, to not even think about downloading it without paying for it - just to stay away and ignore it for what it is; a shameless meditation of self-pity and unprocessed childhood-traumas. But what can I say that hasn't been said on the first few pages of this very site?About halfway during the movie, my girlfriend and I started to argue, whether this really should be rated for children of the age of 6 and above (as it is here in Germany), for all the already mentioned reasons: The movie being depressive, violent, self-absorbed, menacing; and more so the main character being a scary and maladjusted loner acting like he is 5 years old and who implicitly suffers from ADD and a vaguely dysfunctional family life. But I argued that this movie would be best suited for children UNDER the age of 6, those who would never be able to figure out the barely hidden agenda of this movie. Under a certain age, kids don't have a radar for the sad and tragic sides of life like death, the lasting damages of violence... or the self-destructive surreality of a mentally handicapped main characters search for inner peace.My point being: SERIOUSLY, if you want to make a dark, depressing, moody film *about* children, fine with me. But please don't hide that behind the name of a book *for* children. Don't let an omnipresent PR campaign fool parents into thinking that this might be just the new cute thing for them to see with their kids. I mean, come on! I as the audience feel cheated into watching a existential angsty meditation that some supposed "hot shot genius director" conjured up while snorting coke from the pages of random storybooks... And I blame the studio system for allowing this to be promoted in a deceiving fashion. It is as after they watched the final cut, they suddenly realized how much money this guy has just wasted on this bloated piece of trash... so they tried to cut their losses. I understand that they even insisted on changing many scenes, resulting in a lot of pick-up shots and a year long delay.Jesus... I wonder how downright evil that first cut must have been.So, anyway, if you feel like watching this, for... whatever reasons... at least do yourself a favor and watch it dubbed in a language that somehow sounds funny to you. A language that you don't understand. There are some good things to say about the movie (hence the 2 points), for one, the namesake Wild Things are really fun to watch, their animation is one of those rare cases where CGI can really work as an art form - instead of just being an insufficient tool to replicate reality. And second, the acting of the main actor is decent. I mean, you hate that little brat immediately, but that's just how good he plays that part. The problem is just that he is way to old, he looks like 10 or 11, yet his character functions on a pre-school level.You know what... writing all of this down I really begin to wonder if this whole flick wasn't just a big corporate sponsored propaganda piece in favor of expensive child psychiatry... I don't have children, but I think this movie firmly planted to idea into my subconscious that Ritalin truly is the solution to aaaaaaall a kids problems.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I greatly anticipated this movie, I had read this story to both my son and grandson many times.I can not express how disappointed I was , when I saw this movie. The story surrounds the adventurers of a 4 or 5 little boy. Yet the movie tends to throw everything into a teenage genre.I feel that I, or for that matter anyone could have done better.I may not have been able to stretch this story into a full length feature film, but think after hundreds of readings, but I think I could do better in communicating the message to 5 and 6 year old little boys.For these reasons I hope that someone will pick up this story and do it justice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Depressing, Sad, but Haunting (in a good way) ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Found this movie to be really strange and not at all what I expected. I rented it to watch with my 4-year old and that was clearly a mistake but that's neither here nor there for the purposes of this review. Just don't bother watching it with small kids (it will both bore them to tears and depress them.) Here's the deal: I have read a bunch of the reviews on here ranging from 10 stars (absurdly high) to 1 star (absurdly low). The truth I think is somewhere in the middle. I had a lot of trouble dealing with the Max character in general and found him so thoroughly unlikable that it was hard to get through the film. I was rooting against him; almost hoping one of the monsters changed their mind and ate him. No such luck. However, I also really appreciated a lot of the metaphors and parallels that were drawn and this aspect was really intriguing and well done and at the end of the film, made the sum appear greater than any of the parts I recall at any given point. It was just strange to deal with such a sad, sad plot line. A kid who is empty on the inside and craving attention, despite the reasons, is still hard to like and yes, I found myself saying "If I were that mother, that kid would be getting a lot more than a 'why'd you bite me?'" Again, the hollow feeling you get at the conclusion and throughout the duration of the film are actually what keeps it from being a complete train wreck but unless you are in "I'm in the mood to wallow in my own sadness" mode, stay away from it. It wasn't quite good enough to warrant watching it unless you're in the same mode you're in when you feel like tuning on "Leaving Las Vegas" or "Eye for a Eye."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unless your tweeners really enjoy Ibsen they'll hate this picture, but I won't dwell on that. It's not kid friendly, that's clear. Maybe it's grown-up nostalgia."Where the Wild Things Are" starts off well and I liked the first twenty minutes. The shaky cam and quick cuts do reflect a boys irrational mind and Catherine Keener was sympathetic as the mother. After impressively passing that hurdle, I thought the next challenge would be expanding the material to feature length but it really didn't matter.Once the boy heads off to "Where the Wild Things Are" it jumps so far off track tonally it can't recover. It's relentlessly sad and it doesn't reflect any sensible reading of the book. Maybe I was a poor young reader, that's what my teachers said, but I thought the monsters were cool, and I thought it would be a kick to go where the wild things are. I didn't realize it was a magical land of clinical depressives. I thought a wild rumpus was fun too, but I was wrong. The music for it here is "Wake Up" by Arcade Fire. Rumpus-ing, you see, is done to hipster sad music. (YouTube that song and tell me how rumpus-y YOU think it is.) Tony Soprano mouthing one of the creatures was a little weird, and I didn't think the creatures CGI faces were very expressive but I probably could have accepted those if I didn't feel like slitting my wrists through the rest.Spike Jonze and Dave Eggars are talented guys, I like them both, but in striving for something deep and sublime they sucked the fun out of the story. It was like they made the "Wizard of Oz" in all black and white, removed the munchkins and those frivolous songs and decided that it was really about flying monkeys with esteem issues and Dorothy pining for Kansas. I sure hope they don't try to film that one about the five identical Chinese brothers. I still have some happy memories which I don't want ruined, thank-you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>uneven though generally rewarding children's fantasy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Childhood fantasy is all about giving kids power in a world where they essentially have no power. And if that means having to create an entirely new world where that can happen, then so be it.Maurice Cendak's 1963 "Where the Wild Things Are" provides just such a world for Max (Max Records), a nine-year-old boy whose divorced mother (Catherine Keener) is too preoccupied with getting food on the table to give him the attention he deserves and whose older sister suddenly doesn't have the time or inclination to play with her little brother much anymore. One night, in a fit of rage, Max runs away from home, clad in a wolf costume he wears for every occasion; in his flight, he stumbles upon a boat on a nearby shore and sails it away to a wooded isle populated by an assortment of strange creatures whose situations and conditions eerily parallel his own (they too are rambunctious, temperamental and lonely). Soon they've crowned him king of the island and together they play and romp through the forest, bonding, bickering, knocking down trees, building a fort, and teaching one another lessons about life and friendship and what it means to have power over others. (James Gandolfini, Lauren Ambrose, Chris Cooper, Paul Dano, Catherine O'Hara and Forest Whitaker provide the voices for the creatures).First, a somewhat flippant point: though I appreciate the fact that the filmmakers opted to go old-school and not rely so heavily on CGI for their special effects, that doesn't excuse the fact that the creatures on the island look for all the world like only slightly more evolved descendants of H.R. Pufnstuf (or maybe the Banana Splits).That being said, however, there is much to recommend in "Where the Wild Things Are," even though I'm fully aware that it will surely not be everyone's cup of tea.Indeed, with its deep reflections into the human condition, its drab and rather colorless setting (this is no rainbow-hued, Technicolor Oz), its unfrenetic pacing and lack of whiz-bang special effects, "Where the Wild Things Are" may well be the first "art" movie ever designed primarily with children in mind - which, ironically, may actually make it less appealing to the kids than to the adults in the audience. Perhaps because the creatures themselves seem so interchangeable with one another, it's often difficult to fully comprehend the dynamics taking place within the group itself. And without this understanding, the deeper themes of friendship, prejudice, jealousy, hurt feelings, truth, deception, warfare, etc., that are playing themselves out in the story tend to get lost in the shuffle.Yet, for all the reservations one might have about the movie, "Where the Wild Things Are" eventually wins its audience over with its ultra-stylish direction by Spike Jonze (who co-wrote the screenplay with Dave Eggers), its strikingly poetic imagery and visuals (kudos to cinematographer Lance Acord and production designer K.K. Barrett), and its refusal to talk down to it audience. And the last half hour or so of the film is so artistically fine and pure that it makes any quibbles one might have had about earlier portions of the movie seem like mere nitpicking when all is said and done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The nostalgia of Animatronics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall I admire Spike Jonze's directing from his predecessor "Being John Malkovich", and was looking forward to this movie. I've been waiting almost a year to watch this movie and anticipated its greatness. I was unable to catch it out here with the release dates but heard mixed reviews about WTWTA. I was sold on the previews with that song by "Arcade Fire" and looked for it constantly on iTunes and the DVD store. Now actually seeing it, here is what I got out of it.Sendak and Jonze did their best to implement screen time into a feature length film from a mostly illustrated children's story book. Most of this screen time was in observation of the return to animatronics. Seeing many of these nearly life-like "wild things" brought me back into the nostalgic times of the Muppets and Sesame Street. Then it clicked to me, that the target audience was for more so for the adults who were raised with that storybook read to them along with exposure to Jim Henson's works when they are young. Kid's today, are more focused on CG and crap animation. For me, it was like seeing Snufalupagus doing back flips, and rough housing with big bird. The muppets are the bread and butter. The CG wasn't decipherable and blended in with these creatures, if there were any.I really wanted to like this movie more, I had some trouble trying to identify the emotional connection with between Max and the wild things that supposedly ate their previous kings. I wish there was a tad more interaction instead of the mere befriending and rough housing montages between the characters, it was almost as if Sendak and Jonze were couldn't figure out what to implement next. In the story I thought he was supposed to be sent to his bedroom rather than run into a forested area. Plot points were used sparingly as well.This movie still works in it's own way, and I really wish it could have been perfected, however not for everyone. WTWTA is still recommendable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Escape From Reality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A escape from reality. Our main character is a kid that has a overactive imagination. His mother is single and trying to hold on to her job. His sister usually ignores him . After running home from a conflict, he escapes reality to a island full of monsters. He becomes king and they build a fort... etc.I didn't hate this movie, nor I liked it. It just felt too hollow. Yeah it looks nice, the acting was good, and the design of the monsters were great, but it's mostly filler. This film felt like it was made for adults than children, perhaps it was the director's goal to do it. Maybe it's a film where adults can enjoy it and feel like a kid again. Perhaps it's one of those movies where you have to give it another view... and I'll try and see it again, but for now I give it a 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The anxieties and lively fantasy world of Max - a rites of passage tale.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's easy to see why this film has divided opinions so much - it isn't exactly what some people expect from family films these days as its story structure and themes are argued to be too 'depressing' from what is an adaptation of a picture book.But it could be argued however that the Maurice Sendak book, although low on plot is bursting with imagination does have a darkness present within the story.Acting: Records is the only human we spend time with for much of the film, and he's such a natural actor - no horrid stilted mannerisms from this boy. His character is a very misunderstood and troubled child, and his imagination mirrors this.I loved the voices of the Wild Things - O'Hara's and Galdofini's voices are very well delivered and a big part in bringing these huge furry costumes to life.Plot: Admittedly, this does have a very episodic, haphazard, meandering structure, but that is what a lot of kid's imaginations are like.The offbeat, deadpan humour and then melancholy that dominates much of the last third fit the hippy-ish looking Wild Things and the fears of Max himself. There is a playful side that made me feel like a kid again, that alternates the worries from the outside world, so it isn't all solemn at all.I think the very short book has been expanded well, and if things like the Mum's boyfriend and how Max's time in the land where his imaginary land comes to an end I thought could've been done better and explained more, the majority of the film is commendable.Cinematography: The Wild Things themselves are really believable characters(down to the voice acting and these men or women in the huge costumes).There's a random change in seasons(it could be snowing in one scene or have pink petals falling in another) which again matches the tone of a kid's imagination well.Also, most importantly, the wildness of these creatures is displayed effectively, and a certain briefly violent scene proves this point even more. There is a sense that they really get hurt from this rough play, despite the fact that they aren't real.Score: Didn't like some of the intrusive stereotypical indie songs that took me out of the magic of some scenes. A simple, orchestral score works best for me, mostly.Overall: A film that's obviously made mainly for nostalgic adults but could have a appeal for older kids as well.From this final result, they've done the best they could from how they told the story, and yeah they could've made the film with only Max's exuberant adventures then slowly had him miss home, but I like the gamble they took including a child's uncertainties about the world.An very good, if flawed rites of passage tale that needs to be watched at the cinema to fully immerse yourself in Max's imaginary world - 7.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>it's hard not to be engaged by this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I should start off by saying that i was looking forward to this movie for quite some time, it's a first feature from Jonze since Adaptation which came out SEVEN years ago, the trailer looked promising (and as the budget suggested visually stunning). And since it seems like adaptations of children's books seem to be taking over the film industry one director at a time I felt that its the kind genre that should suit Jonzes style. The movie is beautiful cinematography-wise to me above anything, visual style was what made the biggest impression on me. The character, set design, locations and great photography are core to this movie. It does have some moving moments but quickly backs out of them (i'm inclined to blame it on the editing but I'm guessing Jonze had the final cut). It's an interesting movie definitely worth a trip to the movies but to me it's always on the edge between entertaining and moving not really committing to either. It has LOTS of good moments and some truly spectacular ones but they don't add up to a great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Firstly, I am going to second the statement that adults who look back on this movie after the fact only see it as a children's film lacking deeper meaning as being disappointing.It's actually funny, because it seems that they have, like Max once did, forgotten the wonder of being a child.This is an excellent movie, with excellent performances by Forest Whitaker, Bob Haskins, Catherine O'Hara, and Jim Henson's "The Muppets" in particular. What a wonderful cast for this film, and I feel that this one carries the original message of the novels better than any other Wild Things related movie out there.Watch it with your children, or amongst those friends who remember watching it when they were young. I feel that movies that spark the imagination are rare or coated with too many special effects and hardly any substance these days.This is a classic. It is fun and warm and familiar. Relax and enjoy it. Children movies are not meant to be watched with a stiff posture and an eye for mistakes or flaws. Be a kid again, think happy thoughts, and remember how to believe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sad film about the life of an outsider</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spike Jonze's expansion of Maurice Sendak's children's book is an animal unto its own self. It would be impossible to truly film Sendak's book and not have it run only ten or fifteen minutes. Jonze didn't really try and instead expanded the story and took it into new directions. The story of Max who's sent to his room and ends up traveling to the title place only to return while his dinner was still warm, has been re-imagined as the story of a slightly older Max who is having trouble dealing with life (his single mother, his older sister who ignores him, and his lack of friends) who gets into a fight with his mom and runs out into the night and ends up with the Wild Things. For me it came across as a sad little film that is an unvarnished look at growing up and growing older. It is a film about trying to deal with life and all of its problems. It is and it is not the book. For me the best way to view it as the events of the book in reality with the book the view of the older Max looking back at the events a couple of decades on.To be honest I think the film is a masterpiece of sorts. Rarely has the unease and pain of trying to navigate life been so masterfully put on screen. At the same time it's a film I'm not sure I'll ever watch again. The film depressed me. As good as it is I found only sadness in it. Even in the happy parts I found everything tinged with melancholy. I don't need to go there again. (Honestly I do think I will see it again when it hit home video to see if it strikes me differently) I do recommend the film. Its really well done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where the Wild Things Are is one of those films you just can't be indifferent to. You'll either hate it, love it, or be left with a melancholy feeling of indecisiveness. I belong in the last category. When asked whether I liked it or not, I can truthfully say "I have no idea". Visually, it was fantastic. As a film that deals with themes of childhood, fantastic. As an adaptation of the source material- not so good. As a children's movie..... well, that's not what it is, so never mind.The film starts out well, with a realistic portrayal of childhood and great characterisation complimented by a good performance from the young lead. I admit to enjoying the first part of it, mostly because it isn't what I expected at all (though I do have some complaints about excessive use of the shaky cam). Then, the film- to my disappointment, I admit- does not follow the book and Max is not sent to his room without supper, but there is, instead, a rather violent confrontation with his mother resulting in him running away from home. This bit I can't say I cared for much. A long, tedious section then ensues where Max arrives at the island followed by an unimpressive introduction for the Wild Things.Then, however, the film becomes interesting again (though not in a way you may expect). It is very emotional and there are a lot of deep themes that children will not understand (and some downright disturbing scenes), which is why I would not really recommend this to children. It also contains a lot of lighthearted scenes very abruptly juxtaposed with emotionally intense ones which made me a bit uncomfortable, not to mention young children.I will not spoil the ending, but I can say that the movie definitely left a mark on me. I didn't go in expecting an accurate adaptation of the children's book (considering its length) and I'm glad I didn't, because it really is not an adaptation of the book at all, save for the characters. Even the themes presented are different from those in the book. I would definitely recommend seeing it, but I cannot assure you that you won't despise it. It is a very thought-provoking film, and I'm not going to say that children shouldn't see it, but I am warning that they may not enjoy it- especially if they are expecting a light, fun flick (HINT: it's not).7/10 for being a captivating movie.</fullReview>

This was quite an enjoyably expanded live action version of what it's like for a kid with frustrations of his own that doesn't always get addressed by the older ones in his family getting away for a while and letting his imaginations run wild with some friendly monsters who almost immediately take to him, especially the one named Carol (voice of James Gandolfini). Other monsters are voiced by Catherine O'Hara, Forest Whitaker, and Lauren Ambrose. The boy playing Max (Max Records) can be both a little obnoxious and appealing, sometimes at the same time but that's okay. And Jonze does well keeping the changing tones consistent.

It was visually impressive and I loved the music by Karen O. I think it lagged a little bit in some parts, could have been a little shorter. For parent's thinking this is a kids movie, and there are a lot of you because my theater was filled with younger kids, I would maybe reconsider. Yes, there are monsters, the main character is a child, and it's a children's book, but I felt like a lot of the dialogue might go over kid's heads and it was a little violent to be honest. I thought it was a very touching movie at the end though, cried my eyes out and heard a lot of sniffling around me also. Any movie that makes me cry is good in my book! =) I don't think this was the greatest movie, but it had a good message, visually it was great and it was a good take on a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think my headline says it all. I knew this was a "kids" movie before I watched it, I expected a simple, whimsical, lighthearted fantasy/adventure, about a (lonely) boy who created a world in his mind to escape to and have adventures with the creatures who live there. Simple enough, something any small child can certainly relate to.WRONG! Instead Max, who have hints of perhaps being lonely youth (overworked mom, older sister with friends, dad (dead, divorced? I dunno, it's never made clear.) Is completely overshadowed by the fact he goes on violent, destructive rants, acts out, bites his own mother, destroys sister's property and thoroughly soaks both her carpet and bed with snow. All because the people around him aren't constantly paying attention to him 24/7. (Great lessons for kids too huh? Life happens, but even negative attention is still attention right? So do whatever possible to get people to notice you!) It made me lose any warm feelings I might have for Max, they should have just left him as a lonely youth with no friends and a mom who is constantly working, etc.The extreme disjointed feel of the movie arises from when Max steals away to a far off island full of the "wild things." (I am never clear if this is for real in the movie, or a product of a sleeping Max, again, it's never made clear.)I honestly had no idea what was going on, and did try my best to follow it. I tried even turning my brain off to just go with the flow, but found that impossible as there is no flow. After a while I took to just psychoanalyzing the "wild things" and trying to decide which creature matched what manifestation of Max's personality...or the personalities of the people in his life. While most of the time it was one creature or another's non stop whining for most of the movie...it was also violent dirt fights of creatures pelting each other about the face, head, and body with huge painful dirt clumps, violent destruction of creature's homes by Carol, general violent outbursts, threats, smashing and destruction, and the actual violent ripping off of Douglas's arm by Carol. The next scene we see Douglas, he has jammed a white stick into the hole to act as a makeshift arm. This isn't even mentioning the sarcastic overtones, mocking, and general depressing overtones of this movie.At no time did I feel anyone learned any lessons, grew, changed, anything. Maybe a little at the weird ending where the boy is eager to get home...perhaps he learned a little bit to be a little nicer and more respectful to those in his life. Whatever.I have 2 young godsons, who not only would I never consider showing them this dreck, but even if I did, they'd be bored out of their skulls and most likely be finding something else to do within the first ten minutes. Why couldn't this story have been kept about a lonely young boy escaping into his imagination, instead of terror inducing, boring, Freud fest that the writers decided to make it? 2/10, being generous because the animatronic creatures we're actually impressive to look at, and nothing looked overly fake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A emotional journey into the mind of a child</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first read about this movie, I had no idea what the childrensstory was that this movie was going to be based on. Then I found out what it was (it is translated into "Max en de Maximonsters" in Dutch) and I thought it would definitely be interesting. A lot of people still ask how somebody can make such a short story into a movie, but I think the answer is it doesn't . Where the Wild Things Are is more like a reimagening, and author Maurice Sendak also said after watching it that Spike Jonze created his own vision of his story. So in that sense, if you expect the movie to be 100% true to the story, you might be disappointed.The biggest complaint I heard from people by far is that this movie is supposedly "too dark for kids", and while I agree that it does have a few dark edges its not thát disturbing. I would say that kids of the age of 8 and up will have no trouble watching it, but thats my opinion.I think where Where The Wild Things Are is aiming for is representing the emotions that a kid like of Max' age can struggle with, and at that it does a great job and it can often even be confronting. The voices of the monsters are also done with great enthusiasm, and my favorite monster has to be Alexander the goat-boy.The camera-work is amazing and shows the frantic behavior of a young child perfectly. Max Records also does a great job in this movie and he really makes his role his own. He can be very frantic but he never gets too much on your nerves.Sometimes there are scenes that are a bit random, and I also heard people complain about that, but personally I feel that this is also a part of a little kid.At first I was worried that the film would incorporate a lot of use of CGI, but I was surprised to see that the creators used a nice blend of puppetry and CGI (to animate the faces of the monsters) which gives it a very natural look and feel.While Where The Wild Things Are does not emulate the story it does a great job of portraying the mixed emotions that a child goes through. A great movie for young and old.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We have medication for this now</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I could say "Where the Wild Things Are" is a slow paced but sweet movie about family life with a hopeful ending where all sins are forgiven. I would be lying. I spent the first 20 minutes wondering if I was watching an American Family Association PSA about the dangers of single parenthood or a highly produced commercial for the newest attention deficit drug. Max, our main character is isolated with no outlet for his energy or imagination. He takes this out on his well meaning but overworked mother as well as his ambivalent older sister. His acts of bratty aggression escalates until he bites his mother. Yes, you read that correctly. I cannot imagine what would have happened if I had done that at Max's age. Once he has run away and is living among the wild things, we are treated to a long lecture from child psychology 101. Reviews are mixed and I am sure some die hard fan could write a 1000 word essay on everything I am "not getting" but I'll pass.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A weird and wonderful misfire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From a 21st century perspective, Maurice Sendak's Where the Wild Things Are (written in 1962) can be seen as one of the greatest, most illustrious kids books of the 20th century. It's hard to know how many kids of today's generation have read it. Whether you have or not doesn't matter. This latest piece by Spike Jones offers family entertainment of a bizarre and overly surreal/psychological manner, but the film never comes alive, and frankly I'm quite dubious about recommending it.The story bears some resemblance to the Wizard of Oz. Taking Dorthy's place is eight year old Max (give or take a year, it doesn't say). His parent's divorce and his lack of friends are making life hard for Max. One night after scrapping with mom, his imagination takes him away to a far away land inhabited by big furry beasts, who make him their king. It is human nature to think that the grass is greener on the other side, but it is only once you leave that you realize what you have left behind, as is the case here with Max (as it was with Dorothy)The concept of stretching a ten page book into a hundred minute movie, is hard to imagine. Spike Jone's attempt is noble but proves to be a dud. Now let me say that I am not the kind of person to tell people whether to like or dislike movies, but frankly I am a big surprised at the hype for this. Where the Wild Things Are is missing what is possibly the single biggest necessity for a fictional film; it has absolutely no story. After the expository first act which is fairly well done, Max goes to the island of Wild things but once he gets there, nothing much happens. The wild things are characterized incompetently. They are a bunch of depressed lifeless nobodies with no motives. The things are almost as lethargic as Bella and Edward in Twilight, except for when they occasionally bounce around like kangaroos and punch holes in trees for no reason. The only thing worse than the lack of story is the fact that the dialogue is terrible. There is nothing majestic or wise about the Wild things considering the fact that they talk like ordinary people and use too many catch phrases.The only part of the film that impresses me is the way the creatures are brought to life visually. After Avatar, Where the Wild Things Are may be the closest that any film of the decade has come to giving us CG creatures which look real enough to make you question whether they even are CG. The way they interact with max, you would swear they were animatronic or real animals. Such a shame that the quality of their personalities doesn't match.If looked at from a psychological perspective, Where the Wild Things are may prove valuable but as a source of family entertainment, I cannot recommend this. It lacks heart, charm, it's morals are badly presented. There's no way it should have been this disappointing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Case Study In Child Psychology</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie took me a while to figure out. It is a case study in child psychology. Max is angry because his sister didn't do anything to protect him from her friends. Although his mother says she "would have done something", Max is unsure and even more troubled by his mother's relationship to her new boyfriend. (Evidently his mother has divorced or never married. Neither is made clear.) A comment by his teacher upsets his view of the world even more. He does not feel safe or happy. He sets off on an adventure and ends up declaring himself King of a group of "troubled" monsters. He promises to keep them all together, safe and happy. Unfortunately, the promises he has made slowly begin to deteriorate as he is forced to make decisions to accommodate the personalities of each monster. He slowly realizes that the unrealistic expectations that the monsters have placed on him are the same unrealistic expectations he has placed on his mother. He realizes that he (and his mother) have limitations and that he (and the monsters) must eventually take some responsibility for their happiness and the choices that they make. At the end of the movie (as well as the book), Max returns home to his mother and the responsibilities, joys and sorrows of reality. I felt the movie nicely fleshed out the character and personalities of each "wild thing" (even giving them names), as well as giving each of us a "wild thing" to relate to in our effort to understand the people and the world around us. Once in a while the "wild rumpus" has to break forth so the "wild things" in us can let loose.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a family film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I sat down for this movie pretty much without expectations. Never having read the book or even heard of it, I was in the audience because I thought the trailer wasn't bad and because my girlfriend really wanted to see it.From the little I had heard, I thought I was going to be watching a classic children's story. Fantastic, and a little bit quirky. But as the film progressed, I added the adjectives "gritty", "indie", and finally, "dark" to the list. I left the cinema disconcerted and not quite able to make up my mind about it.My problem with this film is it doesn't seem to be able to make up its mind about what it actually wants to be. For a children's movie, I think it is too incoherent, and even disturbing. Don't get me wrong, I think children on the whole are very capable of handling "grown-up" themes and frightening or saddening images, and indeed such elements can make the difference between an entertaining children's movie and a classic. For this to work, however, you also need to provide the child with a safe framework, and this is what is lacking in Where the Wild Thing Are. Just about everything which could give the viewer (child or adult) a handle on what is going on, is left uncertain. Most importantly, there doesn't seem to be a story, a point to it all.Most of these elements would make for a great indie cult classic in a film aimed at adults - and I get the impression that this is the age group among which it has been appreciated most. However, it is marketed as a "family" film, and this I don't think it is. If you watch it with your children, prepare for them to be weirded out, frightened, upset and even bored. And don't do it to instill good taste in them either. Better then to leave them at home with a book (might I suggest, Roald Dahl?) and go watch Donnie Darko with some friends, to the greater satisfaction of both parties.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emotional Rescue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rarely has a film bristled with emotion as much as Where The Wild Things Are. From the first frames the tension is almost unbearable, as young Max responds to his crushing feelings of loneliness and dread by lashing out at a variety of animate and inanimate objects.Max Records's portrayal of his namesake is heart-rending; there are several scenes in the opening part of the film which are likely to prompt, at the very least, a lump in the viewer's throat.The tension is unrelenting throughout the film, as Max confronts his demons - literally and metaphorically - as the king of the wild things. On the island he discovers both his strengths and the limits of his power.Parents in particular will relate to the joys and challenges of dealing with an imaginative child; younger viewers will empathise with Max's predicament as a younger sibling desperate for attention, affection and validation.Not perhaps the most comfortable viewing for an audience of any age, but all the performances, and the execution of the wild things, are enormously affecting.Like the book on which it is loosely based, this film will live long in the imagination.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The perfect movie for Spike Jonze</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I unfortunately missed this film in theaters due to a busy schedule, but to my relief, I managed to sit down and watch it. I did not know what to expect from this film, for I never read the novel it is adapted from, however; I am not surprised that this was a work by Spike Jonze. Regarding the plot, it would be fair to compare it to the 2007 release of "Bridge to Terabitha". But instead of it being about two kids who create an imagination and friendship together, it is about a boy, Jake, who feels isolated and alone by his reluctant sister and workaholic mother. One night, he runs away from home, and flees into his imagination. There, he meets a group of monsters known as "the wild things" in which he becomes their king.Each of the monster characters is easily lovable both by sight and their personalities. Interestingly, each of them somehow relates to Jake. Carol, the hotheaded leader, reflects Jake's wild side, KW, represents the motherly love that Jake seeks, and even Douglas represents common sense and a conscience. Critics have argued that there is little plot that happens in Jake's imagination. I'll admit that it is just basically Jake and "the wild things" playing around and doing ridiculous things, but I still like it. The imagination is his safe spot. Anyone's personal imagination maybe considered boring, but not to that individual. The ending is predictable, he goes back home, but the ending isn't a happy one, for Jake is back in his unhappy life. When I say I'm not surprised that Spike Jonze's directed this, I mean by the type of character he depicts. In Jonze's film "Adaptation", his main character feels isolated, is lonely, and escapes to his imagination nearly to the point where fantasy becomes reality. Both "Adaptation" and "Where the Wild Things Are" explore the grim topic of human loneliness and how we try to cope with it. This movie is not a kid's show. The creatures may look cute and cuddly, but that should not fool those who haven't seen this movie. The movie makes me smile at times, but also like "Bridge to Terabitha" it made me feel sad. It's a serious story with fantasy elements, like "Pan's Labyrinth" (though not nearly as good). In regards to the technical aspects of the film, I'm thoroughly impressed. The visual effects are so good, that I can't even point out what's CGI and what isn't. The cinematography suits the film well; when something happy occurs, everything is brightly lit. When there's mystery, low-key lighting takes place. I also enjoyed the use of the hand-held camera; it helped add a sense of disorientation to the main character's perception of things. But what really helped this film was the score. It adds a surreal quality to the film as well as both a sense of joy and sadness that the main character experiences. What's very prominent in the score is the use of vocals. I found them beautiful and hair-raising. Overall, "Where the Wild Things Are" is another good movie that is right up Spike Jonze's alley though I won't buy and watch it over and over again.***/****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where are the wild things?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a brave movie: devoting 90% of the runtime to telling a story like a child would is no less than taking a risk. However, where this is pleasantly estranging at the beginning the effect wears off pretty soon. Two minutes after Max sets off in his boat it becomes apparent that we are in his fantasy world. Everything that happens thereafter is unpredictable but not surprising and the aimlessness of the story becomes slightly boring.So, although brave, to me this movie was also disappointing. It has its moments, and the costumes are beautiful, but I expected something smarter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So Natural it Feels Real</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Right from the opening scene, this movie clicked with me. Maybe this movie works on different levels. Maybe we each get something out of it. Maybe Im one of the privileged few who "gets it", or maybe I saw a bit of my childhood in Max.The opening scene sees Max building an igloo in the snow. You can hear children playing in the background, but you don't see them. His big sister has new friends, and his mom is dating. They've moved on.This opening scene was just pure magic, blink and you miss it, you fail to grasp how although there are people around, Max is alone and so begins his journey to Where the Wild Things Are.It isn't often that I walk out of the cinema in amazement, but this was a perfect movie that I could in no way criticise. The pace was never too slow or two fast, the feel of the movie was just right, and everything from the direction to the acting just made the movie feel real. This is one of those rare movies that captures a childhood in Max so accurately and naturally.This movie doesn't smack you around the head with an obtrusive music score, or wild action, out of place visual effects, sharp cuts, or strange reactionary stares from the actors. Instead Spike Jonze has created a masterpiece that will probably never get the credit it deserves. Every inch of this movie just grabs hold of you gently and pulls you in, it feels real and so it is believable.</fullReview>

Fine, I will accept WB not wanting to 'position it as a family film' but by all means take your children to see this. Spike Jonze obviously remembers very viscerally what it was like, and what it means to be a child. He renders these memories, infused with emotional depth and meaning, expertly to the screen, in a way that made me feel, and think in a way that I have not while watching a film in a long time. Congratulations and thank you to everyone involved in producing this gem. If I was a movie I would want to be Where The Wild Things Are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let the wild rumpus start!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So after a troubled production and five years which saw one version re-shot because it was too scary we hail the arrival of Spike Jonze (&amp; David Eggers) adaptation of Maurice Sendak's eight page children's classic 'Where the Wild Things Are'. For those of you unfamiliar with the book it tells the story of Max a young boy whose home life is causing him to act up, absent father, mother re-dating and everything else that growing up entails. To combat his lack of understanding of his feelings and in an effort to escape he retreats into a fantasy world inhabited by the wild things a rag tag bunch of monsters who for better of a word lack direction. On meeting Max they make him their king and in the words of the book 'Let the wild rumpus start' as they all embark on a journey of self discovery. Here obviously Jonze and Eggers have fleshed the story out to stretch it to a film but, and here's the thing, no more than your own imagination would anyway. If it seems so it's probably because Jonze's imagination is just bigger and more creative than yours or mine. The island of wild things made with a little help from the Jim Henson workshop, is a fantastical place, rolling seas, misty forests and open deserts plenty of places to run wild. But when all the fort building and mud fights are over you realise that all the wild things each have their own character flaws and Max is struggling to deal with his new family as much as his old. With each creature representing a part of Max's personality anger, insecurity, aggression, isolation etc the combination is volatile and eventually it's this he has to leave behind him when he returns home. Laced with metaphors in between the stunning sets and extended story this film should resonate with anyone who is growing or has grown up. It's funny and moving and the Karen O soundtrack fits like an over-sized hairy glove. The stars, Max being one and the wild things who are animated and emote so well that they are completely believable after spending just a few minutes with them, carry this film way beyond Jonze's twisted mind and into your own. As the tag line says 'There's one inside all of us' and who hasn't wanted to let out a primal scream when things go wrong or right? Max is for whatever reason rebelling against himself, those close to him and even the world and it takes the inner dialogue of spending time with the wild things which allows him to get perspective and push through to finding his place and moving towards adulthood. Put simply you can view this film as a fantasy with big monsters in it but equally you could read deeper into the psychological nature of the journey. But however you view the film its universal appeal will speak to all generations so let out a yowl and let the wild rumpus start.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very symbolic, but dull</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since this was an interpretative film, my interpretation is:Carol was symbolic of ambition, K.W. was symbolic of Max's mother, Judith was symbolic of sadness, Ira was symbolic of love, Douglas was symbolic of peace, The Bull was symbolic of being alone, The Owls were symbolic of logic.Carol was ambition as he created many things, but also could get very mad (he didn't understand the owls (logic) and attacked Douglas (the peace keeper)). KW was symbolic of his mother as she was able to 'shield' him against his anger (Carol), offered advice, and often her influence wasn't there. Judith was obviously sadness, as she often got upset. Ira really wasn't developed much but he loved Judith and stopped her from getting upset. Douglas was how Max felt when he was neglected, but he also came to realizations, so Douglas may instead be insight. The Bull was just a loner, needed direction from someone more outgoing, but did it out of a want to fit in (tell everyone good things). To me the owls were symbolic of logic they were well known by Maxes mother (who tried to impart them in max), were wise, and Max couldn't figure them out. The sleeping in a pile showed they were interconnected.That being said, I liked the movie, but it was a bit dull. There are many interpretations you can get out of it, but if you're like my friend who didn't see past the surface story, you wont get anything out of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Would be a truly WILD ride for kids!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll say it - I was hoping for more. I was a little disappointed. But at the same time, I hold it against myself. This is such a brave film and I fully support it and the way it came out.The movie starts out really strong was an incredible opening sequence introducing us to the films strongest feature, new child actor MAX RECORDS. What a name, dude! The entire first segment when Max is still at home, somehow managed to be the best part of the film for me - he was just such a wild little guy and it was rad watching the troublemaker be himself.Surprisingly, I was pretty bored during the entire central body of the movie - basically 3/4 of it - the entire time that Max is with the wild things and "things are good". For one thing, Max lost a lot of his appeal when he started holding his true personality back in order to get along with the Wild Things. Clearly, it was necessary for the story but it was just disappointing to me when he was so entertaining in the first part of the film. Surprisingly, the voice acting, the wild things, and the dialogue just didn't do too much for me - there was nothing wrong with it, but I was only entertained at a mediocre level.Fortunately the visual aspect is enough to make the film worthwhile. However they created the Wild Things, it was the best way they possibly could have done it. Reminds me of the book 100% and it's so relieving to have a break from all that CGI bullshit movies are over saturated with these days.I did highly enjoy the scenes where they made you wonder if Max should actually feel safe around the Wild Things - or if they really do like to eat little children!!! That was unexpected and was probably one of the most psychologically interesting twists I have seen in a kids movie in some time. The very last segment in the Wild Things world was pretty intense! The only part that truly entertained me :) Although I felt kind of bored throughout most of the movie, I still shed a single tear during the goodbyes. And I really do love the way the movie wraps up in the end. TOUCHING! Although I wouldn't watch the movie again on my own, I still consider it a great movie and would be AN AMAZING experience for children. Cool stuff!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Haunting ... but not at all what you think it is...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most important thing to know about this movie is that it is not a typical fantasy, monster or children's movie. In fact, kids or teens probably won't find this movie very interesting. It deals with adult themes ... not horror or scary things ... but stuff like what goes on in a troubled kid's head.I have to admit, the first 20 minutes really had me confused and disappointed. For an $80M movie, it looked pretty low budget. The opening title was badly done, the lighting was poor and the music - well, it sounded like background film music from the 70s. However, as the movie progressed, I had to let go of my preconceptions of what I wanted it to be and watch the movie for what it was. Then, as I started to get into the head of the problem child, I started to 'get' the movie and become more interested.The most amazing thing about this movie are the visual designs and effects. The creatures and their movements and interactions were just phenomenal to watch. Instead of looking like giant puppets or costumes, they seemed real and alive. I'm sure this movie is going to have an influence on the future 'monster' design.If you had the book as child (it's really just a picture book) and were haunted by the images, this movie won't disappoint. However, if you're looking for a cool fantasy-like story, you won't find it here. This is about a troubled kid working through his 'issues' in his imagination. If you're open to watching a movie about that, it's pretty darn interesting.</fullReview>

However, it is made very well, which makes the sadness even more hard hitting. It ruined my day. Are there any movies of children books that make good movies? I can't think of any.

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. With Adaptation and Being John Malkovich under his belt, writer/director Spike Jonze has clearly proved he doesn't see the world the same as most of us. He was the perfect choice to bring Maurice Sendak's popular children's book to the big screen.Just as Max has to fill in the blanks in his life, so did Mr. Jonze. With only a few pages of text and pictures to work with, the blanks were massive. As kids, we all create our own imaginary world of perfection ... where we are king of everything. We see ourselves the way we wish others saw us. In the story, Max brags about his power and accomplishments and that leads to his being named king. Because the other thing we always seek is a great, trustworthy leader who can make things better. The political overtones are unmistakable.What makes this adaptation work is the look and feel of Max's world. The "beasts" are wild enough to be from a child's mind, but simple enough to be believable. It is heartbreaking to discover that all the battles he faced in his rocky home life are also on full display in his perfect world.The best voices are provided by James Gandolfini as Carol - the split personality brute/cuddly teddy bear who wants so much to trust Max and have this perfect family that all get along. Catherine O'Hara as Judith is the doubter in the group. She has been disappointed many times before and just doesn't want to get her hopes up again. Would have liked a bit more out of Lauren Ambrose as KW. The role could have been even more poignant.I am not clear how this kid's book became such a non-kid's film, but Jonze has delivered a commentary on power, family and authority. Kids may appreciate the fantastic look of Max's world, but they will likely be bored with the interpersonal aspects. Last point, Mr. Jonze has once again used the perfect music to compliment his fine film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"a piercingly honest film, with a reverberant beauty gracing both its visual aesthetics and narrative movements"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where the Wild Things Are is Spike Jonze's ode to childhood. Specifically, it focuses on the confusing, mercurial, and powerful emotions that command us as children when we haven't been forced or trained or taught to master them yet. In that sense, it is a piercingly honest film, with a reverberant beauty gracing both its visual aesthetics and narrative movements.Before diving into the film's potent storytelling successes, I feel a brief mention must be made about its technical achievements. The creatures in WTWTA are beautifully crafted and lushly realized. The visual effects work done to animate their faces is stellar, to say the least. Jonze's team really brought the monsters to life with a convincing mix of physical size and dynamic expressions. It's important to note this because since so much of the movie is centered around them ? and Max's usually very physical interactions with them ? filling them in with entirely CG characters or failing to allow them to adequately express themselves would have been damning to the film. The movie wouldn't have worked otherwise. Nailing this one aspect has gone a long way towards allowing the inherent poignancy of the film to shine through.Jonze and co-writer Dave Eggers have done a masterful job turning Maurice Sendak's ten-sentence book into a feature length film that stays true to the spirit of the original. The book dealt chiefly with how to cope with anger and, appropriately enough, left a lot up to the imagination in its characterization of Max. Jonze and Eggers examine an entire spectrum of emotions and have fleshed Max and the Wild Things out into full and vibrant characters. They've also expanded the story to include a myriad of intricacies, finding organic ways to examine how emotions affect us. One of the smartest decisions they made, though, was to not actively try to provide us with answers. Rather, much like growing up, we are given experiences and made to feel the subtle pulsations of each moment. Any conclusions we come away with are our own, and for that, the film is deeply affecting.The movie is impressive for the complexities weaved into its folds, but also dazzling in its simplicity. On the surface, it is about a boy who journeys to a strange land, spends some time with the locals, then heads home. And the Wild Things aren't extremely complicated creatures. For the most part, they wear their hearts on their sleeves and speak what's on their minds. They're children. But there are also layers and layers of details that enrich the story and characters. Max's mother's boyfriend, the interpersonal dynamics of the Wild Things, the recurrence of specific phrases and emotional responses, the metaphors for growing up ? all of these elements are ripe for further consideration and study. But all of these things that are happening at different levels aren't force fed to us. The film is very straightforward in its storytelling, focusing its energy on crafting a tale about characters who feel powerfully and don't know how to tame those feelings. It's a story about anger and fear and happiness and love. The basic stuff. And because its subject is so basic, the film becomes that much more meaningful, moving in a way anyone can understand.WTWTA works because it is about childhood. This enables it to make small moments feel terribly big, and to be sentimental in the purest form. It perfectly captures the often unexplainable ways we feel, and does it with ease. It's brilliant in the way that it depicts something so recognizable yet still so difficult to articulate. The film is a journey through tangled emotions and unchecked exuberance, and it embodies these qualities itself. Like growing up, it is filled with ups and downs, brattiness and learning to know better, making friends and loving them, and playing and fighting and trying to make a world when the real one isn't good enough. It's sweet and bitter, sad and uplifting; tinged with a streak of nostalgia for a time when the big things were simple and the simple things were big. It is an outlandish yet romantic vision of childhood, and one that anyone who has ever been a child ? or a wild thing ? should experience.-reviewed by Ryan on cinemaverytasty.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Firstly, I've got to share the same sentiment with another reviewer, who stated that intelligent people generally liked this film, whilst ignorant people on the whole did not.My evidence is in the articulate responses of the former against the badly punctuated posts of the latter.Further, I also believe that those who fully understand the meaning of the word nostalgic will benefit most from seeing this movie.Fair enough, it is short, almost plot-less, and it does aim it's arrow between demographics.It is, however, a very simple story, told with flights of wild fantasy and tones of menace, all set to a rootsy indie soundtrack. I believe this is exactly what it was intended to be.Life-affirming.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining, and heart-warming story for ages 10 and up.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a very curious thing that those great chunky ¬Harry Potter novels can be so masterfully brought to the screen, yet there are so many stumbles and slip-ups when adapting those simple Dr Seuss classics.The vast supply of sub-plots the larger books provide make it easier for filmmakers as they simply have to choose the elements they wish to keep. This choice is usually quite obvious, and very rarely does the adaptation end up a failure.Picture books, however, give very little however lively they are, and the writers feel the need to make their own contribution to the tale. Though most often what is added swamps what was originally there, killing the spirit of the story and bringing the film to shame for bearing its title.It seems that it is harder to than to expand summarise.'Where the Wild Things Are' is the first example of success in this difficult task. Ultimately, it is nothing more or less than Maurice Sendak's ingenious tale, and leaves one feeling immensely satisfied this way. To turn the book into a feature film, it has been embellished, not merely extended.Effectively truthful, dark, edgy and faithful, this remarkable achievement from director Spike Jonze ? surely now a marquee name ? perfectly captures the world of a child.Young Max (the incredible, show-stealing, endlessly talented Max Records) may at first come across as bitter, nasty, violent and out of control, but only because this side of children is too often hidden in film's and therefore the realism is rather confronting. Max also has a very active imagination, and to him most things are larger than life. He is certainly not evil, just a little boy, and one you find instantly likable.Interestingly enough, the "Wild Things" are like children themselves, just great big ones. This is so despite some of them looking old, wise and grey-haired.Their design is incredible. It is a huge relief that we were spared of the lazy, cheap, ridiculous-looking CGI, and instead witness some of the best puppetry since the legendary Jim Henson. Their individual personalities and appearances are very intriguing and make them easily distinguishable. The most memorable of the lot are: KW (voiced by Lauren Ambrose) a quirky, good-natured soul who immediately has a liking for Max; Carol (voiced by James Gandolfini) who becomes the closest to Max, but also the most distant, and is the one most similar to our hero; the grumpy Judith (voiced by Catherine O'Hara) who softens at the end along with the others; and of course the well-meaning Alexander (voiced by Paul Dano) who no one ever seems to listen to.It is also very refreshing to not have everything laid down in front of you in cold hard fact. Questions such as "Did he really go to the island, or was it a dream?" will inevitably be raised, though won't be answered, leaving the audience to happily decide for themselves.The story and script are incredibly bizarre, though after a while you stop laughing and begin to feel empathy and understanding as you enter the mysterious world of our characters. It is certainly not your everyday story, just a chain of entertaining and heart-warming events.Other co-stars include Catherine Keener, Chris Cooper and Forest Whitaker.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The essential film to watch before you die.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Films do not usually show children and their spectrum of emotions at all, and when they do, they do not do it well. But here is Where The Wild Things Are, a film that is not afraid to ring true to childhood and a film that shows children as how they really are- sometimes flawed, sometimes angry, but they are to be heard. The film does not have a certain important plot point, and instead it plays out the way many of our childhoods have played out, very different at times, sometimes fun, sometimes sad, but always interesting and always something to admire in it. Spike Jonze has truly created something very special. He is not afraid to make a film that features a child, not as a naive, innocent young boy, but like a real human, and he captures the darkness and confusion that Max goes through. The film will bore children for sure, but once those children grow up and truly see this film, they will admire and appreciate it. The film's tone is uneven at times, but that was an interesting point to the film. Sometimes, in real life, things happen that balance out the scale of our life, and whether we like it or not, it will always happen. The most interesting films are the ones that have flaws, and from those flaws, we learn from them. That is how I view Where The Wild Things are, and Iit is a truly special film. It is the most touching film of 2009 so far, and one to embrace.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The West Georgian review of Where The Wild Things Are</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Hey King! What's your first order of business? Let the wild rumpus start!" In a Spike Jonze adaptation, the veteran director/producer/writer interprets his unique vision of the timeless classic about a boy and his vivid imagination.Nearly 50 years ago, the cult classic in children's literature was released by author and illustrator Maurice Sendak who put all his trust in Jonze for the film and after seeing the final cut commented that he has "never seen a movie that looked or felt like this." I too, can say the same.Jonze has been helping with films since the early 90s including such titles like Being John Malkovich, Synecdoche, New York, and The Jackass series amid a handful of respectable skateboarding films and music projects with bands like Bjork, Weezer and R.E.M. It's no wonder when I give the best soundtrack of the year to Wild Things.Spikes ex girlfriend Karen O, singer for the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, wrote the soundtrack to the film which is a step in a different direction from her previous band. Her sound now has a much more cinematic feel, using a funny mixture of beautiful piano jumbled up in a rambunctious group of singing kids filling in the gaps. A quick side note though; I would highly recommend seeing the film before listening to the soundtrack to get the best experience.Max, a young boy who imagines a world full of enormous stuffed animals, is ironically played by a young boy named Max Records who's only other work before this was a small role in The Brothers Bloom. Like the story, the majority of the film still relies in Max's incredible imagination as he "invents" enormous beasts, goats, bulls, and unknown species in his mind while trying to make them all happy as their newly appointed king.What the book can't offer in the original 10-sentence story that the 111-page screenplay can is the complexity of getting inside of Max's head. And after auditioning over a thousand kids for Max's part, one should go in with as high of expectations as they so choose.Even if Max just a young boy, the viewer realizes this is all in his imagination but, what may be harder to see is that there is a direct connection between his fantasy mind and his real mind which many of the younger viewers might have a hard time picking up on.The symbolism throughout the film made it that much easier for me to get into the fantasy world that Max created which would make it a great film for both kids and adults. The "wild things" became more than just figments of his imagination and carried a true message of love and loss that many "real" films have a much harder time pulling off.The unique blend of CGI and 10- foot-tall costumes made this film into a genre almost of it's own. Each of the beasts had a very unique and important role to the film which consisted equally of hilarious comedy and heartfelt sincerity. Some of these voices included James Gandolfini, Paul Dano, Catherine O'Hara and Forest Whitaker.Catherine Keener (Into the Wild, An American Crime) plays Max's mother, and I for one, have never seen her in a film that hasn't proved to be anything but exceptional and the same applies for this one.Among the producers, Tom Hanks and Maurice Sendak both provided their own two cents to the film making it one-of-a-kind. Where the Wild Things Are comes highly recommended and is currently in theaters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story is about 11 year old Max(Max Records) who imagines a world of being wild and beyond, but in reality he feels very much alone, and also feels ignored by his mother(Caterine Keener) and sister. One night after an angry dispute with his mother. Max runs away, he finds a boat, and sets sail, he comes across an island. When he sets foot on the island. He finds it is populated by 8 foot tall creatures. When they discover Max is there, the creatures want to eat him, but max tells them, they can't cause he is a king, soon after that the creatures nominate him as there ruler.I really enjoyed this film. Maurice Sendaks book was brought to the big screen brilliantly. It will make you feel like your a kid again reading the book. The creatures where done with such perfection, well voiced by James Gandolfini, Lauren Ambrose, Chris Cooper, Catherine O'Hara, and Paul Dano. Max Records is next best child actor. Like I said it will make you feel like a kid again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is nothing short of amazing. As the film progressed, I found myself looking back on the memories of having the book read to me as a child. The film manages to capture the magic contained in the book and elaborate on it. The movie really made you feel like you were looking at the world through Max's eyes. It was almost like watching a world within a world. I found myself overcome with emotion by the time those credits showed up on the big screen. That's a special experience in itself.Just about every aspect of the film is enjoyable. They really did a fantastic job stretching a ten sentence story into an hour and a half film. The writing is fairly superb as the pacing really flows once the ball gets rolling and the dialogue seems like it's straight out of the mind of a young boy. Max Records couldn't fit the Max role more perfectly. His range of emotion and the way he's able to have that look of innocence in his eyes is spectacular. Every action that Max made just felt so heartfelt.The wild things are what really steal the show. The way they were pulled off just makes them look so realistic. Jim Henson's Creature Shop did a really phenomenal job on them. Despite the wild things being unhappy the majority of the film, it's really just a joy to watch them walk, move, talk, or smile.As extravagant and imaginative as the film is, it did seem to have one flaw. The beginning of the film seemed to drag a bit. Everything leading up to Max finding the wild things just seemed to last a little too long. I realize they did all that they could with the source material and their efforts are extraordinary given how short that material is, but from a film critic's standpoint the beginning of the film dragged slightly.Where the Wild Things Are is one of the most heartwarming and whimsical experiences at the theater I've ever had the pleasure of sitting through. If you read the book when you were younger, then this film will really hit home. You won't want it to end. You'll want King Max and the wild things to continue sleeping in a pile, having wild rumpuses, engaging in wars, building those glorious forts, and having Max stay there forever. I highly recommend seeing this wonderful film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Travel to Where The Wild Things Are</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once Spike Jonze unlocked the secret that the monsters are emotions and Max's journey is his struggle to rule those emotions, the pithy, haiku-like prose of the classic children's book all swim into focus and make wonderful sense.This film is the opposite of "dark" in that Sendak, Jonze and Eggers have shone a light on the feelings and emotions many children feel in the situations they experience growing up. (bullying, betrayal, divorce, jealously, loneliness, the shifting sands of familial bonds). Not a "Disneyfied"(tm) confection, the Wild Things filmmakers have treated children with respect by trusting that they, like Max, may not like facing their big hairy emotions, but they do not need to be eaten up by them, either. Not trite. Universal.Where The Wild Things Are presents a fantastic allegory which may help the many Maxes of this world find comfort as they navigate their own way across those "treacherous waters". One can safely say the film is as good as the book, without fear of damning with faint praise. Also, like the book, it is a wonderful gift to children.I'm sure we have a modern masterpiece and a touchstone many many children will treasure for years and perhaps generations to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superb movie marred by the Shaky Cam treatment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the first trailer that I saw, I had a feeling that this would be a great movie. As each succeeding trailer upped the ante, I became more and more sure. When I walked into the theater and saw children and grown men in Max's wolf costume or Max's crown, I knew that I wasn't the only person to feel this way. By a few minutes into the movie, I knew that I was right, and that this was a great movie.This is simply a great movie no matter how you quantify it. The casting is superb. Each and every character is well cast and believable - the voicing, costuming and CGI work of for the Wild Things included. I was particularly impressed with the acting work of Max Records, who was just absolutely perfect as Max and who not only carried the movie, but portrayed what it is like to suffer from emotional disturbances with absolute perfection. In addition, the location and sets enhance the final product immeasurably as does the superb voice acting and the soundtrack.My only complaint with this movie is the Shaky Cam treatment. I'm not someone who is affected by motion sickness to any extreme, but there were several times during the movie that I just had to close my eyes and breathe deeply. Like any spice, too much Shaky Cam can ruin a product. For myself, I wish there was a law against using more than a few moments of Shaky Cam per movie.I will definitely see this movie again just as soon as my stomach recovers from Shaky Cam because this movie is destined to be a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spike got it just right.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An imaginative and energetic boy longs for both freedom of expression and belonging in his family. The pursuit of the former, however, often inhibits the latter. He struggles to find acceptable ways to express himself. As he wrestles to understand his emotions and his place, he creates his own fantasy world, one steeped in his conflicting emotions and desires. Max finds freedom, acceptance, and power, but his crown is unwieldy.The director, Spike Jonze, does not present a page for page recreation of the original book, finding the appropriate number of minutes for each page to add up to the 100 minute movie. The exact story of the book has already been made in the best possible way. The film may seem to diverge from the book, but Maurice Sendak himself has expressed his approval. Jonze, with the help of writer Dave Eggers, the young and gifted Max Records, and several very talented voice actors, dives into the world of the book and swims around. Who might these wild things be? What is their community? The book leaves these answers up to the reader's imagination, and so, appropriately, Mr. Jonze has shared his own. It may not be yours, but his world is full of humor, fun, danger, turmoil, sadness, joy and wonder.This film is as dangerous for children as the wild things are, perhaps even as dangerous as childhood is. It's hard to say whether children will enjoy the movie. The film, like the original book, is more accurately described as about children rather than for children. Though both works feature now familiar conventions of children's storytelling (fantasy, imagination, escape, play), each uses these conventions to tell a layered story. Though Max's time with the wild things features a new look at the characters and their time spent together, with a lightly defined story arch, this series of thoughtful, poignant, sometimes troubling moments reflects accurately the progression of childhood play and fantasy, an almost dreamlike state. The film is not what some expect, so perhaps it is best to enter without expectation.Perhaps children may not fully understand the film, but they are also not able to fully understand themselves. Spike Jonze did not aim for the broadest possible appeal, and I think the film is better, and more honest for it.</fullReview>

There is more social stress and verbal conflict than action.One things that is done very well is the way the monsters were presented. It is easy to get past the fact that they are giant hairy beast, because they act just like we do.There are a few (random) comedic scenes that keep this movie from being a downer all the time, but the mix of happiness and sadness is about the same as in a real child's life. There are depressing things that are true to life that are not excluded from this movie. I didn't cry, but I felt far from bubbly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, I'm not sure where to start with this. Firstly, if you're a parent bringing young children, I would reconsider. There's just not much here for kids. I went with my wife, our 8 year old son, and our 11 year old daughter and her friend. The overall mood, tone, and look of the movie are all dark. I'm perfectly fine with having a kids movie that's not all sappy and doesn't necessarily have a moral or lesson. But this is just brooding and meandering. When I think of Where the Wild Things are, I think of "Let the Wild Rumpus Begin!" (It is "begin" in the book, right? I thought it was odd that they said "start" in the movie.) Anyway, that's what I think of, give me some Rumpus! Well, you get about 5 minutes of Rumpus. The rest is monsters bickering and revealing their social issues. The sequel of this movie should be the therapy sessions that explain each of their problems and their sources.As far as the movie being visually appealing, I'm torn about that. The CGI is terrific. Visually, the movie is dark and Garey like the book is, so I'll give them points for recreating the look of the book well. The costumes are well done. I did find that I was constantly wondering if the projection was out of focus in many sections though. It did become distracting to me. I'm not sure if it was our theater or what.Let's talk about plot. The short of it is, the book does not have much of a plot, and the movie stuck to that. Usually, when a movie is made out of material that is short, more is added to the story to be able to carry it for 90 minutes. They simply didn't do that. I thought the beginning was well done setting up Max's sad view of his life, but it carried on just a bit too long. I found myself thinking? OK, I get it, the kid feels lonely, let's get to the Rumpus! We get to the island, and surprise, there's not just monsters, these monsters are complex and unhappy. I think a previous reviewer hit the nail on the head, it's the Breakfast Club with Monsters, well said! You have a quick Rumpus, a well done done dirtball fight containing one moment of levity, and outside of that, it's a lot of wondering if something very bad is going to happen to Max. The tone always made me feel that Max was in danger from the very beginning. I kept thinking, nothing REALLY bad can happen, this is a children's book. The tone, the look, and the soundtrack kept a dark ominous feeling. I found it to be WAAAAYYY too much. I was waiting for some sort of storyline to develop, something out of a child's imagination. It was just conflict and darkness. It goes on and on, really meandering, and then as if the writer looked at his watch, it was time for Max to leave. He left, went home, saw mom, hugged mom, the end.I just thought it was too ominous and dark for too long. It definitely seemed self-indulgent to me. "Look, I can take a story and keep it dark and menacing even if it was a children's book!" Congratulations, you did that. That would make an interesting 20 minute featurette, but it carries on way too long here without any payoff. My 8 year old didn't like it at all, and my 11 year old daughter and her friend said it was OK. As an adult, the book was entertaining and the movie was not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see "Where the Wild Things Are" and really wanted to enjoy it, after all the comments and reviews I'd read. I had to leave about 40 minutes into the movie, because much of that portion seemed to have been shot Handi-Cam style, with jiggling and movement of the frame; in a theater where your entire field of vision is a 60-ft screen bouncing around to simulate you being inside the character's point of view, anyone prone to motion sickness is going to get sick. (Blair Witch Project, Cloverfield, etc.) We asked for our money back, and I will not watch this film until it comes out on Netflix or cable. If there had been more steadicam shots, dolly shots, tradition non-moving framing, I could have enjoyed the whole thing.

		<shortDescription>Classic trailer, not a classic movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(NOTE: I did not grow up with this book. I never read it before the movie. I think this was made for the people who did.) I was prepared to love this movie. I had seen the trailer a hundred times. I distinctly remember seeing it for the first time, and feeling goosebumps. Unfortunately, the impact of the film itself did not match up to that.Now, don't get me wrong. WTWTA will definitely make you smile. The beginning was just gold. Spike Jonze did capture the essence of childhood in the first few minutes. And Max Records was just an excellent little actor. I delighted in the first act.As the story progressed, once Max finds the Wild Things, the momentum just comes to a halt. Shots and scenes start repeating. So it's playful silliness and a bit of tension, and that's it. There's no real conflict. That's the main problem. Sure, some Wild Things have problems. They get angry... but there's no real resolution. The story did pick up once they started fighting. I was SHOCKED when Carol ripped out that one guy's arm. Now I'm actually interested in seeing that original darker version if there really is one.I also had problems with some of the dialog. At first, I'd keep reminding myself that it was all in a kid's perspective... But it wasn't enough to justify its silliness. (The Fall did that effectively) And "You're out of control!" just killed it for me.On the technical aspect, I thought the cinematography was sub-par. I understand the use of hand-held, but it went a bit overboard. There were also a handful of out-of-focus shots.Lastly, the soundtrack. I found Karen O a bit distracting. Like there would parts when she would scream, and I would think it was one of the characters making that sound. The music cues were all over the place as well. It felt like a long series of music videos.In conclusion, this movie could have been great. It had all the right elements. Its source material has capture the hearts of a good number of people. It dealt with some powerful issues - the devastation of divorce, rejection, insecurity, etc. Unfortunately, it just didn't pack that extra punch. It could have connected with me in such a deep way, but it just didn't.I enjoyed the movie, but as a huge Spike Jonze fan, I was quite let down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, the positives. The film is generally beautifully rendered, and the acting is fine. Arcade Fire's music is nice, and fits the movie's tone pretty well. Now, for the rest: if you like the idea of infusing a sweet, magical children's story with a heavy dose of pop psychological backstory, complete with tired plot contrivances (beleaguered single mother, ignored child, etc.), you might like this one. I didn't, and found the film oddly unmoving. At times, the "wild things" act in a way that a child might well imagine, and at other times, they act in ways only an adult could possibly dream up. And, in the final analysis, I just didn't much care. I went home and pulled the book out and reread it, rediscovering its sweet-but-scary charm. Hopefully, this team won't take on "Goodnight Moon" next (why was the quiet old lady whispering hush? And what is the hidden meaning of the cow jumping over the moon?).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE (2009)While I mildly enjoyed this movie, I felt that director Spike Jonze played it entirely too safe. To me, he could have really gone one of two ways when making the film. The first of which would be to go completely dark and create a movie aimed at adults, which would probably frighten most young children. The second way would be to create a true family/kids movie, but this would probably scare away the coveted young adult demographic.He instead played it straight down the middle, creating a film that unfolds like a cinematic identity crisis. Huge fans of the book might love it, but I'm not sure Jonze is truly going to connect with any particular group of viewers.Newcomer Max Records stars as Max, a mischievous young boy whose igloo is destroyed in the opening scene by his sister's friends. After throwing a tantrum he seeks comfort in the form of his mother, played by Catherine Keener. Unfortunately, his mom is a bit preoccupied by the presence of her boyfriend, played by the fabulous Mark Ruffalo (can you blame her?). Max then throws another fit, which ends with him biting his mother before running away.Max hops on a boat and sails out to an island where he finds a group of monsters destroying things. Max feels right at home and joins in on the fun. After a brief discussion and some ridiculous storytelling by Max, the monsters (voiced by James Gandolfini and Forest Whitaker, among others) decide to crown Max their king. Max and the monsters continue their fun for what seems like an eternity until we predictably reach the conclusion and moral of the story.For some reason, Jonze found it necessary to use shaky hand-held shots almost exclusively throughout the entire movie. Not only was this distracting and tiring, but a lot of the shots also seemed out of focus. This technique took away from the true beauty of the film, which was the visually stunning environment of the island.The overall set design and art direction was awe inspiring and the beautiful score always set just the right tone for each scene. Keener was fantastic as always, even with her limited screen time. The endless banter between the monsters was frequently entertaining enough to keep me interested amongst all of the mayhem.Perhaps I set my expectations a bit high for this movie based on the trailer and my appreciation for the director's other films (ADAPTATION and BEING JOHN MALKOVICH). It might also have something to do with the fact that I'm not a huge fan of the book, unlike much of the audience I was a part of. WATCHMEN, a film I thoroughly enjoyed, faced a similar problem with some viewers when it was released earlier this year. Either way, WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE left me unfulfilled and disappointed that an opportunity to create a masterpiece was missed.Rating: 6/10</fullReview>

My husband and I walked out after suffering through and hour and ten minutes of this trash. My husband wanted to leave after the opening scene where the kid was terrorizing his dog.....I should have listened to him...as I got a 'really bad' feeling from that scene as well!!!!!!NO CHILD could possibly follow whatever "lesson' they were trying to get across. I was having a hard time tying to figure it all out and I still don't get it.It was loaded with violence and incoherent destruction. Just what you DON'T want your small children to see. Got as far as the 'dirt clod' and then just couldn't take the violence any longer!!!!Don't know how it ends...DON'T WANT TO KNOW.....if you have to sit through that much crap to get to the silver lining then it truly isn't worth it to me.As for parents letting their children see this mess....well if your kid starts acting like a complete monster...you will know why......and you only have yourself to blame!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a mother of two, I thought the movie was distasteful. I thought there was way too much violence for the young boy to display. I also thought the creatures were rude and like everyday bullies. Like when the goat became injured no one consoled him or punished the creatures who caused the harm. What if in the real world we behaved this way? It would be chaotic. I somewhat became bored halfway towards the beginning and towards the end. The plot was stale. Like the dog we saw wandering around, and one of the creatures stated, "Don't feed it or it will follow you". Where was the dog going or was it an outcast. Overall, not a good children's movie for me, but the music was great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went in with an open mind. I came out feeling ripped off.This movie seems to scratch a very selective itch in a select demographic. Maybe the hipsters or the book enthusiast. It's definitely not for little children, as it's dark and slightly violent and "scary" for the little ones, in my opinion.I get the themes that run through the movie, I can appreciate the child's perspective, but I think this movie was one of the worst movies I've ever seen.It fails to entertain or capture my attention. When it was finally time to go, I noticed 2 people in front of me who fell asleep. I felt like some of the scenes were dragged on a little too long. And, oh yeah, is there a plot? A point for an hour and a half of this crap? Some people will say this is a 'magical' fantasy movie and that captures the essence of the book and if you don't like it, you're somehow missing the point or didn't understand the movie because a) it captures the imagination of childhood, b)the cinematography and costumes and effects were just great blah blah,... but I don't think so. I saw it as a painful experience at the theaters and I think the movie is pure crap.I can accept that people have different taste in movies and what's good or bad, but I'm assuming people will instead say that I'm missing some grand point.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie will (should) probably get an award in special effects. But that says nothing for the substance in this story or lack of. Dave Eggers is a novelist/essayist/short story writer, not a screen writer (the man just couldn't keep me interested for the duration of the film. Mr. Sendak had the right idea when keeping it around a dozen pages). This movie seems less geared towards children and more geared towards the nostalgic nautical star tattooed hipsters browsing the 80s themed Tshirt isle of Hot Topics around the globe. I can already hear the wheels creaking in the minds of those who brought us the "nightmare before Christmas" franchise. Karen O's (singer of the yeahyeahyeahs: if you're not a fan of her voice, you're going to hate this movie. She's everywhere.) moments in the spotlight were anything but subtle and it was so awkward hearing J. Gandolf's unmistakable voice on one of the monsters (who have names now). I just couldn't get the gangster out of my head.I dunno, I'm sure people are gonna love this movie more for its production aesthetic rather than its story but in the end I feel that that will act as its anchor as it falls through the cracks of general interest.This ain't no Labyrinth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really hoping to enjoy this movie and for the first hour, I did. Unfortunately where the wild things are is where character development is not. The main character, Max, remains just as selfish and cruel at the beginning of the movie as he is at the end. The society of the wild things is in just as much disarray when they are first introduced as when Max leaves them. There is no moral in this movie, no theme, no substance; just a lot of really good looking cinematography and well designed monsters but that alone can't make a movie. It needs to have a point to its existence, a message it's trying to convey and for the life of me I couldn't find one, all I could see was how horribly mean children can be. At the beginning of the movie Max is excluded by his sister and later on he does the same thing to a few of the wild things so there was ample opportunity to show him learning something about responsibility, respect, and self control yet when he returns from his adventure there is no apology to his mother or sister, just complete forgiveness towards him for all the bad things he did earlier in the day and the reward of chocolate cake. It reminded me of Coraline and how she learned absolutely nothing from her encounter with the "other world." It must be a trend in kids movies these days to have the child be right about everything and be completely forgiven for any wrongdoings on their part just because they return after they've run away. So what did I learn from this movie? If I find myself craving cake I should go around biting people and treating them badly because that seems to be the way the world works.</fullReview>

Max is very imaginative and constantly wants his mom(Catherine Keener)to exclaim her approval. One night feeling neglected, Max runs away and sails to be the king of a far-away land populated by large talking beasts. These beast offer no first impression of being dangerous. And they are very eager to allow Max to nest with them and believe he really is their new king.Whimsical fantasy geared for the youngest of viewers.

		<fullReview>So, I loved the children's book because of it's theme of overcoming fear. The monsters rolled with their eyes and showed their big long teeth and bawled at Max. But Max wasn't scared or frightened or intimidated by them. He overcome his fears and he rolled with his eyes as well and showed his teeth and bawled back at the monsters. So they were so impressed by him, they made him to their king, the king of the monsters.For me, in my childhood, this book was very important, because it dealt with the theme of "fear" and how to overcome it. While the book itself was very frighting and scary to me (the monsters and the darkness), it showed me at same time how to overcome fear and deal with it. This made this book so great for me.The movie, well, the movie deals with many things, but misses totally the theme of the book (imho). Which is, like I said before, how to overcome fear and stand up for yourself, and that you shouldn't let yourself get intimidated by others. In this movie the monsters looked indeed nearly exactly as the monsters from the book, but then used for a totally different theme (family, relationships, emotions). Fear is mentioned sometimes, but just as an excuse, it is not the main theme of this movie. At the point when the wild things are introduced, the movie tries hard to reduce their scariness at once - but I can imagine why: There was a first cut of this movie, which I heard was totally rejected because it was too scary for the test audience, and jonze had to do the whole movie again - maybe this first cut would have been the movie I wanted to see.(PS: Excuse me for my English, I'm from Germany :-) )</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where the Wild Things AreAs with most civilized worlds, our wild things are either kept heavily sedated at the zoo, or are on a stage performing in a glitzy Las Vegas magic act.Oops, apparently the title of this movie isn't a question concerning the whereabouts of our planet's fauna, but an island occupied by outlandish creatures.Ignored by his older sister and neglected by his mom (Catherine Keener), a pajama-clad Max (Max Records) runs away from home. Setting sail in a small vessel, Max eventually lands on an island inhabited by emotionally misdirected monsters that mistakenly take him for their king.Based on the popular children's book, Where the Wild Things Are is a dark and depressing exploration of the adolescent psyche that ostracizes younger viewers, but is tailor-made for hipsters with Peter Pan complexes and psych degrees. As for being the king of the monsters, it's only fun until you have to pick a queen. (Yellow Light)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a wholly realized adventure story where the clarity of vision comes from Jonze's masterful depiction of the child character's mind.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE (2009) dir. Spike Jonze, with Max Records, Catherine Keener, James Gandolfini.Spike Jonze is 40 years old, a film-maker who garnered a reputation as an existential, slightly absurd, and very meta director after his first collaboration with writer Charlie Kaufman, Being John Malkovich (1999), and the film they made three years later, Adaptation. (2002). His latest, Where the Wild Things Are, a translation of Maurice Sendak's classic eight-line picture book into film, is none of these heady things: it is a wholly realized adventure story where the clarity of vision comes from Jonze's masterful depiction of the child character's mind. All elements of film come together to convey perfectly the energy and emotion of youth, from the shaky camera to Karen O (of Yeah Yeah Yeahs) alternating gleeful whoops and cheers to mournful crooning throughout the soundtrack. Even at 40 the director still has a clear understanding of what it was to be a child.Jonze takes all the necessary liberties in Where the Wild Things Are, stretching the plot and adding characters while staying true to the core of the original story. Max (Max Records) is a good kid, want of attention, who one night throws a tantrum and is sent to his room without dinner. Instead of obeying, he runs out into the streets and the forest, to the shore and sets sail on the boat he finds there. He is caught in a storm at night, but manages to land safely on a mysterious island where he comes across a camp of arguing monsters. The one with the shaggy head, the striped torso and feathery legs (Carol, voiced by James Gandolfini), is destroying their huts while the others look on. Max joins in with the destruction, and after a tense moment where the monsters consider eating him, he convinces them that he has magical powers that will bring harmony to the group. They elect him king, and he decides to begin construction on a humongous fort. Contention arises mainly between the jealous Carol and his crush K.W., and Judith (Catherine O'Hara), who nags Max constantly. It escalates until Carol discovers that Max is not, in fact, a viking conqueror, and nor does he have magic powers; he is crushed and throws a tantrum. After talking to K.W., Max comes to appreciate his mother's position and decides that it is time to return home.The monsters in Where the Wild Things Are are all children, just like Max, even though some of them are in relationships. Each one reflects a different facet of his psyche: Carol expresses himself the way Max would; K.W. fills the role of the wise older sister; Alex is the youngest and smallest monster whom the others, his family, mostly ignore, like Max's family does to him. It feels insulting to say that Jonze's talent can be seen in the immaturity of his characters' conflicts, but it's true. Max and the monsters' emotional responses to conflicts are brilliantly authentic of children, as the rest of the film is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>dreamy and lucid, lovely and sad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following a small boy, Max, around a world fabricated by his busy mind could prove fatal for a lot of directors, but I gathered Spike Jonze could pull it off. In my mind, he has. Mind you, I've never read the books by Maurice Sendak, who wrote and illustrated "Where The Wild Things Are", published in 1963, which might be a good thing. Dave Eggers, pop-writer extraordinaire, has adapted the story for this film and has in my mind done a great job. I think the focus of the film lay in feelings rather than through special effects; as Max runs away from home and discovers a new world with strange beings in it, he takes - and is forced to - consequences from his actions. His world is that of a child's and I think the film-makers have done a terrific job in creating what I think a production-company that works from readymade solutions, e.g. Disney, would have debased completely; Max is alive, and to say the least, so are his inner worlds. I felt that a shimmer of sadness was cast over the film throughout the entire run, in a very good way. For cons, I'll say the film slumped a little in tempo during certain movements, but then again, don't our worlds regularly do just that? The cinematography was tight and dreamy, the colours reminded me of Aronovsky and the music was lovely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dysfunctional Movie Made for Adults not Kids</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is based on the children's classic book. That book had few words, lots of creativity, and was fun and simple. There's something lost in translation by Spike Jonze. Unfortunately I think Jonze totally miss the point of the book. It was written for kids. Why the movie isn't' as enjoyable as the book? The movie is confused. It's negative, dark, frightening, confusing, too adult-like in its complexities.There are some moments of playful happiness in the movie but they are short-lived. Although the acting is fine, I think Max should have been played by a more hyper, younger child...the type we see throwing a tantrum. The monsters should have been a bit wilder, yes maybe with an emotional side...the one good thing is that some of the characters were kept with simple personality. I think most of them were too complex and were more out of a Woody Allen movie instead.Cinematography according to some was excellent. It wasn't. Lots of weak shots, etc which gives it a look from the 1970s (maybe that's what Jonze wanted) but I don't think it works for a dream scape. Acting was good, script rather weak, very little plot. yes, the book has very little plot but if you are going to make your characters complex, you might as well add a bit more to the movie. Max at times when having fun seems to be forced into acting...it wasn't natural (e.g., like when he makes up a game throwing dirt) or convincing. (Which is why I suggest a slightly younger child especially in that costume). Finally direction was inconsistent.Max should have been the tantrum thrower in his imagination (not the monsters), after all he is king. The monster moaning in the end should have been used a couple times since that is a memorable moment in the book (and it wasn't convincing when Max moaned in the end).In the end, it was painful to watch at times, rarely funny or powerful moments. Mostly somewhat depressing (the book was clearly NOT depressing). But maybe Spike Jonze is a bit depressed. Movie Max didn't express anger or control of the monsters...he lost it. That's not quite in the books. In our imaginations we can control things and make them right, which helps us deal with issues/problems. The movie seems to be lost...My rating is overall 5 for adults (very average film), 2 or 3 for children. Save this movie for television with a group therapy session. Maybe good for sensitive kids at least 12 years old. I wouldn't recommend it for under 12.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where The Wild Things Are is based on one of my favorite books of all time. By the standards of today's films, I was not expecting it to complete follow the book. When I heard about it, I was in between the fence on expecting to love or hate it. I've read a lot of rave about it, and I thought it just wasn't that good. The film features an annoying version of the book's classic misfit Max. In the book, they manage to make Max a brat, but we could also see a lot of sweetness in him. The main flaw of the film is that it did not follow that part in particular. They make him an annoying little brat, but there's no real sweetness behind him in the film. The film's monsters are well done, but the film juggles too much between sadness and humor. The film did succeed in a section where I thought the amazingly over hyped District 9 failed. District 9's aliens were all one character, and they had everything in common with each other. Where The Wild Things Are's monsters have different feelings, emotions, and characteristics. The main point I am trying to get to is that Where The Wild Things Are is a mediocre film, but it is a mediocre film with a lot of good stuff. Unfortunately, in this case, the bad outweighs the good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Max (Max Records) is having troubles at home. His parents have divorced, mother (Catherine Keener) has a new beau (Mark Ruffalo) and his older sister and her friends ruin his nifty igloo. So, he puts on his wolf suit and creates havoc, just as mother is getting dinner for the crew. After a tongue-lashing, Max runs out into the night, steps into a boat, and travels to a far-away, tropical island "where the wild things are". Monsters there include the temperamental Carol (James Gandolfini), the kindly Ira (Forest Whitaker) and his catty gal, Judith (Catherine O'Hara), among others. Max, as in Maurice Sendak's classic book on which the movie is based, leads everyone on a wild rumpus of swinging through the jungle. Then, after Carol shows him a "model village" that he has made in a cave near the desert, Max convinces everyone to create a new series of homes for them all, where they can end up sleeping closely together at night. But, tempers flare, especially between Carol and the sweet K.C. Will this new housing plan succeed and will Max want to remain with the monsters forever? First, let me state that Sendak's book is now and, always will be, a classic in children's literature. It is truly an imaginative story where kids get the chance to "act wild", if they choose, and turn the tables on the adults who run, ahem, the world. But, to me, this film is just not magical and it pains me to try and figure out why. The monsters themselves, are marvelous, taken right from the books illustrations and very life-like. Also, Records is absolutely wonderful as the main human character and the other actors, including those voicing the monsters, are also great. Therefore, in my opinion, it is the direction and, especially, the cinematography, that is greatly lacking. The film just does not have a good pace, nor good editing, and the photography is downright horrible, resulting in a movie that looks like an afterschool special on a tight budget. Faulty, also, is the decision to include some violent behavior, especially by Carol, and the overall "dark" tone of the film. This one is rather scary and the littlest ones, who embrace the book's monsters and conquer their own fears, will be afraid, my view. In the world of children's films, there is no real reason not to see the movie, if an older child wishes to go out for an afternoon of entertainment. But, don't expect anyone to "go wild" over WTWTA, the movie.</fullReview>

The beginning was very well done, as was the scene of him running from his home. (The brief comment by the mom's gentleman suitor was pat and ridiculous.) His arrival on the island was suitably taut. And the end suitably emotional. But in between? My oh my, what a slog. When you expand nine sentences of story text into a full-length motion picture, I guess this is what you get. And because Spike J. is considered edgy and avant-garde, he gets a pass when "lesser" directors would be panned.Let's pretend Nora Ephron directed. Watch the reviews then.</fullReview>

But I found my self bored with this film. The world of the wild things was not as interesting a sit looks, it's actually rather boring. I found myself looking at the clock waiting for it to be over. There are a lot of flaws with this films story and character development and the lessons learned. A film that deals with this type of material in a much better way is the film Coraline a far superior film. That being said there is some good here, it appears that WB Studio let Jonze keep his vision because this is in no way a feel good child's movie. The puppet suits and facial effects are very good and give the wild things a sense of being there rather than using CGI. The voice work of the Monsters is amazing all the Monsters bring it here not one bad performance. The main character Max is actually good too.

It has been years since I've read the book, but I felt that I didn't need to. Some things were different than in the book. Max is a young kid with a lot of energy and enjoys fantasy. When his mom or sister won't play with him, he throws a fit and runs away. He comes to an island run by the 'wild things' Max tries to act like them and they make him their king. They build a huge fort, but when K.W. brings her friends to the fort, Carol doesn't like them, so he becomes mad at Max and tries to eat him. Will Max ever get back home?

(and with "The Science of sleep" it was probed how much you need an excellent writer). "Where the wild things are" has a lot of the great visuals we can look forward with Jonze but the main issue -at least for me- is the casting, I can't stand that little boy and I could never feel compelled to root for him, he's just not charming at all and I could not feel sorry for him ever. I think it would have been better if we didn't know that much about him until the end of the movie so we could focus on his relationship with the wonderful creatures that make the movie get better after the first 30 minutes...and even later the pace gets lost. I agree that the o'hara and ambrose steal the spotlight big time.Other thing...I can't believe the impressive resume Paul Dano is building little by little.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Obviously a Matter of Intellect Here...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mild Spoiler.After reading numerous reviews, I have come to a simple conclusion: Intelligent people love this movie. Ignorant people hate it.It's easy to see why. Finally, we have a movie that doesn't cater to preconceived notions of what "good" film making is. Personally, I find it refreshing to see a story in which the "hero" is not out to save the world, and the "bad guy" is not a readily definable Disney Villain.In real life, none of us will personally save the world, and likewise, we'll probably never face a Disney Villain- our enemy will almost always be ourselves. WtWTA does a brilliant job of reminding us of this, and I think it does an excellent job of translating that truth to a great many people.The most important scene in this movie contains no dialog. It comes on the heels of Carol's violent outburst, after he's settled down, and Max has come out of hiding to confront him.It is here when Max, the true Wild Thing, comes to realize the turmoil his wild behavior is capable of causing. You can see that Max wants to chastise Carol for his behavior, and this is why the film is so important.Children cannot always be Told to behave. They cannot always be Told how to act. Sometimes, they need to be Shown WHY and HOW. That is the purpose of this story. Just like in the book, Max overcomes the need to be Wild, and decides to go home, where he can be safe, and where there will be people who love him. I cannot express my appreciation enough for this film. When the DVD is released, millions of neglectful parents will buy this film and drop their children in front of it, most without bothering to watch the film themselves. I see it happen with every children's movie that comes out. I believe that amid all of the wish-fulfillment and plucky heroism found in Disney movies, this film will provide a wonderful juxtapose for children who need a healthy dose of respect.Furthermore, this story works well for more than just children. Each of the Wild Things are facets of Max's psyche. Judith and KW do a wonderful job of capturing the dark and light aspects of his view towards his mother and sister- Judith being the miserable yet painfully honest, and KW being the caring yet flighty. The fodder for reflection and meditation is abundant.I'm amused at how many people are saying that the Things aren't Wild, that they are merely sad and depressed. Why does the word Wild need to translate as Wacky or Zany? This is my greatest area of contention with the reviews I've been reading. I've heard less about the bird getting his arm ripped off than I have about how depressed people felt when leaving the theater.As for the bird- well, that was pretty shocking, but no more shocking than watching Obi Wan lop off the one guy's arm in the first Star Wars movie. (Part IV: ANH for the sticklers.) At least the bird leaked sand instead of spewing blood all over the place.All in all, I think this is a great movie for children- especially those who already have anger issues. Some have called it an indictment of single parents, but I think Max could be anybody. For the sake of having a story, they simply colored it this way. My only let down was rather small. I too had hoped for a room- transformation sequence, but now that I think about it, such a sequence would have been shallow lip service. I think a little disorientation was necessary to keep the story moving, and to be frank, we don't live in the sixties anymore. Delving into one's psyche these days through such a sequence would have been overwhelmingly Hollywood, and any discerning movie goer would have simply ticked the scene off of the checklist of scenes they were expecting to see.In conclusion, if you hated this movie, the director has on a very basic level succeeded. Watch it again, and put yourself in Max's shoes. Even if you were a well-behaved and sweetly innocent child, you've still had days where you've wanted to do something horrible. The next time you watch this and begin to feel depressed, maybe it's time that you climbed into your own boat and left your Wild Things behind. Max sure looked happy enough to leave his. That's where the uplifting part lies. That island, Where the Wild Things Are is never the place we ought to be, so insisting that the entirety of this movie cater to such a fantasy frolic completely misses the original point of the book.And oh yes, the giant shaggy dog in the desert was simply Max's own dog. It was undoubtedly meant to serve as confirmation that the entire story is taking place in Max's head.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where the Wild Things Are: A Delightful Mixture of Drama, Comedy, and Darkness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many were the reasons that I was quite excited to see Where the Wild Things Are in development. Spike Jonze at the helm, James Gandolfini and Lauren Ambrose both voicing and, of course, the wonderful source material and the curiosity of how exactly Jonze was going to bring it to feature film length.The film tells the story of Max, a quick-to-anger kid dissatisfied with his family life and the world around him. We get the clear sense that his parents are divorced, and he is struggling to cope with this trauma in his early life. Ultimately pushed to a petulant outbreak, he runs away from home, sailing to a far away land where the wild things are.Firstly, the Wild Things themselves are fantastic. They are brought to the screen in a way which makes them extremely real, lifelike (insofar as possible for such strange creatures), and entertaining characters. The facial expressions are particularly wonderful, adding to the depth and emotional range of the Wild Things, which we soon discover to be physical manifestations of Max's family as seen through his eyes. The plot unfolds with Max proclaiming himself King and attempting to lead the Wild Things to happy and fulfilling coexistence. A delightful mixture of drama, comedy, and darkness, Where the Wild Things Are is near flawless in its implementation. We find ourselves immersed in the mind of a child, and in the games of the Wild Things. We are made to laugh as they play, cry as they fight, and tremble as they argue. The painful struggle as they, and Max, deal with their emotions and the less happy things in life, brings a beautiful majesty to the film, completely drawing us into the world of the Wild Things (itself mesmeric). Max Records is incredible as the young Max, a performance boasting enormous talent. Gandolfini's Carol is a heartbreakingly infuriating yet simultaneously lovable character that will stay fresh in my mind for a long time to come. Perfectly paced, emotionally involving, and not afraid to deal with the darker side of childhood and life, Where the Wild Things Are is an unmissable film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It'll eat you up; you'll love it so</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While directors may commonly attempt to rekindle or celebrate the kind of energy or joy associated with childhood, it has proved far more elusive for them to tangibly capture a sense or feel of the mindset of childhood itself. Mercifully, Spike Jonze's Where the Wild Things Are, a perilous adaptation of Maurice Sendak's timeless and beloved children's book, proves a delightfully insightful exception. Having the daring (as well as, retrospectively, plain good sense) to not only tap into the gleefully exuberant mindset of a child, Jonze's interaction with the cinematic medium proves a multi-million equivalent of a kid playing with their toys, exploring technique, setting, narrative and characterisation with the whimsical fascination irrevocably linked to youth. As such, seldom has a film so strange, nonsensical and yet breathtakingly nostalgic and emotionally wrenching hit the multiplexes, nor has so unlikely a literary adaptation proved so compelling and inventive a triumph.It would seem Jonze has also cracked the secret to a successful cinematic literary adaptation through again delving for the essence or feel of Sendak's book much in the same way that he intrinsically captures the essence of childhood, in both cases striving for the fundamental and sensory core rather than the disposable superficials most directors would latch onto. As such, the film functions more as extension or re-translation of the source material rather than point-by-point by the numbers representation, with each (necessarily) added element or plot point feeling so entirely appropriate and in keeping with the delightfully irreverent spirit of the book that even the most seasoned readers turned watchers are likely to object to their addition. With astonishingly inventive set and prop design, Jonze crafts a realm that is utterly alien and yet inevitably speaks to the deep-seated child in any viewer. Similarly, by use of practical character costumes from Jim Henson studios rather than conventionally opting for CGI characters, the Wild Things stunningly come alive with much more bounce, crinkle and credible presence, feeling all the more real through their wilful aesthetic falsities. The captivatingly adorable musical score by Carter Burwell and Karen O perfectly rounds up the bizarre yet lovable package, assembling a delightful selection of melodies which prove appropriately beaming and young-at-heart without wallowing in excessive 'indie cutesiness'.In fact, with all the visual and auditory magnificence on display, seemingly tailor-made to enthral an audience young or old, it is easy to forget just how serious Jonze's film can be for a story involving interactions between enormous furry creatures and a boy in a suit of wolf pyjamas. Rather than delivering a straightforward hymn to the exuberance of childhood, Jonze again abstains from the easiest path by devoting a substantial portion of the film's focus to the angst, uncertainty, fear, sadness and existentialism of childhood, as represented through the clashes and conflicts between the (clearly symbolic) Wild Things as facets of Max's personality. It is on this front that Jonze's film achieves both its strongest, most resonant chord, but simultaneously one of its few stumbles ? through managing to evoke the desperate concerns and issues inevitably plaguing a child's mind, Jonze's film runs the risk of feeling lopsided or sidetracking itself, flitting chaotically between chaotic energy and joy and pouting, self-reflexive moping. As such, while the film appears ultimately designed for an older audience, giving them the opportunity to retrospectively make sense of the emotional turmoil plaguing their own minds at a younger age, it would take a younger audience to intrinsically understand the film at face value, running the risk of potentially dividing the focus between audiences old enough to not be scared or alienated by the film, or those too old to not commit to its wilful silliness and exuberance.Perhaps the film's greatest boon is Jonze's discovery of (spectacularly named) young star Max Records as infamous wolf-suit clad troublemaker Max. Records displays incredible charisma, emotional range and a welcome nasty streak, making Max, far from the stereotypical cutesy Hollywood child, feel like a real, fleshed out person, complete with contradictions, ambiguities and genuine aching heart. Supporting him, Catherine Keener is similarly daringly ambiguous yet equally human as Max's mother, managing to shine and thankfully skirt cliché in her few scenes. Mark Ruffalo also manages to entertain in a single scene as her vacuous boyfriend. But it is the astonishing humanity of the Wild Things which really come across as the most resonant characters apart from Max, the highlights being James Gandolfini's booming tones impressively conveying child-like rage and fear; Paul Dano fittingly vocalizing childhood alienation and yearning to fit in; Chris Cooper's calm voice essaying the piercing sense, logic and analytical cunning of a kid, and Lauren Ambrose capably ascribing a voice to childhood impulsiveness while simultaneously reflection and wisdom, each crafting heartwarmingly and tragically real and memorable characters in their own rights.Easily outdoing almost any other contemporary literary adaptations, films about childhood or films period, Jonze's Where the Wild Things Are beautifully mirrors the poignancy, beauty and scampish sense of fun of Sendak's book while proving a masterful piece of cinema in its own right. For any viewers attempting to either understand or re-capture their inner child, or simply enjoy a fun yet bittersweet cinematic romp, Jonze's bravely strange and commendably unique film delivers an almost peerless offering. Those uninitiated should waste no time in letting the wild rumpus start, as its bold concoction is highly unlikely to disappoint.-9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A definite film of the year contender!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally got the opportunity to see Spike Jonze's adaptation of the classic children's book by Maurice Sendak and I can honestly say that it is one of the most emotionally captivating films I have ever seen. Max is a misunderstood child who's mother has started seeing a new boyfriend and his reaction to this is with some attention-seeking behaviour. When a family argument causes him to run away, Max creates a world where not only is he loved by all, but he is the king. He sails to a small island in his boat and discovers a world that allows him to express his emotions in his own way. He meets large furry creatures Carol, KW, Ira and several others who initially see him as food, but after claiming to be a king, they decide to make him their ruler. The way Max interacts with the creatures is incredible, and their plights explain his own feelings of loneliness, despair and misunderstanding with everything going on in the world. It is a clever way of physically manifesting a child's fears and Jonze has done a remarkable job in making this emotionally effective. You feel instantly attached to Max because of his struggles and the same goes for the creatures. Their plight is mirrored in Max's emotions and the viewer is drawn into the world created by Max's imagination.The resolution of the film is very clever in creating a way for Max to settle his issues in real life by settling the creature's issues with each other and I applaud Spike Jonze for not only transferring a well-loved book to the big screen, but for turning it into one of the most incredible journey's of self discovery, love and companionship.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Where the Wild Things Are' is a classic children's story by Maurice Sendak that won the 1964 Caldecott Medal as the "Most Distinguished Picture Book of the Year." In the story a child is sent to bed without any supper and sails off to a magical land in his imagination, a forest full of big wild fat creatures who accept him as their king.The movie version, directed by Spoke Jonze ('Being John Malkovich,' 'Adaptation'), is a strange film, not least because it's 101 minutes long and based on a book containing only ten sentences (Dave Eggers helped Jonze do his expanded version). The Wild Things are a "dysfunctional" group. That's the word used in an interview by Max Records, the adorable and very bright actor who plays the boy, who was ten during the shoot. The look of Where the Wild Things Are is special, even in an era of much experimentation in technique and in animating and simulating fantasies. Here, a real boy moves among a group of giant sized doll-like creatures, which are real people in fat suits.THE WOLF SUIT: When Max runs away in the movie (he doesn't go to bed; he finds a boat and sails off) to escape being punished because he has bitten his mother (Catherine Keener -- who looks like him) he is wearing a "wolf suit," a wooly pullover with ears, a tail and big whiskers. Maybe it helps him hide from the Wild Things that he's just a boy. According to Records, there were something like 57 suits used, with different amounts of dirt on them.THE CHILD'S WORLD: The beauty of the film is that before the fantasy begins it thoroughly enters into the world of the boy, who is playing alone in the snow. A bunch of neighborhood kids come and he starts a snowball fight with them and has tons of fun, till they all pile onto his igloo and smash it and him. Then he cries. Never before has a movie shown so well the aloneness and sorrow of a child whose play is ruined.THE VISION: Jonze's genius comes through in the DIY quality of the special effects -- the more remarkable in a film that cost a hundred million dollars. It may not in fact have been easy to construct giant animatronic animal fat suits and have people moving them around in a forest, but they look not like some Pixar wizardry but a bunch of big dolls pushed (well, independently moving, but pushed by a child's imagination) here and there (with CGI added for their facial expressions). At the same time they talk (with the voices of Paul Dano, Forest Whitaker, Chris Cooper, James Gandolfini, and Lauren Ambrose) and have expressions, but the boy, Max, is there among them, always looking much more real than they do. Many shots are dark and crowded with the big forms of the creatures, and the camera is mostly hand-held and jumpy -- a note of realism in fantasy land that is most welcome. To make fantasy real is important. To make it look unlike any other film fantasy is remarkable. Many of the shots of Max among the Wild Things -- Carol, Alexander, Judith, The Bull, Ira, Douglas, KW, and The Goat -- are dark, almost blurry, because they're seen from the point of view of Max, the boy, who's dwarfed and engulfed by them. Thus by breaking all the rules of framing and clear presentation Jonze and his DP Lance Accord have given the film a unique look and feel, a child's-eye view of a dream world that's exciting and fun, yet also dark and scary.But in their invention of the Wild Things as what Variety's senior reviewer Todd McCarthy calls "middle-aged urban kibitzers, vaguely complainy and neurotic," the filmmakers have, as McCarthy puts it, "defanged" the situation, even though this "is a choice with some wit behind it." Their ordinariness (within the extraordinary, fantastic place Max has entered) makes them cuddly and appealing even though they're giants and could crush Max and are said to have eaten all previous kings who've come their way. It's an original choice, but one that's not quite justified by Sendak's story (though Sendak loves the movie) and also one that removes some of the magic of a child's adventure. And it's also true that the seventy-odd minutes of time Max spends on the island are a lot of random galumphing around, without much suspense or drive. Nonetheless it all gives one the feel of being in a child's world: kids kind of like galumphing around, and they have attention spans that are intense but brief.THE DYSFUNCTIONALITY: This is, after all, a lugubrious journey for Max. He may enjoy being a king, but he reigns over a bunch of fussy old fools. The Wild Things are children acting like adults. They're also adults acting like children. Either way, it can be rather a bore at times. This may not matter to the very small children who watched the film when I did, because it's still an adventure. It's still a small boy in a strange land triumphing over adversity, and what's not to like about that? You just wouldn't want to spend much time with these critters. For me over an hour was too long, but it does end.Finally Jonze does a fine job, with his whole band behind him, not least the wonderful Max Records, who, while he may have the mind of a 30-year-old in real life as somebody said, still knows very well how to be a 10-year-old child, and when he woofs like a dog or throws big clods of dirt, these are the most joyous and spontaneous moments in any movie this year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Greatest Films I've Ever Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As everyone knows, its really hard for a decent film to be made these days, but, lately, 2009 has given us a load of excellent films. To name a few: District 9 and Star Trek. This film is up with those as the best of 2009, and possibly one of the bests altogether.The film is basically seen from the point of view of a child, through the camera movements, actions, so forth. It really reminds us what it was like to be an eight year old child growing up. Do you remember how you thought of the world when you were a child? There were no morals. No code. You just lived. The film really captures the true nature of childhood. And the casting of Max Records as Max was a wise move, and Records really has a good career ahead of him in the future.Now, the monsters. The monsters were spectacular and are each a different characteristic of Max. They are lonely, sad, etc, and they elect Max as their king in an effort to get rid of their pain. Now, the monsters are amazing, through a blend of costumes, puppetry and digital effects, and they can sometimes be incredibly frightening, especially when one goes on a rampage.Is this movie for kids? No. At least not for kids under seven, at least. Some sequences are very brutal and intense, and the presence of the monsters might scare a few. This is an grown up movie with grown up situations. If films like this are made more often in the future, then we're in for a wonderful future.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jackass the movie, part 2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seriously, "Where the wild things are" is without any competition the most dark, depressing, sad and disturbing children's movie I've ever seen. Actually, it's more disturbing than any of the 100 or so horror movies I've seen in the last year! Because it's real horror! The real horror being that you probably have crying kids after this who'll be as gloomy as the movie is grey and dusty. You'll have kids who wonder why everybody in the movie is so mean all the time and who'll wonder why you let them see it. No normal kid will find this to be in any way uplifting, positive or fun. In stead it's going to be a traumatic experience that will just suck the life right out of their little hearts! If you want your kids to enjoy this story, stick with the book. I remember that to be a lot more fun and interesting plus that you can spend some quality time reading it to them.But this is not all... I have to add that a lot of scenes in the movie started to make sense once I saw who had directed/written it. If you're someone who enjoys or enjoyed "Jackass" then you'll probably love this movie. You will even "understand" it. It *IS* 50% Jackass, the same stupid, lobotomised violent games and attitude some call fun. That director has with this title ended up on my permanent ban list, since he seems not to know where to draw the line, where to maybe not go with his particular brand of "fun". But I guess to come up with something like Jackass you have to be somewhat disturbed in the first place, so how this movie turned out doesn't really surprise me. I only wonder, if he makes a romantic film, are the protagonists going to clobber each other in the heads with giant dildos, squirt random people with whipped cream and expose themselves to children, for cheap laughs?More than likely...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dear Reader, The same people who gave "Coraline" the OK for 6 year old children in Switzerland were apparently in charge of "Where the Wild Things Are" as well. Just like Coraline, Wild Things is psychologically terrifying for young children. No blood. No guts. Not much physical violence. But explicit things are rarely the scariest. It's the implicit things that dig in and wreak havoc with your mind. Small children do not have the tools yet to deal with such psychological burdens. Loneliness. Abandonment. Despair. Angst. Sure these are all situations we all must deal with eventually. But do you want to expose a 10-year-old to this intentionally? If you do not, then do not inflict "Where the Wild Things Are" on your children.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a great movie that I absolutely hated.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Story: Sometimes a movie comes along that I despise but I also recognize is a legitimately good movie. This is an example of that, so is Monster. This is the story of a little brat who throws major temper tantrums when things don't go exactly his way. When his mom ignores him while entertaining a male guest the kid acts the absolute spawn of hell and when his mother looses her temper with him, he runs away into an imaginary land where wild creatures live. I must compliment the writers for going beyond the book and mapping out a world that a child would imagine. A.Acting: The acting was pretty good. The kid always made me believe that he was seeing these creatures and this world. The voices all fit the monsters perfectly and Catherine Keener did an excellent job as Max's mother.Visuals: This movie looked awesome. The use of mostly practical effects with only minimal amounts of digital effects really assisted the overall product. As is standard with any story designed for kids, it contains a significant amount of traumatizing material, my favorites being when Carol rips off another monster's arm and it says, "Carol, that was my favorite arm!" leading them to replace it with a stick. The other being where Max hides in Judith's mouth from Carol. Tell me that isn't nightmare fuel! A Sound: The music really fit this movie and so did the sound. Not much more to say. A Overall: Understand that my hatred for this movie stems from my hatred for the kid in this movie. He needed a very good flogging. Did he ever get one? No! Why the mother apologizes to him for her loosing her temper with him. The kid gets away without punishment. Thank you, Hollywood, for encouraging parents to not discipline their children, for not teaching them to obey their authority figures, for letting them know that it's okay to throw temper tantrums, for telling them that mommy and daddy are in the wrong for trying to mold you into a valued member of our society, and I want to thank you adding to the general decay of our society as kids continue to grow up with no sense of discipline or work ethic.For the record, as of this writing, I have no kids. Upon hearing my thoughts about this movie and my general thoughts on child raising, my sister has threatened to steal any children that I may ever have away from me so that they actually enjoy their childhood.

		<shortDescription>Amazing and Touching "Wild Things"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"What is wrong with you!" screams an exasperated Catherine Keener as Max's Mom. Wild Max (Max Records) goes off crossing the line biting his Mom, after an upset over her boyfriend (Mark Ruffalo). Max is not having a great day. Loner Max has his igloo crushed by his sister Claire's (Pepita Emmerichs) friends, while he is hiding within. All he wants is to be included in Claire's life. Max's parents are divorced. Max runs away dressed in his furry wild wolf costume. He boards a sailboat on the river, and sails out to sea. He lands on an island of monsters, "Where the Wild Things Are." Director and Writer Spike Jonze ("Being John Malkovich"), and Screenwriter Dave Eggers's "Where the Wild Things Are" is amazing and surprisingly touching. "Where the Wild Things Are" is based on the beloved 1963 children's book by Maurice Sendak, who is also the Producer. The illustrated children's book is 300 plus words long. Jonze and Eggers masterfully create a 100 minute feature movie from that. I did not remember reading the book, though thumbed through the picture book as a kid. Jonze and Eggers generate from the modern broken family dynamic. On the island, Max becomes King of the Wild Things. The movie is also unexpectedly dark, particularly with the manifestation of lead monster Carol (awesome James Gandolfini). Carol seems always on the verge of postal.On the island the monsters seems reminiscent of Max's family. Compassionate K.W. (gently powerful Lauren Ambrose) maybe Max's Mom. K.W. and Max have a quiet touching conversation about family. Max confesses, "I have one of those?" I began to think that Carol (Gandolfini) represented Max's estranged father or? is he Max? K.W. and Carol had a past relationship. Hiding Max from Carol, K.W. admits that she doesn't know why Carol is so angry. In catharsis, Max says, "He's just scared?" Anger is just fear with bravado. There is a great moment where Max and Carol roar, "Roo!" Is it wild or just sadness and regret? Max just wants to have a family. Life happens, and it is not always what we want. And life goes on."Where the Wild Things Are" is visually spectacular with creatures in the forest and desert. And the cast includes the amazing voice talents of Forest Whitaker and Catherine O'Hara. "Where the Wild Things Are" is one of the best movies of the year for it's touching storytelling and eloquence, reminding us to let go our fear and that life goes on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember some things about the book from when I was younger, but not much, and it doesn't really hold any place in my heart the way it seems to with other people. The trailer still appealed to me, though. It offered some fantasy elements, a nice soundtrack, and nice visuals. Well, I was bored. The film's protagonist, a young boy named Max, throws a tantrum in his house, runs into the woods, has some sort of dream where he becomes friends with monsters, then comes back home. The end. That's about the entire plot. Nothing much happens. The film is good at evoking various emotions, but other than that it just felt empty. Some of the monsters Max befriends have relationship issues. Not sure why. They're almost immature about things, throwing their own tantrums and just being unreasonable with each other. I'm sure it's all because they're a product of Max's imagination, a tantrum-throwing child himself, but what's the point? It's like watching a movie about young children who can't play nice. Where the Wild Things Are just didn't do much for me. Oh, and no Arcade Fire in the movie, either. 4.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>i love love loved this film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this book was one of my favourites as a child. i think spike jonze did an AMAZING job with this film, and it exceeded my already high expectations. while some complain that it's not 100% true to the book, i don't really see how this matters. i was disappointed they left out his disappearing walls, but not much more than that. how can you be mad that the film strays from the book in trivial ways, when sendak absolutely loves jonze's adaptation of his book? it's rare that authors love their books made as films. the movie captures the FEEL of the book; the little details are hardly significant. everyone complains that this movie isn't for kids. i agree, it's not for some kids. but i think some parents need to grow a pair of balls. most kids LIKE to be scared. they're not going to be traumatized by a movie about an angry, emotional child. i think they probably wouldn't read so deeply into the dialogue it as parents think they might. these are the same parents that are afraid of their children watching harry potter and being exposed to witchcraft. grow up. the cinematography was incredible in this. i thought the sound effects were really awesome as well. and karen o's soundtrack was fun and very fitting. most of all, i LOVED the wild things. they all looked amazing and were very expressive, especially their eyes. i thought that carol was the best character. james gandolfini's nasally voice was PERFECT for this. he is a very conflicted character who is incredibly sensitive but has outbursts of rage, just like max. i did leave the theatre feeling a little and empty.. but i don't see that as a negative thing. i thought it was very intriguing. it's rare a movie can make me feel that way. i don't really trust the validity of anyone's opinion that didn't like this movie because it "bummed them out" and was "too dark and depressing." this movie had no resolve - i think that's what makes it so beautiful. i think it was much more meaningful that way. this story was very relatable, and really deep on many levels. i found myself bawling at the very end when max leaves and all the wild things are howling. i thought this film was very moving. it was a fun escape for me. i loved it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointingly Dull</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My daughter (now 21) wanted to see Where the Wild Things Are because she loved the book when younger, and I was happy to go with her (and pay....) but neither of us was especially bowled over. I thought the movie very attractive to look at but - I hate to admit this - I dozed off about half way through and when I woke up with a start, it didn't seem like I'd missed much. It is so slow that the struggle to stay awake was beyond me after a day at work.On the positive side, it's lovingly crafted. The puppets are stunning and it's so good to see a children's fantasy movie which isn't a cartoon. The CGI effects are seamless, the scenery ravishing (shot in South Australia I believe?) But...... there really isn't much to it. Attempts to pad out the story with psychological excuses for child hero Max's angst (missing father, busy single mother who is dating, problematic older sister etc) feel false and bolted on. Instead of a journey inside his head, we see Max run away and take off in a boat. I'm not sure why, because it would have worked perfectly well as an internal journey or dream.Will the monsters eat Max or make him king? Well, I think we know what a brief movie it would be in they ate him so..... they make him king. But the monsters' dialog is more banal than profound, and little happens. There is a heavy, ponderous feel to the whole enterprise, and little story.So, while I admire the technical skill of the puppet makers and cinematographers, I'm disappointed at the end result, and I can't imagine many young children really being enthralled. Frightened maybe? It's a movie probably aimed more at the adults who have fond memories of the book, than the kids.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has been duping critics for a couple of weeks now into believing it would be insensitive to, you know, actually criticize it.If you've read the nine-sentence book, you already know a far better story than the half-baked pointless rambling that passes for a narrative here. Basically, Max causes mischief, is exiled, travels in his imagination to where the wild things are ... except in this version the "wild things" are just a bunch overgrown neurotics, implausibly named and voiced. Max learns nothing, gains nothing, changes nothing, and neither do the wild things. Ninety-four minutes later you're back on the pavement a few dollars poorer wondering why you wasted your time. And if you brought your kids, you're wondering if they will be emotionally retarded by the experience.On the other hand, the scenery was pretty, the child actor Max was surprisingly engaging, and whoever sewed Max's wolf suit should get the Academy Award for costumes. So I'll give it 2 out of 10 instead of 1 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"It's hard to be a family."Imaginative children's films like Where the Wild Things Are can be more dramatically satisfying than adult, independent, or international films. The child-like sentiments and ideas are adult in streamlined, minimalist ways that deliver truths about humanity without compromising the joy of storytelling.Max (Max Records)) is a bratty little boy whose sister, Claire (Pepita Emmerichs), ignores him and mother (Catherine Keener) is distracted by a job and new boyfriend (Mark Ruffalo). Max creates his own world of beasties who have a surfeit of humanity, outsized animal hybrids who seem to want just what Max wants: family.As these gullible lunks accept Max and make him king, based on his heroic bragging, Max sees how difficult it is to rule in harmony when his best shots are only building a fort and inciting a clod-throwing war. The parallel to President Obama's eloquent promises and multiple delays (He can't even receive the Nobel without reservations about his underachieving) is apparent, although Maurice Sendak couldn't have known that allusion when back in 1963 he created the picture book on which the film is based. Yet JFK could have served as a reference.Just as interesting are the costume/animations, as if the creatures had stepped right out of Sendak's pages (much credit to Jim Henson Co's Creature Shop). As well as those inspired voices: for instance, James Gandolfini as Carol perfectly channels Tony Soprano's charisma into an unforgettable mass of brute and softy. However, Max Records as Max is not memorable except for an angelic face.Director Spike Jonze is the right director to take us on Sendak's imaginative ride?after all, his Adaptation and Being John Malkovich are classics of creativity and wild-ass wit. Thankfully he and Sendak don't linger on the inevitably sappy Max return to family. But then, back to family is what both Max's dreams and reality are all about.Carol: It's going to be a place where only the things you want to happen, would happen.Max: We could totally build a place like that!</fullReview>

While the creatures were interesting, I couldn't identify with the issues. We start off with a garden variety brat who seems to be living a decent life with a mother willing to sacrifice for him and his sister. He is the classic ADD kid with the big imagination. However, I would have classified him as a sociopath. He has only thoughts for himself and has an incredible streak of cruelty. When he meets the wild things, he uses their innocence to manipulate them for his own purposes. Everything comes around to his messing things up and then being sorry. Big deal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this with my 11 year old son on DVD and we both really liked it. Its a splendid children fantasy movie, though yes, some of the wild things are a little bit intimidating and this movie is not for the really young kids who might get scared. Once saw parents here in indonesia take babies to see Anaconda, but be warned! Nice concept in the movie that a naughty boy escapes into a fantasy world, a sort of mix of peter pan and narnia with the child horror effect of Gremlins. the movie had a balance and entertainment throughout, comedy, drama, nice script, something to appeal to everyone. Personally I am not familiar with the literature of this 'Maurice' guy and I am not into Harry Potter stuff but this movie should not be passed over. Glad they mixed real life with animation because an outright animation as was originally planned would surely not have been as effective.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where The Warped Things Are</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Spike Jonze succeeds in one respect with "Where The Wild Things Are," but he fails utterly in another respect. Great production designs and costuming distinguish this avant-garde film, but an abysmal plot with narrative gaps and unsavory character like the abusive, juvenile delinquent protagonist who bites his mom on the shoulder and runs away detract from the film. The main character, Max (Max Records), is an obnoxious adolescent, and he is never sent to bed for anything. The first fifteen minutes establish the dire straits that Max cruises at home with his single mom and sister. After Max takes a bite out of his mom (Catherine Keener), he lights out of the house in a pajama type fox outfit and finds a sailboat and sets sail on a turbulent ocean to an island where these monstrous half-man/half-beasts live. Max takes up with them, sleeps in a pile with them and supervises them as their king. This film is unfit for children."Where The Wild Things Are" differs in one major respect from the picture book Maurice Sendak novel. Max is sent to his room in the book after he bites his mom and his room changes into the place where the wild things live. After Max becomes the king of the wild things, he finds himself back in his room in time for his supper. Director Spike Jonze never creates a moment wherein things go from strictly literal to fantasy. He plays everything for real in this $100 million film and never signals literally when Max enters his fantasy and re-enters the real world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Screaming child of Id.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 2007 I saw this strange movie that changed my perception of both how movies targeted to children could be made, and also the ability of an artist with a good vision to adapt literature to the screen without losing the message of the original. It was called Bridge to Terabithia, and I was amazed at the way it combined realistic child characters with real-life themes that concern them, in a language that they understand without being made too simplistic or talking down to them. Bridge to Terabithia set a standard, but unfortunately it was so misadvertised and ignored that nobody knew that a new standard had been set, that children's issues dealing with real child development are now something more than "Imagination is great!" and "Love will solve anything!" and take into account the knowledge that even children have that things aren't always okay and sometimes bad things happen; that death is a part of life and that we do not live in a world where what we want is what we'll get.Spike Jonze may or may not have seen Bridge to Terabithia. However, whether he did or didn't, he still understood the message and made another film that deals with childhood as it's actually like, not childhood that is served with a cherry on top as most children's fantasy movies are. In Where the Wild Things Are, Max runs away to escape his frustration and anger at his home-life, but his home-life is no terrible situation all considering and a large part of it is simply Max trying to deal with how much attention and work his mother is able to give. He goes to an island of imagination where Wild Things are, and they make him their king, but unlike most 'parallel dimension hero journey' fantasies where the protagonist figures out the logic of the fantasy world and applies it to solve his problems in the real world, Max finds instead characters of roughly the same intelligence and maturity he has coping with the same problems he has as well, and no real answer to them are given. Indeed, just as Bridge to Terabithia reminded me strongly and painfully of what it was like to run through the forest turning tree-stumps into goblin kings, and then losing that experience with life experience in a way that I totally miss but do not want to return to, Where the Wild Things are reminded me of the thousands of times I'd sleep over at friends' houses, only to spend too much time with them the next day or something and end up getting into a huge fight over whatever and having to eventually be separated for a while. It's the dirt-clod fight you had where someone got hurt and you got angry at their hurt because you didn't mean it but now your fun is ruined. It's the time you threw rocks and eventually broke a window, only to spend an entire day fretting over the eventual punishment you were going to receive from the adults, only to punish yourself with your guilt to such a degree that by the time the adults discover it, they have nothing left to do but forgive you and give you cake so you feel better. No single sentence or moralization fixes everything, and childhood is filled as much with frustration and anger as it is with imagination and hope. This is the region of childhood where the wild things are.That is not to say that this movie is perfect. Spike Jonze's actor direction, his realization of the Wild Things, and his clear-eyed view of childhood's high and low points (and how quickly they change) are spot on, but the soundtrack does get in the way, the hand-held cinematography adds nothing, and there are a couple scenes of sentimentality that really weigh the plot down. Dave Egger's dialog and characterization is brilliant and spot-on, but at times the script doesn't seem like it's actually going anywhere. The experience of this movie becomes so much more than the whole or even the sum of its parts: the moments when you're uncomfortable in your seat, wondering if anyone will get hurt and, if not, if their feelings will, are the moments this movie becomes real. The fantasy and the storytelling are almost beside the point of the affection. Little Max is not the little kid inside that you want to escape into and run around without a care in the world, who then enters a world of maturity and comes to terms with it, he's the little brat you were who got unfairly blamed for something in the school yard and sits crying in the corner of the home room, wishing everyone would understand that you're a kid and don't understand. He's intelligent, but not wise; he's romantic, but not okay. So if you're willing to visit that dark Id of your former self, then this movie will be looking into a mirror of the primal screaming man-child inside of you. If you're looking for a fun escapist entertainment, or worse, an indie paean with great music and nostalgic characters, you might not find yourself enjoying this movie quite as well as you expect. In fact, this movie is so much better for it, but unfortunately, something tells me it's not going to end up as liked as first imagined. It seems to me it's too real for most people's expectations, as nostalgia, escapism, and childlike hope are in short supply here. After all, someday the sun will go out, if some other tragedy or catastrophe doesn't wipe us out first.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classless version of classic children's book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It would seem impossible to make a film out of a book comprised of of less than two dozen illustrations and a word count that couldn't fill a page without more padding than an insecure 14 year old at a high school dance and Spike Jonze proves it with his take on the classic children's book by Maurice Sendak, Where the Wild Things Are.Slapping a drab everyday realism on like bad siding Jonze immediately perverts the magic of the story by populating it with teens and adults. Then there is the question of his corps audience. I find it much to heavy and maudlin for a children's audience causing it to drag even for adults with too much debating and not enough "rumpus". The Wild Things are beyond cuddly and adorable I must admit and James Gandolfini gives perfect voice to the snorting wild guy Carol but overall this turkey has enough stuffing to feed the Chicago Bears and your full of it fast.In my college days my friend's and I would sit around someone's apartment listening to Procol Harum's Salty Dog passing a joint and a copy of Wild Thing around. It wasn't one particular apartment since many of my classmates took "Kitty Lit" (Children's Literature) not with kindergarten teaching aspirations but for the easy three credits it offered the unemployable English major. Whether you were a stoner or Miss Bonnie of the future everyone was taken by the boisterous simplicity of the rollicking imagery that celebrated the imagination of a rambunctious child's care free youth. This tawdry face lift to make it legitimately lengthy enough to make millions is selling out at its most literal and in doing so it removes the heart and soul of what makes the story endearing. Gee, am I a child for feeling this way?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't read the book for 13 years, and I only have a vague memory of the story and characters. I couldn't have even described them in any way, but after seeing this movie, the experience that was generated by it swept me off my feet and made me realize why Where the Wild things Are is one of the best books and movies i've ever seen. Now, I wasn't planning on seeing this film until my obsessed friend had another devious scheme to get all of our friends together (all 14 that could go), and watch it together. The simple joy of having a favorite book translated to the screen is a cautious one, (take the movie Eragon for example) you have to take the most important parts of the story and characters, and illustrate them in a way that will appeal to audience of the book. However, the book's current audience seems to be overly- protective mothers and clueless children, who simply don't get the fact that this movie translated the book perfectly, and reshaped it to be something more than a sequence of rhymes that mothers repeat over and over to their children so they will go to sleep. Neither the mother or the child is contemplating the evolution of the characters, the impact of the island both on the wild things and on Max, and the simple and joyous wonders of the experiences and sights Max becomes a part of. If a child goes, "Mommy, why were the wild things sad?". Don't blame the movie, blame the fact that the mother has gotten the child attached to a book that was never intended to be a happy and blissful time. The book was a trial for Max, and the lessons he learned from the joys and sorrows of the Wild things is what this movie is truly about. Of course, this is just the opinion of 14 actors, writers, and musicians, so we don't know what we we're talking about and all the mothers are right...Go watch this movie, and let the wild rumpus begin.</fullReview>

Judith was a cool person. Judith was popular she has a lot to say about herself. Max was cool he was cool to see what his family was like and how popular they were and his sisters guy friends were cool. I hope people will go see it.

		<shortDescription>Pure emotional brilliance, a film for any one who remembers what it's like to feel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a hard film to pin down. A fantastical, art-house masterpiece that's main focus is making you feel by reminding you of very real feelings that you may well have buried or suppressed upon growing up. It's not about a grand adventure or any easily digested moral. If you can't put your self in Max's place, warts and all, then you probably won't be able to enjoy this film on the level it's meant to be enjoyed. But if you can, wow, you'll be captivated and blown away.I imagine this being studied in child psychology classes well before film studies classes. Every beat isn't magnified to glorious effect. It's the overall product with some fairly mundane-seeming pieces that come together to make a greater whole that matters here. I'll come right out and say, this is the first film that I finally let the tears flow in since WALL-E. And surprisingly I wasn't able to hold back until the credits like I was then.There are so many little moments, almost right from the beginning, that get you in this one. From "Worried Shoes" playing during a scene that pretty much puts us right back there, lying at Mom and Dad's feet as they worry about bills or work or things we don't understand to Max racing home looking for his Mom until she finally pops around a corner and there she is, and it all feels better again.Perhaps even more powerful is the near-universal feeling and perhaps even theme of the film of wanting everything to be okay, and being powerless to make it so. I'll tell you a secret, I may be 26 but I'm just a little kid. I constantly want to rip at my hair and scream at the world when the little, stupid, everyday things go wrong and there's nothing I can do to stop those little, insignificant moments from existing. This film is cathartic for those feelings. If you're willing to let yourself get swept up in it, then those emotions can, at least for a moment, feel purged by the end of the journey.Alas, as much as this film should be left in the realm of emotion, it wouldn't be right of me to not mention the pieces that make the whole. First up is the acting, standing out most of all being young Max Records as Max. No other child actor could have pulled this off like he did, in my opinion. He's a little hellion that you strive to avoid and hope his parents have money for counseling in one instance, but still a likable, easy to relate to little guy that is basically a stand in for your inner child and all those feelings that you thought you forgot in another. Catherine Keener does an admirable job as the mother, although it's likely the least she's had to do to be brilliant in a film ever. Then again, to play the part so perfectly of *everyone's mother* might not have been as easy as I think.The voice actors were also a perfect choice. I can't think of anyone else who could've played any of these characters. While James Gandolfini does an excellent job as Carol, to me it was Lauren Ambrose as KW that really stole the show, although one could argue that's because she was the character everyone most wanted to love and be loved by. On the subject of the creatures, all I will say is they were brought to glorious glorious life by The Jim Henson Company via puppetry, guys in suits, and minimal CGI used in service of emotion rather than for trying to make something "look cool".And a quick word about the soundtrack. Maybe it's because I've listened to it on repeat for a week, but I'm not at all surprised to say that it's fantastic and fits the film perfectly. I was expecting "All is Love", "Building All is Love", or "Hideaway" to be the standout moments (and in some cases they partially were), but I'm still surprised to say "Worried Shoes" (a cover, but used so effectively) as Max lays at his mother's feet is my favorite moment musically.So, yes, this can be summed up as, "Boy runs away from home, comes back." in seven words, as the "wise" owls ask of Max when wanting to know what advice he wants. But that is as simplistic as the question he asks, "How do I make every one okay?" But like that question, it's not as simple as it first looks. The creatures are representative of emotions, from rage, to fear, heck even to feelings of inferiority. It's not a straight fantasy adventure and isn't easily digestible. Even as much as I love it I'm positive that I won't fully understand my feelings on the film until a second viewing.As a final note, I'm sure others will come to feel as I did that the best moments in the film were the build up at the beginning and the running home at the end, for pure raw emotional depth. That does not at all mean that the middle parts or the parts with the wild things were bad or lacked depth. They were much more surreal and require much more examination, however, and so it is far easier to relate to those simple real-world moments.All-in-all, a fantastic film. A reviewer on Metacritic has already stole my witticism that I'd most love to use about the film, so I will simply be quoting her: "I'd eat it up, I love it so."PS: This really doesn't feel like an adaptation. Jonze has taken Maurice Sendak's charge to make it his own to heart. But it still feels very much like the book came to life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not to bad at all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well the first thing that comes to mind when recalling Where the wild things was how endearing the film was. The film looked like a 150 million dollar blockbuster but it only coasted around 80 million. Visually stunning and the music throughout the film was fantastic. My only problems with the film may have been the pacing and the editing, the emotion of the characters changes with every scene change and the characters continuity suffers because of it. James Gandolfini plays the main wild thing Carol, his voice acting was quite surprising, he's known for his tough characters but Carol is quite the opposite. Max our main character was superbly cast as well as the rest of the actors in the film. The screenplay may have been a little convoluted but in the end this was simply a film I couldn't hate. Being a fan of the book I'm so happy it's been brought to the big screen, and Spike Jones did a tremendous job. Now it may not be as good as the trailer makes you think it will be but very few movies are these days. Now this may be a film aimed at a younger audience but I couldn't help but be entranced by this mini masterpiece. I hope the rest of the world can embrace the positives and forget the negatives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unarguably the best film of 2009, as well as one the the best I have ever seen. . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Caution, May Contain Spoilers* Where the Wild Things Are is the first movie in which I had laughed, cried, grew angry, and even gotten a LITTLE scared in a whole movie. Never have I experienced emotions such as this than in any other movie. It is true, though, that Where the Wild Things Are is NOT for kids under the age of 10.The movie starts with Max (Max Records) chasing his dog through his house holding a fork. At first I could have sworn that his intentions were to actually kill the poor thing, but he didn't. We see Max next building an igloo. He is trying to get his sister's attention but she won't listen to him and soon there after her friends destroy his little snow fort and send Max running into his house crying without saying sorry or doing anything about it. Later on in the beginning Max's mom (Catherine Keener) ignores Max while she is with her new boyfriend. Max goes a little crazy and bites her mom and runs away into the city streets and off into a patch of forest where he finds a boat and sails to where the wild things are. There he discovers huge harry creatures (Carol, KW, Ira, Judith, Douglas, Alexander, and a big black bull whom is unnamed) who befriend Max because he claims to be a "king". Soon Max is plunged into a fantastic journey that is pack full of emotions just like I stated earlier.Where the Wild Things Are is unarguably the film of 2009 as well as one of the best movies I have ever seen. Spike Jones has put a lot of work into making the 9 sentence book into a full length movie and he succeeded. The movie is a deeply moving tale of coming to grips with emotions and connecting with the people we love. Max had to learn that on his own. And we have the benefit of Max's great adventure to learn from.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1972, at Spring meadows autumn heights elementary school, when I was in the second grade, It was a stormy day, It was raining cats and dogs. I remember there was a tornado warning on the radio and it was very bloodcurdling! Our class was invited into the library, and I was very overwrought! Then we all gathered in the circle and the library teacher came out to tell us a story. I couldn't wait! The story was about monsters! Which is something I normally wouldn't be allowed to listen to, because my mother was very strict about anything that was violent and a story about monsters sounded very vehement, but my mother wasn't present.When the teacher started reading I had shivers running down my spinal cord. She read the first sentence, then suddenly we heard this noise, so we looked out the window and there stood a walloping tornado in front of my eyes. The teacher quickly escorted the kids down stairs into the cellar, but somehow she forgot about me. I was starring out the window and when I stopped looking, I notice nobody was in the room. And then the lights started flickering and one light detonated and crashed and fell on top of me. As I fell down with my clothes on fire I stopped and rolled across the floor. Then suddenly the window shattered into pieces. And I expeditiously flew out the window and curved and I busted through another window into the next room of the school. After the storm passed they found me in a janitor's closet rolled up in a ball sucking my thumb. Then they rushed to a hospital. That experience traumatized me until this very day.And now 30 years later. Late night I was surfing the web checking out the new movies, I passed through some really good movies, like Hannah Montana, and Dragonball, and then I saw "Where the wild things are" I was like that sound familiar and clicked on the thumbnail and the gazed upon the pictures of the movie and this overwhelming fear came over me. As was clicking the next button I saw the horrifying image the little kid in the white cat costume I raced to the next picture the dreadful look of the piliferous, pubescent, flocculent, hairy creature and right there a literally fell out of my brand new Raynor Ergohuman leather chair and keeled over and fainted. As my roommate, which has been my friend all most 5 years now found me fainted and sent me to the ER.After I was revived by the doctor, everyone told me that I should face my fear and watch the movie as soon as it comes out. Then one night my roommate(I was not apart of this)illegally downloaded the movie and tricked me into watching it, as I thought we were going to watch the breakfast club, As soon as the movie started it brought back horrible memories, I tried to run but the door was locked and the window was glued down. I started yelling so loud the neighbors called the police, and they busted the door down. As my roommate tried to convinced that there was nothing wrong, the cop busted him for downloading the movie illegally. I have yet not to watch the movie, and my roommate hasn't spoken to me since the incident, all this pain and suffering just from a stupid book.Then 2 weeks later I finally brought myself to watch the movie. The copy of the movie was still in the DVD player. As I watched it during the night with my blinds shut and my lights off I turned my TV on and started watching it. After the movie was over it really wasn't that horrible. It was okay.I hope every who reads this comment will understand my fear and pain and my broken relationship with my roommate, and hope this will be helpful to some people... thanks for reading!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting, but didn't capture my childhood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watched it at a screening event with high hopes, left very disappointed. It was plain, simple, didn't pull me into the movie, I couldn't relate at all with Max, and had a very vague ending, and quite a few flubbs throughout the movie with who max is. Well, I'm still trying to figure out who he is, why what happened happened, and what the heck was up with the ending. I was hoping for it to grab my attention and throw me into a world of childhood dreams... and It literally felt like I was forcing myself to watch the movie.Great for kids who don't know the book, bad for people who grew off of the story back when.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Several things...(most of them words)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's almost a truism that better screenplays come from adaptations of short stories and not novels. Spike Jonze's "Where the Wild Things Are" is more or less based on a long paragraph from a beloved children's book where the illustrations are what stir the imagination.Blowing that "paragraph" into a gorgeous to behold, beautifully shot feature length film can't really be compared to its source other than: Is the spirit of the original captured? Jonze succeeds there, but the "filler" is so glaringly added (both with the jargon and syntax of today's youth which will date it; "big downer," for instance) and meant to lecture that it all quickly begins to feel like a Sunday/Hebrew school lesson, and, boy, I started to squirm.This is no fault of the lead character, however. Max Records (as Max) is so acutely attuned to his role and the camera that it's one of the few remarkable performances by a child on film. And the movie held me until?the fake fur arrives.I can see how placing these creatures in reality would appeal to creators of a film version, but it all stopped when the Henson "muppets" arrive. They all look like Snuffleupagus' dubious offspring. Worse, every time James Gandolfini spoke dubbing one creature, I was thrown right out of the film. Using such familiar voices?Tony Soprano no less?was a serious miscalculation. And for a book with only 300 or so words in total, we pass that mark in the film after about 10 minutes. Then the characters talk and talk and talk. The only successful sequence for me was when they were busy building a fort and the action took over all the talk.The long delayed release acknowledges the problems with the movie. It's too bad because had there been a screenplay that didn't sound like a series of actor's improvisations of "what lessons I learned as a child" perhaps this would have been the enchanting story everyone hoped (like "Peter Pan" which has its own set of terrors). This review approximates the total number of words in Sendak's original "Where the Wild Things Are."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where the Wild Things Are (PG, 1:41) ? Borderline, 2nd string, originalOK, let me get this out of the way right off the bat. Young Max Records plays Max, the hero of this kid's adventure tale. There's something about his mouth, especially when he's smiling or laffing, that reminds me uncannily of the young Jodie Foster. This immediately predisposed me to like the kid and expect to enjoy his performance.For the most part, I did exactly that.Max comes from a broken home. In his bedroom is a globe, a gift from his dad, with a metal plate on it that identifies Max as the owner of this world. But Max has little control even over his own small world. (Here I quibble with the choice of director Spike Jonze to show Max's figure filling the screen when he's by himself; it would have been more effective to show him as smaller than his surroundings ? kid-sized ? in the early going.) His older sister ignores him; when he starts a good-natured snowball fight with some of her friends, then dives inside his snow fort for protection, they jump on it and bring it down around his ears; later, disconsolate, he watches from the shadows as his mom flirts with her new boyfriend, a stranger to Max and a rival for his mother's affections.This is about when he goes a little nuts and starts acting out, seeking attention. He gets it, of course, but it's the wrong kind. "Max, what is WRONG with you?", his mom wants to know. At this, Max takes off running out of the house, and this is where the movie starts qualifying for my "borderline" category. This is the label I slap on a movie that might be SF or fantasy if viewed one way, but just regular fiction if seen from a different perspective.The fantasy version (and the most kid-friendly one) says that Max really does run down to the shore, swipe a sailboat, voyage for several days across the ocean, find a large, isolated island populated by huge shaggy creatures, become their king, and have some adventures before finally sailing back home. The realistic view says that all this happens only in Max's imagination, as he tries to sort out his feelings. From this perspective, which the adults in the audience will probably recognize, all the creatures are allegories for aspects of Max's personality and milieu.There's Carol, the big, grumpy critter that likes to smash things, the embodiment of Max's loneliness and neediness. Douglas is the loyal, helpful sidekick. KW is the nurturer, but she's drawing away from the tribe, preferring to hang out with her new pals, the owls Bob and Terry, who are supposed to be wise, except that Max can't understand a thing they say. And, of course, there's the little goat-headed guy who sighs "Nobody ever listens to me.".There really isn't much plot or dialog beyond a boy doing boy-adventure kinds of things, building forts and such out of sticks, whooping and tumbling, monkey piling, being happy and sad within minutes, getting really grubby, and trying to sort out his place in the world.They do a fine job of this.Recommended for kids and anyone who's ever been one.ADDENDUM (following day): I noticed that another reviewer said that Wild Things was good, but it's no Bridge to Terabithia ? a very high standard, which hardly ANY movie can meet. Terabithia was a masterpiece, simply one of the best films I've seen this decade. Last year I snaffled up all the used copies that my local video store was unloading and handed them out as holiday presents. Every single recipient had missed the movie in the theaters and thanked me profusely for insisting that they HAD to see it. It is the gold standard for a kid's movie that speaks even more profoundly to the adults. Blessings upon whoever invented DVDs; it's still not too late to see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is for disturbed adults who had a difficult childhood. NOT FOR CHILDREN.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a movie for children. It is for disturbed adults who had a difficult childhood. I will guess the the makers of this movie do not have children. It does'not even follow the book. In the book the kid is sent to his room. In the movie he runs away. Now my kids will at temp to run away every time there is a disagreement. The movie had too much violence, stepping on people, swinging branches at people and laughing. What an insensitive story. Another example of some people on Hollywood are out of touch with many varieties of families and can only relate to their dysfunctional upbringing. It is just a marketing ploy to trick families into bringing there whole family. I would rather just watch the trailer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not your typical friendly child like family movie, but it could of been done better!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based off one of the most popular and beloved children's books of all time, director Spike Jonze brings the tale to life in Where the Wild Things Are. The movie starts off with a lonely boy named Max whose life isn't so perfect, until he runs away from home and befriends strange looking monster-like creatures named Carol, KW, Judith, Douglas, Alexander, Ira and and then of course is The Bull.Now you may think that this is the kind of movie that you would take your kids to enjoy and have a good time, but that's where you're wrong. When I went to go watch this movie today, I was hoping to expect it regularly, but then there was more than what meets the eye. It's been a long time since I truly remember reading or looking at the book as a young kid, but in my own defense, I thought it was too strong to be PG-rated kids tale.There will be scenes that you may or may not enjoy, but from the beginning to end, you may realize that this movie is not for little ones (That's how I saw it when I watched it at the movie theaters) Max was too bratty in the movie and Carol's character development and angry issues were too scary. If you're an adult like me, then you may want to go see this by yourself without taking younger children with you, unless you have kids that act out too much, then you would be able to understand the deep detail.The story may or may have been kinda rushed for being a 1 hour and 34 minute film, but I did felt like there was something missing to the picture soon after it was done and finished at the end. It's not the kind of movie that I would want to watch again and it will leave you thinking with mixed signals and confusing feelings about the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where The Wild Things Aren't</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Totally fubared version of the Sendak children's classic. Bad boy Max Records {that name sounds like a mega music store chain} runs away to a place in his imagination peopled by strange creatures. That is the problem with this movie. There is NO imagination. The story is slight, whatever message the book had is totally lost on screen and the creatures are very unconvincing. They look like refugees from a Thanksgiving parade and inspire more giggles and laughs than awe. Every scene seems out of focus and director Jonze shows no sense of direction{pun intended} or clarity. Even though the hype is designed to scare children, it will never happen. Kids will see right through it and adults who get stuck taking their kids to see it will probably become bored.A classic example of a "family film" that falls flat on its face. The producers of this mess better pray that it is a hit. If not, all the ineviatable merchandising products will never sell. There is really no reason for you to waste your money on this film. Read the book-it's 100 times better than the movie, and the real message of the story will become clear. For once, I would like to see Hollywood make a family movie that is not dark, overloaded with special effects, has a real story, remain faithful to its source, be entertaining and be able to be enjoyed by the whole family, but I guess thats like asking a bear to -hit on a toilet.My vote-one star.</fullReview>
