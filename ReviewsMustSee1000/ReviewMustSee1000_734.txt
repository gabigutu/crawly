		<shortDescription>Pure action and Tommy Lee Jones make this an unforgettable masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arnold and Sly are great action heroes. Their characters are always larger than life. Rambo and Rocky are household names and The Terminator and films like Commando are great partly because of Arnold's physical presence. But as good as they are, I don't think they can hold a candle to Harrison Ford. Sure he is in great shape, but have you ever seen an actor take average guys and make them so real that you want to know them? Take your pick, Han Solo, Indy and even his character in Six Days and Seven Nights was an adventurer. Add Richard Kimble to that list. As Kimble, Ford is perfect. He is the wronged man that has to avenge his wife's death and clear his name at the same time. He is so great in this film and I'm sure that's why so many people went to see this film at first. But I think what kept them coming back was Tommy Lee Jones. We'll get to him in a minute.Andrew Davis proved here that he is one of the best action directors in the business today. Along with Under Siege, he showed us that he is an efficient artist that knows how to keep the action flowing. He never seems to let up with his relentless pursuit of the perfect scene. But since the film did so well and everyone pretty much knows what it is about, let's talk about the true strength of the film, and that would be Tommy Lee Jones." I don't bargain." " Well that's odd!"His portrayal of Samuel Girard is an exercise in how to make the audience relate and understand a character. He starts off as a manic perfectionist. He is obsessed with capturing Kimble and that is all that matters. But as the film proceeds, you can sense his unease, his wonder and his ethos. You can tell by a simple expression that he is beginning to solve a crime and not just chase a criminal. And the turning point to me was his simple scene where he says " You know Devlin and McGregor made 4 and one half billion dollars last year? That company's a monster. " It is all in his face. He knows that Ford is innocent but he still has a job to do. It is Jones that makes this film so much fun. And I didn't think that there would be a more worthy recipient of best supporting actor in '93 than Kilmer in Tombstone, but Jones' work here was well deserving of his Oscar.The Fugitive belongs on every top 100 list and if the AFI wasn't so enthralled with older movies, they would see that films like this are more worthy than some of the mediocrity that graces their findings. This is an incredible film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best action movies of the decade; Ford and Jones are in top form.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nothing is more thrilling to see than two characters with superior intelligences, pitting their wits against each other. A thriller does not require a great deal of plot or techno-babble to be involving or complex, although many distributors of blockbusters today seem to think so. For these reasons, "The Fugitive" is a huge blessing for a movie critic such as I. I was just thrilled by the excitement, the performances by Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones, and the whole Hitchcockian aura that this sensational film delivered. Even though we have been seeing too many films based on television series come out lately, "The Fugitive" is certainly not one of those that we can add to that routine bushel.Ford is Dr. Richard Kimble, a vascular surgeon who is wrongfully accused for the brutal murder of his wife (Sela Ward), and therefore sentenced to be executed. After escaping from a bus crash/trash collision, he finds himself running from the Chicago police and especially the U.S. Marshall service, led by Lt. Gerard (Oscar-winner Tommy Lee Jones). At the same time, Kimble attempts to prove his innocence and in turn discover who did kill his wife. What ensues is a tangled web of medical conspiracies, along with a search for a notorious "one-armed man." As I have stated, this is a simple plot that requires no superficial decoration.Ford, who has always been a less dramatic presence in movies and more of a subtle but affected persona, fits the part of Kimble perfectly. With this role, the last thing required is a melodramatic actor that sticks out like a sore thumb. Ford casually settles into the role of the man on the run, bringing intelligence and style to a less ostentatious character. Jones, who has never really been considered a headliner until now, creates a character that is extremely humorous but also calmly diligent. His only goal is to carry out the task he is assigned to, and nothing will stand in his way, least of all a rivaling police force or Richard Kimble himself. One of the fascinating Hitchcockian elements of the film is how it allows its audience to not be able to take sides. We are constantly rooting for both Ford and Jones when either of them come into perspective. We familiarize with both of them and are amused by both equally. The film's finale, which I won't dare give away, satisfies both sides of this rooting coin.I have not previously been a fan of the director Andrew Davis's work, but with this entry, he certainly has sparked my interest. With such films as "Under Siege," "Code of Silence," and "Above the Law," he has been able to work with action stars that are both larger than life (Seagal, Norris). Here, he uses more intrigue and atmosphere to reach his audience, building suspense and excitement through simple film tools rather than things blowing up or guns going off (However, there is a phenomenal opening crash scene to boot). With quick pacing, a never-a-dull-moment storyline, and great actors, "The Fugitive" ranks itself as one of the best action films of this decade, and definitely one of the best films of 1993. Rating: Four stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fabulous Thriller That Endures</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This a one of the best thriller/suspense/action films I have ever watched, and I've seen tons of them for almost 50 years. It "endures" because it is just as entertaining on the sixth viewing as it is on the first.Of course it helped it was based on a TV show that people my age watched religiously every week, so the plot if familiar and many of us wanted to see how the movie would stack up to the TV program. Well, as good as the TV series was, this was far better. Two scenes alone: the train wreck and Harrison Ford taking a swan dive - were worth the price of the film. Great stuff.The story has been discussed by many so let me just add how much I appreciate the sound in this movie. When this film first came out on VHS, I used the opening moments as a demo model for various surround systems. The DVD has enhanced that as well as the picture.The film has just the right amount of action scenes, very interesting characters and a storyline complex enough to bring you back for multiple viewings to totally understand it. Ford, of course, is the star with Tommy Lee Jones a close second, but the more you watch this, the more you appreciate EVERYONE'S acting in this movie.And, by the way, filmmakers take note: here''s another example how you can make an "edgy" modern-day crime film without a ton of unnecessary f-words.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Great Thrillers!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a kind of magic when a superb cast, a truly gifted director, and a literate script with equal parts 'over-the-top' action, riveting suspense, and rich characterization, come together. The end result attains a luster that only grows through the years, as new audiences, through DVD and VHS, experience the same excitement we felt, viewing it on a theater screen. In the last decade, only a handful of suspense films could be called 'great'...and on top of the list is THE FUGITIVE.Based on the popular David Janssen TV series, the film faithfully follows the same premise; a doctor is accused of his wife's death, but escapes before his execution, and tracks down the 'one-armed man' responsible for the murder, as a driven law officer attempts to recapture him. Being a big-budget film, however, the scale of everything is expanded...Dr. Richard Kimble is now a brilliant vascular surgeon, at a major Chicago hospital; the handicapped killer is a dirty ex-cop working on orders from crooked board members of a billion-dollar pharmaceutical firm; and the lawman is no longer a solitary police lieutenant, but a deputy United States Marshal, and his team of agents! While some fans of the original series complained that the 'intimacy' the series had was lost, director Andrew Davis only used the 'bigger' aspects as plot elements, placing the focus, wisely, on the dual stories of Kimble's search, and Gerard's pursuit.Despite the esteem the film has achieved over the years, Harrison Ford has gotten a bad rap for his very understated performance as Richard Kimble. While Tommy Lee Jones certainly had a far flashier role (earning him an Oscar as 'Best Supporting Actor'), Ford's intent wasn't to play 'Indiana Jones', but a man whose whole life was dedicated to his career as a surgeon, and his wife (played, in flashbacks, by the lovely Sela Ward). Seeing his wife brutally murdered devastated him (his scene in the police interrogation room, going to pieces, was largely improvised on the set, and displays some of his finest acting). His search for the killer was not the confident quest of an action hero, but based on uncertain, spur-of-the-moment decisions made by a desperate man, whose medical background was his only tool. Fear does not lend itself to flashy theatrics...Jones, as Marshal Sam Gerard, on the other hand, was a seasoned veteran, the best at what he did, and pursuing a fugitive was 'old hat' for him. With a confidence bordering on arrogance, he ordered people about like chess pieces, multi-tasked without breaking a sweat, and still could charm with a wicked smile and sarcastic remark. Of COURSE he wins the audience's heart!Featuring some of the most spectacular action scenes ever recorded on film (the train/bus wreck that frees Kimble, the dive off a dam into the churning maelstrom of the reservoir), as well as two slam-bang fistfights when Kimble finally gets 'justice', THE FUGITIVE still is remembered primarily for the suspenseful Jones/Ford 'cat-and-mouse' chase, cross-country, and the grudging respect that grows between them...which, ultimately, was what the TV series was best remembered for, as well.There is magic, here!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good acting and directing, constant action and tension. Even after many years this movie still stands</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Fugitive" is one of those movies that you may already have seen a dozen of times, but which still seems to surprise every time that you watch it. I don't know what it actually is that makes this movie so good, but it sure works. It's probably the combination of a good script, good acting and the abundance of action that's always present, but never exaggerated.The movie is about a doctor who's wife has been murdered by a one-armed man. He's innocent but is accused of the murder and convicted by court. He will get a lethal injection soon, but as he is transfered to another jail, the bus in which he is transported with some other inmates, crashes. He knows to escape and is determined to find his wife's murderer, but has to try to stay out of the hands of the police. The result is an interesting cat-and-mouse game between him and the police that never allows your attention to fade away.The story is perhaps not exceptional, but thanks to the good directing and acting and the constant action and tension, this movie really delivers everything that you can expect from it. I give it an 8.5 - 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a fine vehicle for Harrison Ford made even more agreeable by a clever, somewhat tongue in cheek performance by Tommy Lee Jones as a US Marshall out to have a good time getting the bad guy, even though the bad guy might not be so bad, and even though that's irrelevant, but hey, don't think so much and get me some coffee and a chocolate donut with those sprinkles on top, ya hear?This is also a Hollywood producer's orgasmic dream with a chase scene beginning in the first reel and lasting throughout. It is based on the 60s TV show of the same name, but gets its premise from a true crime story, that of Ohioan Dr. Sam Shepherd who actually went to jail for murdering his wife in the 50s. He too claimed to have fought off the real killer, but the forensic evidence and his personality were against him. Here we have Harrison Ford as the good doctor, and it doesn't take a Hollywood genius to tell you that the most popular leading man of the late twentieth century ain't about to play the kind of guy who murders his loving wife.Ford does a stand-up, competent job, saving lives and patting kids on the head as he plunges through sewers and off the top of a towering waterfall, steals an ambulance, survives a bullet wound and a bus wreck, etc. His fans will be pleased, but Tommy Lee Jones steals the show (and got a Best Supporting Oscar for his trouble) as a clever, wise-cracking good ole boy who has a lot of fun leading the posse. I wonder if he or director Andrew Davis invented the spin because without it, this wouldn't be half so good.This is not to be confused with, nor is it a remake of The Fugitive from 1947 starring Henry Fonda and directed by John Ford, a cinematic gem of an entirely different sort.See this for Tommy Lee Jones who has made a career out of turning oh-hum parts into something special.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great chase thriller with star power</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This excellent film details the adventure of a man's search for his wife's killer and to clear himself of her murder. Harrison Ford is the hero and wanted man and on the run to escape capture by a determined U.S. Marshal in one thrilling scene after another. A spectacular train wreck with a bus of prison-bound felons gets the action underway at which point Tommy Lee Jones enters the picture and takes over the film by sheer force of personality and doesn't let go. Harrison, a resourceful type, stays just ahead of Jones in this taut cat-and-mouse thriller and adroitly leaves just enough clues for the police as he closes in on the killer. Ford and Jones are well matched here in one of the best urban crime mysteries ever filmed. Cast and Chicago locations add realism to a great story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most intense picture of the decade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Fugitive is the biggest heart-pounding thriller I have seen in a while (and the best one this decade). The story revolves around Dr. Richard Kimble, played by Harrison Ford to pythagorean procision. Kimble is accused of killing his wife and is chased all over Chicago by Marshalls while looking for his wife's one armed killer. One of these Marshalls is Samuel Gerarg (Tommy Lee Jones terrific and Oscar nod performance) who after a while believes he is innocent. Spectacularly done in the tradition of crime/drama thrillers with Ford and Jones working better together than ever before. I found this film to be the best film experience of the early 90's, and hopefully you will too. A++</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fast-paced action thriller is even superior to the TV series...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a good "chase" film, you can't beat 'The Fugitive'. Not all films taken from TV series manage to make it to the big screen with a style of their own and a story worth telling. Exceptionally fine performances by Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones are the icing on the cake. The picture scores on all levels: photography, music, editing, script and performances. The bus/train crash at the start is a spectacular piece of filmmaking that gets the story off to a good start with powerful urgency. While you're rooting for Ford all the way, as the doctor wrongly accused of the murder of his wife, you sometimes find yourself in the shoes of the crafty, quirky detective with a sense of humor (Tommy Lee Jones) who is relentless in his pursuit. The battle between the pursued and the pursuer is the dominant theme and it is carried off with great wit and style.As absorbing as any action drama of the '90s. I would have been happy if Harrison Ford, as well as Jones, earned an Oscar for his earnest and highly physical performance. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

It's the story of a conspiracy surrounding Dr. Richard Kimble, a surgeon who is on the run while U.S Marshal Samuel Gerard tries to find an explanation of why Kimble was framed for the murder of his wife. The movie has a sticking nature to it, every detail in the actors face will prove that Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones deserve every praise they have received for their performance.Based on the 1960's Television series, this movie does not disappoint.

		<shortDescription>Great thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harrison Ford is "The Fugitive" in this 1993 version of the popular television series. The film also stars Tommy Lee Jones as Gerard, Sela Ward, Julianne Moore and Joe Pantoliano. For you young 'uns out there, "The Fugitive" TV show starring David Janssen was based on the 1954 Sam Sheppard case, the subject itself of 10 books and two movies. Dr. Sheppard. accused of murdering his wife, claimed to have seen a "bushy-haired man" at the scene. It was a landmark case, resulting in the creation of the "change of venue" motion.The film "The Fugitive" keeps the basics: Dr. Richard Kimble, en route to prison to await execution for the murder of his wife (Ward), escapes after a terrible accident. On his trail from the beginning is a U.S. Marshall, Sam Gerard. Both men have way above average intelligence, so while Gerard is able to get close, Kimble always eludes him. After stealing clothes, shaving his beard and dying his hair, Kimble goes to the hospital where he worked and gets into the computer database to find the one-armed man. He knows he injured the man's arm in a fight, and repair of the arm would have necessitated a visit.This is a real on the edge of your seat thriller, with an absolutely spectacular beginning sequence that grabs the audience and doesn't let go. In the TV series, the one-armed man is an intruder; here, a different storyline has been added, and it's quite good. One of my favorite parts occurs when Kimble, disguised as a janitor at the hospital, overhears an incorrect diagnosis for a young boy. Because the ER is so busy and there is no one available, he's asked to take the child to another floor. While doing so, he conducts his own quick examination and writes a change of orders; the boy ends up in surgery. The OR doc (Moore) catches Kimble looking at the child's x-ray, and when she learns the boy never arrived at his destination, alerts security. Gerard asks her later, "What happened to the boy?" "He saved his life," Moore says.Both Ford and Jones are at the top of their games and very well matched, Jones bringing a lot of humor to his role as the determined Gerard. Ford looks a little like the Ape Man in the beginning with all the facial hair; as Kimble, he's sympathetic and his desperation and determination are more internalized than Gerard's.It wasn't until 1998 that DNA evidence finally exonerated Sheppard, who was released in 1966 after a retrial (in the original trial, the judge told reporter Dorothy Kilgallen that Sheppard was guilty). Sheppard died in 1970, his life ruined. Fifty years after the case, it continues to influence courtroom proceedings and inspire books and films. This "Fugitive" is particularly excellent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Insider review from an Extra on the Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, looking back on this movie it is pretty decent, but not one of the better ones I have seen (I have worked as an extra on a few movies and sadly, none of them were all that great).The plot was OK, but hate to say it the acting was a bit stilted and somewhat over the top.I do have to agree with the "tounge in cheek" comment on the performance by Tommy Lee Jones. It is subtle, but the irony is there.I was in a few scenes but the "Convention Dinner" scene where they end up chasing the Fugitive through the hall was pretty realistic (if you discount the fact that you have to repeat it 5, 6 or 20 times) and Tommy Lee had this scary-intense aura about him.You can see me - I am the redhead who flips around in her seat a moment before he and the other guy leave the room and continue their battle. Funny sidebar - during one of the repeat takes Ford tripped over the leg of my chair and nearly fell face down. A PA (producton assistant)came over and gave me a dirty look and told me to move my chair in further(duh).This one scene took all night to film ( extras arrived at about 8pm and left somewhere around 7 the next morning). I would never choose to do this as a profession. If you ever decide to be an extra, bring a good novel or some homework with you to read during the 4-5 hours of down-time that usually is the norm, and expect to be there for 10 - 14 hours.No wonder movies cost millions to make.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb Action Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Probably the greatest modern post Hitchcock action thriller. A terrific cast led by two towering performances from Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones makes the most of an intelligent script and superb direction. The 60's television series provided a firm base for the story, but this feature length, densely plotted movie, takes proceedings to new heights of drama, and excellence.The central premise is as old as the hills. "The wrong that must be righted". Ford playing Dr Richard Kimble is falsely accused of murdering his wife and the forces of good, the Police, become the agents of bad, in trying to recapture him after he escapes in a spectacular train and bus crash, as good an action sequence as you will ever see at the cinema.Tommy Lee Jones is imperious as Marshall Sam Gerrard charged with tracking him down. Wonderfully gnarled and taciturn, Gerrard starts out simply doing his job, but things change as he not only comes to respect his quarry, but also starts to have doubts about Kimble's guilt.The first half is all action, particularly the magnificent scene where a cornered Kimble dives down the face of a dam to escape his pursuers. The second half becomes a detective movie as Kimble returns to Chicago to find the real murderer- and clear his name. Full of twists and turns, there is an inevitable showdown at the end, and a text book ending as to how you wrap this sort of story up.Director Andrew Davis's previous work gave no hint of his ability to deliver such a masterpiece, although his previous effort "Under Siege" will have sharpened up his action skills. And subsequently, he never quite scaled these heights again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The fugitive's name is Doctor Richard Kimble.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dr Kimble is falsely accused and sentenced for the murder of his wife. Whilst being transfered to prison a breakout occurs, seizing his chance, Kimble goes on the run in a desperate search to clear his name. Hot on his tail is staunch Marshall Sam Gerard, a man who always gets his man.Based on the long running and popular TV series of the same name, The Fugitive stands up as one of the best thrillers of the 90s, it's full of action and tight sequences that dovetail excellently with the who done it plot. The film opens harshly with the murder of Helen Kimble, and we are shown that it wasn't Richard who killed his wife, this puts us firmly onside with Kimble and his pursuit of the truth. Much credit must go to Harrison Ford who layers Kimble perfectly, Kimble is an honest hard working man reduced to fugitive tactics to avoid capture, always seemingly one step away from being caught, Kimble becomes something of a modern day hero figure, and in this Ford excels. As Sam Gerard we have Tommy Lee Jones having the time of his life, gruff and ready for a rumble, and with a quip at every turn, Gerard is a man we know is not to be messed with, and Jones portrays him wonderfully as the obsessive pursuer he is.From that harsh opening, to a quite breath taking sequence with a train, the film cements itself as a bona fide top draw thriller, however, the second half of the picture, whilst still an intriguing mysterious chase movie, does veer down the formulaic road with it's conspiracy plot line, but it really is a minor complaint that doesn't send the film to averageville. The Fugitive at any one point is never less than great fun, high on action and containing great performances to crown the smart David Twohy/Jeb Stuart screenplay, the film is a winner from start to finish. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thankfully this version of "The Fugitive" wraps up in two hours rather than a couple of seasons.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a thoroughly enjoyable movie that has good acting, a good story, and good action. Based on the television show of the same name it is also probably the most successful and best television show to movie I have ever seen. It also has that major plus in that at the end of the movie you are done with your journey and everything wraps up rather nicely. The story has Dr. Kimble accused of murder and we speed through the trial as the police do not believe for a minute Dr. Kimble's story of a fight he had with the actual killer, the one armed man. Well through some good and bad luck at the same time, he finds himself free of the prisoner transport he was on and now he is set loose to try and clear his name and bring the real killer to justice. On his trail though is a United States Marshall played by the very good actor Tommy Lee Jones. In fact, Jones would win an Oscar for his performance in this movie. He would later reprise this role, but with little success in the film "U.S. Marshals", my thinking is though that it might have done better at the box office had they not simply made almost a remake of this movie with the wrongly accused escapee, but instead had him track someone actually guilty of the crime. This one though has some great cat and mouse as you really pull for Kimble (played by the excellent Harrison Ford) to connect all the pieces and find the party responsible for his wife's death. Most of the action is confined to the city of Chicago I think it was, but there is enough action and such to make up for the lack of locales. Though there is a great scene involving a dam and the inner workings of it as Kimble is almost caught right off the bat by Gerard (the marshal). All in all a fine film and in my opinion still the best television show to movie film there is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An adaptation of a famous TV series, "the fugitive" was a blockbuster when it was launched in 1993. Did I enjoy it? Yes and no... We deal with a spirited action movie, led without any dead times and with a well-balanced performance. I was told that Tommy Lee Jones almost stole the show from Harrison Ford. Honestly, I didn't have this impression.But "the fugitive" is also a movie without any major surprises and where you can detect a lack of inventiveness because it confines itself to the usual rules of the detective movie: a man wrongly accused of a crime he didn't commit, a will to discover the real culprit, police on his tail, a predictable progression sprinkled with stirring chases. Furthermore, the script, which is sometimes repetitive doesn't exclude unlikelinesses and the end makes the whole conventional.Nonetheless, Andrew Davis knows his job and "the fugitive" remains a spectacular and watchable movie but also too much superficial to call it a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has got to be one of my favorite movies with Harrison Ford. I've never seen the TV show this movie is based on, but I loved the movie. They managed to take the formulaic "cat and mouse" game and turn it into a first-rate thriller.The story is gripping and keeps your attention with constant plot twists. The atmosphere in Chicago is amazing, perfectly capturing the mood and feel of a crime-ridden town.The performances from the leads were phenomenal. Tommy Lee Jones is tough, gritty, and totally believable as Deputy Gerard. Harrison Ford is equally amazing as Dr. Richard Kimble, the wrongly accused man. The supporting cast also does a great job.The action and excitement in this film is almost nonstop and will keep you on the edge of your seat. Better yet, it isn't just action for the sake of action, but it also serves the story.My only real complaint is that the film was just a bit too long.I'd choose this over Bourne any day. This is recommended for fans of Harrison Ford, fans of Tommy Lee Jones, and action movie buffs in general.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film exists within a realm that is usually highly overrated for its "flair", the explosiveness of its iconic scenes, its badass characters... but often, if not VERY often, these films lack substance terribly. This here features an excellent cast, good action, but is actually a very compelling and superbly crafted story, with great tension; very difficult to keep up for a whole 2hrs + with such a basic main plot; and a superb ending. Great suspense, great twists, great acting - Ford plays his part very well and Tommy Lee Jones as usual is brilliant, and *just* right. It really takes a great effort to extend such a synopsis into a lengthy epic like that and not lose credibility, dynamism at least at some point. For a movie inspired by a series, this is just pure, pure quality. An underlying arm-wrestle between bold justice and insidious conniving; between recognizing right and wrong.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Made when people went to see the film because of its Star....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dr. Richard Kimble returns home from work one night to find his wife Helen has been murdered. The killer, a one-armed man, manages to escape before police arrive. With lack of evidence pointing to the one-armed man, Kimble is arrested and charged with murder. On his way to prison, the transport bus crashes, giving him the opportunity to escape. Kimble decides to find out who the real killer is and why his wife was murdered. But a US Marshal named Samuel Gerard and his team are tasked with finding Kimble and arresting him. However, the further he is to catching Kimble, the more Gerard is convinced he is innocent..........As my summary says, this was made when Star power was one of the main reasons why films made so much money, and ironically, this was released the same year that Last Action Hero flopped, starring Schwarzenegger, easily the most bankable star in Hollywood at that time.Along with Cruise, Hanks, Gibson, Stallone, and Costner, Ford was among those actors who's name above a film title would guarantee a huge revenue at the box office, and this was one of Fords last film that was huge because he was in it.It also helps that it's thrilling from beginning to end, and for a remake of a TV series, it's pretty intelligent and doesn't spoon feed the audience with all the Basil Exposition we are 'treated' to now.But what really stands out is the change of mood when the film flits from Kimble's quest to Gerard's. It's almost like the film has two different narratives, and the tones of these narratives are much different.Kimble's is cold, dangerous, and untrusting, while the Marshals quest is honestly downright hilarious at times. And when these narratives merge, it's unmissable, especially the now legendary dam scene.Ford gives a really humanistic, vulnerable performance, and there are times when you really feel sorry for the man, one minute, he has everything he could wish for, the next, he's stealing food from an almost comatose patient.A true classic, one of Fords greatest performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A taut thriller with top notch performances from both Ford &amp; Jones</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Fugitive" is based on the classic TV series of the same name that ran from 1963 to 1967. The finale of that series still ranks as one of the most watched episodes in U.S. history. So, while the TV show provided a promising template for a successful movie, it would nevertheless be a challenge to match the impact of the original.The story concerns Dr. Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford), a doctor falsely accused of killing his wife. Convicted of murder, a spectacular crash en route to prison allows him to escape and search for the real killer. Unfortunately for him, hard-nosed U.S. Marshall Samuel Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones) is determined to pursue his man until he's back in the hands of the authorities.The performances of Ford &amp; Jones are the linchpins that hold the film together. Both characters are equally driven and the actors successfully bring this intensity to the screen. Their portrayals also have a depth not found in most action movies. Notably, Jones managed to snag both an Oscar and a Golden Globe for his work here. Apart from this pair, Joe Pantoliano &amp; Julianne Moore make welcome appearances while the remainder of the cast is mostly composed of lesser-knowns who nevertheless perform admirably.Director Andrew Davis masterfully handled the film's action set-pieces along with the unravelling of the mystery at the core of the story. Even when the story gets a bit convoluted, the viewer is nevertheless propelled forward inexorably. The Oscar-nominated score by James Newton Howard is another important ingredient in the mix and is only one of several technical areas that received awards attention.Ultimately, "The Fugitive" lived up to its predecessor and became a huge commercial and critical success. A thrilling and engrossing action movie, it remains just as vital more than twenty years after its original release.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb, intelligent film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched The Fugitive for the first time in years, and enjoyed it immensely. The script and direction are near perfect. The tension hums along like a clock, and there are lots of inventive chases, but the plot is always crystal clear. Tommy Lee Jones and Harrison Ford both bring a keen intelligence to their roles. It could be Ford's best role, and Jones lights up every scene he's in with a droll humour and relaxed yet astute manner. But all the actors, including then-unknowns Jane Lynch and Julianne Moore, are given smart and absorbing parts. Even cameos are good. The background music is very dramatically old fashioned but bearable. The flippant, jokey humour of the detectives gets annoying sometimes. The opening bus and train crash is amazing -- one of the most perfectly executed stunts you will ever see. But the film is just constantly inventive, such as a chase scene in the St Patrick's Day parade, or the police raid on the house where Dr Kimble is staying that turns out to be the arrest of the shonky landlord. Not a scene or word in The Fugitive is wasted. It's almost clinical, the way the film is paced, but it has so much heart and soul, it draws you in and keeps you riveted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I didn't kill my wife." "I don't care." Fantastic and gripping thriller. I haven't seen the series, but I've heard it inspired Twin Peaks to an extent, so I'll probably check it out sometime. But this film lives up to it's reputation as a great thriller. Harrison Ford plays Richard Kimble, a respected doctor who is accused for the brutal murder of his wife. His only argument is that he stumbled upon his murdered wife and a one-armed man, whom he fought with. This doesn't hold up in court and all the evidence is against him, so he's sentenced to be executed and sent on the bus out of Chicago. Fortunately for him, the bus crashes, allowing him to escape, and from then on it's a game of cat-and-mouse as he is pursued tooth and nail by a cop (Tommy Lee Jones; excellent). Eventually Kimble finds himself back in Chicago in a hunt for evidence to clear his name while being pursued by the cops. Harrison Ford is excellent and convincing as the disgraced doctor hanging on by his fingernails, and Tommy Lee Jones is funny and likable as the cop pursuing him. The hunt and the unfolding conspiracy keeps you gripped throughout and the set-pieces can be quite awesome, like a massive dam Kimble finds himself testing his faith with. The supporting cast are all good, notably Andreas Katsulas (Commander Tomalak in Star Trek TNG, equally sinister here), and Jeroen Krabbe. I'm not sure if the film was making any deliberate stabs at corporate corruption or big pharma, or just using that as a story element, but it works. The film is an excellent mystery and an excellent action thriller, highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Fugitive is a brilliant movie with a very well developed storyline and a very professional and dramatic cast.The movie is intense and action packed all the way through and also very exciting.As far as performances go ,this is without a doubt one of Harrison Ford's finest performances and without a doubt Tommy Lee Jones best performance,he really stole the spotlight from Ford in this movie,an Academy Award dosen't lie.The character development for both Ford and Jones characters is also top notch,especially for action movie standards.The movie is filled with action but never gets too carried away or drags out ,which I liked because it bothers when they take you away from the story too much.The Fugitive is a great movie that I would recommends to all moviegoers,especially if you're a fan of action,adventure or the two main actors. A doctor goes on the run after a court finds him guilty of murdering his wife.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fast and highly likable thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a traffic collision convicted murderer Dr Richard Kimble (Ford) tries to clear his name whist Samuel Gerard (Jones) attempts to track him down.This Andrew Davis picture brings together a slick plot flowing with action and intrigue and with Tommy Lee Jones and Harrison Ford on perfect form this is the perfect remedy to an absent action injury.With James Bond being "reborn" these last few years and The Bourne trilogy racking up plaudits from everywhere it seems we have reinvented the term of thriller in a genre that is often scrutinized for its lack of realism in context.What makes the Fugitive tick? For starters this is a fun adrenaline soaking thriller that needs minimal explanation to get the blood pumping. From waterfall jumps to train crashes this has enough to fulfil the viewer's requirements.There is an array of credited actors who have broken barriers in their lifetimes previous to this Oscar winner. Tommy Lee Jones (winner of best supporting actor) has of course starred in plenty of action thrillers. Under Siege, No country for old men and possibly Men in Black he knows how to tackle the action. Having just reviewed the Oscars from 15 years ago I must confess to having liked John Malkovich's protagonist in the Wolfgang Peterson thriller In The Line of Fire plenty more. The swagger and evilness of Booth was elaborate, eccentric and malicious with a delicious cunning that made his character seem approachable but undeniably sick and evil. Jones nevertheless presents a character with baggage but does not convey it and with an intelligent appreciation of law and crime he sets the benchmark to the law breaking citizens of America.Ford establishes himself as mystery man in the early stages where we believe he could be good or evil and when the plot momentarily loses its balance we know the truth of his innocence.This narrative of a man needing to escape and prove his name as innocent is reflective of numerous other thrillers there's no question. Bearing in mind this concept can become tedious when seeing repetitive viewings of various thrillers it is significant to recognize this was one of the early films that brought this technique to the attention of the critiques and various other filmmakers. It is a stunning concept that adds tension and mystery from every aspect.The scene setting is wonderfully exuberant. The forest setting generates the feeling of isolation exquisitely whilst the montages of the flashbacks fittingly reflect this isolation and gives the central character development and contemplation.There are lapses in the action with an overhaul in dialogue and the Bourne series has shown the meaning of thriller but this is undoubtedly fast and fun mystery.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>three great performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Fugitive' is quite a bit more faithful to its source material than many other feature films inspired by old television series, at least in an elemental sense. Most of the key reference points are there; innocent Dr. Richard Kimble, his wife's murder, the dogged pursuit by police Lt. Gerard, and of course the one-armed man. We hardly expect the main actors to impersonate their antecedents and they don't, though the thought of Harrison Ford mimicking David Janssen is an amusing one. But where the film really deviates from the TV show is in Tommy Lee Jones' portrayal of the Gerard character. Barry Morse's staid police lieutenant may have had just a touch of deviousness to him, but it's nothing compared to Jones' flamboyant, in-your-face, control-freakish turn as the U.S. marshal on Kimble's trail. Jones' Gerard is every bit as much a lead character as Ford's quieter, determined Kimble. There are new twists (and a new sub-plot concerning pharmaceutical subterfuge) added to the familiar plot of Dr. Kimble on the run, trying to locate evidence that the one-armed man killed his wife and thus prove his innocence. Kimble is certainly nothing if not resourceful and not surprisingly, a certain suspension of disbelief is required by the audience to accept his ability to get out of scrapes and avoid the police throughout the film. In fact, there are primarily two sources of great enjoyment in 'The Fugitive,' one being Jones' over-the-top performance and the other Kimble's ingenuity at tracking down the murderer even while he himself is being pursued. Another actor deserves mention: Jeroen Krabbe, who plays a doctor friend of Kimble's who ultimately turns out to be one of the baddies. With his cultured accent and sophisticated manner, Krabbe exudes a kind of upper-crust menace very effectively, so that when his character's true nature is revealed, there is a real sense of justice prevailing in his getting his comeuppance. There is a certain infuriating quality about Gerard, for all his wiseass remarks and endearing devil-may-care attitude towards protocol, in that he seemingly never stops to consider whether Kimble just might be innocent, at least not until very late in the film. It stands in contrast to some of Kimble's old friends at the hospital he visits, who are just as unswervingly convinced that he isn't guilty without any physical evidence or proof to back up this belief. Kimble inhabits a no-man's land in the middle, slipping in and out of each alternate universe, one where he's damned for all time and the other where he's a great guy, and don't be silly, of course he didn't kill his wife. It's that tension that propels 'The Fugitive' along but also makes the ending not entirely satisfactory. You want to hit Lt. Gerard on the head when he finally realizes the truth and tell him, "Of course he didn't kill his wife, you fool!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well-written adaptation and film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Truth be told,the job of a vascular surgeon is not the most pleasant job that there is to be found out there. But,for vascular surgeon Richard Kimble(Harrison Ford),life could be better. This is due to Richard Kimble being a rich,successful,and respected vascular surgeon. On top of that,Richard Kimble has a beautiful wife with whom he has a loving relationship with,Helen (Sela Ward). This has made Richard Kimble's life perfect,and given Kimble what most people dream for/of.But,one night,everything perfect and wonderful in the life of Richard Kimble suddenly comes to an end. This is when Richard Kimble comes home,only to discover that his beloved Helen is being murdered by a man with a prosthetic arm. And then,before Richard Kimble knows it,he is falsely convicted for the murder of his wife. The result? Kimble being sentenced to Death Row.However,one night,a stroke of "fate" steps in for Richard Kimble. This stroke of "fate" allows Richard Kimble to escape imprisonment,and allows Kimble to return to Chicago(his hometown)to solve the murder of his wife. Richard Kimble has several loyal,trusted and respected friends/colleagues. Because of this,Kimble has a very strong chance at solving the murder of his wife,and bringing the people who are responsible for it to justice. But,the Chicago Police and the United States Marshals have a tight watch over Richard Kimble. This complicates Kimble trying to solve the murder of his wife and bringing the people who are responsible for it to justice. On top of that? The man leading the case against Richard Kimble is Samuel Gerard(Tommy Lee Jones),a United States Marshal who's determination and obsession in finding Richard Kimble is aided by his intelligence.The only things that will tell who is able to win the whole "case" between Richard Kimble and his friends/colleagues and Samuel Gerard and his team of United States Marshals,alongside the Chicago Police Department? Time,decisions,and intelligence.The script for "The Fugitive" is a bit unarranged,and could have been easily fixed by director Andrew Davis before its release. But,other than that,"The Fugitive" is a well-written film and adaptation. Based off of a 1960's television series created by the late Roy Huggins (RIP),"The Fugitive" succeeds in taking the television show that it based off of,and keeping several elements of the show,remaining true and original without recycling the show. There are a lot of original elements to "The Fugitive",which helps it out a lot,at the same time. And,despite the fact that the script for "The Fugitive" happens to be a bit unarranged,it does a good job at documenting Richard Kimble trying to solve the murder of his wife,and the case being lead against Kimble. The way that everything leads up to another is perfectly arranged. At the same time,"The Fugitive" successfully takes crime drama,action,and plenty of chemistry,alongside a small amount of humor,and blending it all together in one.There are also a lot of strong performances that are to be found in "The Fugitive". In Harrison Ford's performance as Richard Kimble,Ford turns in a richly executed performance. This is by Harrison Ford understanding how his character of Richard Kimble is feeling,and bringing Kimble's feelings to life. The beauty of it? Harrison Ford's performance as Richard Kimble does not find Ford portraying Kimble as a big,tough guy who's enemies better look out for themselves. Harrison Ford's performance as Richard Kimble paints a picture of Kimble as a smart and laid-back man,who is just trying to solve his wife's murder and bring the people responsible for it to justice. What makes this performance tick is viewers seeing that Richard Kimble is no tough guy whatsoever--letting the plot and script have an interesting and creative "twist" to them. In Tommy Lee Jones's performances as Samuel Gerard,Jones understands how Gerard feels about the case of Richard Kimble,and Gerard's determination and obsession to find Kimble,alongside the intelligence of Gerard. This keeps "The Fugitive" moving along well at a well-structured and constructed pace. It helps viewers of "The Fugitive" clearly know and understand the two sides of the story. Anytime a scene in "The Fugitive" calls for humor out of Tommy Lee Jones' performance of Samuel Gerard,Jones takes the humor and brings it to life,allowing the humor to be worthwhile and viewers of "The Fugitive" have a few laughs. All of these elements all work not only being blended together,but also for the scenes in this film that feature both Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones and the scenes with action (the action here is well-mixed in with the script;it is fitting and suitable,but does not push itself a mile to being an action film,on behalf of the way it is arranged in the script for "The Fugitive" and the performances in the scene with the action).It is also worth noting that even though you will only find Sela Ward through a small half of "The Fugitive",Ward's performance as Helen Kimble is one of the film's highlights. Why? In Sela Ward's performance as Helen Kimble,Ward puts a good amount of compassion into her scenes,and even though very little,emotion when it is called for (You'll know what I mean.....). Sela Ward's performance of Helen Kimble contribute to "The Fugitive" being as good and successful as it turned out to be. It also succeeds in allowing viewers of "The Fugitive" know how Richard Kimble feels as they watch Richard solve Helen's murder. All of this allows "The Fugitive" to fully come together,and be the good and successful film that it turned out to be.Overall,whether you have or have not watched the television show that "The Fugitive" is based off of,if you enjoy crime drama films and enjoy a film with a good cast and good acting (most of the cast here is obscure,but they are all great actors who are perfect in their roles here),"The Fugitive" is the film is for you.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Fugitive is one of the most thoroughly entertaining films ever to careen through the action genre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Fugitive turns out to be a smashing success, a juggernaut of an action-adventure saga that owes nothing to the past. Accused of his wife's murder, a doctor (Harrison Ford) goes on the run, hunting down the real killer while a cop (Tommy Lee Jones) pursues him.The original TV series, starring David Janssen, ran from 1963 to 1967. Here it is updated into an expansive action-adventure film, powered - even through its less coherent stretches - by lead performances of an old-school solidity and rigour. For his performance Jones won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. The Fugitive was one of the few movies associated with a television series to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie had been made with lots of profession both in front and behind the camera. The directing is subtle and nice and the performances by the actors are excellent.Really the best thing about "The Fugitive" is the acting, in particular Tommy Lee Jones. Basically his performance alone is what makes the movie work well and makes the story believable enough to be captivated by it. No wonder he won an Oscar for this, it's his best role till date and his character is an highly memorable one. Harisson Ford plays a boring average man which work well for his character and the movie. Other actors worth mentioning are Joe Pantoliano and Jeroen Krabb.Still "The Fugitive" is not a movie I enjoy watching. The story, especially towards the end gets a bit too complex and perhaps even ridicules. I don't know but for some reason it doesn't really blend in with the rest of the movie, that was just basically a tense chase between Dr. Kimble and the U.S. Marshals. I think an action/thriller movie like this should be made just for pure entertainment were not a lot of thinking is required. Yes, although I still find it a good and recommendable movie I still tend to call this movie an overrated one.The movie is filled with some tense and memorable chase and action sequences that alone are reasons enough to go and watch this movie. The whole train/bus crash at the beginning is already regarded a bit as a classic action sequence that is well known to everybody.Worth watching mainly because of Tommy Lee Jones and the nice action and chase sequences. However if you expect this to be a simple entertaining action flick, think again, you're better of watching another movie.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chase Movie That Often Jumps The Shark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seeing the Nick Love big screen version of THE SWEENEY I was struck as to how cynical the marketing was . It could be any high octane thriller set around a bunch of bank robbers in London with a crime squad led by a rough diamond cop trying to bring the crooks to book . In other words it's simply called THE SWEENEY because it's got a ready made market for people who fondly remember the original TV show . This is pre-dated by this big screen version of the television show of THE FUGITIVE which features Harrison Ford playing a character called Dr Richard Kimble being pursued by a cop called Gerard in a film that is nothing more than a cynical exercise in trying to cash in on a half remembered TV show from yesteryear . That is not to say it's a bad film as such but anyone expecting anything along the lines of the TV original won't recognise this film as sharing anything in common with the David Janssen series As it stands if you like loud , brash , action packed muliplex entertainment then you'll certainly enjoy this movie . The downside is that you have to take the rough with the smooth and this comes in the form of plot contrivance . Interestingly the original court case is skated over and the audience never given a reason why Kimble is found guilty of the murder of his wife . Of course sharing the name of the TV series THE FUGITIVE and a character played by Harrison Ford in 1993 the audience know Kimble must be innocent but even so the evidence must have been rather damning . Being a contrived plot means that in order for the story to progress more and more ludicrous things involving good luck/bad luck has to happen which strains credibility when you stop to think about anything . The shark is well and truly jumped relatively early in the film where Kimble takes a dive of a dam falling several hundred feet in to a waterfall which must contain several thousand tons of water and surviving This sequence ties in with the protagonist's nemesis US Marshall Samuel Gerard who has the almostsupernatural ability to be one step ahead of the other characters . Kimble disappears in a blocked off tunnel ? He's obviously escaped down a drain . He jumps off the top of a dam ? He's obviously survived the fall . He looks through some garbage and concludes Kimble is using a false ID One almost hopes Gerard does something credible such as throw his hands up and say " Hey guys the trail has gone cold " but I guess that would mean less tension and excitement in a film that merely exists to wretch up tension and excitement to a multiplex audience . A fact reflected in its massive box office takings</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of Harrison Ford's most magnificant, significant and most highly acclaimed performances of his career. The Fugitive explores the themes of Justice and Betrayal from a murder case. Harrison Ford plays as Dr. Richard Kimble, a highly respected doctor in Chicago. He has all that he wants; a wife and a succesful promising career. But one night his life turned around. There is someone in his house.........his wife is dead. Now he must run for his life to find the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. With a whole police force behind his back, he will not give up until he finds the man who killed his wife. Co-starring Tommy Lee Jones, this movie is one of the best thrillers out there. It makes us think hard on the themes portrayed in the movie and reminds us that Justice is not always achieved in our world. Harrison Ford's extremely realistic performance as a man on the run, will keep you on the edge of your seat. This film is certainly a classic in the genre.</fullReview>

"The Fugitive" is undoubtedly one of the best movies of the 90's &amp; Harrison Ford comes up trumps again. He plays Dr. Richard Kimble was is sentenced to death for murdering his wife, a crime he did not commit. He escapes from custody whilst being transported to the penitentiary where his sentence will be carried out. Right from the start his escape itself from the bus taking him is brilliantly done, very exciting to watch, &amp; things hardly let up for a moment throughout this movie. Tommy Lee Jones plays the leader of the law enforcement officers trying to recapture him &amp; what follows is a very exciting battle of wits between two very intelligent men. The action is superlative as the doctor sets about trying to prove his innocence whilst at the same evading the law.

		<shortDescription>A classic! The Best Harrison Ford's action flick. An Andrew Davis masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Fugitive (1993) is a classic action thriller flick from Andrew Davis and Harrison Ford. It is my favorite all time classic action film from Harrison ford and Andrew Davis, that I love to death! Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones, gave their best performances on screen, I have ever seen. No wonder the score is 7.8 on IMDb, because it is a classic and I absolutely love it. I grew up, with this film and it is my childhood favorite movie. Back in 1993 this film was a hit, I remember seeing the trailer on TV as a kid, this movie was also in the theater. This is third time that Tommy Lee Jones and Ron Dean worked together with the director Andrew Davis. Tommy Lee Jones previous worked on a movies The Package and Under Siege, until he got cast in this film. Being the biggest Harrison Ford fan, I must say this is my favorite film of his. Watching him last year on YouTube on Jimmy Kimmel Live show, Harrison specifically requested Jimmy not to ask him anything about Star Wars. I don't know what happened with him on Star Wars movies and I don't care! I was never fan of Star Wars and I never will be! I was more an Indiana Jones fan and still I am. So my favorite Harrison ford Films will always be: Indiana Jones Trilogy, this one (The Fugitive), Clear and Present Danger and Patriot Games. Those are the films I grew up with it.Plot: Dr. Richard Kimble, unjustly accused of murdering his wife, must find the real killer while being the target of a nationwide manhunt. I know that this movie is based on original TV series from the 60's with David Janssen and it was also based on a doctor who was accused of murdering his wife, which he didn't, I watched the TV movie. I love this film to death, Andrew Davis Sensational directed the film, no shaky cam and no CGI in the movie. The special effects were great, the acting performance from the cast was perfect and the chase sequences were incredible. The film is entertained from the beginning till end. I love the music score by James Newton Howard in the film, the plot and the story is brilliant. About the character Dr. Richard Kimble, this character has a heart. I love how Richard (Harrison Ford) was pretending to be a janitor the same time, while he was looking in the prosthetic limb area for patient information matching the description of the one-armed man. The best scene and favorite of mine is a scene, when a doctor (Julianne Moore) asks Kimble to take down a boy down the stairs in the operation room, who has a chest broken and Kimble doesn't obey her, he sees the record and he writes a description, he talks to the boy and he put him in the right surgery floor and saves the young boy's life. That scene touches my heart every time, I see it. This film has a heart, it does show that Kimble is not only innocent, but he is a good hearted person, that he was convicted wrongfully, for the crime he did not commit. That is why I love this movie. I also love Tommy Lee Jones' character Deputy U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard who later starts to believing that the man is innocent, but he has to do the job by bringing him back to hand of the law. I love his line "I...don't...bargain." About the cast: Beside Harrison Ford which I love him that he did an outstanding, believing acting and the best performance. Tommy Lee Jones as Deputy U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard was outstanding which I loved him in this movie. Joe Pantoliano as Deputy U.S. Marshal Cosmo Renfro was terrific, recently I just watched him in Bad Boys II and I seriously love his voice. Julianne Moore as Dr. Anne Eastman has only two scenes and made only a cameo scene in this film, which she was awesome! later she played the main role in my favorite all time adventure flick The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997). Andreas Katsulas as Fredrick Sykes was fantastic and he was awesome villain I love him in this film. Jeroen Krabb as Dr. Charles Nichols was incredible as a doctor and the villain I love him. The last actress I want to mention in this movie is L. Scott Caldwell as Deputy U.S. Marshal Erin Poole she was also awesome. I know she had a small role in here, I am really wondering why she didn't return in the sequel U.S. Marshals (1998).

		<shortDescription>Great acting and scene by scene suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally getting around to writing a review of this movie after so long, I am glad to report that I still like this great action movie and particularly, the rivalry between two actors from the 1970's generation -- Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones. Without the two actors, the movie would have been largely forgotten but the two antagonists are in full flight and in their prime. (Maybe a few years past.) The movie features one long chase with police only a step behind as prison escapee Dr. Richard Kimble tries to outwit and out-run Samuel Gerard, federal Marshall. Kimble races across Illinois to Chicago from highway to subway to hospitals and flophouses with a pause at the St. Patricks's Day Parade. Viewers are treated to some exciting scenes as Kimble successfully dodges police as he changes his appearance by shaving his beard, changing from day clothes to uniform and back again. He seeks out friends whose help he needs to establish his innocence. In the end, the two men meet in the back seat of a car, where they share a mutual respect, well earned by both, after a lengthy combat. Credit to director Andrew Davis for great scene by scene suspense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't let this one escape you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are some films which are pretty much perfect (for what they are). 'The Fugitive's' beauty lies in its simplicity (not to mention the excellent performances from its two main stars). A prominent doctor's wife is murdered. He's accused and convicted, but manages to escape and sets out to prove his innocence.Of course 'simple' doesn't always mean great. Like I said, 'The Fugitive' would be a lot less if it wasn't for the fact that everyone's favourite space pirate/adventurer, Harrison Ford, wasn't the fugitive in question. As with most of his films, he's great to watch and perfect to root for. But of course things go even less smoothly for our runaway doctor than they already have been. If being wrongly convicted for spousal murder wasn't bad enough, the toughest U.S. Marshall ever, played perfectly by Tommy Lee Jones, has been despatched to bring in his man ? at any costs. Again, Jones' performance is spot on and if ever there was a better game of 'cat and mouse' then I haven't seen it.There are plenty of memorable scenes in the film, most of which involve the two leads squaring off ? most notably the scene at the dam. And, even thought the film is now over twenty years old, it can still hold onto its own today. It doesn't look in any way dated and you don't need iphones or Twitter to prove how modern it is.Sometimes I try to guess who the audience to a film is. In this case, I'd say: everyone. If you like thrillers, if you like tension, if you like mystery or you just like either/or Harrison Ford or Tommy Lee Jones then you're in for a treat. In fact... if you like good films in general you really should check it out. Despite its two hour runtime, it flies by (not sure whether that makes the 'semi-sequel' 'U.S. Marshalls also a success ? most people may just want to stick with this one).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sits at the top of the heap, as chase movies go</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The beauty of THE FUGITIVE (just as a premise, before a single life of dialogue is written) is that you've already got a sympathetic protagonist to lure the audience in. Dr. Richard Kimble goes from affluent happily- married surgeon to widower and wrongfully-convicted murderer in just a few minutes' runtime. It's a nightmare situation, the police are no help, and you just want the guy to set things right and clear his name. All you need now is a foil to chase down our hero (it's got that) and some capable direction to keep things fast and tight (it's got that, too).Tony Lee Jones is a vision to behold in this movie. He truly inhabits the tireless hunter; yeah, it helps that Gerard is a well-written character, but Jones infuses the role and the movie with great personality. Ford's certainly no slouch, and feels at home as the guy who's outsmarting the police. Nice to see him go from hunted back to caring doctor too, in the scene with the injured boy.It's a well-done movie all-around; tense, exciting, there's good banter among Gerard's team, it's a good Chicago movie, and that ending is all sorts of satisfying.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The fugitive is indeed a successful film and lives up to its name. The story is about a doctor called Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford) who is on the run after the bus he was on is crashed and was suppose to be given a death sentence for apparent 'murder'. He is believed to have killed his wife but Kimble (Harrison Ford) sets out to prove he was innocent and find out the real killer and his motive. However, the problem he faces in finding out these things is that he is being hunted down by the US Marshall Samuel Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones) who firmly believes Kimble (Harrison Ford) is guilty and that he is trying to get away for his 'crime'. The Fugitive is simply an awesome movie. What makes the film great is that you the viewer will feel for the character Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford) and want the true culprit brought to justice. The actors especially Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones were exceptional and made the film the success it already is. Film has action, it is an adventure and it thrills you all the way to the end. The plot of the movie is so simple to understand and is certainly a movie worth watching. Gotta love the 90s. The best decade when it comes to action movies and the Fugitive was certainly one of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't alive to see The Fugitive t.v. program so I can't use it as a reference for The Fugitive the movie. As I've heard from my parents it was a long running series with Dr. Richard Kimble perpetually on the run. Well, in that case, the movie was on point.I thoroughly enjoyed this who dunnit movie. As good as Harrison Ford was as Dr. Richard Kimble, Tommy Lee Jones was better as the lead officer hunting down Dr. Kimble. In fact, I would say that TLJ put his name on the map with his performance. Sure, he was good in Under Siege, but he took it up a notch in The Fugitive.The Fugitive was a terrific story with terrific acting, an all around blast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A first rate thriller with two great lead actors.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Fugitive (1993) is about a vascular surgeon named Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford) who was accused of killing his wife. As he escapes from being executed he goes on the run to prove his innocence while avoiding getting caught by a team of U.S Marshals lead by the determined Samuel Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones). I will start off by saying that I don't just like, but love this film. Everything about this film is perfect. This is an exhilarating film and I enjoyed every minute of it. The Fugitive is a great action thriller that is highly entertaining and filled with heart pounding moments. The film is directed by Andrew Davis. Andrew Davis is one of the few directors who in his prime knew how to craft a well made action film. As far as his films go, this is his best one and my favorite. The scenes between Ford and Jones are engaging and suspenseful. The entire film is a perfect example of great suspense. One of my two favorite scenes in this film are where Kimble is chased by Gerard. One is the dam chase and the other is the stairway chase. Both of the scenes are terrific examples of great thrills. The performances by Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones are outstanding. Harrison Ford is great as Dr. Richard Kimble. You really feel the characters vulnerability and you really root for him. I am in general a huge fan of Harrison Ford and as far as his performances go this is one of his best. Tommy Lee Jones as the determined U.S Marshal Samuel Gerard is magnificent. Tommy Lee Jones is another one of those actors who is basically good in just everything he is in. He also won an academy award for best supporting actor and I got to say that he truly deserved it. The supporting cast may not be on par with the two lead actors, however they still do capable job in their roles. The score by James Newton Howard is wonderful and add more excitement during the action scenes. Overall, it is a first rate thriller that will appeal to action fans and to those who in general like a good film that features top notch suspense and a well written story with wonderful lead actors. I absolutely have no problems with this film. 10/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"A hard target search of every gas station, residence, warehouse, farmhouse, hen house, outhouse, and doghouse in the area"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the popular TV series of the same name (1963-1967), David Janssen played the lead role of a doctor who had been tried, convicted, and sentenced to die for the murder of his wife. The doctor, Richard Kimble, was innocent of the crime. Because of a train wreck, Kimble was able to escape and subsequently search for the one-armed man that he knew was the real culprit. Folks tuned in every week to see how the doctor fared. Despite many close calls and being fanatically pursued by a relentless Lt. Gerard, Kimble remained elusive. Finally, after four years, Kimble and his quarry were trapped atop a water tower in the presence of Gerard, who shot the one-armed murderer from the ground. That final episode on a Tuesday in August of 1967 garnered a 72 percent share of all USA TV viewers.The 1993 movie of the same name maintains the same premise although the plot is rather different. An innocent doctor (now a vascular surgeon), Dr. Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford) is on the run and is, at the same time, trying to locate the one-armed murderer of his wife, Helen Kimble (Sela Ward) before the authorities close in and execute him. In the movie's brief prologue, all available evidence had pointed to the doctor's guilt. The sentence was surprising and unusually swift. So, without any hope for deliverance, he finds himself handcuffed while riding in a prison bus to his hapless destiny. Directly because of a m?le, the bus tumbles down an embankment directly onto train tracks. The massive collision of a freight train and the bus is as sensational as ever seen on screen. The locomotive may be derailed, but its momentum chases Kimble as he desperately runs for his life (No models: The train and bus were real!). Skillfully able to evade his pursuers, Dr. Kimble works his way back to Chicago where he resumes contacts with his friends and sympathizers. With few places to lick his wounds in a hostile winter and with no resources ? and even slightly wounded ? Kimble somehow defies the odds and stays free. See how he casually walks into a hospital, and, as a doctor knows exactly what to do: (1) self treat his wound, (2) grab a quick meal, (3) shave his beard, (4) clean up, (5) find suitable clothing, and (6) leave in an ambulance.Kimble's pursuit is led by Deputy US Marshal Samuel Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones). Gerard is obsessed with catching Kimble, and his manhunt is on a massive scale. Tommy Lee Jones as Gerard, whose screen presence is immense, is steadfast in his mission. He is alert, intelligent, and weather-beaten, and leaves no doubt who is in charge. He often adopts a superior tone. But, in the course of the film, as new facts are presented, Gerard's facial expressions and body language subtlety change as he comes to realize that the beleaguered surgeon may be innocent after all. Yet, he doggedly keeps up the chase, as he has a job to do, and not judge (Kimble: "I didn't kill my wife!" Gerard: "I don't care!"). He has a team that includes right-hand man Cosmo Renfro (Joe Pantoliano), Erin Poole (L. Scott Campbell), Noah Newman (Tom Wood), and Biggs (Daniel Roebuck). There are other characters, like Kelly and Rosetti of the Chicago Police Department; Kelly is especially adamant about Kimble's guilt right up to the very end.Meanwhile Kimble, using his brains as well as his wits, is eventually able to gain access to Cook County Hospital, where he searches for those who have prosthetic right arms. The doctor narrows the search to a manageable five names. He finds one man, a Frederick Sykes (Andreas Katsulas), an ex-policeman working in the security business. In the meantime Kimble finds a place to stay in a Polish woman's basement apartment. He is betrayed by her drug-dealing son but escapes. Back in the hospital, Kimble is instrumental in saving a boy's life by a quick diagnosis and altering the regular hospital doctor's instructions.Kimble meticulously pieces the puzzle together and realizes that he, and not his wife, was the real target. Kimble breaks into sullied Sykes apartment for more information. Dr. Lentz, deceased (actually murdered) the previous year, and Kimble's supposed friend Dr. Charles Nichols (Jeroen Krabbe) falsified the records/research of the dangers of a new drug (RDU 90 = Provasic) that caused liver damage to line their pockets. Knowing that Kimble would be against them, they hired Sykes to do their dirty work. There is an altercation on the Chicago El with Kimble and Sykes. Kimble then heads for the Grand Ballroom where an honorary dinner is being held for Dr. Nichols, who is touting the dangerous new drug as a miracle. The final confrontation occurs on a rooftop and in a laundry room.The movie, focusing on two determined, smart, and hardy men pitted against each other, builds suspense and excitement with plausible situations (except for the dam leap, the origins of which may be Alfred Hitchcocks' 1942 feature, "Saboteur"). The chase is stronger than the murder plot, which can be confusing. But the performances are very good, and Harrison Ford certainly appears in his element although Tommy Lee Jones won the coveted Oscar. Although Sela Ward's character died early, flashbacks enhance her screen time. Great cinematography and on-location shooting are always a plus. A final word: Unlike many modern movies, the language is not vulgar. "The Fugitive" is enjoyable even after many viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the top films ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before watching this film I read that it was based on a 1960s TV series, that much of the dialogue was improvised, and that the script was still being written as filming started. That didn't bode well because, as we know, actors are interminably capable of speech, but dialogue is something different. However, maybe this is the exception to the rule, as Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones are both brilliant in their roles and if much of that was improvised, all credit to them.Jones got the Oscar for his role as by Lt. Gerard but Ford is equally impressive as the wronged Dr Richard Kimble, falsely accused of the murder of his wife (Sela Ward). We see her mostly in flashback and this is a believable relationship, unlike in the sequel using Wesley Snipes in the Ford role.The film is a cat and mouse chase as Gerard pursues Kimble through various settings. The sense of tension, perfectly backed by the music of James Newton Howard, builds like in a Hitchcock movie, which is a credit to director Andrew Davis. Michael Chapman's cinematography is crisp and sharp and clinical. Perfect for this film.As Kimble is being hunted by Gerard, he is himself hunting for the mysterious one-armed man who was the real murderer of his wife, but what was the motive? Using his medical knowledge and his analytical skill he aims to find his quarry before Gerard finds him! But Gerard is also piecing the truth together. Simple plot that twists and turns as it develops. In a sense you find yourself rooting for both men as they both come across as warm and intelligent, pursing their intertwined goals.I really can't find fault here. This is one of the top films ever. Why the IMDb rating is so low, I don't know. I'll do what I can to move it up a bit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Ford/Jones hide n seek story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not a new movie, in fact almost 20 years old, but I managed to catch it on the ION network this weekend. Ford and Jones look pretty young.The movie begins in the home at night, the wife is in her night clothes, there is a struggle, she ends up dead and the husband is accused of murder. We very briefly see the trial and a guilty verdict sends him to prison.Harrison Ford is the husband, Dr. Richard Kimble. He maintains his innocence and claims a "one-armed man" was in their home, he struggled with him, was knocked out and doesn't remember much.As he is being transported to prison there is a scuffle in the bus, it veers off the road, and tumbles down the embankment. When a guard says to him "you're a doctor, can you help him" regarding an injured man, Kimble answers "take my cuffs off." The movie might have ended quickly had it not been that the bus rolled onto train tracks, and now a train was about to hit. Kimble manages to get to safety and it took 90 minutes to determine for certainty that he had not died in the wreck but in fact escaped. The hunt was on.The hunt is directed by Tommy Lee Jones as US Marshall Samuel Gerard. And most of the rest of the movie involves the cat 'n mouse game, Gerard trying to track down Kimble. While Kimble's motive was to gather evidence to prove his innocence.Good movie, Ford and Jones are in top form here.SPOILERS: Kimble works his way back to Chicago and the hospital where he had worked. He pieced together clues that led him to the assassin with the prosthetic arm, and eventually back to another doctor who had been falsifying data in an important drug test to gain its approval. Dr Kimble was the target, not his wife, because he could expose the fraud and there was lots of $$Money on the line. All is well that ends well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Fugitive (1993) 9 User reviews are instructive in their often uniform dissection of what makes this such a fine movie drama. That, and IMDb contributors' high level of excitement and firm conviction of The Fugitive as being in the top 100 movies. It all adds up to rare praise. This reviewer thoroughly agrees. Director Andrew Davis must take much of the credit, because even though by now most audiences are familiar with the basic plot, the movie loses nothing when seen again. It is intelligent. The action scenes are spectacular yet believable, the pace constant and even. Harrison Ford, he of the permanent expression of dismay, is ideal as Dr Richard Kimble, convicted of murdering his beautiful wife for the insurance money. His defense team wasn't up to much: Richard is slated for a lethal injection, but fate frees him and he winds up on the run. This is enough to draw Marshal Samuel Gerard into the equation, in the person of Tommy Lee Jones. He has a blank expression akin to "you don't say?", and we see it lots as doctor and cop try to out-think each other. The doctor must avoid capture long enough to prove his innocence. The marshal, an assertive hunter, just wants to bring his quarry in. In the process, the audience is swept away with these two, and no wonder. It's not a matter of picking sides. Both men are smart and well-intentioned. Sit back and enjoy the magic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doctor Kimble needs a hand while he remains on the run.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the old TV show, and starring Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones, this movie remains a lesson in just how to rework something into a smart, entertaining blockbuster for modern audiences.Ford is Dr. Richard Kimble, the innocent man who is sent to jail for the brutal murder of his wife despite his insistence that it was committed by a one-armed man he fought with in his home. One crash later and he's on the run, being followed by human bloodhound Samuel Gerard (Jones). Can Kimble evade capture for as long as he needs to prove his innocence? Running at just about two hours, The Fugitive is perfectly paced so as to never outstay it's welcome. This is all thanks to the big set-pieces dotted throughout and the fact that the film focuses on the dynamic between Ford's fugitive and Jones's U.S. Marshall. The two stars have rarely been better and the dialogue from Jones remains immensely entertaining and quaotable.With a supporting cast including Sela Ward, Joe Pantoliano, Julianne Moore, Jeroen Krabbe and some other familiar faces, you get a good bunch who do well with the material but never get in the way of that central main attraction.Director Andrew Davis (with a script partly written by David Twohy, who would go on to direct the likes of Pitch Black and A Perfect Getaway) gets the whole thing just perfect, hitting some good beats and providing a lot of tension throughout, thanks to some nicely edited moments and some enjoyable confrontations.A big hit when it was released, The Fugitive remains a fantastic example of a big-budget blockbuster done the way they should be.See this if you like: The Defiant Ones, "Prison Break", The Chase.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A well respected Chicago surgeon Dr. Richard Kimble has found out that his wife, Helen, has been murdered ferociously in her own home. The police found Kimble and accused him of the murder. Then, Kimble was tried, convicted, and sentenced to death. However, on the way to prison, Kimble's transport crashed. Kimble escapes and is now on the run. Deputy Samuel Gerard from Chicago takes charge of the chase of Kimble. Meanwhile, Kimble makes up his own investigation to find who really killed his life, and to lure Gerard and his team into it as well.I loved this movie. I really liked it a lot. Compared to other chase films, this is one of the best. This movie is based off a TV series and no, I did not see it. However, I was really convinced that the events that happened in the film could happen in real life. It's realistic. This film is taught and intelligent. In fact, you find out who killed the protagonist's wife way early into the movie and does not play like a "whodunnit" film.However, the whole explanation in the end is a let-down, no doubt. In fact, the movie stretches a bit. The whole final act plays unlike anything from the the first two acts. I felt that the movie needed to end a bit earlier and the action in the end was going a bit too long and too far. Another thing I was annoyed with in here was the false or trick scenes, where something you think will happen but because it's a movie, something else happens. It's really clichd, I think.The performance by Harrison Ford was great. Tommy Lee Jones provides all the one liners here, which are more or less funny from other action movies. The action scenes in here are decent and sometimes great. Overall, it's a really good chase film, although it does fall short in the whole resolution and explanation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film with a powerful message.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Fugitive has very simple plot which can be summed up in a few lines: a woman is murdered her, husband is - wrongly - convicted of her murder and sentenced to death, he then escapes and attempts to prove his innocence whilst being pursued by a relentless US Marshall who will stop at nothing to get his man. That man is Dr Richard Kimble who is played brilliantly by Harrison Ford, in his best performance after Indiana Jones.Ford is very convincing as the man on the run - in my opinion he gets the nervousness, of a man constantly looking over his shoulder, spot on. Meanwhile Tommy Lee Jones is highly entertaining as the US Marshall Samuel Gerrard he refuses to give in until he has Kimble - dead or alive. Jeroen Krabbe meanwhile is quite menacing and very slippery as Doctor Charles Nichols, his financial motive contrasts nicely with the Chicago Police Department's belief that Kimble killed his wife for the money, even if it is a little unconvincing that a Doctor (who is "already rich") would go such extraordinary lengths - that of faking the results of a drugs trial and murder - simply for financial gain.The Fugitive is great entertainment with a fast paced plot that keeps you interested with just the right amount of twists and turns which are placed evenly through the film. The action meanwhile is fantastically over the top - the train crash and the dam scene are classic moments in cinema history, they are all the more entertaining for the fact that Kimble is clearly no action man and (like Indiana Jones) is not quite up to the job of evading Samuel Gerrard and the scheming of Nichols.Lastly it is worth noting that The Fugitive quite subtly points out the insanity of the death penalty - which in fact makes the film all the more uplifting for a Brit like me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Harrison Ford is arrested for killing his wife, a crime he didn't commit. Through some incredible luck, he escapes on the way to the prison and returns to Chicago, completely undetected because he shaves off his beard. Can he find the real killer before the marshals (led by Tommy Lee Jones) track him down? This film is considered one of the better films out there. It was good, but I wouldn't say it was the greatest. Having just watched "Striking Distance", I found some of the similarities to be a bit unfortunate. I mean, they're two very different films but coming out about the same time makes me suspicious.Ford is great of course and Jones is the perfect man to face him. Julianne Moore also gets a top billing, but I'm not sure why because she has no more than five minutes of screen time. I could have used a full hour of her.What keeps this film going is the mystery and conspiracy. It runs very deep and keeps you guessing, so much so that even in the end you may need to watch the movie again to really understand who is connected to who and what. I think I saw a plot hole or two, but maybe it was just so complex I couldn't tell! The action is also good (especially the train-bus collision) but this should not be your reason for watching it.If you liked this movie, I strongly recommend you read up on the case of Dr. Sam Shephard. My understanding is that his case was the basis for the show and movie, so you might want to see how things happen in real life. Just a suggestion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dr. Richard Kimble is accused of murdering his wife even though he witnessed a one armed man committing the crime. On his way to death row there is an accident that allows Kimble to escape. The hunt is on. Kimble goes on the hunt to find out who killed his wife and why, and U.S. Marshal Sam Gerard goes on the hunt for Kimble to bring him in. All the events leading up to the great climax make for an amazing cat and mouse thriller.Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones are great in this movie. No matter which one is on the screen you get the same vibe. Their characters both don't want to stop. They want to find who they're looking for, and they're not going to slow down until they do. To me, this is one of Harrison Ford's better roles. To me his films have been dwindling in quality lately. The scenes involving the U.S. Marshals provide some good comic relief that makes the mood of the film more lighthearted until the action picks up again.Andrew Davis does a really good job compacting four years of material from the TV show into a 2 hr. and 10 minute movie. He even gives the film a twist ending that you're not really expecting. What I really like about The Fugitive is that it's a non-stop action film, but it's not a popcorn flick. This is a real serious movie. The characters and dialogue are realistic, and they make use of several different emotions throughout the film. This is a great movie that if you haven't seen it, you should definitely rent or buy it. You won't regret it.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently came across a message on the IMDb message board for one of Hitchcock's classic thrillers challenging readers to name modern crime thrillers in the tradition of the master's work. I was surprised by the fact that several of the first few answers I thought of ("Witness", "Presumed Innocent", "The Fugitive" and "What Lies Beneath") all starred the same actor- Harrison Ford. In my view Ford is often underrated, particularly by the critics. (He has, for example, only ever received one Oscar nomination, for "Witness"). Perhaps his roles in the Star Wars and Indiana Jones series have led to his being unfairly categorised as an actor most at home in effects-laden blockbusters. He is not, perhaps, the most emotionally demonstrative of actors, but he is able to convey a sense of solidity and inner decency which make him valuable as the hero of crime thrillers as well as political thrillers like "Patriot Games" or "Air Force One". The surprise twist in "What Lies Beneath" came as particularly shocking for the very reason that a man we generally associate with solid, unflappable heroes actually turned out to be a villain, led astray by his inability to curb his emotions.In "The Fugitive" Ford plays Dr Richard Kimble, a doctor wrongly convicted of the murder of his wife and sentenced to death. (Ford does get to show some genuine emotions when Kimble breaks down after his wife's death and in the scene where he is being interrogated by the police). Kimble manages to escape when the bus which is taking him to prison is involved in a collision with a train following a failed escape attempt by another prisoner. Kimber is faced with a race against time to discover the reason why he was framed for the murder and to find out the identity of the real killer. He is pursued by Sam Gerard, a US marshal who has taken over the responsibility for investigating the case.In some ways the film is as much about Gerard as it is about Kimble. Kimble is a classically Hitchcockian figure, the straightforward hero wrongly accused of a crime and trying to prove his innocence. Gerard is an unusually complex character for the cop in a crime thriller. He starts off as a man simply trying to do his job as best he can, without thinking of deeper issues. When Kimble tells him "I didn't kill my wife", Gerard cynically replies "I don't care". As the film progresses, however, Gerard comes to believe in his quarry's innocence and a strange respect grows between the two men. Ford and the showier Tommy Lee Jones have different acting styles, but they combine well here. Jones is very good here, but I was rather surprised by his "best supporting actor" Oscar, as I felt that the Academy overlooked fine performances from two of the supporting actors in "Schindler's List", Ralph Fiennes and Ben Kingsley who was not even nominated.Besides good contributions from the two leading actors, "The Fugitive" is notable as an exciting, well-paced thriller. There are some memorable moments such as the heart-stopping train crash and the confrontation between Kimble and Gerard on top of the dam, followed by Kimble's plunge to safety. Occasionally one doubts the credibility of what one is seeing- it seemed unlikely, for example, that Kimble could have survived his dive from the dam unhurt, or that he should be so successful in eluding his pursuers even with so competent and dedicated a cop as Gerard in charge of them. These doubts, however, are generally quickly swept away by the pace of the action. Director Andrew Davis seems to specialise in thrillers, but this, one of the finest crime thrillers of the nineties, is best example of his work that I have seen. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent, influential big-screen treatment of an old TV show.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nowadays it seems that every other month there is a big-screen release adapted from an old TV show. Think about it.... they've virtually all be done: Lost In Space, The Avengers, Starsky &amp; Hutch, The Saint, Charlie's Angels, Fantastic Four, Mission: Impossible and Thuderbirds to name but a few, with more promised for the future (at the time I'm writing this, big-screen treatments of The A-Team and The Persuaders are on the cards). The trend for borrowing TV concepts and transforming them into major film releases really began with this 1993 offering. Knowledgeable film buffs might argue that Batman or even Flash Gordon pre-date The Fugitive and were also TV shows long, long ago, but both of those films actually drew their inspiration more from the original comic books than their television ancestors. Therefore, The Fugitive is probably the first genuine cinematic version of an old TV show. Ironically, after all the years since its release, it is still the best of the bunch too!Dr Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford) returns home one night to find his wife bleeding to death and a burglar in his house. He fights with the burglar, and discovers that his assailant actually has a prosthetic arm, before finally being overwhelmed. When the police arrive, they refuse to believe that Kimble's wife was murdered by an intruder and instead charge Kimble himself with the crime. He is convicted and put on Death Row. However, Kimble gets an unexpected chance to clear his name when the bus transporting him to jail crashes off the road and ends up straddling a railway line. Kimble makes a breathtaking escape from the crippled vehicle and goes on the run in the neighbouring woodland. Ace FBI agent Sam Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones) is brought in to track down the fugitive and the two of them are soon locked in a battle of wills, which ends when Kimble makes a remarkable escape from his pursuers in a storm drain. Later, Kimble makes his way to Chicago where he begins to piece together the mystery of his wife's murder, eventually realising that he was set up to divert attention from a conspiracy in the medical world.Ford is terrific as the titular fugitive and he gets superb support from Jones as the Federal Marshal on his tail (the latter got an Oscar for his efforts). The film is brilliantly scripted by Jeb Stuart and David Twohy, who manage to remain faithful to the plot of the original show, while updating it for contemporary audiences and condensing it into a 2 hour narrative. James Newton Howard also does a fabulous job with his score, which is emotional and exciting at all the right moments. The story is paced very thoughtfully, so that the characters are introduced and developed meaningfully, without tedium setting in while the viewers await the action. The Fugitive is a terrific film, totally absorbing and exciting from beginning to end, and easily one of the films of its year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How to make a good thriller... solid Ford, great Tommy lee jones</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Andrew Davis' fugitive is one of the most suspenseful and well acted thrillers from the 90s. I respect this film because it featured a couple actors (ford and Jones) that are not my favorites but give two of their best performances here. However highlight was still Joe Pantoliano for me, he was great in his role as a deputy marshal. The story is a bout wrongfully framed doctor who is on the run from the US marshalls. It is a well written script, and is suspenseful and interesting at all times. This film was very entertaining to watch. It drags you along with it, it was a rare time where i cared for Ford's character, i think Davis got it right with this one, simply a very good thriller 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>discrepancy in the movie - about Kimble's keys</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What I don't understand: there is a comment toward the end of the movie by Girard that Dr. Nichols borrowed Richard K.'s car and his keys, and "thus there was no forced entry." But WHEN were the keys used? How did Sykes use the keys, and yet get them back to Dr. Nichols just about the same time, so that Nichols could get them back to Richard? Because Sykes had stayed in the apartment - he attacked Kimble after attacking his wife. Did one of those 2 (N, S) make copies? The time frame would not allow the scenario as presented. To me, there is a great inconsistency here, a puzzle that annoys the heck out of me. Anyone notice this? Anyone can explain it all to me? Or am I missing something obvious? I watched the movie twice this weekend and still didn't get that solved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Revisiting The Fugitive was 131 minutes well spent.My favorite line. Tomy Lee Jones: "I need a rest". This is a rollercoaster of a film viewing experience. The action never ceases, and the plot and characters are at least 51% of the time believable. I'm wondering how Harrison Ford survives that long waterfall jump, and in soaked clothing manages to avoid dieing of hypothermia wrapped up in nothing but a bed of leaves in the dead of winter. But then he is a doctor. And they can do things like that because they know everything.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top notch thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like a lot of Hitchcock films, The Fugitive centers on the premise of a wrongfully accused man who must clear his name. The cat and mouse game between him and his nemesis makes for exhilarating entertainment. The entire exercise seems plausible. Dr. Kimble goes about his task in a logical and efficient manner and U.S. Marshall Gerard chases him with a frenzied zeal. The close calls are exciting. Though the stunts are spectacular, especially the famous plunge from the drain and the leap from the onrushing train, thankfully they do not overshadow the human drama. A top notch thriller, 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Fugitive pits Harrison Ford against the U.S. Marshall's as he races to find the man who murdered his wife and got him framed for the murder. What ends up happening is Tommy Lee Jones is hired as one of the U.S. Marshall's to hunt down Ford. As the troubled doctor, Ford conveys his emotions perfectly, showing a soft side yet a grim determination to find out what really happened. As the Marshall, Tommy Lee Jones gives off one of his most serious performances that injects a very well- crafted hard edge. Unfortunately, Tommy Lee Jones was awarded an Academy Award for his performance, and it was a definite must that Schindler's List star Ralph F. should have won. The script is kinetic and perfectly structured by providing fierce energy with some very witty and carefully worded dialogue. The direction is unusually emotional as it dwells quite a bit upon Ford's trauma on the death of his wife. Things connect well enough but there are some flaws too. Some of the chase sequences (Ford jumping into the water) were just downright insane and stood out as being totally unrealistic. Also, the pace was too slow sometimes as it got repeating from chase to chase to chase. A similar problem was encountered in Steven Spielberg's Catch Me if You Can. The Fugitive stands out as one of the few sharp modern thrillers and is a definite must for fans of the genre. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers!This is a fly by your seat kind of film, as described in the documentaries following my purchased version of the movie. No script, not really. Actors contributing lines as they saw fit. Ford involved in plotting and direction. And so on.It's no surprize, then, that there are plot holes and discontinuities. The surviving guard gives his 'bs' story on the assumption that the black guard was already recovered. Yet some time later, just after the famous 'doughnut' remark by Jones - another of his own improv lines - they find the black guard. Lentz dies 'last summer'. But Kimble meets Lentz at the benefit/runway show. And that much time just doesn't seem to have elapsed. In fact, it seems as if he's back in Chicago within days, or at least a week, of his escape. He fingers Nichols. But if he knew of the connection between Lentz and Nichols, why did he imagine Nichols was innocent? As others have mentioned, why would he grab the ambulance (as Jones character says where could he be going in an ambulance?)? In fact, why would he approach the black guard, and then shout the advice on the wound, when it would have been self-evident to any doctor, inside? Clearly, they has this chase set up. But they didn't really need an ambulance for that. And why does Jones/Gerard actually try to gun down Kimble as he slips through the bulletproof glass doors? Was it just to show off the 'wax pellet' guns used as props? And so on.Other than the contrivances, and holes in the 'script', it's a pretty watchable drama, and after repeated viewings. Ford tends to look stunned most of the time. But Jones goes from a look of terror in the tunnel when he realizes the 'fugitive' just picked up his loaded gun, to anger at the dam and the bulletproof door, to humor and so on. It's quite a range and believably acted - which is why he probably got the academy award.The other actors do a good job. Krabbe is believable and menacing at the last. One-armed man Katsulas is frightening as the 'mob killer', or whatever he is (head of security). I wondered about the black cop in glasses who seems to show up in three different scenes. For a big budget movie, you'd think they'd disguise him to make it look as if they weren't using the same 'extras' over and over again.The idea of the big corporate scheme to defraud isn't so far-fetched. The idea that it was a hit on Kimble is, since he hadn't connected his participation, and didn't know anything about Lentz. And I don't understand why he was called to a 'provasic-gone-bad' operation in order that his wife would be alone? And it's surprizing he'd have so much trouble with Sykes on the stairs, especially after loosening his arm. Ford/Kimble is a pretty strong and agile guy.At any rate, for all the difficulties of 'moving the shoot along', it's a decent film, with a good performance by Tommy Lee Jones, even for a couple of hammy lines (the 'big dog' stuff). If it's watchable, it's because of the care put into the stunts, the train wreck, and other things you don't notice at first, that don't fall into strange and inconsistent plotting. So if you try not to say to yourself - now, wait a minute, didn't he just . . . - and keep up with action to move the 'plot', it's a good film. It's one of the better films of the 1990s. And that's due to the acting, to the action, to the care put into the sets, scenes and stunts, and definitely not because they spent an undue amount of time trying to come up with a believable script.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best fugitive movie in the world. Highly underrated though...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Fugitive is a classic detective movie. It is stylish in every aspects: the music , the editing, the direction, the story. There are many surprising moments as there are in any crime movie. The music is classy and fits in any modern detective movie. It has many great punch- lines. I loved the U.S. Marshals too. They were ever-ready and completely active. Harrison Ford was great. He is a smart fugitive who is convicted of killing his own wife and he is innocent. His efforts to prove his innocence was quite smart and that's the most entertaining part. But, in my opinion, Tommy Lee Jones was the best. He acted very well as a bad ass U.S.Marshal who will stop at nothing. His role in this movie is one of my all time favorites. All in all, Fugitive is surprising and age had no effect on this masterpiece. IMDb really surprises me sometimes by giving quite low ratings to great movies like these.Still it doesn't change a thing for me. Just go for it!10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Truly Great Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"THE FUGITIVE" I remember watching the weekly TV series starring David Janssen as a small boy back in the 1960s. Well, I just watched the remake of David Janssen's "The Fugitive," this one starring Harrison Ford, Tommy Lee Jones, and Joe Pantoliano and I must say it's great. I normally don't say this about remakes, but this film really is great. It's emotionally charged from beginning to end, takes you on a roller-coaster ride all the way through keeping you riveted to the edge of your seat with heart-pounding action all the way through. I give it a "Thumbs-Up!" And, that's not something I do with very many remakes. Thanks guys, for a great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know how you have that "Must See" list of films that you never get round to watching? I had "The Long Kiss Goodnight" on my list for 10 years but this movie trumps that, a long 16 years after release! Question is, was it worth the wait? Well, yes and no. Obviously, no film is worth waiting that long for unless you're the sort of obsessive fan associated with certain sci-fi franchises. But "The Fugitive" is, perhaps surprisingly, still a quality action movie that continues to be a benchmark after all this time. Tense, thrilling and lifted further by Tommy Lee Jones in blistering form, this is one movie that has not lost its power over time.Based on the TV show of the same name, "The Fugitive" opens with the brutal murder of Helen Kimble (Sela Ward), the wife of brilliant Chicago surgeon Dr Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford). Wrongly convicted of her murder and sentenced to death, Dr Kimble escapes and sets out to find the one-armed man who did kill her. Trying to catch him is relentless US Marshall Sam Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones) and his dedicated team who don't really care whether Kimble did it or not. And so begins arguably the best manhunt ever committed to film...A bold statement but compare this to the half-hearted sequel "US Marshalls" (despite Jones' presence) and you begin to understand why "The Fugitive" is held in high regard. There's no CG stunt work, no pointless explosions or needlessly slow-mo gun fights. This is simply a great film that doesn't patronise or try to be anything other than a gripping battle of wills that never lets go of your attention. In fact, the only fault I can think of is that you are just as likely to cheer for Jones as you are for Ford - he thoroughly deserved his Best Supporting Actor Oscar as the helplessly charismatic Gerard. Actually, there is another fault but only if you're a fan of the TV show "Scrubs" - Neil Flynn's all-too-brief appearance will raise a faint smile which breaks the tension somewhat but it quickly passes, thankfully. But from the moment where Kimble escapes from a wonderfully staged train crash, the film rarely lets the tension relax as both Kimble and Gerard get increasingly desperate to get what they both want.Chances are, though, that you won't have waited 16 years to catch this fantastic action blockbuster. But if you have then prepare yourself for a movie that not only thrills and entertains with ease but one that still can produce the goods today. It stands head-and-shoulders above any other chase movie you could think of (including director Andrew Davis' other famous chase movie "Chain Reaction") but is also a cracking thriller movie that actually delivers the goods. All you have to do is now go out and catch it...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this first in the theater shortly after its' August 1993 release. I saw it again on fresh video release about seven months later,and sometime later on a medium I don't immediately recall. EAch time I am struck by the fact that,despite my(And anybody's,really)ability to practically recite,not only the plot but the sequence of events,even some of the exact lines spoken by each character,this film just plain simply DOES NOT lose its potency,interest,energy or even suspense. Credit goes to the actors--not only HArrison Ford and Tommy Lee JOnes as pursued and pursuer,but also JOnes' posse of fellow feds(Joe PAntoliano,Tom Wood,Daniel Roebuck among them)and the shady side characters such as Dr.Kimble's colleague(Jeroen Krabbe)or the one-armed man himself(hulking,brooding Andreas KAtsulas)--for building the interest through intelligence and uncanny acting AND reacting. Director Andrew DAvis,a whiz at action films,is able to camera shoot and plan practically every element of this film to exquisite perfection! David Twohy's script is parts construction and ad-lib(if you see the extras on the DVD,you'll know what I mean),and the ability for Ford and some minor players,such as Ron DEan and Joe Katsulas as the arresting and highly suspicious(!)detectives,to be able to create a great sense of conflict and reaction to add tension.I just caught this again as a free rental,and to me there's really no price on it. I'd buy it,I'd see it on the tele. Maybe you all know the story of the beleaguered and ultimately innocent Dr.Richard Kimble and his chief,cunning, "Les Miserables"-like law enforcement pursuer Philip/Samuel Gerard,but that still shouldn't hinder one from seeing and--for me,anyway--enjoying this excellent piece of big budget film-making(a somewhat rare commodity it seems anymore)again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first to show that TV series makes a great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well here's a rarity. A film based on a 1963-67 TV series would've been laughed at in the early 1990's. In 1993, Andrew Davis took a beloved TV series and turned it not only a critically acclaimed movie but a $183 million dollar box office smash that also won the 1994 People's Choice Awards, Golden Globe nominations, The Critic's Choice Awards and not but not least, The Oscar For Tommy Lee Jones as best support actor. Very rare that a movie based on a TV series would earn such praise.Dr. Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford)is a surgeon who after a party, finds his wife, Helen (Sela Ward) murdered and is attacked by a one armed burglar. With his wife dead, fingerprints all over the crime scene and a 911 call by Helen, this would seem to indicate that Kimble is the killer. Kimble proclaims his innocence but the evidence seals his fate. Convicted and sent to die by lethal injection, fate has an unusual hand for Kimble. On a prisoner transport. a riot ensues, causing a train wreck that frees Kimble and begins his quest to clear his name. On his trail is US Marshall Sam Gerard (Jones) an officer that is determined to get Kimble,alive or dead. As the two men play cat and mouse, Kimble will find evidence pointing that the murder of Helen was meant for him and uncovers a web of greed and medical corruption while Gerard also finds the same evidence that shows that Kimble may be innocent. Will Kimble find the answers to clear his name or will Gerard and his team capture him? Sounds like a great premise for a movie and in 1993, it was. With a great script, taut direction and great performances by everyone, The Fugitive destroyed the notion that TV shows can't make great movies. By taking basic ingredients and turning it into there own, the film wound up being the first film to get award nominations and publicly acclaimed too. Buy it or rent it and see why it remains a classic even today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harrison Ford vs. David Janssen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this movie came out in 1993, I was curious about several things. (1) How Harrison Ford would play the role as opposed to David Janssen. Ford did a great job of playing a specialist in a big city hospital. I thought, though, that since David Janssen's Dr. Kimble was a pediatrician in a small town, his was a more likable character. Also, Harrison Ford's Dr. Kimble had a pretty weak motive. Why would a vascular surgeon want to murder his wife for money? David Janssen's Dr. Kimble at least had a bone of contention with his wife, although I know we can't blame Harrison Ford for that.(2) How would they handle Dr. Kimble roaming from town to town solving everyone's problems and moving on in the neighborhood of two hours? (3) How long could Dr. Kimble run and hide, considering forensics were much better in the mid 90s than they were in the mid 60s? I admit I went into that movie ready to compare it to the original TV series, and was ready to rip it to shreds. However, the more I got involved in the movie, the more I forgot that it was spawned from my all-time favorite television show. This movie is pretty doggone exciting. By the time I got out of the theater, I had made up my mind that The Fugitive was a great movie and a great TV show. 9 out of 10 for this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The chase is on!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen "The Fugitive" dozens of times over the years, and it's one of the most enduring and intelligent thrillers ever made. Like any thriller by director William Friedkin, it's basically one long chase that never pauses or lets you take a breather; it's that exhausting an experience to watch "The Fugitive." And it has the performances to boot. Based on the television series, Harrison Ford is Dr. Richard Kimble, a respected Chicago surgeon who is wrongfully accused of brutally murdering his wife (Sela Ward). Sentenced to die by lethal injection by the courts, fate and an attempted jail break (culminating in one of the most exciting action sequences in the film) spring Richard free, and place him on the run for his life as he searches for the real killer. The killer in this case, a one-armed man, is the obsession of the good doctor as he dawns disguises and tries to stay one step ahead of dogged F.B.I. marshal Sam Gerard (Best Supporting Actor Oscar-winner Tommy Lee Jones) and his team of law enforcement officers. And the chase is on. As the picture roles, we're in the action with two men who are both chasing after radically different goals; it's the hunter and the hunted. We're with Ford's desperate doctor as he searches vigorously for a fiendish murderer, and we're with Jones' agent as he tracks Kimble's trail. Andrew Davis ("Under Siege") directs the film's frequent chase sequences with intense focus that is reminiscent of what we've become used to in Friedkin's action films. It's really exciting stuff here.10/10</fullReview>

My guess is that the main responsible for this can only be the director.All Andrew Davis' films I saw were interesting, but still not that good as this one. It seems that the order of the scenes is interesting, so that when you see one scene it makes you want to see the next one. The Tommy Lee Jones' character in the movie is one of the best detective characters I've ever seen.

		<shortDescription>A solidly enjoyable thriller with a solid plot and plenty of thrills and fun acting from a scene-stealing Jones</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Dr Richard Kimble returns home to find his wife dying and an one-armed man fleeing the scene, nobody believes his story and he finds himself on a bus heading upstate for the rest of his life. When an accident finds him freed from his guards, the US Marshals are brought in to hunt him down. Slipping the net, Kimble starts to try and solve the murder by following up the clue that nobody else bothered to ? the presence of the one-armed man.It is difficult to comprehend that I first saw this film over a decade ago, have seen it several times since but yet it is still as exciting, fresh and enjoyable as it was the first time I saw it. Perhaps this is down to the fact that the film relies on good old fashioned thrills rather than gimmicks or loads of special effects. The story is interesting, gets down to business very quickly and never really lets up until the end; not an explosive pace but a constant and steady one that has highs but very few lows. Kimble's investigation is the heart of the story but ironically also throws up the slower moments where it is possible to pick holes in the logic but this is a minor fault that I only felt because the rest of the film does its stuff pretty darn well. It is the manhunt where the film comes alive and it is never better than when the two elements come together. The chase keeps up the pace and the sudden moments of action are as exciting as they are memorable. It is not without slow moments and elements of the plot do tend to require you to suspend belief but this is made easier by the way it tends to grip and involve you.The cast are roundly good; Ford is sturdy and reliable as ever, doing both the "everyman" act and action man role as well as each other however he is simply put in the shade by Tommy Lee Jones who enjoys himself tremendously. He has all the best lines, all the best scenes, is a tough action hero in the way all men wish they were, decisive, tough and has good action scenes; it is telling that the Fugitive 2 was made on the basis of his performance alone. While Jones is great, he is well supported by his Marshals in the form of Pantoliano, Dean, Wood and others. Krabbe is solid enough but, like the others within the murder case, they are less interesting than those within the manhunt. Suffice to say though that the performance you'll remember is from Tommy Lee Jones.Overall this is a solid thriller, the type of film that I look to Hollywood to produce because this is their strength. The plot is solid enough and mixes an exciting manhunt with a murder investigation, producing a constant pace that is only made better by a hatful of exciting set pieces spread throughout the film. The fact that Jones is such good value only helps the entertainment value of the piece, making the film an enjoyably old-fashioned thriller that continues to stand up to the test of time surprisingly well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can you picture anyone other than Harrison Ford playing Dr. Richard Kimble? Can you picture anyone other than Tommy Lee Jones playing Marshal Gerard? The Fugitive is one of the rare remakes. It took an established entertainment product (The Fugitive was a hugely popular television show in the 1960s) and redefined it for new viewers. Older movie goers might not have been able to accept Ford and Jones in their roles, but for the younger movie-goers, the actors inhabited their roles so much that they became those characters. Tommy Lee Jones has been living off of his hard boiled image established in The Fugitive for the past decade. The Fugitive pretty much tells the same story that the TV show did. Dr. Kimble comes home from work to find his wife dead and he becomes the prime suspect. Dr. Kimble is then sentenced to death after his trial. During the transport back to jail, some of the other prisoners attempt a daring escape, resulting in Dr. Kimble escaping the transport bus himself. Now free himself, Kimble attempts to clear his name by finding his wife's murder, he's looking for the infamous one-armed man. Kimble is able to stay one step ahead of the US Marshals trying to relocate him, lead by Gerard. Directed by Andrew Davis, the movie features the right about of action and classic whodunit to keep viewers guessing. The scenes that were most effective were the ones that Kimble hides in plain sight as a janitor, where every person that looks at him might be the one who turns him in. The ending is satisfactory, in so much we finally see Tommy Lee Jones smile. Perhaps we can pause that moment and tell our kids that it did happen once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the one armed man became a suspect police were assigned to watch the house. The one armed man was told to take care of Dr Richard Kimble. Knowing the police were watching the one armed man had to create a diversion to enable him to leave the house. At this time the one armed man called the fire department. The Fire Engine pulled up in front of the house and the fire jumped off the truck. The fire engine was at least a 1950 or 1960 model with no decals, however the big mistake was yet to come. As the firefighters rounded the engine it was obvious to firefighters like myself that the engine had NO HOSE in the hose bed. Although most people would not notice the mistake any firefighter would have. It was probably a poor attempt at saving money. The Chicago firefighters are good but not that good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A murder is committed, an innocent husband convicted, an escape happens, and the chase for "The Fugitive" is on.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie version, based on the television series of the same title, hits on all cylinders that can make a movie great. There's action aplenty, astonishing escapes by the fugitive, played by Harrison Ford, near-misses by the pursuing US Marshall, played by Tommy Lee Jones, fantastic stunts on screen, and suspense that holds the viewer on the edge of his/her seat. This is a definite film to grace a collection of any home viewer.If one recalls, the TV series had a doctor wrongly convicted of the crime of murdering his wife, when the real killer was an one-armed man. Dr. Kimble escaped from his prison lock-up, then spent several tv seasons hunting for the guilty killer, and at the same time, trying to avoid being recaptured by a Lt. Gerard. The movie makes use of the basic program, but then alters the escape of Dr. Kimble, limits the locality to Chicago, and introduces a drug-related scheme that Kimble stumbled onto, and would have prevented a medical company from reaping millions of dollars in the drug's sale.The viewer is asked to follow "The Fugitive" as he stays just one jump, literally, ahead of the law. There's a very realistic train wreck staged, which helps spring the good doctor, a leap down a waterfall, which keeps him out of the clutches of the US Marshal Gerard, and many more realistic stunts. Catch this film, on tape, or DVD. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Incredible Ford vs The Real Jones</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a story behind me and The Fugitive.(Said in best Sophia Petrillo, of The Golden Girls, voice) Picture it: Phoenix. 1993. A movie critic, much like the one you're reading now, who writes for a college column with the same name, wants to see a double feature with his buddy: Jurassic Park and The Fugitive. The paper advertises a "free" screening of The Fugitive following the final showing of Jurassic Park at the original Cine Capri. So, he goes to buy both tickets at the box office, but the clerk informs him of the misprint in the newspaper and that only ones with preselected passes can attend the sneak preview of The Fugitive that Thursday evening.Disappointed, but devious, that young reporter has plans and attends Jurassic Park for his third time. Heck, it was Cine Capri ? a local legend of a theatre ? and it's a big-screen movie. Following that movie, he goes to the lobby and talks to the manager who's scrambling around because this promises to be a not only booked presentation, but over-sold screening of The Fugitive. The manager repeats that the newspaper misrepresented their viewing of the Harrison Ford movie that wasn't supposed to open until the next day. He said to the young movie reviewer, "Unless you have a pass?"Smartly, the future Reevesreviews.com admin pulls out his college-press-badge he happened to have on him and convincingly (and visually panicked) states: "I did have a pass, but I left it in the newsroom."Honestly, he did get many passes, but not for this one. Shhh, don't spread it to the manager that probably doesn't work for the same company, now 17 years later. The manager surprisingly okays the deceit and allows the two buddies back into the auditorium to watch The Fugitive. But, before he did, he noticed the line outside, the line of people that apparently wrapped around the building indicating that not all who actually did have passes could see the movie. Even though it was Cine Capri, and it had a large number of seats, it didn't have enough to supply the mass-mailing of the free passes.Smiling, the young male didn't care. He was about to watch a fantastic movie. A movie that would still hold up in spades nearly two decades later. A movie based on a TV-show he has still yet to see.It doesn't matter. He, or rather, I loved the film. It contained great action segments, wonderful acting ? Ford as Dr. Richard Kimble was superb while Tommy Lee Jones would rightfully earn his only Oscar a few months later, a powerful score and enough suspense and intrigue that you don't have to see the original source material.Kimble is living the wonderful social life with a beautiful wife in tow until his wife is bludgeoned to death and the good doc is accused, sentenced, jailed and transported until a chance ? and explosive ? escape leaves him free to search for the, gasp!, the one-armed man who really killed his wife (Ward.) It's up to U.S. Marshalls, led wonderfully by Gerard (Jones) to catch the fugitive(s) in an unbiased and unforgiving way.Against impossible, and I do mean IMPOSSIBLE, ways, Kimble thwarts the authorities and puts the pieces together to regain his innocence and freedom. Will Gerard catch up with the lone doctor? Will he care? He clearly says he doesn't.This movie is flat exciting and simple. Barely a CGI moment, if any and it relies heavily on the acting of both Ford and Jones in classic cat 'n' mouse fashion. And it works, it really does. You will have to get pass the endless "OH! He's gonna get caught here! No, he's definitely done for there!" moments ? which worked better in the superior The Silence of the Lambs and most of all, the 93-story-drop Kimble survives off a dam. (Yeah, that's an exaggeration, but not too far off.)This is the first viewing I've had of this movie in a long time, and with what I've been seeing this past decade, this was thoroughly refreshing. I love pre-CGI movies and especially movies that rely on heart, plot and acting vs. special effects. This is a must see?Even if you have to lie your way into the theatre.Did I mention, that young reporter got his pick of any seat as, he and his friend were the first ones in the auditorium before anyone else was let in? Oh, yeah. Those were the days.Side Note: When I originally watched this, one of my first thoughts was: Ford, as shown here as the runaway Kimble, would make the ideal movie adaptation of David "Bruce" Banner if they ever made a Hulk movie. Unbeknownst to me, it would be another 10 years until they did, in fact, finally bring the Hulk to the big screen. By then, Ford was probably too old. Either way, I grew up on the TV version of The Incredible Hulk and saw the late (he would die, literally, a few months following this movie's opening) Bill Bixby in Ford. Maybe it's just me, but watch for yourself and think David Banner on the run here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Ford's best movies!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Richard Kimble (Ford) is wrongly accused of his wife's murder and is being relentlessly pursued by the police (led by Tommy Lee Jones) who will do anything to capture Ford, but who is even more hell-bent on clearing his name and bringing the real murderer to justice.It is classic police's chase as Ford escapes from the bus on its way to prison, relying on his doctor's smarts to outwit the vigilance of a veteran detective, always staying one step ahead and at the same time, trying to get the police on his side and using what they know to assist him to investigate his wife's murder. The surprise comes when the real murderer is actually his good friend. When Samuel (Jones) realizes the police is chasing the wrong man, he quits being the 'bad' guy and pretty much teams up with Ford in the end to catch the real culprit.The director wins my praise by not wasting time on long and meaningless dialog unrelated to the story, but rather lets the action to speak for itself from the desperate measures a man can go to clear his name. This is a smart movie reminiscent of the Bourne Trilogy, also about a man pursuing the truth about his real identity.I bought the VCD for S$3 after renting the DVD. To me this movie is for keeps!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE FUGITIVE- REVIEWI was walking through K-Mart the other night when I stumbled across "The Fugitive- Special Edition" DVD. I was in the mood for buying a DVD so I thought I'd check it. It had lots of bonus features plus it was $9.95. I was sold. I actually felt I was ripping K-Mart off. If they knew it was my 2nd favorite movie of all-time, could they have charged me more? Anyway I watched it this morning and here's my observations:-To fully appreciate the movie, you have to (1) know it is loosely based on a true story (2) have watched the TV series from the 60's. -This movie contains the only enjoyable role ever played by Tommy Lee Jones. -It's probably also Harrison Ford's last good movie, unless you count "Air Force One" as a comedy. -I reckon if he went in the outfit he stole from the old guy in the hospital in his initial court trial and not the suit with the beard, he would have got off with good behavior. -Great quote 1 (when he's being quizzed at the station) "Financially, you're not gonna be hurting after this". I'm gonna use that when consoling people at the next funeral I attend of a well-off family. -I know it would have ruined the film, but I gotta ask, if they're killing people to cover up this thing, why didn't they kill Kimble? Didn't it occur to them that even is they successfully framed him and he went to prison to wait for the lethal injection, he would have had a few years to do research and chase down the one armed man. All he needed was internet access and someone like Chloe from "24"and he would have solved it in a week. -That bus rollover is still one of the best car accident scenes in a movie. Brilliant. The train crashing into it is even better. Watch the DVD to see the fascinating insight to the making of that scene. Amazing. The only digital effect was Kimble jumping from the bus. -Great quote 2 from Deputy Gerrard "You wanna change your %^&amp;*(*&amp;^ story" -Great quote 3 from Deputy Gerrard "Think me up one of them chocolate donuts with the sprinkles on top" -The tunnel scene is totally implausible. Watching closely you'll see cops from both ends were no more than 20 meters from him- and they missed seeing him jump down a sewer. That's not even considering the jumping off bit. -One thing everyone in the world knows from movies. If you have to call the cops, don't talk too long or they'll trace the call. Be careful if you're ever in this position of cops trying to drag out the call. -It's amazing that this movie isn't particularly brilliant in any one area, yet it keeps you gripped the whole way. Much like "Heat" it contains 1 awesome action sequence but other than that just plays out a very well written story with just 1 ridiculous scene. And the stars only share a few minutes of time together on screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Fugitive is up there with the best thrillers of all time. I cannot believe this movie is not there with the IMFD top 250. Harrison Ford was terrific as usual. From, the very beginning of the film you felt compassion for this man. He also captured the essence of a man struggling to find the killer in this giant city. Tommy Lee Jones brought wit and charisma to the film. He deserved the Oscar he got and his quotes were brilliant. Everything in this movie was great and designed to keep the audience in the edge of their seats. It was difficult to watch it in the theater because of the huge sound effects coming from the other auditorium that was playing Jurrassic Park. I recommend this movie for anyone and it is one of the great movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely the best adaptation of any TV series to the big screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>""Name: Richard Kimble. Profession: Doctor of Medicine. Destination: Death Row, State Prison. Richard Kimble has been tried and convicted for the murder of his wife. But laws are made by men, carried out by men. And men are imperfect. Richard Kimble is innocent. Proved guilty, what Richard Kimble could not prove was that moments before discovering his wife's body, he encountered a man running from the vicinity of his home. A man with one arm. A man he had never seen before. A man who has not yet been found. Richard Kimble ponders his fate as he looks at the world for the last time. And sees only darkness. But in that darkness, fate moves its huge hand." And with those words, David Janssen as Dr. Richard Kimble, began a four year television odyssey as The Fugitive, the innocent man wrongly convicted of murdering his wife. For four years Kimble managed to just barely stay one step ahead of Philip Gerard, the police Lieutenant obsessed with his capture. The question is could such a premise be translated in an entertaining manner to the Big Screen with just a little over two hours to do it in? The answer is yes, yes, and yes.In Director Andrew Davis's film version, he gives us a lesson in how to translate a television series to the big screen. You update the story enough so it will appeal to the audiences of the nineties, you find actors such as Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones for the lead, and you keep the heart and soul of what the original series was about. In this version of The Fugitive, Ford plays the part of renown surgeon Dr. Richard Kimble. One night after coming home from an emergency operation, he encounters a man with a prosthetic arm in the process of killing his wife, Helen(nicely played with beauty and grace by Sela Ward). After a brief struggle, the one armed man escapes and Kimble tries unsuccessfully to revive his wife. Kimble is questioned then arrested and convicted for the murder of Helen. All this is cleverly portrayed on the screen by interlacing flashbacks with courtroom testimony. It enables director Davis to have the story quickly progress, yet fill us in with enough background that we are immediately sympathetic to Kimball's plight. Later, as Kimball is being transferred with other prisoners on a bus, an escape attempt by the other inmates goes awry, causing a spectacular train crash which enables Kimball to escape. From this point on, the suspense is piled on and will keep you riveted until the final outcome.David Janssen will always be remembered for his dark brooding characterization of Kimball on television, but in what I consider one of his best portrayals ever, Ford brings his own special quality to the role. He makes us so aware of his deep love and devotion to Helen in the early parts of the film, so that we can immediately identify with him. Like Janssen's Kimball, Ford's portrayal is often quiet and unspoken but in a way that makes us believe this is because of necessity rather than a character trait. In the original series, Kimball would always interact in the lives of many strangers he met every week, to give us insight into his character. In this film version we meet many of the people who have known and worked with Kimball. What this does is give us more of an insight into his character in a short space of time. Through this plot device, we understand that Kimball is not just a good surgeon, but an equally good human being. It's adjustments such as this in the storyline that makes this series to motion picture translation work so well.There are other things. In the original series, Lt. Gerard was an Indiana police lieutenant. In this version he is now a Deputy U.S. Marshall. Whereas Barry Morse's portrayal of Gerard in the series was of a single minded almost business like attitude, Tommy Lee Joneses Gerard is also single minded but hardly business like. He brings a whole new dimension to the role of the U.S. Marshall who has only one intention, to do his job no matter what, and bring his prey in anyway he can even if it's on a stretcher. Tommy Lee Jones has played many interesting and complex characters, but when he is on the screen as Gerard, he commands the attention of not only his deputies, but the motion picture audience as well.Writers Jeb Stuart and David Twohy also prove it's possible to put entertaining and interesting dialog into a script along with action and suspense. Just as there were numerous near captures by Gerard in the TV series, there are many here also. By incorporating all the latest crime solving technology into their story, the writers are also able to add even more to the suspense as it makes it that much more difficult for Kimball to find his wife's killer while he continually evades capture. Director Davis and his writers use one more clever device that is perhaps what really makes this film work. Through early events that happen in the film, it is perfectly clear that Gerard doesn't care whether or not Kimball killed his wife. The only thing he cares about is recapturing Kimball and returning him to prison. As Kimball begins to unravel the mystery of his wife's death, he leaves clues for Gerard as to what his intentions are. As the film progresses, and although he would never admit to it, we see Gerard develop a vast curiosity about the Kimball case, enough so that he does begin to care. Because of this, when the end of the film does come, it is that much more satisfying.All in all, this is not only the best action/suspense film of the nineties, it is easily one of the most entertaining films of that decade. And when a film is that good, you have no choice but to give it my grade which is an A+.   </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but definitely not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a decent action/detective movie with good pacing and good acting all around. My main problem with the movie centers around the holes in the plot: while it's suggested, it's never clearly stated why Helen was murdered; the fudged clinical trials of the drug all being ultimately controlled by one doctor seems rather unlikely; the number of times Kimble goes unrecognized by people who should know him on-sight (even without the beard) goes beyond the realm of unlikely into the realm of ludicrous; Kimble's skill at creating a false pass and faking out people who work at the hospital also seems rather lame. I'm sure I could come up with more if I watched it again.In the end, it was a good enough movie to be enjoyable, but some very basic believability issues marred the overall story. Obviously the 90% or so of users who rated this movie better than I did will disagree with me on this, but I have a hard time understanding why this movie is so highly-rated. It was okay, but I don't feel any pressing need to watch it again at any point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Mystery Masterpiece in Every Sense of the Word!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Andrew Davis is an action director who has done a few decent films, but one great. This is a mystery/thriller with a brain that has it all. Car chases, foot chases, one-versus-all, and a complex plot enhance a generic whodunit into new heights and into the highest realm of movie magic.I have never seen the TV show this is based upon, but I don't care. This movie is good enough for me (and probably better too). Harrison Ford give his greatest performance as well-respected Chicago physician Richard Kimble. The first few minutes of the film document his conviction of the murder of his wife. It alternates in such a creative and exciting way to see exactly what we're dealing with: Kimble's wife is murdered by a one- armed man and the evidence against the innocent Richard is high. The way that this is shown is just perfect. It is well created and is makes the viewer feel slightly uncomfortable and shocked, but thirsting for more. On the bus to be incarcerated, it crashes, leaving Kimble to go on the run from the entire country. Nobody is on his side and justice has not been brought, but we want Kimble to survive and the bad guys brought down. That's a reason why I love this so much, a regular man faced with certain death must put the wrong things right with impossible odds and lots on the line.Richard's first goal in the manhunt is to change his appearance. His change makes him look like the Harrison Ford we all know. After he changes his look, he is able to waltz right by some of the key people that are trying to kill him. That is where the brains come. He can dodge his enemies at ease in such a calm but brilliant way. That causes his evasion to become easier and he can focus on who killed his wife and why. Meanwhile, a tough team of US Marshals, led by Sam Gerard (Jones), lead the way for the hunt of Dr. Kimble. The intro of Gerard and his crew is where the friction really heats up. As Kimble digs deep into the case, so does Gerard and his men in a parallel fashion. Eventually, Gerard has a change of heart and the Marshals soon become on the same side as Kimble. Kimble's discoveries in the murder are shocking and need full attention and thinking. Movies like these are the best. Loyalties change hands and secrets are revealed that will make the viewers' blood boil. I don't want to ruin anything about the conspiracy behind the murder, but it is sharp to perfection. Think to yourself what makes a movie great, truly. The Fugitive has those. Now think about what makes a mystery great, truly. The Fugitive has those. The first little bit is an exciting manhunt that feels like one man against the world. While keeping the manhunt premise, it subtly shifts gears into more of a whodunit. There are so many people linked to the murder and the movie cleverly teases them into the picture, raising excitement. The bar constantly raises, so the way it all comes together must be something very smart. And it is! The characters are so well-written and acted with Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones shining as the crown jewels.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a pretty exciting, fast-paced thriller about Dr. Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford), who was accused or murdering his wife Helen (Sela Ward). After being convicted, he escapes after his transport van crashes and then goes on his own mission of finding his wife's killer - all the while avoiding the pursuit of the U.S. Marshal Service.Ford does a good job acting in his Dr. Kimble role, proving his determination of finding the true criminal in the case and dodging the marshals left and right - all in a nationwide manhunt that generates enough thrills, chase scenes and games of hide-and-seek that will keep you on the edge of your seat. He also generates the audience's sympathy, letting them believe he is innocent and that a real murderer is out there. What distracts from the exciting plot, unfortunately, is the Tommy Lee Jones' flamboyant portrayal of Marshal Samuel Gerard. He treats the case like he was playing a game instead of solving a serious murder and his constant showy attitude eats away at the tense atmosphere. What is also distracting, and extremely annoying, is the mindless chatter and butt-kissing of Gerard's deputies, particularly that of the loudmouth Cosmo Renfro (Joe Pantoliano) and moronic Biggs (Daniel Roebuck).Julianne Moore is a nice addition to the cast, but unfortunately her appearance is more like a cameo at best since many of her scenes were deleted apparently.Overall, it's a pretty good thriller with some action and surprises that make it quite entertaining.Grade B-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He Just Won't Give Up !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Fugitive is a crime thriller based on a TV series from the 1960s of the same name and it stars Harrison Ford, Tommy Lee Jones and Sela Ward. The plot is pretty straight forward. After his wife gets murdered , Dr. Richard Kimble(Ford) is accused of committing the crime and with circumstantial evidence stacked against him, he is sentenced to death. But due to a fortunate accident he escapes from the police and starts his own investigation of the murder of his wife while the authorities headed by Deputy Samuel Gerard(Jones) keep chasing him.From a thematic standpoint, this film isn't very deep. It isn't really trying to say anything too cerebral or profound about our society or the characters. The director Andrew Davis knows what kind of film he wants to make and he does a very efficient job of making a thriller that keeps the viewer invested and always on the edge of their seats. Something or the other is happening at every moment and boredom is never allowed to set in. The cat and mouse game between Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones' characters make the film an exhilarating watch. Both Ford and Jones give good, intense performances.If a thriller works well, the screenplay and the direction have to be admired. Although there are certain occurrences in the film that require the viewer to suspend his/her disbelief to some extent, but for the most parts the storyline remains believable. The director and the screenplay writer never consider the viewer to be stupid and actually demand some attention from the viewer to understand what is happening in some of the scenes.The Fugitive isn't a very deep film, but it is certainly a thriller in the true sense. The direction, acting and the screenplay will keep the viewer engrossed and heavily interested.</fullReview>

A larger-than-life story of the wrongfully convicted man-on-the-run, hellbent on proving his innocence and bringing his wife's killer to justice. But the DVD audio commentary by director Andrew Davis greatly enhanced my appreciation of the film.What's most impressive is the amount of dialogue that was ad-libbed, particularly by Tommy Lee Jones and his posse of U.S. Marshals. In order to produce a sense of spontaneity, the actors were encouraged to understand their characters' motivations and then work out their lines together on-set, instead of adhering strictly to the written script. This allowed the actors to make the characters their own and made the interplay more natural. This surely contributed to Tommy Lee Jones's Oscar victory for his colorful performance.The production also strove for realism wherever possible. For the train crash scene, they crashed a full-size train. Director Andrew Davis, a Chicago native, made use of authentic Chicago locations. He snuck footage during the real Chicago St. Patrick's Day parade and opted to use a real office interior, with a real view of the city, rather than a phony backdrop. Tommy Lee Jones rode in a real helicopter and Harrison Ford drove a real ambulance. Movie-making is all about storytelling and filmmakers work hard to create illusions. Nowadays it's possible to do anything using digital special effects. So it's impressive to see a big action thriller like THE FUGITIVE make the movie "for real".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The good things about The Fugitive, first of all, are its leading actors. I liked both Tommy Lee Jones and Harrison Ford in this movie. Not only did I think they played well, but I also thought that they were well matched together in this movie and that they had smart chemistry. The use of settings is another admirable thing in the movie, and that includes the sewers and the St. Patrick Parade. When my mind connects sewers and St. Patrick Parade to the plot of an innocent fugitive being tracked down by the authorities, I'm thinking "Nothing better. I like it. I truly do. I think it matches the plot in a smart way.". Talking about sewers, Harrison Ford's character's daring jump into the water from out of the sewers at a formidable height, I thought was one hell of a masterful scene act and a scene act worth remembering for decades to come. It's without any doubt the absolute best scene act I've ever seen in movies in my life, and the best scene act of the entire film. However, what I liked the most about this film is its pacing. The pacing in The Fugitive is superb and a pure master's work. Furthermore, I thought that the movie had nice charm, a nicely developed story, enough drama and tension, a few good surprises and a flawless scenes structure. Short reflection on The Fugitive: what an enjoyable and impactive ride. The Fugitive is the kind of film that leaves you wowed after you finish watching it. I'm glad to have watched this movie, and I worship it. Because of all the good things I said about the film, for me The Fugitive deserves to stand as a classic. My rating for The Fugitive: 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An all-time classic chase thriller with an equally compelling character study, The Fugitive ranks as one of the best examples of it's genre around. As dogged detective Tommy Lee Jones hunts his prey (an innocent doctor, played by Harrison Ford) through hospitals, street parades, and even the Hoover Dam, the interaction between the two and the amount of near misses will have you falling off the edge of your seat. And there is also Ford's quest to prove his inculpability in the murder of his wife... Jones's bonding with his hand-picked investigation team... Exactly how much can you squeeze into a two hour long feature?!My favourite aspect of the production isn't the brilliantly directed scenes of pursuit, or the slow unveiling of who WAS responsible for the tragic crime, or even Harrison Ford as the wronged man who nevertheless stops to help others even while on the run (Thus engaging him perfectly with the audience's sympathies). Nope, that would be Tommy Lee Jones as the bombastic police office in charge of the capture... He is never short of something to say... Doesn't take crap from anyone... And (most of all), the small looks in his eyes as the evidence mounts that Ford may not be the one responsible for his spouse's demise after all. He turns from the man trying to get Ford at all costs... To the only one willing to protect him in the heated climax...A great character, brought to life by a great actor. Someone give that chap an Oscar... Whoops, he received one. WOWEE Life Is Good. :) 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I expected a dull action movie and in fact, it's rather good. First, the choice of the Chicago region is cool as it mixes the nature and an authentic city, traits that can't afford NYC (no nature) or LA (no city). Next, Harrison is always excellent playing an overtaken but pugnacious doctor (see  frantic ,  what lies? ) and Jones brings a surprising but cool side to a unpleasant job. Sure, the story has a lot of improbabilities (why didn't Harrison manage to prove his innocence at the trial for example) and the last sequence in the hotel is a bit boring. But the idea of this running innocent man is really punchy and it's easy to understand why it was a TV show at the beginning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brooks--The Fugitive Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Fugitive is a great movie based on the 1960s television series of the same name. The performances of both Tommy Lee Jones as Deputy Girard and Harrison Ford as Dr. Richard Kimble are great, but it is Jones who gives the best performance. He well-deservingly won the Best Supporting Actor for 1993 in the Academy Awards that year.Dr. Richard Kimble is wrongly accused of murdering his wife. He is sent to jail, but when a security guard is stabbed and another one is unconscious, Kimble uses that chance to run away from the law. The great thing about this is that Kimble is not running away to be free, but he is running away to solve the crime. Tommy Lee Jones plays Deputy Samuel Girard who is trying to track down Kimble. He has one run-in with Kimble, but Kimble gets away.The movie is great, and in my opinion it is one of the best films of 1993. There are however a few things about this film which are ridiculous. First, when Kimble is driving the ambulance and Girard and his men are going after him and they trap him in a tunnel. Despite at least ten marshals going after Kimble, he manages to crawl into the sewer without one of them seeing him. Also, when Kimble is in the sewer and Girard and his men are going after him in the sewer and Girard finds him and has him trapped and Kimble jumps approximately 100 feet off of a dam and survives. I mean come on can this really happen? Also, when Kimble is walking up the street and a woman stops next to him and asks him if he wants a ride. Would you go up to a stranger and ask for a ride? These things are minor things and would not affect your viewing on the film, but these are things that you stop and ask yourself can this really happen? This is a great movie and if you have never seen this movie and are fans of Ford and Jones or action films I encourage you to check out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb Version Of TV Series.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Andrew Davis directed this surprisingly superb cinema version of the classic TV series that had starred David Janssen as Dr. Richard Kimble, and Barry Morse as Lt. Philip Gerard, his pursuer. This time, Harrison Ford plays the wrongfully convicted Dr. Kimble, who was found guilty of murdering his wife Helen(played by Sela Ward) despite it being the work of a one-armed man(played by Andreas Katsulas) After his train derails in an escape attempt gone wrong, Kimble becomes a fugitive, as he relentlessly tries to hide from authorities led by U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard(played by Tommy Lee Jones) and uncover the true killer, which ends up not being just a simple burglary gone wrong... Well acted and written film has incredible action scenes and suspense, and neatly condenses the TV series. Plot may end up being a bit too complicated in terms of conspiracy, but otherwise this is the textbook case on how to adapt a TV series to film, which is so often botched.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Harrison Ford is a brilliant actor end of story. You gotta love his performance in this film and im not gonna lie here but the 80s and 90s were the best films of all compare to now(except some of them that are brilliant like Shrek,Tangled etc).The Fugitive is based off a TV series of the same name and tells the story of a Doctor Kimple(played by Harrison Ford) who's wife got murdered by a one hand guy who lost his hand in an accident and wears a prosthetic hand.But none of the cops believe him when he is up in court as they thrown him in jail as they think HIS the one that murdered his own wife.But when the train that brings him to jail breaks down,Richard(sporting long grey hair and a bushy grey beard)goes on the run and changes his appearance(by dying and chopping his hair) as well as shaving off his beard in order for the police not to notice him and to prove that he is an innocent man.So when one of the FBI agents tracks him down(played by Tommy Lee Jones),Richard proves to him that he is telling the truth about the man with the prosthetic hand,but will Lee Jones' charcther believe his story and let Richard get away??Bottom Line this movie was brilliant. You gotta love the story,you gotta love the acting and everything about this film is fantastic. I know I know its not aimed towards women like me,and I don't wanna sound racist when saying it but I for one would highly put this film in at no 20 on my list of all time favourite movies. Is it my all time favourite movie No but is it a great film YES.Also keep an eye out for Jane Lynch(a very young looking Lynch)from Glee and Julianne Moore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones do what they do best in this heart stopping man hunt. They give you their clichd gawks, studied replies and cowboy humor. And we love 'em for it. We also have a murder investigation, accompanied by the flashbacks of convicted Dr. Kimbel while on the run. The supplemental plot surrounding a wonder drug drives the finale a bit more than necessary as Hollywood goes straight to the obligatory good versus evil fisticuffs. Up until then, the action scenes trump each other and are always held up by the drama. What man wouldn't be obsessed with finding the truth when having Sela ward taken from you in her prime? While the one-armed bandit stays true to the TV storyline, our doctor saving a little boys' life seemed a bit over the top, but this blockbuster film still holds up over time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Makes you think, is there a formula for filmmaking?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film starts directly with the story without going into establishing much in the starting. The story starts with Harrison ford being accused of his wife's murder. Now after seeing so many movies, it is inevitable for me to think, where the plot will eventually go. But the story is simple without paying much emphasis on twists. The man is falsely accused and runs away owing to unusual circumstances and then starts to work in order to prove his innocence. There is pretty much just the running away from the police in the entire film. The plot is simple and what makes the movie worth watching are its fascinating screenplay and the power to grab your heart. The casting is one of the best. It could not have been better. From the starting itself the undoubted innocence on the face of Harrison ford as Dr. kimbley is the clue for everyone that he is falsely accused. This is the entire film. I cannot spoil the movie further because there is nothing much in the plot. Tommy lee Jones on the other hand again looks so sympathizing as the police officer that I knew from the beginning that he is going to help in the end. The movie is the best example of how a very simple plot can be so exciting. I was bound to think whether there can be a formula to make successful films. However, at times I got irritated at how he is able to escape always just from under the nose but then the innocent look on his face doesn't allow to go deeper into that. The film is very much normal and one of the best at the same times.MESSAGE: "Everyone gets a chance."VERDICT: "A recommended watch."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Fugitive" (1993) works because both the man chased and the man doing the chasing are likable.Harrison Ford plays a wrongly accused of murder physician escaping from captivity, trying to prove his innocence by locating the actual criminal who did what Ford is accused of doing (murder).It'a a similar, though less leisurely, role to that played by Ford in "Witness" (1985) in which Ford plays a Philadelphia police detective wrongly accused of crime and hunted by other Philly cops (who are actually guilty of the crime).The entire movie moves, and pulls the audience in because both the protagonist and his pursuer are likable characters.The policeman doing the chasing is portrayed by Tommy Lee Jones, who got a Best Actor Academy Award for "The Fugitive" (1993) and deserved it.The audience roots for both the man chased and also the man doing the chasing.It is important for audiences to like characters they are presented with in dramatic movies. The more humanity, character depth, and intelligence a character shows through his dialog and actions, the better the movie, and this applies to all characters in the story, certainly all the main ones."The Fugitive" (1993) does this very well, better than any other famous action movie I ever saw.Another thing which makes "The Fugitive" (1993) a superior movie is the complete absence of four letter word expletives commonly heard in most other "action movies" (espcially Bruce Willis movies). Good action movies are possible and better without the expletives. But in today's world (2012), it is unusual to see and hear a movie without them, sadly.------------- Written by Tex Allen, SAG Actor.Email Tex Allen at TexAllen@Rocketmail.Com.Visit WWW.IMDb.Me/TexAllen for movie credits and biography details about Tex Allen.

		<fullReview>The Fugitive by far is one of the best films dealing with fugitives on the run from the law. This film has two solid leads and it reminds me of action films from the 80's. The train sequence at the beginning of the film is definitely one of the best train sequences seen on film.This film is about a doctor who is wrongly accused of murdering his wife and is sentenced to death. He escapes from prison to prove his innocence. But can he do that with the U.S Marshals on his tail? The acting is very good. Harrison Ford is at his best as the man on the run. Even better is Tommy Lee Jones as the head Marshal. He was great and is someone you don't want to mess with.Overall, this is one of the best thrillers of the 1990's. This movie has a fair share of action and drama combined. I rate this film 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I DON'T CARE!" "Your fugitive's name is Dr. Richard Kimball. Go find him." These lines of Tommy Lee Jones practically set the tone for the chase for the vascular surgeon who was accused of killing his wife in Chicago in this superior Warner Brothers production. The storyline, especially for me and others in my generation who watched the TV series by the same name in the 60's, is very familiar: Dr. Kimball is, to reiterate, falsely accused of killing his wife, though Deputy Marshal Sam Gerard very stubbornly refuses to believe it. An unfair judge at an unfair trial sentences Kimball to be killed, but on the way by bus to the place where the execution is to take place there is a wreck where, after an attempted killing on the bus, the bus gets swayed onto a railroad when a fast train plunges into the bus, (which is real in the movie), leaving Kimball to escape to run back to Chicago, and so he does. I was impressed with the acting. Tommy Lee Jones justly earned the Best Supporting Actor Award for 1993, and Harrison Ford aptly conveyed the fact that he was a bitter and upset man, knowing he was unjustly accused of murder and very angry that his wife was dead and he did not know who the real killer was. Sela Ward was very appealing as Kimball's wife Helen, and Jereon Krabbe portrayed well the two-faced, crooked physician. The setting was and was not drawing: the Carolina woods made a beautiful part of nature, but some of the parts of Chicago were dismal at best. I was glued to the movie because of the story itself and the concomitant excitement. My late Mother, who was in her late 70's when she watched the DVD of it with me one night, like it as well, and she was very picky. Arnold Kopelson was a capable producer, and Andrew Davis was a skillful director, and I was especially impressed with the music of James Newton Howard. Yes, it was a very impressive movie, another one of those I have watched repeatedly.</fullReview>

Now on the run as a fugitive, he is pursued by the obsessed Deputy US Marshal Sam Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones in an Oscar-winning role). This film is one of my many favorites for the film's elements of action, pursuit and the sheer brilliance of Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones as each man faces off to discover the truth and Jones' hunt for Ford throughout the streets of Chicago.

		<shortDescription>An Action Movie Of The Highest Calibre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This exhilarating action thriller is full of plot twists, suspense and excitement from start to finish but what distinguishes it from other movies of the same genre is its two main characters who are both good guys who, through extraordinary circumstances, become adversaries. Both men are very smart and incredibly determined and it's their efforts to outwit each other that grips the audience so strongly and creates a dual which is riveting to watch.The story of a man who's unjustly accused of a crime he didn't commit and then has to go in search of the real culprit to prove his innocence (whilst also being pursued by the police) is, of course, a set up for the classic double chase plot which inevitably puts the accused in numerous dangerous situations and under constant pressure because of the ever present threat of capture.In "The Fugitive" Dr Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford), is a Chicago surgeon who's sentenced to death for the brutal murder of his wife. Whilst he and some other prisoners are being transported by bus to the Illinois State Penitentiary, an attempted escape by one of the other prisoners leads to the driver losing control of the vehicle and swerving off the road and into the path of an on-coming train. The resulting collision provides Kimble with the opportunity to make a run for it. After making his escape, this man who has nothing to lose decides to track down the one-armed man who he knows was his wife's real murderer.Deputy U.S. Marshall Samuel Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones), is the man whose job it is to hunt down the escaped convicts and after the bus crash, he quickly arrives on the scene and takes charge of the situation. His dogged pursuit of Kimble is relentless but surprisingly as the chase goes on, what he discovers leads him to suspect that his prey may not be guilty and what he learns about Kimble inspires a certain amount of respect although this never, even for a second, deters him from his single-minded commitment to carrying out his task to its conclusion."The Fugitive" is skilfully directed by Andrew Davis and the pace of the action is absolutely breathtaking. The sequence early on in the film during which the audience sees the events that led to Kimble's arrest is a marvellous example of this and the momentum is then maintained as there are numerous situations where Kimble has narrow escapes from being caught and the consistent level of tension just seems to escalate as Gerard is regularly only one step behind his quarry.The action set pieces are all brilliantly staged but the bus / train crash is easily the most impressive with further excitement being added when Kimble makes his incredible last minute leap to escape from danger. The screenplay is also excellent and includes some enjoyable moments of humour which provide an effective counterpoint to the suspense which features strongly throughout.Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones are thoroughly convincing in their roles and show so much more of what they're thinking and feeling by their expressions and body language than they do through what they say. Ford's fear and the strain he's under, is constantly evident in his face and Jones, whose character is a consummate professional who's adopted a persona which works well for him in the context of his job, subtly shows that below his aggressive surface resides a rather warmer and more understanding man.It's easy to see why this movie was such a box office success as it scores highly on every level and combines visceral excitement so perfectly with intelligence and humour.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is it just me...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>?Or are all American thrillers basically the same movie, just slightly altered and repackaged each time? Okay, I know at heart that there are some obvious details in each film that make it different to ones before it, but I can't be the only one who's thought that, by simply pulling a bunch of dangerous-sounding buzz words out of the air (words like 'prosecution', 'corruption', 'mistaken identity' and 'manhunt') I could form the foundation of the next big action thriller. So why, then, is Andrew Davis' The Fugitive, a film that contains all these base ingredients and more, so much fun to watch? Short answer: a solid story, good acting and a cast of characters that fit into their respective roles like a favourite pair of pyjamas. Long answer: by all means, read on.Harrison Ford is Dr. Richard Kimble, a respected man sentenced to prison for murdering his wife, despite being adamant that it was not him, but a mysterious one-armed man, who committed the crime. On the bus ride to the big house, the other prisoners stage a daring escape, allowing Kimble to flee and begin a life of anonymity whilst seeking out the real killer. That is, until he crosses paths with Sam Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones), a hard-nosed US Marshal who cares not for Kimble's excuses, and whose only concern is restoring the status quo.Excluding the excellent Indiana Jones trilogy (notice I've left out the fourth instalment, which I refuse to mention by name), Ford has made this genre his forte, making him a natural fit for the desperate, determined Kimble. Jones earns the Best Supporting Actor Oscar by playing the typical Jones role to great effect: a no-nonsense tough guy with a sideswiping sense of humour. And Joe Pantoliano, best known as Ralph Cifaretto (or Cypher, if you're no Sopranos fan) makes under-appreciated contributions as Gerard's right-hand man.Suspense is on high supply throughout. My personal favourite is Kimble's attempt to hide in plain sight at the hospital, a tense and dramatic set piece that sets a paranoid tone for the rest of the film. But there is a plethora of energetic, 'edge-of-your-seat' moments to satisfy film connoisseurs and action junkies alike, including the sewer chase, the St. Patrick's Day parade and the rooftop climax, all of which comply with the conventions of an action thriller nicely against the backdrop of a bleak, but not quite noir, Chicago CBD.Speaking of conventions, it's clear that Davis has made a tight pace the top priority in The Fugitive, as the entire film is determined to remove any and all obstacles that would otherwise slow the movie down. Character development is restricted mainly to Ford's character, but is sprinkled in just enough to keep the rest of the cast from looking like cardboard cut-outs. But most pleasing was the omission of a romantic subplot. At different times during production, both Julianne Moore and Jane Lynch were scripted as Kimble's love interest. Despite the obvious pitfalls this would create from a logical perspective (considering Kimble spends the whole movie trying to avenge his beloved wife), it also sounds like the director has dodged a minefield of clichs by avoiding the beaten path; something I am very grateful for.Admittedly, the film becomes a little convoluted in the third act. Depending on how much you've enjoyed The Fugitive, this alone might be enough to warrant a second viewing, but otherwise it's nothing that a quick trip to the IMDb won't fix. If you're looking for a theme to take away, I suppose the movie could act as an exposition of human nature in desperate times. However, I doubt that was on the agenda during filming, and so the film should instead be enjoyed as was intended: an absorbing, high-drama roller-coaster, which I expect will remain a staple of this genre for many decades to come.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

		<shortDescription>A good thriller flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well I had seen the Hindi movie " Criminal" starring Manisha Koirala. So, scene by scene, dailogue by dailogue was copied by criminal from this movie till 1st 1 hour. Fugitive is an amazing movie and never lets you get bored even for a minute. All in all, a good thriller movie that has a good pace and keeps your mind busy with unexpected twists.The movie is about a husband Dr.Richard Kimble ( Ford) who is convicted of his beloved wife's murder.God gives him one more chance when he flees from the bus carrying the criminals that meets with accident.Now his objective is to hunt down the real killer. Now this task is not so easy when you have a detective Gerad( Tomy lee) who has not let his whole team sleep just to get to this guy. Detective wont give up in his search and so wont Kimble in search of his wife's murder..Detective in every attempt misses Kimble by few seconds..A well directed movie... You can watch it if you are bored and want to see a good thriller flick..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fast paced action with great performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The fugitive is just a great film for so many reasons. First of all, I love it because Sam Gerard, the US marshal on the hunt for the wrongly accused DR. Richard Kimble treats his team whom he refers to as his "kids" like family. He actually mothers them, telling the lone female on the team to wear two coats, while advising Noah not to let someone give him any you know what about his pony tail. This type of camaraderie really appeals to me. And as far as performances are concerned, Tommy Lee Jones is outstanding. His vocal intonation is very expressive, conveying a gamut of emotion from humor to kindness to menace.And hey, let's give it to the guy, he wasn't exactly a teenager when this movie came out but he was running and jumping with the best of them. And I really admire Sam Gerard because he was totally dedicated to what he thought was the truth--Kimble was convicted in a court of law and that was all he needed to know. This is why he says he doesn't care when Kimble tells him he didn't kill his wife. But at the end of the movie when the truth comes out about who actually killed Helen Kimble Gerard is totally willing to accept it no holds barred. I love that.Love the "Peter Pan" dive into the water, train wreck, running around in the st paddy's day parade, all of it. See it if you can.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on the television series of the same name, 'The Fugitive' is a convincing, absorbing and mostly gripping thriller that holds your attention. This 1993 box-office smash hit, is cleverly directed by Andrew Davis and very well acted by it's lead cast.'The Fugitive' is a cat-n-mouse thriller. A wrongly accused is on-the-run to prove his innocence, while a stubborn Marshal hunts for him. It's basically a war between these 2 men, who go 'no holds barred'! Andrew Davis has made a memorable fare in 'The Fugitive'. He has directed the film with style. The Screenplay keeps you at the edge of your seat most times, and even the characters are damn interesting. Michael Chapman's Cinematography captures each moment wonderfully. Dennis Virkler's Editing is cool.Performance-Wise: Harrison Ford is terrific in the central role. The legendary box office star, proves his mettle yet again. Tommy Lee Jones is razor-sharp in an Oscar-Winning role, while Jeroen Krabb is good. Andreas Katsulas and Joe Pantoliano are first-rate. Julianne Moore appears in a brief role.On the whole, 'The Fugitive' works big time. Take a look at this one, if thrills are what your for craving for. Thumbs Up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun but Rambling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this big screen adaptation of the classic TV series, a doctor is falsely convicted of murdering his wife, but escapes en route to prison. This is an entertaining, fast-moving adventure yarn with non-stop action. In fact, there is perhaps a bit too much action, as it starts to run out of steam towards the end. The story is fairly straightforward but tends to ramble and becomes somewhat muddled in the latter stages. It could have benefited from tighter editing. Ford is well cast in the title role, but Jones steals the film in his Oscar winning role as the U.S. Marshal who doggedly pursues him. It's mindless fun, with little attempt at plausibility in the plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fantastic retelling of the classic TV series. When I first saw this I was put off by how they explained why Helen Kimble was murdered but after seeing it over and over and over again I've come to respect the originality of the movie and the screenwriter's ability to start the story put a exciting middle to it and finally a nail biting climax and a satisfactory ending to a edge of your seat thriller. A lot of people have put this movie on a high platform and rightly so in 92 this movie showed us how it was done. It outclassed Speed and others of it's ilk. The main reason is the chemistry between Jones and ford they create a fine tight rope of a drama and action flick. Jones however provides what comedy relief there is intentionally. His Gerald differs from Barry Morse's Gerald in that he is even more obessessed and he refuses to listen to anyone except his instincts maybe it's his finest role to date. It did bring him an Oscar. Harrison Ford carries the movie pretty much like Richard Kimble he's smart he's quick and he's relentless. Ford captures you from the first screen shot until the credits roll. The movie is a fine roller coaster of a ride the stunts are fantastic and the story is tight. This movie should be included in film classes as a example of how to make a great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based upon the popular television series of the mid 60's, this thriller converts well to the big screen thanks to some competent direction from Andrew Davis, and two sure-footed performances from the lead stars.Harrison Ford adds yet another character to his already impressive collection as Dr. Richard Kimble, a man who, whilst on the run, searches for the one-armed man he claims killed his wife. And Tommy Lee Jones continues to grow in stature, after his Oscar nominated performance in "J.F.K.", with a very good turn as Deputy Gerard, the man pursuing Kimble.Davis develops tension early and maintains it well, right up until the suitable, though none too surprising, ending. Plot complexities near the finish may lose some viewers, but most of the audience will enjoy every minute.

		<fullReview>I was a young man in college when this movie came out and Harrison Ford's acting was so forceful that I briefly considered becoming a vascular surgeon! From the beginning this movie keeps you involved. The train wreck on the silver screen felt like you were there, no surprise since the director derailed an actual train for the footage (I have seen the wreckage myself in S.C.).The only complaint I have is the end when Dr. Nichols, a highly regarded doctor despite his under-handed dealings with the drug company, suddenly transforms quite unexpectedly into the prototypical, dastardly villain bent on killing Harrison Ford's character even if it means taking out a few marshals in the process. I don't recall the absurdity of the end in the theater, but subsequent airings on TV have made it more than apparent that the studio was in a hurry to wrap up the filming versus a more thoughtful and dramatic ending.At any rate, having lived in Chicago the past couple of years, it has also been fun recognizing the filming locations.</fullReview>

It is a fast-paced thriller, with excellent special effects, two lead actors at the top of their craft, and a story-line that keeps you on the edge of your seat right until the end.The story in brief: Rich doctor accused of murdering his wife protests his innocence, claiming the murder was committed by a one-armed man he saw at the murder scene. The doctor is found guilty, and sentenced to death. Circumstances provide an illegal escape from prison, and the doctor, now the fugitive, has to prove his innocence by finding the one-armed killer.While doing this he saves the life of one of his prison guards, saves the life of a boy needing emergency surgery and spares the life of his chief pursuer who would have undoubtedly killed him in a heartbeat. Sounds too trite? In the context of this film, and with a frenetic Tommy Lee Jones and Harrison Ford being... well, Harrison Ford, the film actually works quite well.Director Andrew Davis has provided a movie that has stayed fresh and exciting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best (if not the very best) of the TV show adaptation movies. Not only is the film consistent with the theme of the series, but it juices it up with intense action and an involving, well-constructed plot.The movie adopts just enough of the popular '60's program's original elements, and blends them nicely with the right measure of new plot twists to concoct one furious and exciting ride. Harrison Ford takes the role magnificently originated by David Jansen, and puts his unique stamp on it to make a Dr. Richard Kimble that is his own. His perfect sparring partner is Marshall Sam Girard (Tommy Lee Jones), who takes Kimbles's escape as a personal challenge to a chess game of wits.Parallel cat-and-mouse duels are the stuff of this chess game: Kimble is not only the pursued, but also the pursuer of his own prey, the mysterious one-armed-man he saw fleeing from the murder scene. The action is constant, featuring leaps from dams, high speed ambulances, chases through sewers, fights, shootings, and more as each closes in. The train wreck sequence that sets Kimble on his trek to clear his name is one of the finest sequences ever filmed. The cast is exceptional. Never a dull moment from start to finish. A great mystery, and a great pursuit suspense thriller. This is the kind of movie that remains fun after multiple viewings. A keeper for sure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although the outcome is never in doubt, The Fugitive is one of the best "chase" movies ever, successfully maintaining the suspense from first to last. Tommy Lee Jones won an Oscar as best supporting actor for this film but it is also among Harrison Ford's best performances. Based loosely on a celebrated murder which would have been even more famous if CNN and Fox had been pursuing the story, The Fugitive records Harrison's pursuit by Jones as a U.S. Marshall attempting to capture the doctor accused of killing his wife, while Harrison tries to find the actual killer with Jones never very far behind. There was a TV series before the movie -- and it was pretty good. But the movie is better. Of its type, The Fugitive is one of the best, though it trails both North by Northwest (the Cary Grant vehicle) and the Open Window. Very Hitchcock-ian, which is a high compliment for those who did not see Hitchcock at his peak.</fullReview>

You can ask yourself why the police didn't have investigate such a lousy proof any further but that's not the thing, Ford escapes (without wanting to) and he is chased by a superb Tommy Lee Jones.

		<fullReview>Entertaining thriller, everyone brilliantly cast. The key to the success of this film is the water-cooler repartee of the marshal's office team under Tommy-Lee Jones. Life is one big crossword puzzle and they always complete theirs. So when (the never better) Harrison Ford stays out of reach it sets off a cycle of excitement and disappointment that are good foil for the inevitable action sequences.This can't last though, as the function of the team relies of the black-and-whiteness of the situation. As Ford's Richard Kimble finally shakes off the shadow of presumed guilt the dynamic becomes more personal. I find the denouement a little unsatisfactory (it's all a bit serious) as a result.The film is crisp and gets on with the action without romanticising Kimble's struggle for freedom.

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly intimate and emotional action film - 9/10 stars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although it is listed most commonly as an action film, "The Fugitive" is a delightfully dynamic film, surprisingly intimate and emotional as well as dramatic and thrilling. The movie keeps the viewer on the edge with its well choreographed chase and fight scenes, and the plot thickens effectively and challenges the audience to figure out the truth. There are many decent action films that share these characteristics, but "The Fugitive" has more depth and muscle than most other works of the genre due to its touching emotional context. Ford's subtle depression, the somber city and wilderness settings, the graphic flashbacks and the haunting musical score make enable the audience to understand the characters and empathize with them. There is also a good deal of humor, much of it improvised on the part of Tommy Lee Jones and his partners, which adds to the naturalistic feel of the film and credibility of the storyline. And the extraordinary plot twist and climax keeps the film from suffering the generic letdown of many potentially good thrillers. Overall this is an excellent film with an excellent plot that reveals more subtleties every time it is watched.</fullReview>

Ford is his usual charming self, though I was going to leave the movie had he not cut that ugly beard off! Tommy Lee Jones was perfect for the part of US Marshall. He's pushy. He's conceited. He's extremely effective at irritating everyone but the audience. I can't help it .. I love the guy!The plot and writing were a bit thin though.

		<shortDescription>a must for fans of the genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Slam-bang thriller from the director of other action extravaganzas like Under Siege. The story: Ford is Richard Kimble, a renowned doctor unjustly convicted for the murder of his wife and sentenced to death; Jones is Samuel Gerard, the relentless bloodhound of a U.S. Marshal given the burdensome task of tracking Kimble down after he unexpectedly escapes and runs wild all over the city of Chicago. The result is an endless, over-the-top barrage of mind-blowing action scenes/stunts, suspenseful and all-too-believable plot twists, and some amazing acting between two superb leads. Ford brings the perfect vulnerability to his role as a doctor forced to take it on the lam, and Jones is magnetic as the hard-nosed federal officer determined to get the job done. Smart, gripping, and entertaining. ***?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has a certain animosity to it, a special magnitude. Having recently seen Collateral Damage, I felt the urge to watch this again and see how it stacked up against the director's new stuff. It does exceptionally well. Harrison Ford is a magnificent actor with numerous great films under his belt. At times in this movie, its hard not to imagine him as his Tom Clancy character, just from his appearance. The supporting cast all did great jobs, and Tommy Lee Jones is a great sarcasm actor with dry wit. This movie is a definite for Ford/Jones fans and I give it 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It continues to amaze me how Harrison Ford can continue to do excellent acting jobs, but has never received an Oscar. In this thriller, Ford plays a doctor( Richard Kimble) wrongly convicted of his wifes murder. Tommy Lee Jones, who did pick up an Oscar, is the U.S. Marshall( Sam Gerard) who is bent on catching the escaped Kimble. Playing like an adapted Les Miserables, this is actually taken from a true story. Throughout the movie, Kimble evades police while trying to track down his wife's real murderer. While containing a few scenes that require a stretch of imagination, as a whole the movie is realistic, and full of edge-of-the-seat suspense.</fullReview>

Following a harrowing bus crash on his way to be executed, he escapes and begins his quest for the one-armed man who actually committed the crime, all the while being pursued by Lt. Sam Gerard (played by Jones). The film features excellent chase scenes and a finale which is not to be missed. The dam scene was one of my favorites.

		<fullReview>In my opinion, "The Fugitive" is the best movie of 1993. It is also one of the few successful films-based-on-a-TV-series. Harrison Ford is good as Dr. Richard Kimble. But to me, David Janssen still the best out of the three incarnations of the wrongly accused, yet rightly resourceful doctor. Tommy Lee Jones is equally effective as U.S. Marshall Sam Gerard, Kimble's pursuer. For the movie, Gerard's title and first name were changed. Those who have seen either of the TV incarnations of the Fugitive will recall that his name is Lieutenant Phillip Gerard. Why the change is anyone's guess.The best lines in this film are from Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones. The former shouts: "I didn't kill my wife!" In response, the latter says, "I don't care!" The message here, of course, was that Gerard's job was to nab Kimble, not determine his guilt or innocence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent right the way through. (POSSIBLE SPOILERS.)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Davis takes the blueprint for a (60's?) TV series and turns it into a multi-million dollar Hollywood blockbuster. Like only a few of his directorial colleagues before him (De Palma is one) he succeeds. "The Fugitive" is tremendously entertaining popcorn fare. Star power is largely the key to this being such a compelling thriller. We have a protagonist and antagonist, as usual, but Jones as the antagonist doesn't overplay the character or make the audience hate him. Ford is impressively humble as the doc on the run. There is one outstanding setpiece, which I won't reveal (though most readers will probably already know what I'm referring to even if they haven't seen the film) The script is not outstanding, but neither is it awful, just serviceable. As the title implies, the majority of the movie follows Kimble as he is on the run from Gerrard. This means that all the best lines are given to Gerrard, and since he's not really the character we're meant to have invested our sympathies in, they just serve as comic relief. The film rarely flags in pace, which must be attributed to Davis, but aside from that the direction is also merely serviceable. The intensity of the flashback scenes is pleasing, and its important that the whole "one armed man" thing never feels like a subplot which detracts from the two main characters. Watch it for the performances, and the perfect simplicity of the plot. Who said great thrillers always have to be convoluted and spectacularly original? Not me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Andrew Davis' The Fugitive was nominated for Best Picture in 1993. This was a huge surprise considering most critics didn't think it lived up to the prestige of the other fine pictures that year such as The Piano and Schindler's List. Although this film is nowhere near the status of Schindler's List, it is quite an entertaining, thrilling action/adventure. Harrison Ford can always be counted on when it comes to being an action hero. He epitomized it in Star Wars as Hans Solo and in Raiders of the Lost Ark as Indiana Jones. Nothing changes for The Fugitive. He is excellent as the lead and Tommy Lee Jones is also superb as the supporting actor, a role for which he won an Oscar and beat out the hard competition of Ralph Fiennes (Schindler's List). The Fugitive is one you should rent if you want to be entertained. It is one of the better-done action films of the 1990's and deserved everyone of it's Oscar nominations (received seven in all).****/5</fullReview>

But this movie stands not only as a big action star vehicle - but as an exciting re-telling of the old 60's TV show. Not every TV to Silver Screen remake is a winner on the Big Screen - but this one certainly is ... and go figure - the third incarnation currently on TV once more is also a bona fide hit!Tommy Lee as fast talking, quick thinking no nonsense Sam Gerard is priceless. His supporting cast of agents mesh seamlessly providing well timed patter and the feel of a truly cohesive unit. Although most reprise their roles in US Marshalls - it's never as good as it is here.Ford shines in both his confusion and his resolve and his "swan dive" is a terrific effect. The bad guys are delicious, and even though you KNOW the ultimate ending you are still consumed by the action and suspense.Alas, the beautiful and talented Sela Ward has only a minor role.I've watched this one again and again!8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film is both exciting and very tense.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the great original t.v. series from the sixities, "The Fugitive", directed by Andrew Davis ("Under Siege") is just as entertaining as the tv series itself. It's about Dr. Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford), who is convicted for the murder of his wife, Helen (Sela Ward) in Chicago. The local detectives think Kimble did it for the money while Kimble knows that he was framed by a man with artificial limb. He gets the chance to prove his innocence by escaping a frightening train-bus wreck. Samuel Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones, who won a Best Supporting Oscar) and his small band of U.S. Marshals arrive at the scene and follow the clues that Kimble leaves for them. It doesn't take too long for Gerard and Kimble to meet face-to-face, they meet in a sewer. Kimble, who's holding Gerard's gun, says to Gerard in a scared tone, " I didn't kill my wife." Gerard quickly replies, " I don't care." That leads to one of the best scenes in the movie where Kimble jumps off the edge of a dam right into a river. That's pure filmmaking and stunts like this are common in a Davis film. I liked Gerard's description of Kimble's escape to Cosmo Renfro (Joe Pantliano), his main deputy "He did a 'Peter Pan' right off the top of this dam. Right here." The second half of the film is mostly a patient cat-and-mouse chase. It isn't fast-paced as the first and the ending is well-made. What makes "The Fugitive" work so well is I didn't only root for Kimble, but I rooted (and laughed) for Gerard as well. Besides Davis's smart direction and handling of the film's pace, the story by David S. Twohy is masterfully written and is near perfection.  Harrison Ford gives another unforgettable performance as Kimble, but Jones is the stand out here as Gerard. The supporting cast is great, too and "The Fugitive" is a classic film that shouldn't go unseen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tommy Lee Jones is a great actor and his Oscar is much deserved. I have wondered, though, that nobody has ever commented on what is apparently a great goof in this movie (Well, possibly it's just me who do not see it clearly). After the best action scene of all time where Kimble narrowly escapes from the bus getting hit by the train, Sheriff Rollins talks to one of the guards on the bus, who says that he saved his friend, because: "He is my partner. He would have done the same for me." But some time later, we hear someone shout: "We've got a live one" and they find the policeman. But since his partner was already commented on saving him, hasn't he already been found? Well, anyway, this is a fantastic action movie that I can watch again and again, and I can not recommend it enough. It's got energy, attitude, power and humour, which balanced in the right way make movies great. Thank you, Andrew Davies for an experience that I enjoy again and again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Fugitive" is so innovative, exciting, exhilarating, and smart that it is near impossible to dislike. Based on the 1960s television series of the same name, the film deals with a doctor who has been wrongfully convicted of a crime that he did not commit. The Chicago Police Department believes that Dr. Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford) is the one who killed his wife (Sela Ward). When Ford escapes, in one of the greatest scenes ever captured on film, he is constantly haunted by the obsessed Detective Sam Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones in his Oscar-winning role) whose only goal is to return Ford to justice. The film is one-part action thriller, one-part mystery drama, and one-part character study. Needless to say, the film works to perfection on all levels. The direction and screenplay are inspired and Jones's performance lifts all those around him to an even higher level. Harrison Ford also quietly gives one of the best performances of his storied career. "The Fugitive" was probably the best film of 1993 behind "Schindler's List". A really great film that is a must-see for all serious fans of the cinema. 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great performances, great story and some great action scenes make this one of the best action films of the 1990's.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Fugitive is an extremely rare type of movie in that it manages to succeed not only as a excellent movie based on a television series but also as a great movie on its own. The plot is simple: Dr. Richard Kimble is wrongly accused of brutally murdering his wife and is sentenced to execution. While on route to being executed he is involved in a train/bus wreck and manages to escape. However he finds he is soon being tracked down by Jones and just about every cop and is determined to find the real killer to prove his innocence. In a movie like this you need to have good performances in order for the script to work and The Fugitive is full of them. The character of Dr. Richard Kimble is a tailor made role for Harrison Ford who gives a strong sense of believability to each of his roles and this one is no exception. Here Ford perfectly exemplifies an everyman with skill and determination. Jones' role could have been a throwaway but he manages to bring a quirky sense of humour and craftiness to his performance and won an much deserved Oscar. Unlike in most action movies, we are given intelligent characters we can root for and more importantly ones we can care about. The cat and mouse games between the two are extremely enjoyable to watch as a result of this. Even the supporting performances are good especially Joe Pantoliano who provides comic relief while actually serving a purpose (as one of Jones' partners). Director Andrew Davis allows moments for the Ford and Jones characters to develop and what could have been just another action film is elevated by Davis' intent to focus more on building suspense than John Woo gun battles (a wise choice on his part) and though the film does contain several outstanding action sequences they actually feel like they belong here rather than just being gratuitous, since one of them provides the basis for the rest of the movie. Blessed with great performances, a great script and some great action scenes sums up why this movie works and why others don't. Something I've always thought about movies that follow formulas is that it's not the formula that makes the movie bad, it's how the formula is handled. The Fugitive is an exception to the rule that movies based on T.V. series are bad and therefore succeeds by never letting up for a minute from beginning to end. It holds up brilliantly on repeated viewings and is one of the best action films of the 1990's. Rating:****1/2 out of *****</fullReview>

You don't need explosions and car crashes when you have those.But this movie does gives you one big crash, and because just one they evidently decided it had better be big. The bus crash / train wreck is alone worth seeing the movie for. ("How do they DO that?" asked my wife. "Once", I replied)Escapist adventure fare that is not mindless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A slice of great filmmaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now THIS is what movies should be made of! In "The Fugitive," we have a taut thriller with twists, turns, motives, and false accusations, a myriad of stunts and chase scenes, and of course, two incredible actors in the starring roles! I am, of course, referring to the irrepressable Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones. Ford, once again a nice-but-tough guy is fleeing from the law, led by US Marshall Sam Gerard (Jones.) The acting here is flawless, and at that, it's hard to even think of it as acting. Ford seems to simply "be" his character, without overdoing emotional scenes to draw attention to himself. Instead he wisely chooses to underplay and thus make his performance all the move believable. Jones is a bit of a contrast; his hyper, relentless, and so-darn-likeable Gerard continues the pursuit without voicing his opinions, however, they are evident in his mannerisms, his expressions, and we see a very complex character at work here. It is no wonder Jones earned the Best Supporting Actor Oscar, as it was richly deserved. I would recommend this film solely on the merits of its two main players, but the rest of the cast--most notably the Chicago police squad--is excellent, as is the writing and finished product. A four star bust if I ever saw one!</fullReview>

He escapes on the way to prison and sets out to find who really commited the murder. Davis is a master at creating suspense, and Tommy Lee Jones (in a role that Kevin Spacey would be excellent in) is superb as the U.S. Marshal hunting down Ford.+ (GOOD THINGS) 1.) the performances 2.)

		<shortDescription>Ford runs this explosive facelift of the old TV series.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not so many TV-to-film transfers can live up to greatness, but THE FUGITIVE can prove that enhancing an original plotline with a right edge can turn into a super movie. The added suspense lives up to calling this just another mega-thriller that differs the original black-and-white series. Both Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones are fully demanding in giving this the raw energy a simple cat-and-mouse story needs. For interesting terminology, the leading characters are on opposite sides of their personalities, with "good" convict Kimble evading the so-called "villainous" U.S. Marshal who is out to capture him. Ford uses the old INDIANA JONES trick in a couple of the riskiest stunts performed on film, but he keeps the action moving. One drawback is that you're now beginning to notice his recent characters a bit more worrisome than heroic, but Ford gets the job done as usual. Much of THE FUGITIVE displays continuous action and suspense until the rousing climax. Look for a hospital nurse that appears in the form of Julianne Moore. This will most likely end up as one of the Top 10 action thrillers of the decade before the 90s is through.</fullReview>

You want to see him catch the One Armed Man and see his name cleared of murder. Tommy Lee Jones brings humor and determination to the role of Sam Gerard. The film starts off with a spectacular train crash, and then takes you on a trip that spans from damns to skyscrapers.

		<shortDescription>Better Than The TV Series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What makes the 1993 version of "The Fugitive" better than the TV Series? Is it the special effects? Maybe, but I think it's the origin of the one-armed-man. In the TV Series, David Jannsen's nemesis seemed to be using his handicap as an excuse to carry out a life of crime. He seemed like he was looking for sympathy, and didn't deserve it. No wonder handicapped-rights groups took offense to it. Harrison Ford's one-armed-man was a lot better. He was bad, just because he was bad. He sounded like the kind of guy who didn't need an excuse to be dirty, however lame it may have been. Incidentally, the phrase "one-armed-bandit" is also slang for slot machines. I'm surprised that neither the writers of the movie or the show tried to make the prosecutors accuse Kimble of being a compulsive gambler.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones race through the breathless manhunt movie based on the classic TV series. Ford is prison escapee Dr. Richard Kimble, a Chicago surgeon falsely convicted of killing his wife and determined to prove his innocence by leading his pursuer to the one-armed man who actually committed the crime. Jones(he won an Oscar for his role as Sam)is Sam Gerard, an unrelenting bloodhound of a U.S. Marshal. They are hunted and hunter. And as directed by Andrew Davis, their non-stop chase has one exhilarating speed: all-out. So catch him if you can. And catch an 11-on-a-scale-of-10 train wreck (yes, the train is real), a plunge down a waterfall, a cat-and-mouse jaunt through a Chicago St. Patrick's Day Parade and much more.This was one of the best movies of 1993.

		<fullReview>There is nothing wrong with pilfering the premises of old TV-shows provided, I think, that they are plot-driven and not character-driven. It would be wrong, for example, to re-make Hogan's Heroes because it was the quirky mix of characters and the acting that made it a success, not the ridiculous plot. The Fugitive, however, is different because the story provided the impetus rather than the cast, who are merely characters rather than personalities (the wrongly-accused doctor, the obsessed marshal, the one-armed man). Because of this, skilled actors such as Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones can slip into the roles like they are well-worn suits and, together with the enhanced opportunities offered by big-budget cinematics, can create something terrific.Part of the reason this re-make works is that Harrison Ford plays this type of role so well: the reluctant hero, resourceful everyman and unfairly-treated victim. Just about anyone can identify with Ford's plight and imagine themselves in the same situation, and conversely hope that they might use the same courage and initiative. On the other side of the coin is US Marshal Tommy Lee Jones, who is conscientious to the verge of obsession and strives to think like his quarry - but not so blindly that he also doesn't empathise for him. That's what makes The Fugitive better than the average cop-and-crim chase movie: both characters are likable, and the climactic meeting between them doesn't disappoint.It has its fair dose of action, but not so much that it overrides or smothers the tension and suspense of the plot. While not at the pinnacle of film-making, The Fugitive is great viewing that treats both its substance and its audience with respect and intelligence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Action Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of the action films are stupid, involving hillbillies in junk car crashes, directed by Hollywood B directors, and acted out by C actors from San Fernando Valley (during a break from Pno, movies!) meant for people with double digit IQ's, who frequent Denny's for gourmet food. This movie was "loosely" based on Dr. Sam Shepard murder case, in Clevland Ohio, in 1954. In that case the intruder was blamed for the murder of his wife Marilyn Reese Sheppard, as she lay sleeping. Sam Sheppard, an osteopath, was convicted with evidence and motive (she intended to divorce him, muddy his reputation and take his hard earned money) He was released after ten years in jail, but died only 4 years later at the age of 46, due to drug, alcohol overdose and Remorse? The two writers-who are just brilliant-take the story and give an incredible twist to this case that makes this action picture a marvel of a movie.The action is gripping and never ending! This is the challenge of the intellect of one man vs the resources of the machine (practically any one with a uniform and a ID badge.) Tommy Lee Jones, is terrific (won Oscar.) Harrison Ford, is a good action actor more than an actor known for his acting. We also have Julianne Moore, as a very sexy looking Dr. Eastman in an otherwise drab County hospital. Just the scene with the bus hit by the train is worth the price of the movie. The editing and direction is immaculate. All said and done one heck of a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tommy Lee Jones and Harrison Ford in a superb movie remake of the TV series.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harrison Ford may have gotten the top billing, but Tommy Lee Jones stole the movie. And since Ford is no slouch in "The Fugitive," that gives you some idea of how good Jones is in this big-screen remake of the 1960's TV series that starred David Janssen.It's the same plot as the TV series: Dr. Richard Kimble, played by Harrison Ford, is put on trial and convicted of the murder of his wife (played by Sela Ward). Ford had arrived on the scene of the murder in time to tussle with the murderer, but he had to let the assailant go as he tried unsuccessfully to save his wife. Detectives summoned to the scene are unconvinced by Kimble's tale of a one-armed man on the scene, and suspicion quickly settles on Kimble.He is tried and convicted of the murder and sentenced to death. As he is being transported to death row on a bus with a bunch of other prisoners who are being moved, a couple of the other prisoners stage an escape. The attempt goes wrong, the bus goes off the road and onto a railroad track, and in the chaotic seconds before a train impacts the bus, Kimble saves the life of a guard and then manages to make his escape in the aftermath of the wreck.And that sets up the rest of the movie: it's a pure chase, a hunt with Ford as the hunted and US Marshal Samuel Gerard, played by Jones, as the hunter.The chase is played out in a series of episodes that take Kimble back to Chicago, where he practiced medicine and where his wife was murdered. With Gerard and his crew hot on his trail and sometimes just minutes behind him, Kimble has to try to track down the one-armed man and figure out why his wife was murdered.It's a suspenseful chase, during which Gerard comes to the conclusion that Kimble is not the cold-blooded wife murderer the Chicago police and DA think he is. This leads to the climactic chase/fight scene, in which Harrison's Dr. Kimble is vindicated and cleared of the murder as he brings the real murderer, and the man who hired the murderer, to justice.This is a great entertainment movie with some very well-done chase sequences. The train wreck that starts the action is an amazing piece of special effects and action photography. There are some jaw-dropping stunts and the fight sequence at the end keeps you on the edge of your seat right down to the end, even though we know before the movie even starts how it's going to turn out.Harrison Ford is excellent in the role of Dr. Kimble, but make no mistake: whatever the billing says, this is Tommy Lee Jones' movie. He's smart and funny and riveting to watch, and even though your sympathies might be for Kimble, you can't help but be cheering Gerard on as he hunts Kimble down.This is one of my favorite action/suspense movies, and even though it's now 18 years old, it's still great entertainment to watch. Certainly if you enjoy seeing Tommy Lee Jones in a role that allows him to steal the movie from Harrison Ford, you're going to want to catch "The Fugitive." It's also the best example I know of how to take a TV series and successfully translate it into a big-screen movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A murdered wife. A one-armed man. An obsessed detective. The chase begins. Harrison Ford is The Fugitive. Are you hooked yet? I don't know about you but this is enough to get my attention. The tagline pretty much sums up all the important aspects of The Fugitive. Harrison Ford plays Dr. Richard Kimble who comes home one night to find his wife murdered. He is accused of committing the crime and, despite pleading innocent and telling everyone it was a mysterious one armed man who killed her, he is sentenced to death. Kimble escapes his detainment and begins a relentless search for his wife's true killer. All the while he is being chased by Detective Samuel Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones), only making his search all the more difficult.The Fugitive is a cool film. That's really all I can say. It has got a lot of great aspects to it that keep you interested and very entertained. If you are into thrilling mysteries with plenty of enticing action then this is a great movie for you. The movie mostly plays out with the kind of tone you would expect, throwing in a few tricks along the way that makes for a very entertaining story. This film never lost my interest but it never spiked it. I was amused by the film the whole way through and enjoyed it enough to not regret watching it at all. It boasts some great set pieces and fun chase sequences through these busy urban sets. The film has a lot of characters but the only two that really draw you in are Kimble and Gerard. The two are played excellently by Ford and Jones respectively.The best way to describe The Fugitive would be high quality escapist entertainment. This is simply one of those movies you take at face value. There isn't a whole lot to take out of this film, and you really just have to watch it for a good time. It pretty much succeeds in that area. I wasn't blown away by this film but I wasn't bored or irritated by it either. It doesn't have any glaring issues that bothered me other than the occasional silly line or ridiculous moment that makes you go, "yeah right." Overall it isn't a movie that is very aesthetically impressive, but it does have its moments. This isn't one of those films that you can bash, but rather just accept it for the fun use of two hours of your life that it is.The Fugitive is a lot of fun and it's easy to enjoy. It doesn't require a significant amount of brainpower but it isn't a braindead schlock of a film either. When you look at the action thriller genre, The Fugitive stands as the genre done just right. There isn't too much or too little with this film, it's simply just a good ole film that is worth the watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Minority Report</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I would rather read a poorly structured story that has fresh ideas than a tightly structured one with clichs." ? Douglas Wood"Television is like the American toaster, you push the button and the same thing pops up every time." ? Alfred HitchcockAlfred Hitchcock perfected the "man on the run" genre with such films as "Saboteur", "Foreign Correspondent", "The 39 Steps" and "North By Northwest", all films in which falsely accused men try to evade capture whilst simultaneously trying to prove their innocence. It doesn't matter if our heroes are guilty or why they're being chased, all that matters is that the possibility of capture keeps the audience in constant state of excitement. You might say the entire genre is a MacGuffin: an excuse to spin action.The "man on the run" genre remained dormant for several years before the success of "The Fugitive" gave birth to another round of copycats ("Chain Reaction", "US Marshals", "Eraser", "Enemy of the State", "Minority Report", "The Incredible Hulk", "Quantum of Solace" etc), all released afterwards and each slavishly copying Hitchcock's formula. Where "The Fugitive" differs from these films, though, is in its casting of Tommy Lee Jones. Jones plays a loud-mouthed law-man tasked with hunting Richard Kimble, a doctor falsely accused of murdering his wife. But while most of these "man on the run" films generate their thrills by having the audience side with the "running man" (in this case Harrison Ford), "The Fugitive" is exciting because the audience sides with both hunter and hunted, both Ford and Jones intelligent and resourceful "good guys" who are equally fun to watch.Incidentally, Steven Spielberg's "Minority Report" steals heavily from "The Fugitive". Both films begin with "flashbacks" of a murder, shot in dreamy fragments. Both films feature a sequence in which the hunter and hunted eye one another through bullet proof glass (a clich of the genre: see everything from "Eraser" to "Salt"). Both films feature a scene in which a commuter on a train sees the fugitive's face on a newspapers whilst sitting directly opposite him. Both films feature the villain being unmasked in front of an audience of partying sophisticates. Both films feature a bad guy who is also a paternal friend and corporate head who frames the hero for the benefit of the "company"....etc etc. But there's tons of other reappropriated scenes as well, like our running man hiding in crowds while their pursuers look down from above, our heroes hiding in dingy apartment blocks while police look for other people, our heroes changing their eyes or cutting their beards to break back into their work places and instead of Harrison Ford jumping off a reservoir we have Tom Cruise jumping off skyscraper cars.But then Spielberg has always been a clich parasite. "Minority Report" doesn't only stop at "The Fugitive", it lifts scenes from "Se7en" ("Will I kill him? Won't I kill him?"), "A Clockwork Orange", "LA Confidential" (the chief of police is the bad guy, whilst the guy we're supposed to hate, Colin Farrell, is really a hero) and "Blade Runner" (creator of pre-crime kissing Tom Cruise).But it's the "villain clichs" that have become most pervasive. All these films, from "The Fugitive" to "Minority Report" to "Chain Reaction" to "District 9" to "LA Confidential" to "Monster's Inc", feature the "shocking" revelation that the "bad guy" is really an affable corporate head who covers up a crime for the benefit of the company. In "The Fugitive" the villain tries to pass a new pharmaceutical drug, in "Minority" the villain tries to pass a pre-crime law, in "Monster's Inc" the villain tries to pass a new energy plan. Pharmaceuticals, law enforcement, the energy commission...the modern villain is always a tuxedo wearing corporate lackey, all these films incorrect in individualising and personalising processes that are social, collective and systemic, an approach which implies that it is just a question of personal morality rather than social structures. Incidentally, Tommy Lee Jones would continually revisit the archetypal character he created in "The Fugitive". More often than not, Jones plays an authoritative hunter, capable of reinstating order ("US Marshals", "No Country For Old Men", "Electric Mist", "The Hunted", "Men In Black", "Volcano", "Small Soldiers", "In The Valley of Ellah" etc).7.9/10 - Worth two viewings.</fullReview>

It was him, Richard Kimble, not Helen who was the killers actual target!Mile a minute action thriller with Dr. Kimble, with a bum knee no less, running the length of the Chicago Marathon in his pursuit of justice where at the same time justice, in the Chicago PD FBI and US Marshals, trying to both capture and have him executed for a crime that he didn't commit! Having uncovered the truth about this drug Provasic causing serious liver damage to those who use it Kimble didn't at first realize what he was getting into by trying to bring that major fact about the drug out to the American people. ***SPOILERS*** With literally billions of dollars at stake the company that produced Provasic put a hit out on Kimble in order to shut him up an thus have the drug, with approval by the Food and Drug Administration, made available to the public. As Kimble slowly started to uncover the truth to who were both behind his wife's murder and those who hired him to do it his only hope now is, by using himself as bait, to draw them out into the open. Powerhouse final with Kimble having it out with both his wife's killer, on a Chicago El-Train, and the person who hired him, at a major Chicago Medical Convention Center, with the Chicago PD and US Marshall Gerard unwittingly coming to his rescue.

		<shortDescription>An all-time chase thriller with 2 enduring performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE FUGITIVE is one of the very few examples where a film adaptation of a hit TV show perhaps surpasses that TV show in scope, ambition, and payoff. The classic 1960s series "THE FUGITIVE", starring the perfectly cast David Janssen as somber, falsely accused Dr. Richard Kimble, has been one-upped by this 1993 masterpiece of an action-adventure film THE FUGITIVE, starring the rugged, unique Harrison Ford in the role of Kimble. Ford has similarities to Janssen, but there are also differences. Ford is much more burly and more of an intimidating presence than Janseen was and so you couldn't see Janssen kicking someone's ass the way Ford could. But Ford definitely does excellent job of capturing the calm, meek, quiet nature that Janssen so perfectly conveyed in the series, with added touches of desperation and fear. This is important as Kimble was always designed to be a 'regular everyday Joe', one of us. We HAVE to relate to him and sympathize with him and the more cocky, brutish characters that Ford has played in the past (Han Solo, Indiana Jones, etc.) have no part in this movie. I just hate that Ford didn't get a Best Actor nomination for this film as it is truly a performance deserving of one.The 2nd great performance in this already-classic film is that of Tommy Lee Jones, who truly came into his own with this movie. He won Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, but c'mon! We all know he was really the 2nd lead of this film. Jones plays Kimble's pursuer Deputy Marshal Sam Gerard (in the series it was Barry Morse playing Lt. Philip Gerard). About the only thing Jones and Morse have in common is that they are short men. That's about it! While Morse was much more calm and reserved as Gerard, Jones' Gerard is all out full-throttle, in-your-face, get-the-job-done-or-else version of the character. Full of juice throughout the entire film, Jones conveys a man obsessed with doing his job at whatever cost, but along the way, we get to see flashes of humanity and insight that makes us realize that Gerard isn't just some carbon copy blind cop. He begins to realize that maybe Kimble's assertion that he didn't kill his wife might be true. Kimble is a 'fugitive' and Gerard is fully within his right to arrest him and bring him in, whether Kimble is guilty of his convicted crime or not, but at the same time, Gerard's no-nonsense persona shines at welcome moments when he's dealing with people who are either buffoonish, deceptive, or apathetic. This is a key ingredient that makes this film work.Another brilliant aspect of this film is all the minor characters that Kimble encounters along the way, none of which have a big role, but all seem like actual people, just going about their everyday business. But none of these characters detract from the main plot of the film, thus THE FUGITIVE flows throughout.Like many great action films, the film contains some exciting scenes and set pieces (the train crash, the dam chase, the county jail chase, and the exciting climax with the one-armed man).Special mention should also go to the actors (Daniel Roebuck, L. Scott Caldwell, Tom Wood, and especially Joe Pantoliano), who play Gerard's deputies aiding him in the search for Kimble. The chemistry of this group is totally convincing and fun to watch and listen to.Andrew Davis directed this Best Picture nominee from 1993 and I would definitely rate it as one of the best films of the 1990s and one of the best action films ever!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a wonderful movie. The story goes to show you that even in 1993 cops and prosecutors were just as crooked as they are today. Cops will twist the truth and make innocent people look guilty so they can "pretend" to solve a case and become a local hero. It is really sad how the law works. Most cops spend weeks not months or years in school and then all of the sudden they have a badge and that makes them invisible, above God. It's disgusting. I'm so sick of hearing about how cops care about the city, they protect you, blah, blah, blah. I have never once been in trouble with the law, and yet, the few I have met have been rude, ungrateful jerks. Maybe this post really has nothing to do with the movie, but people need to know that most cops are crooked jerks. As for 9/11, the real heroes that day were the fire fighters, not the lazy cops.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another great film of the nineties,The Fugitive is a film that would inspire future movies/shows such as Prison Break and Shooter.Harrison Ford plays Dr.Richard Kimble who is a vascular surgeon wrongly accused of murdering his wife and when the opportunity arises,he goes on the run from the Chicago police and the US Marshals led by the sometimes ruthless and humorous Sam Gerard(Academy Award winner of 1993 Tommy Lee Jones).I thought before watching this film that it would end up being mostly drama but it also a crime/thriller and action movie as much as it is a drama.I was a bit surprised that Tommy Lee Jones would win an Academy Award for a performance that was more reminiscent of an action movie villain than a dramatic character.I was also a bit surprised that Harrison Ford wasn't nominated for an Academy Award as in my view,this was one of his best and most memorable performances in his career so far.Bravo!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had never heard of the original TV series when the movie first came out, but when I saw the movie several years later, I was quite impressed. What's really interesting is the dichotomy of Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford) trying to escape, Sam Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones) trying to catch him, and how both men try to outsmart each other.OK, so how many man-on-the-run movies can there be? Well, "The Fugitive" justifies them. And while Tommy Lee Jones - who won Best Supporting Actor - has since become typecast as the pursuer, remember that this was the original. Of course, Harrison Ford is the real reason for the movie. His gravitas reaches unmatchable levels here. A real treat. Also starring Sela Ward, Julianne Moore and Jeroen Krabbe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Chase Is On!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not much of a fan of films adapted from TV shows. Most are dreadful, but there are a few that work well when stretched to feature-length. The Addams Family, Starsky &amp; Hutch, and The Fugitive.When The Fugitive was released in 1993, films spun off from TV shows was not the common occurrence it is today. The Fugitive is one that works, and works better on the big screen. Through sharp, taut direction, virtuoso action scenes and two great performances from Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones.The film uses the basic framework of the series and takes it to great new places. Ford is Chicago surgeon Dr Richard Kimble. A respected man who loves his wife Helen (Sela Ward) dearly, his perfect life is shattered when a one-armed man breaks in to their home, and batters Helen to death. Richard can do nothing to save her, and fate deals him a cruel hand when her murder is pinned on him.In a shocking ten minute prologue, the film goes through the motions of Richard's arrest, trial and eventual sentencing to death with an almost frightening rapidity. These scenes are short, clipped and devoid of excessive material. They're important because it sets up the atmosphere that constantly hangs over Richard for the duration of the film. It is a point where the whole world is seemingly against him.But Richard gains his freedom in the first of many marvellous, exhilarating action sequences. The prison bus he's on is hijacked by the other prisoners on board, and it ends up on the train tracks, just in time for a meeting with an oncoming train. Watching Richard jump from the bus before the collision is one sight you won't forget in a hurry.Enter Deputy Sam Gerard, the US Marshal on Kimble's trail. Tommy Lee Jones pulls out all the stops here, putting in an Oscar winning performance. You perk up every time he's on the scene, because you know you'll be entertained. Although Sam is initially portrayed as an obsessive lawman with no qualms about catching his quarry, Jones is skilled enough to bring more dimensions to his character.Jones' best scenes are with his team of deputies. Although they're dead set on catching Kimble, director Andrew Davis is smart to add a little comic relief to counter-balance the building tension. Sam's deputies affectionately snipe at each other, but they are real people. My favourite scene is when Sam and one of his deputies, Newman, apprehend another fugitive. Newman is taken hostage, and Sam is forced to kill their fugitive. When Sam checks if Newman is OK, this scene speaks volumes about Sam's character. Behind that cynical front is a thoughtful man who cares a great deal for the people who work with him.The Fugitive is a story of two halves. Richard searching for the one-armed man, and Sam's deepening investigations. Ford is a great deal more subdued than Jones, but you do feel for his plight. And with Ford's status as an everyman, he is perfectly suited to this character who has to continually change identities and locales to stay one step ahead of the law.The film is admittedly a little vague about how Kimble gets the money for new clothes and hair dye, but that comes with the territory. Since Davis has such a firm hand on the reins, he keeps things ticking along nicely. And Kimble's own investigation is logically explored.Kimble's unforgettable swan-dive off the top of a dam is master stunt-work on an epic scale. And there are many thrilling chase sequences. Too many to mention, but the best is Kimble's near death at Sam's hand at the County lock-up.There is an immense amount of satisfaction in watching Kimble put it together. It's a puzzle that needs to be solved. And I wouldn't dream of spoiling it for you. The Fugitive is at it's best when the slick plot direction is moving forward, even though it leads to a few dead-ends and near misses for our hero.It all comes together nicely with Kimble finding the killer (or killers), and Sam and police catching up to him at the same time. Still, in regards to the police, the film requires some stupidity on their part, since they're so willing to ignore any possibility that Kimble might be innocent. It's left to Sam's team to put the pieces together and save the day.The Fugitive is excellent. A refreshingly character based action film that is a rarity these days. Look out for some fine supporting performances from Julianne Moore, Joe Pantoliano and the underrated Jane Lynch. All component parts of a much larger masterpiece.The finest action film of the 90's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE FUGITIVE, in my opinion, is an excellent, nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat action movie that you'll want to see over and over again. I know I wanted to see it over and over again after I first saw it on WTTG in September 2002. If you ask me, Kimble (Harrison Ford) was a very desperate man out to prove the fact that he didn't kill Helen (Sela Ward). It sort of reminds me of THE NEGOTIATOR, only this movie mostly takes place outdoors. Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones) was a dogged U.S. Marshal in my opinion. This is because he wouldn't stop chasing Kimble. In conclusion, I recommend this excellent, nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat action movie that you'll want to see over and over again to all you Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones fans who haven't seen it. When you see this movie, hold on tight and prepare to be taken on a wild ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a pretty standard thriller. Harrison Ford performs pretty well, in fact, most of the actors portray their characters very good. I really liked the typical in-your-face smart-ass character that Tommy Lee Jones' played; he was a great comic relief, coupled with Joe Pantoliano. I also enjoyed the inventiveness of Harrison Ford's character, throughout the movie. The plot is interesting, but I guess it's mostly there as an excuse for a mostly standard thriller. The characters are believable and all the actors portray their respective characters well, with no exception. The suspense is pretty good, and it lasts for most of the movie; unfortunately, at the very end it seemed to degenerate into a typical thriller, and for this movie, it just seemed like it had the potential to be better than that. The movie is one of the better thrillers, but it's only worth watching if you like standard thrillers, and you're just looking for the pick of the bunch. I'd only recommend this to fans of standard thrillers, or fans of any of the main actors. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rarely do we see a classic TV series brought to life so well on the big screen. Even though McHales Navy, The Brady Bunch, and Lost In Space were not very good shows, the film adaptations of them were even worse. The Fugitive was a very good TV show, full of great plot, drama, and suspense, but the film version is even better.Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones, need I say more? These two actors brought more intensity, feeling, and flat out great acting to The Fugitive than no other two actors could have hoped to. The plot of the film is fantastic: A doctor (Harrison Ford) is framed for the murder of his wife and sentenced to death, he escapes during a train wreck and is pursued by an obsessed U.S. Marshall (Tommy Lee Jones) as the good doctor works to prove that the one armed man, and not himself, is guilty of his wifes murder.While Harrison Ford is great, and very believable, Tommy Lee Jones steals the show as the man who will stop at nothing to catch Dr. Richard Kimball. You can feel the fear of Dr. Kimball as he runs for his life, and fears capture every day, as do you feel the need for the U.S. Marshalls to catch this man. The chemistry between Tommy Lee Jones and Harrison Ford in the scenes that they do share could never be re-created. The suspense is very intense. I would rate this film as one of the 10 best films of all time, it unfolds before you so beautifully, and the ending is excellent. If you've never seen it, then you should steal a car, go rent it, then blame it on the one-armed man.</fullReview>

The biggest problem is that Davis is too pedestrian in his methods and never adopts a useful style. Richard Donner and Spielberg have covered multiple topics in their careers, but have also maintained a sense of style. Davis takes everything at face value.Here Ford is called upon to do something other than quip Lucas-inspired dialog, something he also failed at with Witness. Pantoliano does his usual cross-Buscemi routine. Jones does his 'Under Siege' bit all over again.Simply put, here's as dramatic as Davis and his cohorts can get.Final Analysis = = Midrange Material</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They don't make 'em like this anymore. Really.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who would have thought that just ten years later this kind of blockbuster would be an endangered species? Well-written, tastefully shot, and as realistic as it can reasonably be, considering the genre? Today's action movies are all empty exercises in CGI, with ludicrous contrivance and sitcom-poor wisecracks where plot and characterization ought to be.But once upon a time, there were movies like `The Fugitive.' For a movie with train wrecks and dam plunges, today it looks deliciously subtle. A simple, scary premise leads to a hang-on-to-your-hat chase across Illinois. (Has there ever been a movie that made such great use of Chicago locations?) The plot is well thought-out, and the action set pieces are terrifically conceived and executed. At its best, it reminded me of `North by Northwest,' and that's pretty darn good, in my book.When it came out, I remember wondering why everyone was raving about it so much; after all, it was just a popcorn thriller, albeit a well-made one. Looking at today's action movies, it's not so hard to understand anymore. When was the last time mainstream movies had fight scenes like this? You know, the kind where people actually look like they're getting hurt? The final standoff between hero and villain has both of them bleeding, limping, practically falling down. In movies like `The Matrix' and `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' and `Charlie's Angels,' the fighting is more like ballet--it's just as graceful, just as ridiculous, and just as boring. (Although, to be fair, Peter Jackson's `Lord of the Rings' series is taking movie fighting back in the right direction.)When was the last time an action-movie script defined its characters so well with such little effort? Of course you're going to feel for the falsely accused protagonist--but you also come away respecting and liking those who are hunting him. Tommy Lee Jones may play the same part in everything--let's face it, people, he really does--but he's never found a better home for his schtick than here. But you don't just like him; you also like--and feel you know--the four or five people in his staff, who probably have twenty or thirty lines between the lot of them. That's a real accomplishment. The dialogue is smart without being too self-conscious or jokey--another thing you don't see much anymore.It's hard to say when we'll see a movie like this again. It's still just a popcorn thriller--but they don't make popcorn thrillers like they used to. 8.5. out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Innocent Man On The Run</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of all the old TV shows that have become big-screen movies, THE FUGITIVE must be one of the very few that actually works. A transfer to the big screen of a fine TV series that starred the late David Janssen and ran on ABC-TV from 1963 to 1967, THE FUGITIVE had all the earmarks of a great film, and it does not disappoint.Taking over for Janssen, Harrison Ford stars as Dr. Richard Kimble, a prominent Chicago surgeon who is convicted for the brutal slaying of his wife Helen (Sela Ward)--a crime he did not commit. While on his way to meet his fate in an Illinois prison, the bus he and other prisoners are riding in suffers an accident, and is literally crushed by a freight train. Ford manages to make it out of the wreckage and escapes into the woods. Now, however, he not only has the whole Illinois state police and the Chicago P.D. on his trail, he also has a phalanx of U.S. marshals, led by the tenacious Sam Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones).With all the odds stacked against him, Ford constantly has to change his appearance to avoid detection while at the same time going after the one-armed man who actually killed his wife. The result is a gripping cat-and-mouse game through the streets of the Windy City, a literal battle of wits between Ford and Jones that made for some of the best movie-making of the Nineties.Superbly directed by Andrew Davis (UNDER SIEGE; CODE OF SILENCE), THE FUGITIVE is not only a brilliant big-screen translation of a fine TV show from the past, it also echoes a theme familiar to Alfred Hitchcock--a man on the run for a crime he never committed. Ford is the man in that position. Jones won a well-deserved Supporting Actor Oscar for his role as Gerard, but as Jones himself readily admitted, it is Ford's portrayal of Richard Kimble that is at the heart of this great thriller. Not nearly as violent as a lot of action films have tended to be, THE FUGITIVE is one of the finest in its genre, well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superb action film, with a twist.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the greatest action films ever made, "The Fugitive" tells the story of Dr. Richard Kimble, a surgeon falsely convicted of killing his wife, and how he is pursued by the relentless Deputy Sam Gerard after his escape from police custody. As exciting as the film's action scenes are (especially the one showing the bus-train crash that allows Kimball to escape), they do nothing tp eclipse the sheer power of the two main actors, Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones. Jones especially is so intriguing, and his character so interesting, that you constantly ask yourself when he will re-emerge when he is not on screen (though Ford is wonderful as well in a somewhat more conventional role).The film wisely asks you to see a manhunt from two very different perspectives. Ford is the escapee fighting for his very life, and he rushes almost nonstop in and around Chicago in an attempt to prove his innocence of the crime of which he has been convicted. Jones, a U.S. Marshall, is concerned only with bringing his fugitive back to justice, as is revealed in the now-famous exchange, made when Jones confronts Ford for the first time (and at gunpoint):Kimble: I didn't kill my wife!Gerard: I don't care.Two minor faults: the scene in which the reason for Kimble's framing is revealed is just a tad confusing, or was to me at any rate. Also, "The Fugitive" takes the all-too-familiar route of having a final chase scene that takes up a significant percentage of the movie's running time. I realize that this is the way action movies are "supposed" to end, but I always find the protracted expenditure of energy on the characters' part personally draining rather than invigorating. Sometimes less is more, even in this genre.That aside, a fantastic film with surprises at every turn, and bonuses of the kind ya can't hardly find no more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The chase is on</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based as it is on the famous television series everyone knows the rather simple premise of this film. Dr. Richard Kimble is accused of murdering his wife but we know darned well that Kimble is innocent. No mystery here, the one-armed man did it. Unfortunately for the good doctor all the evidence points to himself and he is duly convicted and sentenced to death. But fortune shines on Richard Kimble as while being transported to prison the opportunity for him to escape presents itself. After a thrilling, wonderfully executed, train wreck sequence Kimble finds himself a free man. In order to remain free he will have to survive in a cold, rugged, unforgiving landscape. And he will need to evade a dogged pursuer. Enter U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard. And away we go.After initially evading capture Kimble faces new challenges. He has to find a way to survive in the world without any money. Not an easy thing. And he has to conduct his own investigation of his wife's murder, find the real killer and prove his innocence. And he must do this while going unnoticed in his hometown of Chicago where more than a few people are looking for him. It's a simple story and there is great tension as the chase begins. Maintaining that level of tension for the over two hour running time of the film would prove to be a challenge. It's a film with an energy that somewhat wanes as we move towards the end.Perhaps the biggest problem with the film is that apparently the filmmakers thought the simple story was a little too simple for its own good. The one-armed man isn't enough, there has to be some kind of grand conspiracy and another dastardly villain. Somebody decided the compelling story of the wrongly accused man wasn't enough. In trying to explain the events leading up to the murder of Kimble's wife the film really does take an unfortunate detour and much of the tension drains out of the story. The film is at its best when Gerard is trying to track down Kimble. Tommy Lee Jones created a truly memorable character with his portrayal of Gerard. While less showy than Jones, Harrison Ford does well with his role as Kimble. Left to their own devices these two characters would have been enough to make a truly excellent film. The film was always about Kimble and Gerard, Ford and Jones. Those are the characters we care about, identify with and root for. In fact Jones is so good, so compelling, that you're almost rooting for his character to succeed as much as you are for the plainly innocent Kimble. But instead of leaving well enough alone with these two men in the end the film devolves into a big conspiracy saga that rather disappoints. As the final act plays out there's too much going on, keeping it simple would have worked much better. The end result is a good film but one which with a more sharply focused story probably could have been something much greater.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the supreme examples of '90s crime action flicks also represents the best of another kind of '90s movie, the TV series remake. "The Fugitive" takes its name, although not so much of its content, from the 1963-67 TV series that starred David Janssen as Dr. Richard Kimble, wrongly convicted of killing his wife, on the lam, and on the trail of a one-armed killer.That's all in the movie, too, with the exception that Harrison Ford now plays Kimble. But since the movie doesn't have the luxury of four seasons worth of hour-long episodes to stretch out the denouement, things are much faster-paced. Just how much faster-paced is established in the opening credit sequence, which shows Kimble arrested, tried, convicted, and escaping a stranded prison bus just ahead of a speeding train in one of moviedom's all-time-best cliffhangers.Director Andrew Davis has had much success with two kinds of movies, those set in Chicago and those featuring Tommy Lee Jones. This has both, so it makes sense that it is Davis's career moment, and Jones' one Oscar-winning performance. Davis's feeling for the Windy City, the grittiness of the backstreets and the skyscrapers lit up like Christmas trees at night, creates a compelling composition. He also populates his film with vivid, authentic-looking characters, like the boarding-house lady and her son, the roller-blading hospital attendant, and the surly CPD detectives, some of whom are welcomely recognizable from Davis's earlier, excellent Chuck Norris vehicle, "Code Of Silence."People are quick to credit Jones for his performance, and he deserved Academy consideration, playing against the Javert formula and walking a tightrope as he alternates between ruthless and determined on the one hand, and amiable and goofy on the other, sometimes in the same scene. His lines aren't that witty or cool, but Jones' delivery of simple lines like "I don't care," "I don't bargain," "We got a gopher," and "The big dog's always right" makes all the difference. The interplay between Jones and his supporting cast of underlings has an engaging yet professional-seeming vibe that draws you in.But Jones' performance wouldn't shine so brightly if he were chasing an actor like Adam Sandler or Howie Long. Harrison Ford really emotes in this film, creating an emotional bond with the audience that keeps him at the center of our attentions no matter how bright and pleasing Jones' pyrotechnics get to be. Ford's breakdown scene during the police interrogation is riveting, nakedly emotional, and all the more surprising because, according to the DVD commentary, it was improvised. Throughout the rest of his performance, Ford dispenses with the glamour shots and lets us in on his character's grasping desperation, whether he's looking through files, making a phony ID, licking egg off his fingers, or shaving his beard. The result is a suspense film that really works because it draws you into feelings so real they hurt.In addition to being a good acting primer, "The Fugitive" also boasts a top-flight clinic on editing. This is apparent not only with the train escape scene and Kimble's other narrow misses, but the fact we are distracted from some obvious plot holes. I won't go into the problematic reveal of the real culprits, except that they would seem unlikely to have been overlooked by the police or by Kimble in any actual investigation worth its salt. The pharmaceutical angle is a weak MacGuffin, not really explaining the whys of the crime. But when you see those flashbacks of the gorgeous Sela Ward dropping rose petals behind her while the killer waits to strike, logic flaws kind of go out the window, at least the first time around.A great film about justice, that works all the better because it plays with the conventions of the form. Who says there's never anything good on TV?</fullReview>

Right away the movie sets it up where you really care for Ford.. and you want his justice served. The cops are of course dumber than dumb - Ford just shaves his beard - and dyes his hair.. and can walk around conducting his own investigation. While the movie is well done given the above scenario, there came a point where I thought: "OMG" how much longer can this plot line be played out? We all know what is going to happen in the end anyways! It seem to me that better editing (shortening) would have made this movie much better. As it is, it takes too long to wrap up. About 2/3rds the way through I got bored.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Betraying the audience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 'The Fugitive', Andrew Davis chose to adapt a television icon into a vehicle for its star, Harrison Ford. Unfortunately, at the same time, Davis managed to provide an icon for a trend that has been plaguing films since, presumably, moviemakers began to run out of viable plot lines: the Dumbing Down of the American Audience Movie. Although numerous examples could be offered from the film to demonstrate this unfortunate trend, the four most vital ones should suffice:1) Ford, a successful and wealthy doctor, presented as being obviously close to his wife, is convicted of his wife's killing with only weak and highly dubious evidence and motive which any decent attorney, let alone the battery of them he should have hired, should have shredded in no time.2) Since the crime was committed in Chicago, and Ford was remanded to the Illinois State prison for the carrying out of his sentence, a U.S. Marshal would not have had jurisdiction. Assuming Illinois is similar to most other states, the state police would be responsible for escaped state felons, and even if help was solicited from the federal government it would be on a collaborative basis at best. Both Tommy Lee Jones's right in asserting control of the case, and the arrogance in which he then conducted himself, were ridiculous.3) The unjustly famous bus/train crash scene suffered from severe problems of continuity and logic. The bus clearly was not on any train tracks when it came to a rest; even if so given the obvious nature of the terrain it would have had to be resting along the tracks instead of across them; the entire scene shifted to an entirely different locale when the train did come along; the second engine of the train was obviously well beyond Ford instead of being behind him when it jumped the tracks; and in any event all he would have had to do was run a few yards at right angles to the engine's path to escape it.4) The one-armed man stated to Jones that he had been previously investigated by the police for the murder of Ford's wife. As a matter of course they should have discovered then what his involvement was with the plot, and should have had more than enough motive to get the police onto the real guilty parties.Given these crucial shortcomings, along with the usual number of absurdities films of this type seem to indulge in (the Chicago police were portrayed as immoral and inept thugs), and the usual number of minor problems (Ford would have had to jump at least 30 feet out to hit the dam's converging water plumes and avoid the concrete wall, and from a standing position to boot!) and coincidences necessary to further the flow of the script (in the enormous Cook County Hospital complex Jones conveniently finds himself at a crucial time right outside the one department having a direct bearing on the movie), one wonders if most of the other reviews at this site were about the same film, especially after its appearance on DVD allows for repeated viewings. The shame of it is that, given more care in directing and continuity, many of the above problems could have been eliminated and 'The Fugitive' might well indeed have been a good or even excellent movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.This is as close as you can get to take advantage of the limited things Jones and Ford can do.Massive stunts at the beginning. Jones struts, Ford scowls and staggers. Then you can settle in for the chase, minor plot twist and obligatory confrontation. But even though this as slick as you can get with this crew, I am amazed at how poorly it has aged. Part of it is the obsolescence of any thriller -- the latest stuff always eclipses the old. But the mechanics of this seem so transparent now. A US marshall with such resources, freedom and personality -- and someone who really would care a hoot about innocence. A specialist physician with any sense of cleverness. The old noodle of the scheming, murderous megacorporation who can manipulate a few facts to advantage.The many, many confrontations among these magnetic characters. The clean resolution of justice at the end. Too much. Too much.I picked it up because I am reviewing Julianne Moore's work. She is in only one small episode, something engineered to convince us of the thorough decency of the doctor. I haven't seen all of her work -- much is difficult to access. But this ranks with `Evolution' as her worst. Both the project as a whole, and her contribution are curdled.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Doctor is Out.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Part of the fun of the original series, lo those many years ago, was watching Doctor Richard Kimble get turned into Doctor Richard Humble. I mean, here he is in the person of David Jansen, and we know he's got a sconce full of medical knowledge and everything, yet he's running from town to town being a gardener or a pool guy or something, never able to show off his skills until the end of the program when he's called on to reveal his identity by saving someone's life. It was like watching Jimmy Stewart in "Destry Rides Again," the newly arrived sheriff acting like a bumbling inarticulate naive idiot until half-way through he unlimbers his guns and leaves the town goggle eyed.The movie lacks the tension associated with that kind of status discrepancy.It doesn't really matter much that Harrison Ford is a doctor. He's only called on to exercise his skills once. And he never is hired as a handy man or chimney sweep so there's no real mystery about his true occupation to be unraveled.I'm pretty much skipping the plot of the movie because it must be pretty well known by now. But I will say that the episodic semi-mystery of the original, with Kimball getting involved in the lives of various locals, has been dropped in favor of a standard chase/action movie, and not a bad one if you disregard certain facts. One of the facts to be disregarded, common to action movies of this caliber, is that the human body is destructible. Instance: Dr. Kimball does this Brody out of a sewer outlet and falls down the greatest biggest most horrifyingly tiptoptoloftical cascade of water you ever saw. The scene reminded me of an old Tarzan movie in which Tarzan dives off one of the towers of the Brooklyn Bridge. Like Tarzan, Harrison Ford, emerges from the midwinter water, shakes himself off like a dog, and makes off through the woods with only a look of irritation to show for the experience.The solution to the murder mystery, when it comes, arrives rather suddenly and without earlier hints. All of a sudden there is something to do with falsified results of liver damage. I don't know what's the big deal about Provasic. I once asked a doctor to give me something for my liver. He gave me a bag of onions and that was that. The ending involves more human indestructibility, multiple shootouts, a helicopter with one of those bright spotlights, a chase across a roof, a fist fight in which middle-aged doctors throw punches that would stun a rhinoceros, and so forth.Harrison Ford is okay. We don't get to see nearly enough of Julianne Moore.She exudes intelligence as well as a peculiar beauty. Tommy Lee Jones is outstanding. He brings something unique to each role. And Joe Pantoliano is as good as always, which is to say pretty good. Joeren Krabbe is a smooth villain. Well, with a name like that, could it be otherwise? Come to think of it, we should have seen more of Sela Ward too, a Southern black-eyed susan if there ever was one. It's easy to understand why, after she was murdered, Ford carried a grudge against the perpetrators.Well, see it if it's on TV sometime. Or rent it if you want action. And if you want action, the first bang-up bus-train collision should keep you happy for a while.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fugitive from concern</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the fact that it was nominated for Best Picture and Tommy Lee Jones' performance took supporting actor, The Fugitve is a middling time killer with a dull Harrison Ford, a mediocre script, and a predictable outcome. An unnecessary film adapted from the 60's TV series, the direction lacks flair, and the locations and cinematography are standard television quality. The TV series had the advantage of a introducing various settings and characters as Dr. Richard Kimble fled the law and recognition. In the film, the action is repetitive and fugitive Kimbel's continued access to the hospital where he once practiced stretches both credulity and patience. In truth, for me it all just didn't really matter and the film seems somewhat overblown. There are a few good scenes, and the perennial interest in seeing the wrongly accused prevail held my attention.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Fugitive (1993) *** 1/2 (out of 4) After wrongfully being convicted of murdering his wife, Dr. Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford) gets a chance to escape and try and track down the real killer but he's got a U.S. Marshall (Tommy Lee Jones) in hot pursuit. Based on the popular 60's TV show, THE FUGITIVE works on so many levels that it's easy to see why it became a hit when originally released and why it remains so popular nearly twenty-years later. I think the greatest thing that the film has going for it is that it basically works as two very good films rolled into one. The first forty-five minutes or so we're given a terrific action film that starts off with an introduction to the murder and conviction of the doctor and then we go full steam into the intense action. We get a terrific train-bus wreck, which is still impressive all these years later and right from here we go for faster action as we see Kimble trying to evade the police and the U.S. Marshall. These scenes are full of wonderful action but the way Andrew Davis keeps the suspense building is where the true magic is. The second half of the film sees a little less action as we find the doctor doing the investigating trying to figure out who killed his wife. Both sequences work so well and especially when you mix them together as you really get a complete film. It also doesn't hurt that you've got two great performances. Ford could play this type of role in his sleep but I still don't think he got enough credit. He's really not playing an action hero here, I mean, serious, he gets beaten by a one-armed man. He really plays a doctor here who must go beyond his normal limits to try and clear his name and I thought Ford did a great job with it. There's no question, however, that the film belongs to Jones who rightfully picked up the Best Supporting Oscar for his work here. I really loved the comic timing that Jones brought the film and I thought this humor really helped make the film so memorable. The highlight for me has to be the scene where a woman is screaming uncontrollably and Jones simply tells her to shut up. Joe Pantoliano, Sela Ward and a briefly scene Julianne Moore are also good in their parts. THE FUGITIVE ends in a way you'd expect it to but there's still no question that it's a tense little thriller that works on most levels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good thriller with an excellent performance from both leading actors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I take it all back! I used to think of Harrison Ford as one of the most overrated Hollywood actors of recent years (and Nicolas Cage as another). I continue to subscribe to my view of the latter. But, in the light of his excellent performance in this slick, entertaining and tense thriller, I think I may have to amend my judgement of Ford. His performance is a masterclass of controlled, understated and believable acting and contributes hugely to one's enjoyment of what is an intelligent and gripping film. Ford plays Dr Richard Kimble, an eminent vascular surgeon in Chicago, who, having been wrongly convicted of his wife's murder, escapes police custody on his way to prison (where he will face the death penalty) and goes on the run in a desperate attempt to track down the real culprit. His escape is facilitated by a spectacular collision between the bus in which he is being transported to jail and a train. In the immediate aftermath of that incident, Kimble manages to escape the clutches of the security officers who are responsible for his transfer. While on the run, he is tenaciously pursued by wisecracking Marshal Sam Gerard (played brilliantly by Tommy Lee Jones). The film, which is loosely based on a TV series of the same name that was made in the 1960s, features the cat and mouse chase between Kimble and Gerard and the former's quest to overturn the miscarriage of justice of which he is a victim."The Fugitive" is essentially a chase movie. But it is a rather better one than many films of its kind. The acting, direction, dialogue and glossy cinematography are all first class. The train and bus collision that allows Kimble to make his getaway is brilliantly and spectacularly depicted. And a scene in which he dives into a waterfall is also wonderfully filmed. I do, however, have some reservations about the movie. In particular, certain elements of the plot strain credulity. The ease with which Kimble is seemingly able to enter and wander around hospital buildings unchallenged is, frankly, incredible. That goes especially for one such incident in which he is mistakenly regarded by a medic as a hospital porter and is asked to transport a young patient to the operating theatre. En route, and after a brief chat with the patient about his medical history, Kimble makes use of his knowledge and expertise and amends the patient's medical notes and the written details of the treatment recommended for him. By doing so, he saves the patient's life! The way in which Kimble manages to evade Gerard by making a giant leap into the gurgling waterfall of a massive dam and emerge mentally and physically unscathed, with the contents of a wallet in a pocket of his trousers undamaged, frankly beggars belief. There are one or two other scenes that do not ring true for the same reason. There are also some minor continuity errors. But the film somehow gets away with these mistakes, primarily because there is far more that is right about it than is wrong. "The Fugitive" is an energetic, intelligent and entertaining film that is well worth watching. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Harrison Ford, Tommy Lee Jones, Sela Ward and Jeroen Krabbe star in this 1993 thriller based on the 60's TV series. A doctor is on the run after he's falsely accused of murdering his wife. Richard Kimble (Ford) is a Chicago surgeon who has just found his wife, Helen (Ward) murdered. He gets questioned and arrested by police shortly after. He becomes convicted and sent to prison awaiting death penalty by lethal injection, but escapes after an accident on the prison transport bus. U.S. Marshal, Sam Gerard (Jones) and his team investigate the case and hunt Richard. Richard tries to prove his innocence and searches for the man responsible for Helen's death. Richard's friend and colleague, Dr. Charles Nichols (Krabbe) gets questioned by Gerard and his part in the case is soon revealed. This is a great film and Harrison and Tommy are good together. I recommend this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw THE FUGITIVE on cable. I really enjoyed it. It is a winning story, based on an old TV series. The characters were created by Roy Huggins. The story, written by David Twohy, and the screenplay written by Twohy and Jeb Stuart, created many highs and lows, and kept it suspenseful all the way through. It is about a doctor's wife that is murdered. The murderer gets away and the doctor is convicted of the crime. The doctor escapes from going to prison and tries to find the real killer, while a persistent U.S. marshal is on his tail.The direction by Andrew Davis was superb, mixing a human drama within a thriller with lots of action sequences.This movie worked very well as a movie. The story and the script seemed very crafty. I was rooting for the main character (Harrison Ford) all the way and also for the lieutenant (Tommy Lee Jones) and his team ( Joe Pantoliano, Daniel Roebuck) who were after him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Harrison Ford runs and Tommy Lee Jones chases after him in this big-budget film adaptation of the popular television series.This is a Hollywood action movie for the thinking man, where you can tell that at least as much thought went into characterizations as into the numerous technical stunts. One of the film's strongest ingredients is the chemistry between Ford and Jones, all the more remarkable since the two actors don't actually appear physically together on screen very often. Jones, especially, steals the show, and I remember sitting in the movie theater at the time of this movie's release thinking that he would at least be nominated for an Oscar (which he was, and which he won).So, good movie for its genre....but an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture?

		<fullReview>I hadn't seen this in quite a few years and watched it in HD Blu-Ray recently. Wow, I remembered it was good, but I forgot just how good. Andrew Davis, probably one of the most underrated and finest action directors, really delivers in The Fugitive. The script was unfinished when they started filming and they, Davis, David Twohy and Harrison Ford, added to and tweaked it as they went along, yet it appears to be a well planned and cohesive script. The film was nominated for 7 Oscars including Best Picture, winning one for Best Supporting Actor - Tommy Lee Jones, who was most deserving. Harrison Ford, Jeroen Krabbe and Jones were terrific as was the cinematography, directing, music score, stunts, special effects and editing. The film moves at a fast pace from the first frame, never letting up until the end. If you are bored with this film you need to seek help! Roy Huggins and David Janssen would be proud of this effort to bring their excellent TV series to the movie screen. I highly recommend it for viewing and repeat viewing.</fullReview>

Imagine my surprise when I saw a familiar face in the parade. His face has been on all the networks for the past week or so. My friend and I backed up the movie and watched the parade section over and over. In the parade sequence, we believe I spotted Mr. Roland Burris marching with a big green banner across his chest. I couldn't make out the writing on the banner, but it seemed like it was part of a group marching together. Roland Burris is the gentleman Illinois Governor Balgojevich appointed to replace Senator Obama. At the present time, the governor has been impeached. We don't know the fate of Roland Burris' appointment. If you watch for him, the scene is right after the close up of the drum corps. I am so sure that this is him. I would love for someone to verify this information. If he is a prominent citizen it is logical that he would be part of a Chicago parade.</fullReview>

He now must find the one-armed man who did it, while fleeing from U.S. Marshall Sam Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones, in his well-deserved Oscar-winning role). Every time I watch this I'm completely engaged in watching Kimble and Gerard solve this mystery. It proves to be the most interesting and fun movie I've ever seen. Jones gives the greatest film performance of all time, in my opinion. I don't know what else to say about it, since the film really has to be seen to understand why it is so great. By the way, it took several viewings before I could really say I loved this movie, and it took even more before I named it my personal favorite film.

		<fullReview>THE FUGITIVE and U.S. MARSHALLS are 2 of my favorite A list chase thrillers. These 2 movies introduced us to a "family" of United States Marshalls who work together to fight crime. The reason the films work so well for me is the intelligent story lines, the richly developed main characters, and the good support from the secondary characters.In THE FUGITIVE, Tommy Lee Jones indeed deserved the Oscar he got for his portrayal of Sam Gerard. He gave the character warmth, wit and hilarity. Simple moments like, "WHY HAVEN'T THEY TURNED THAT WATER OFF YET???!!!" are reasons why the Oscar was deserved.Harrison Ford also deserved an award for his desperate, driven portrait of vascular surgeon Richard Kimble, whose beloved wife (the classically beautiful Sela Ward) was brutally murdered. Convicted and imprisoned, Kimble gets a unique opportunity to escape, hunt down the person or persons who DID kill his wife, and bring him/them to justice.And he uncovers the most evil conspiracy of greed and corruption.With a great cast that includes Joe Pantoliano, Julianne Moore, and Jeroen Krabbe, THE FUGITIVE is one of the new classics, a smart, cerebral thriller and also a nonstop action adventure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hey, Tommy! I Love Those Little Sprinkles, Too!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the better action movies of the 1990s, Andrew Davis' The Fugitive retells the long-lived television series' story of a man, hunted by the police, trying to prove his innocence in the murder of his wife.The story itself has such a long life-span. I think the TV show was based on the Sam Shepard murder case. The Fugitive ran for four years and ABC had the class and daring to conclude the series at the end of August in 1967. It was a tremendous ratings hit, even with most of the country sweltering under a late August heat.Even though I was a little kid, I liked watching The Fugitive reruns on daytime TV--the concept of poor David Janssen one step in front of the heat, and meeting new and interesting people whom he didn't dare get too close to was appealing even to a 9 year old. I watched the finale, with Janssen grappling on a water tower or something, with the one-armed killer, an unnervingly ordinary-looking shlub.When I heard Harrison Ford was going to be in a remake of the story, I naturally was interested. Ford is a one-act wonder, but he is a sympathetic character and I wanted to see what Hollywood had to say about Dr. Richard Kimble's adventures a quarter century after the end of the series.What we got was a tightly-plotted, almost always believable adventure with Ford in . . . a minor role.It's really Tommy Lee Jones' hammy, eccentric, and startlingly cold-blooded performance as US Marshall Gerard-- Kimble: "I didn't kill my wife!" Gerard: "I DON'T CARE!" --that makes the movie work. And it saves Ford from being so bland and ordinary that the viewer would dismiss him early on. We know he didn't kill his wife. We need a foil, a not-really-a-villain who will keep hounding Ford's Kimble, keep scaring him and us with, well, Jones' face and his dogged determination.Jones is the sharp, bitter thread of chocolate in Ford's vanilla. And damned if it doesn't work.With the crispness of Davis' direction, the locked-in likability factor for Ford and Jones, some really great stunts (except for the ludicrous jump from a dam sluice way), and location shooting in Chicago and North Carolina (doubling up somehow for Illinois), The Fugitive is a taught, crafty chase film that only runs into trouble when the reason for the murder of Kimble's wife is revealed, a stale, chestnutty back-story.Kimble's wife is played by the lovely Sela Ward and we, unfortunately, only get to see her a few times where she isn't getting murdered or lying there, a bloody corpse. I suspect that, if there was more footage of her, it wound up in the editor's wastebasket.Well, enough bloviating. The Fugitive is a fine piece of genre work. It's scary and fun, but not silly.Silliness is a movie sin I have found less and less forgivable over the years.</fullReview>

The film is a big-screen reworking of the beloved TV series.Harrison Ford plays Dr. Richard Kimble, the man at run from the law in order to pursue the one-armed man who murdered his wife. Tommy Lee Jones is deputy Samuel Gerard, who will not stop until he find Kimble. The film really follows the events from the original series, all rolled into one thrilling movie. Lee Jones is one of the main highlights in the film, in his Oscar-winning performance as Gerard. Ford was great too, and really deserves an Oscar. Director Andrew Davis deserves the credit for his edgy and gritty direction."The Fugitive" is a great action film. One, wherein every minute is surrounded by suspense and non-stop action.

The pacing of this movie is excellent and is never boring or dull. There is not one scene where the viewers gets bored. Some of the most intense scenes in movie history are the bus crash scene and the jumping down the waterfall scene. I don't remember seeing this in the theater but if I did, it makes it that much better. AFI named the movie a top 100 Thrillers in movie history, I don't know where it landed exactly but it was a real gem. One of the best movies of 1993.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I wonder if Tommy Lee Jones ever cared? :D</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Fugitive is a fun action movie that keeps you going until the cool ending. We've got terrific actors, Harrison and Tommy who play cat and mouse very well. My only problem with the film was that I didn't know if they wanted this to be an action movie or a drama/suspense thriller. It had exciting explosions but then turned into a soap opera. Not to mention a miraculous survival off a dam. Well, I mean, whip or light sabor, I love Harrison, but geez, yes, it was cool, but someone had to look at the dam scene and wonder too if it was believable.I would recommend the Fugivtive because like I said, it's a fun great paced action/thriller with some minor flaws. But I'd say grab the popcorn and enjoy Tommy's best line ever "I don't care!" 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie, bad casting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Fugitive is a great movie; it's very well written. It's one of most gripping and exciting movies I have seen. The dialogue was nothing spectacular, but not notably bad, like many action movie recently. However, the major letdown was the casting. Don't get me wrong, Harrison Ford is a fine actor, but he is not completely versatile and I didn't feel this role was entirely suited for him. Tommy Lee Jones is worse, and I don't believe he's that good of an actor to begin with. And in some parts of this movie he seriously reminds me of Mugatu in Zoolander. There are some actors like Gary Oldman and Johnny Depp who can play practically anyone, unfortunately Tommy Lee Jones is not one of them. This would be a practically flawless movie if Johnny Depp and Gary Oldman played the leads. Hmm.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Fugitive was in my opinion the most successful example of Hollywood's ongoing efforts to strip-mine the culture of the past. So many of the old TV shows re-done these days on the big screen are backward and silly, precisely because they were never intended to be two-hour movies, just laugh-tracked escapist fare for a more innocent time. The Fugitive on the other hand, is a silly old TV premise, that works great in the form of a movie. So, having taken an old show with some real promise, the film makers then managed to surprise us all by really delivering where it counted. From the jarring, disjointed opening sequence, to the white-knuckle chase scenes, the Fugitive is never boring. And even better than that, they came up with the brilliant idea of making the crew of U.S. Marshals to be the most engaging, entertaining part of it all. The Fugitive was an effort where everything came together flawlessly. In trying to spin off a sequel with U.S. Marshals (1998), we see how without the great writing, the same bunch could headline a movie that sucks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too fantastic a thriller?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Fugitive is, indeed, a fast-paced action thriller and mystery drama which portrays the trials and tribulations, as well as determination, of Dr. Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford) in his attempt to elude authorities and prove himself not guilty of a crime he was convicted of, all while tracking down the real murderer. But in large part, the film must be viewed as a cartoon-like fantasy, with reality taking a back seat to the action. In his relentless attempts to escape the doggedly pursuing Detective Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones), Kimble encounters an incredible amount of unbelievably good luck in the number of golden opportunities that seem to materialize out of the blue to satisfy his needs of the moment, serendipitously providing him access to the means and paraphernalia by which he, conveniently, is able to repeatedly slip from Gerard's grasp and carry on his pursuit of the real murderer. Everything, from needed clothing just being available at the right time and place to be of use to Kimble, to a subway car stopping short in an emergency, but with its door just happening to be in position to allow access to the station platform, almost laughably discredit any link to reality the movie may lay claim to. The viewer, however, will not be bored.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best thrillers, the chase is suspenseful throughout</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The fugitive, in a nutshell is one of the greatest thrillers ever made. The pace never lets up, and the best touch is that the director uses brain action to drive the plot instead of violent action, which lets us identify with the characters. And what brilliantly constructed characters! First there's Dr. Richard Kimble(well played by Harrison ford), falsely accused of murdering his wife and on the run after a brutal bus wreck. We start to identify with him as well as root for him as he searches for his wife's killer. And then there's United States Marshall Sam Gerard(in Tommy Lee Jone's academy award winning role) who attempts to hunts Kimble down. The interesting thing about Gerard is that we begin to root for him too, seeing his tough,relentless character at work.There are moments in this film when Jone's is so unbelievable you heart skips a beat,yet Ford nor Jones take the spotlight. The lead is shared. In the few scenes they have together the interplay is near perfect. The murder and the conviction take place very quickly at the beginning allowing for the rest of the story to evolve over a longer time.This is well done, though it leaves us wondering why Kimble was sentenced to death on such circumstantial evidence. Hats off to the support cast! Joe pantoliano and Julianne Moore both turn in excellent performances. The one problem I have with this film is that the Dam scene is overrated. The previous scene in the tunnel was exceptional yet the stunt in question happened too fast and is undeserving of it's fame. The best scene in the film is when Kimble struggles to get through the electronic door at the prison as Gerard thunders after him. In say, James Bond films you hold your breath while the hero is in danger and let it go when he escapes. In this film you hold your breath for the full two hours until the final shot when you'll let it go. I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys films and if you haven't already seen it go to the video store and rent a copy of this definitive classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The thing about this movie that makes it so great, is that if you knew the T.V. series from the 1960's of the same name, you knew the outcome. Yet, they were able to make this movie very interesting. It doesn't hurt to have Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones, (Who was superb as Sam Gerard) star, but this movie is very well done. I only saw a couple episodes of the original "Fugitive" starring David Jansen, but I know from research that it was a extremely popular show in the 1960's. The same basic plot was used in the motion picture version, with a twist, that can be related to in today's society. That's what makes the picture credible. This movie may not match original T.V. series in popularity, however it does do it justice in terms of believability.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Slick, suspenseful update of the TV series and simply a well made entry in the innocent man on the run genre has Ford as the doctor framed for murdering his wife and Jones (in the role that made him a star again) as the federal marshal who doggedly pursues him, even though there's nothing personal in it for him.Jones reprised his character for the sequel, "US Marshals", which had Wesley Snipes as a marine in the Ford part.Harrison Ford delivers his usual strong performance as the wrongly convicted doctor who has to find "the one armed man" and stay one step ahead of the man chasing him. It's easy to see why Ford actually had a post-Star Wars career: he can be funny, he can be serious, he can be menacing in a heroic way, and he's simply very good at playing regular guys who aren't exactly larger than life but he makes you invest yourself in them.Tommy Lee Jones is memorable as the federal marshal chasing Ford, full of dry, dead pan humor that makes him menacing and yet not inhuman at the same time. He manages to be both an antagonist figure and a heroic one. That's hard to do."I didn't kill my wife!" - Harrison"I don't CARE!" - Tom</fullReview>

Top-notch adaptation of popular sixties' tv series with David Janssen, has Ford as wrongly accused murderer Dr. Richard Kimble on the lam to catch the one-armed man who brutally killed his wife. Jones (in his brilliant scene stealing Best Supporting Actor Oscar winning performance) is Federal Agent Gerard, the man obsessed with nabbing his man and only one step behind in his dogged pursuit. Excellently staged stunts and surprisingly affective acting from both men out for justice. Emphatically directed by Andrew Davis featuring a train collision, one of the best action sequences ever filmed.</fullReview>

I think that the best thing about the movie is the fact that the characters have depth to them. In only a couple of scenes, we see what a good and decent person Richard Kimble is and that makes us really care that he has been convicted and sentenced to death for a crime he didn't commit. It's just rare to find a movie that evokes genuine emotion like this one does. A lot of filmmakers seem to be under the impression that they can evoke emotion from people simply by having bad things happen to flat and one-dimensional characters that we know absolutely nothing about. So I'm going to do something that I very rarely do and give this movie a 10/10.</fullReview>

It's just one of those things that make it a great movie that you may not even notice.

To confirm that, check both The Fugitive and U.S. Marshalls together. You'll notice that the sequel has many "clone moments" derived from The Fugitive.

Tommy Lee Jones is superb in the brash and grimly amusing Gerard.The Fugitive is also something of a movie to learn some aspects of filmaking by, in the way the story is revealed. The courtroom session takes place between the two starts of opening credits, showing the swift and bewildering sentencing of Kimble. And there is the action : the train wreck is the best crash scene I have ever seen.I'd like to believe if Schindler's List wasn't up the same year that The Fugitive would have walked away with all the Oscars. This movie is smart, brilliantly directed and superbly acted. One of the best movies ever made and my absolute favorite.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Imagine a time, if you will, when fugitive movies were not released ten times a year, a time when Tommy Lee Jones actually appeared in fugitive movies simply because he liked the script and not because he was revisiting the role that made him famous again, a time when the fugitive movies were about much more than simply a homicidal maniac being chased by a man who has a connection to him. You will understand this film a lot more.It relies so much on characters and a witty script as compared to explosions and fight scenes. But of course that's not to say it doesn't have any pyrotechnics or chase scenes or battles - the action scenes will satisfy even the biggest of action buffs. It just makes a lot more sense when they're there for a purpose.Harrison Ford plays Dr. Ryan Kimble. Kimble comes home from work one night after an emergency procedure at the hospital to find his wife brutally beaten to death by a one-armed man. The one-armed man escapes from the scene of the crime and all evidence points to Ryan as the assaultant and killer.After sentenced to death, Ryan is pushed into the back of a convict bus transporting convicted fellons to jail. But one of the criminals tries to escape and the bus ends up swerving off the road and flipping down a steep ravine, coming to rest upon a railroad track. Ryan escapes before the train rips through the bus, resulting in a great scene where Ryan is running in front of the derailed train, chained at his feet and arms. It's the classic Indiana Jones bolder scene redux.Ryan eventually disappears into the woods and U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones) arrives at the scene of the crash a short time later. He is the ultimate seeker; he is barely ever wrong about anything, and when he is he doesn't like to admit it. Jones presents his character with such a sense of self-confidence and oozing calmness that his Oscar was well-deserved.Ryan keeps on running throughout the film, only stopping to gather evidence of his killer and then moving on. He goes through some interesting scenarios and starts to stumble upon a conspiracy, but no one will hear his story - the only living person who might care is the same man who says he doesn't care: Sam Gerard.If I am correct in my observations, Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones only appear in about two scenes together - the rest of the film they are apart from each other. As Jones pursues Ford, it seems as though he starts to make a connection with his prey - as though he may be the only one understanding what Ford is doing and why. It creates a sense of greater suspense for the audience. This is not a run-of-the-mill chase picture we are exploited to on so many occasions. We care for both characters in equal regards, and when they finally do come face-to-face it results in a kind of unexpected payoff; at last we get to see the two together in the same shot and it's strangeThe movie is directed by Andrew Davis, who directed "Collateral Damage" and "Holes." He has a solid sense of direction even if the material itself doesn't always hold together. Given a terrific script like "The Fugitive," Davis creates a type of cement cornerstone that is the base of the film. The script and direction compliment themselves often, something that can't be said in most cases.Tommy Lee Jones recently appeared in "The Hunted," a film about a madman killer on the loose, and Jones plays the man trying to pursue him. The stupidity of the script hit me hard. I rewatched "The Fugitive" not a week after I saw "The Hunted" and realized the sheer genius of it versus the lesser film. This is a movie that will wet the apetite of all action, mystery and thriller lovers alike who are looking for something different than the routine chase films. I know it did for me.4.5/5 stars -John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Perfect Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the greatest thrillers of all time, The Fugitive is a textbook example of a thriller that keeps its audience glued without insulting their intelligence. Dr. Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford), a Chicago surgeon, is wrongly convicted of killing his wife (Sela Ward), escapes from prison and heads back to his hometown in search of the real killer, a mysterious one-armed man that Kimble struggled with in his house after his wife's murder. U.S. Marshal Sam Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones, in his Oscar-winning role) and his deputies relentlessly pursue Kimble in and around Chicago, always staying a few steps behind. This movie works on so many levels, but it begins with the actors. Harrison Ford, is one of his best roles, perfectly portrays the dignity and righteous indignation that Kimble feels. He should have received an Oscar nomination for the sheer physical and emotional effort that he put into this character. Jones is a perfect choice for Gerard: He is relentless, shrewd and sarcastic in his quest to track down Kimble. He always projects a smarmy, superior quality that attracts the viewer, yet makes us want him to lose his prey. The terrific supporting cast includes Joe Pantoliano, Andreas Katsulas, Daniel Roebuck, and Jeroen Krabbe. Director Andrew Davis takes the audience along for the chase, and uses Chicago as his landscape, including a busy St. Patrick's Day Parade for one scene. These locations enhance the film by using the city as a maze through which this chase occurs. Another terrific feature is James Newton Howard's score, which manages to add color and tension to scenes, even when there is no dialogue. Perfect all around, from acting, directing, composing and screenplay, The Fugitive should remain a classic. Vote: 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another triumphant 90s thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Fugitive" is, for most of the movie, a simple enough story: all the evidence says Dr. Richard Kimble killed his wife, except there was no particular motive (why would a wealthy man kill his wife for money?) and everyone who knows him thinks he's one of the finest human beings around. To prove his innocence, he has to escape from prison and, despite being the subject of a massive manhunt by the tenacious but ultimately fair and just Deputy Gerard, single-handedly prove his innocence by tracking down his wife's real killer. Ultimately he just gets some medical records and makes some phone calls, which apparently he couldn't hire a private detective to do before the trial despite being rich, but hey, the beauty of the movie is you probably won't even notice or care.The movie is paced brilliantly, and if you read about the production of this movie, the director and key actors were given a great deal of freedom to write scenes on the fly, famously shooting the parade sequence with real parade participants who didn't even know they were going to be in a movie (neither did the director until the day of the shoot - they got permission to film the parade that very day). Then, after a great deal of footage was shot, thousands of edits were made, cutting entire subplots if that's what it took, and the end result was a fine-tuned movie with pacing that, for much of the movie, is almost irresistibly riveting.The movie is known for its iconic action scenes - there is of course a real train derailment captured on film and Harrison Ford jumps hundreds of feet off a dam. Many movies in the 90s has these, but what makes the Fugative work so well is that you can actually enjoy the non-action elements of the film too. Tommy Lee Jones and his crew are consistently funny and entertaining while still seeming believable as they track down Kimble. Kimble wows the audience with his brilliant moves at every step (although one wonders why he didn't think of any of this stuff *before* the trial... grumble grumble) and of course, the audience can't help be sympathetic to him as he has the compassion to save lives despite being one wrong move away from arrest and a death sentence for the entire movie.If the movie has one weak point, it has to be the way it wraps up the story, which involves an overly convoluted conspiracy that comes out of left field. It's not exactly bad, but after every single detail in the first two thirds of the movie was absolutely perfect, the unwieldy explanation of why Kimble was framed seems a bit disappointing. Perhaps any explanation would have had this problem, though, because it's trying to provide a logical explanation for what was basically a fantasy sequence of events, so whatever you come up with is going to be a let-down.Ultimately, this is a wonderful movie with two nit-picky flaws that shouldn't ruin the movie for anyone. It's one of the best thrillers of the 90s because it remembers that it's not all about the action scenes - it has pacing and it has characters you actually care about. It's a great package.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harrison Ford on the run</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very typical and predictable chase movie from the 90's. It is a very generic 90's movie that works but just doesn't really stand out all that much. I personally think the main reason a movie like this is not forgotten is because it has Harrison Ford in it. Like I said the formula works, but it lacks the suspense and tension to make it a great chase movie. So the plot is about a guy in the medical field that gets apprehended and accused of murdering his own wife. There was a chance for his escape so most of the screen time is over him running from the feds and using his wits to escape while trying to find answers. I guess with today's standards I was expecting something more. But again this was made in this 90's so I am going to cut it some slack. On a positive note the execution of the chase and action sequences is done well. It's a okay movie to pass the time with.6.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Roller-coaster ride that jams halfway</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first hour of "The Fugitive" is just fantastic. It's one of the most brilliant cat-and-mouse games I've ever seen, well-acted and extremely gripping. The reason it works is probably because there isn't that much of a story to deal with at that point, it's just one guy running and everyone else trying to catch him. The first act also gives us that one scene from "The Fugitive" literally everyone knows: the immortal dam scene. It just gets better every time I watch it, even the super-obvious dummy can't ruin it. Sadly the movie kinda sinks in after that, probably because from then on more and more people start to sympathize with Harrison Ford's character. When he was hated and chased down like an animal the movie was chock-full of tension, but in the second half they barely even seem to want to find him and it's tough to keep interest. There's a detective story woven in, but this storyline is just so pedestrian and breaks the claustrophobic mood. There is no real threat anymore, you don't fear for the main character's well-being, and this leads to a rather predictable finale that even the brilliant Jeroen Krabb couldn't save. I get why this movie is such a classic, because the greatness of some scenes is tough to deny, but as a whole it's not really that superb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is pretty entertaining, but it definitely has some major flaws that can't be overlooked. As Kimble, David Janssen was likable in the original series, but Ford here, though sympathetic, is unlikable (he shoves a man as he walks into the hotel at the end). And what kind of wimp is he that he can't beat a one-armed man in a fight (in the original series, Kimble just sees the man run from his house). If Kimble in this movie says he couldn't beat up a one-armed man who killed his wife, I would think he murdered her, too. Also, when Kimble leaves the hospital after shaving and changing clothes, why does he steal an ambulance truck? That would only draw attention to him and help the police catch him. It is clumsy screenplays like this, which force action to happen, that exists too often in Hollywood today. Though the movie does have some intensity and excitement, it is not a great masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superior thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Fugitive is not an action film; it is a top-notch thriller that moves at such a fast pace that it FEELS like an action film. The number of explosions, deaths and stunts is actually quite small, although the legendary train wreck still holds up as a remarkable action set piece. What creates the majority of the film's tension are the remarkable performances by Tommy Lee Jones and Harrison Ford; the one generating such an incandescent intensity he appears as an inescapable Nemesis, the other showing more in one look of his tortured eyes than a page of dialogue could convey. The script is almost air-tight. There are so few plot holes that when they do appear they seem out of place. The cinematopgraphy is as naturalistic as possible, creating a sense of realism that most thrillers eschew in favour of slick fantasy. The music, by the gifted composer Thomas Newman (American Beauty, Six Feet Under) is quite possibly the best action film score ever. The editing, particularly in the beginning, is beyond belief. All in all, a near perfect film.</fullReview>

He instantly knows he escaped from the tunnel through the storm drain with only check 10 feet of the long tunnel, pathetic. He always seems once step ahead. The scene in the hospital when he saves a boy, why would Julianne Moore be suspicious right out of the gate, she looks up as he's pushing the boy to see what he's doing. If she's trying to save people, why would she bother to look up. I just hated in this movie how everyone's first thought was always the right one.

		<fullReview>It has a good beginning and ending, but the middle of this flick drags on for too long with too many near misses between Jones and Ford. Jones isn't a good villain, because he isn't evil or intimidating, just annoying. I kept hoping Rybeck would show up from UNDER SIEGE to stick a knife in Jones' cranium again so I wouldn't have to listen to any more of his ranting and raving. Plus I don't like action films where the screenwriters go out of their way to make a more three dimensional, "realistic" action hero, but have him do things that make some of Bond or Rambo's heroics look plausible. Hey Ford, leave the waterfall jumps and train dodging to your Indiana Jones character.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lots of dull sleuthing here, in the vein of "Witness". The only way to bring life to this was to attach parts of movie predecessors. Most notably, we get "Silver Streak" (the train crash), "First Blood" (the leap off the sheer wall of the dam), &amp; "The 39 Steps" (the escape by mingling with the parade). The climax on the roof is from "Die Hard". Otherwise, the visual story is drearily colorless.Likewise, the story is completely gray. The writers should have taken notes from "No Way Out", or even "Presumed Innocent", which at least attempted to string us along that Ford could be the culprit.This could have been worthwhile if it had one element really of interest. The problem is, it's so basic and drab...simple enough for the unsophisticated Ford to handle, but that's it. Jones plays this as a joke, which is good enough for an Academy statue...but he's a one-trick actor as far as I'm concerned, and he played that trick out long before this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film update of old series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dr. Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford) and his wife, Helen (Sela Ward) seem to have it all, until she is murdered. The police believe that Richard killed her, and there is enough evidence to convict him, and a serious miscarriage of justice results in Richard being on a train on his way to prison. But, there is a train accident, Richard escapes, and he goes on a quest for his wife's true killer, while trying to keep one step ahead of the police, led by Marshal Sam Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones). The television series from the 1960's, where David Janssen had the role of Dr. Kimble, was an ongoing drama, where Dr. Kimble sought the one-armed killer of his wife while trying to figure out why she was killed, and while keeping ahead of the police and helping people along the way. My father was a fan of David Janssen and of the original series, and was not thrilled with this movie. He went into it with the idea: How can they condense an entire series into one movie? I did not watch the series as a small child, and I really liked this film, with a few reservations. By the way, the television series finale for "The Fugitive" was one of the most-watched episodes in television history. Why did I like this film? First of all, while the story is not that complex, it is a riveting tale that the film tells quite well. There are even hints that the police knew, all along, that Dr. Kimble might not be guilty. Secondly, there is a lot of action to blend in with the well-told story, and some excellent cinematography (for which Michael Chapman was deservedly nominated for an Academy Award) really enhances the suspense factor. The main reason that I liked this film, though, was the Oscar-winning performance of Tommy Lee Jones. He could have portrayed Marshal Sam Gerard in several ways, but chose the best way, giving us a Gerard who was intelligent, dogged in his pursuit of Kimble, honorable, and dedicated to doing his job to the best of his ability. Harrison Ford was the wrongly-accused Good Guy, but Tommy Lee Jones was not the Bad Guy. He was a Good Guy who just happened to be wrong. Tommy Lee Jones is a very intense actor, and that fit this role perfectly. Even as he (and Don Cheadle) rescued "Volcano" from an absurd premise, Jones manages to outshine Harrison Ford here. Ah, that brings me to my one reservation about this film: Harrison Ford. I want to quickly say that Mr. Ford did a good job in portraying Dr. Richard Kimble. But, that role in this movie had the potential to be an Academy-Award winning performance, but Harrison Ford did not give us that. What we saw was, instead, a well-executed portrayal of a well-known character, with no stamp of individualism on it. If you asked me to name Harrison Ford movies, I would likely forget this one, as it just as well could have been several other actors, (e.g., Tom Hanks, Mel Gibson). Whereas Tommy Lee Jones gave us an A+ performance, Harrison Ford probably earned a respectable but unspectacular A- or B+. That's not bad, but it could've been better. Well, now that I've finished my little rant, which will likely tick some people off, I will conclude by saying that this is a very good action-suspense film with good cinematography and a wonderful performance by Tommy Lee Jones, and it is a very enjoyable viewing experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did not know what to think when I saw this movie. I was pulled into the story dealing with Richard Kimball's desperate attempt to find his wife's killer and clear his name. "Wrongly accused" stories always are intriguing. This part of the film was good, you really are pulling for Harrison Ford here. HOWEVER, then you have the supporting cast and story. Here is where it all goes bad. The group of marshals led by Tommy Lee Jones have a script that consists of about three lines. The problem is that they dominate half of the screen time. The result is overacting at its worst. Overplaying skimpy lines and doing it so badly. Dominating camera time and not having anything to do or say. I was shocked at scenes that were included in this film. So much empty filler. There is one marshal with a ponytail, and he is about the worst actor I have ever seen. Am I the only person that saw this? I guess the casting idea was that he was realistic as a marshal, because a real marshal probably would not know how to act either? Is it his fault, or does he just not have a well written role? Not sure, but it is bad. Truth be told, this is a rather simplistic action story. However, by putting Ford and Jones in the leads, you get some credibility. I just wish that they had spent a little more time trying to develop a smarter script and some better acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite the great acting, cinematography and directorial pace, I could not otherwise get into this movie, because of the terrible premise. A rich doctor with a competent lawyer and well-placed specialist doctor friends, Richard Kimble is convicted of first-degree murder and is sentenced to death. After the train crash, Kimble only then begins searching for the man with the prosthetic arm. And what was Kimble and his lawyer doing before the trial ? Were they even contemplating and investigating and preparing a trial defense at all !!? Why does it take a trial conviction for Kimble to start his own investigating? Unbelievable.Generally, a poor criminal defendant will be the one who gets a death penalty. Kimble with well-connected, rich friends and active in high-profile charity work is not the kind of defendant who gets a death sentence. What's wrong with this picture ? An intelligent doctor friend makes the comment to the Tommy Lee Jones' character, "You will never find {Dr Kimble}. He's too smart." This is an astonishing statement for a smart doctor to make. Kimble is an experienced vascular surgeon, not an undercover James Bond comparable. It would be like the doctor friend saying, "You'll never catch Albert Einstein, he's too smart." Incredible.And if the doctor friend is so smart, he would not admit to felonious assistance of a convicted felon. And if he is so helpful and loyal to Kimble, where was he at the trial preparation and post-trial sentencing? Why does it take a death sentence for this doctor to become interested in helping Kimble? And why didn't he do his own investigation for the man with a prosthetic arm? He had access to the hospital records. Or was he just too busy ?First-degree murder involves a pre-meditated killing. Nothing in the movie indicates how Kimble performed pre-meditated acts or planned the killing. If it were planned, it surely did not look like it in the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I always like a good crime action thriller, and this is another fantastic one based on a TV series. Basically well respected surgeon Dr. Richard Kimble (Golden Globe nominated Harrison Ford) found his wife Helen (Sela Ward) ferociously murdered at home, and the police mistakenly found him and he was accused of murder. He was then tried, convicted and sentenced to death, however, he manages to escape when the prisoner transport bus crashes. Kimble is now on the run, both escaping the cops, led by Marshal Samuel Gerard (Oscar and Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Tommy Lee Jones), and trying to find the guilty man and prove his innocence. Also starring Julianne Moore as Dr. Anne Eastman, Joe Pantoliano as Deputy Marshal Cosmo Renfro, Andreas Katsulas as Frederick Sykes, The Living Daylights' Jeroen Krabb as Dr. Charles Nichols, Daniel Roebuck as Deputy Marshal Robert Biggs, L. Scott Caldwell as Deputy Marshal Poole, Tom Wood as Deputy Marshal Noah Newman, Ron Dean as Detective Kelly and Joseph F. Kosala as Detective Rosetti. The action and some stunt sequences are exhilarating, Jones deserved the Oscar, and this film has very witty pace. Jones returned in a sequel, U.S. Marshals in 1998, which obviously cannot come close to the great action and thrills of this. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Film Editing, Best Music for James Newton Howard, Best Sound and Best Picture, it won the BAFTA for Best Sound, and it was nominated for Best Editing and Best Special Effects, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Director for Andrew Davis. Harrison Ford was number 5 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and the film was number 33 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills. Very good!</fullReview>

First, the story of a respectable doctor-turned-wrongly accused fugitive is not convincing at all. The character portrayed by exceptionally gifted Harrison Ford manages to hide from police, forge ID papers and lead an alternative crime investigation of his own tracking down real murderer unbelievably easy. How and where could this upper-class, a pillar of a community surgeon have learned all these tricks? Did he take a course in surviving skills? Second, Tommy Lee Jones plays a hard-boiled gun-waving cop, nothing special, a stereotyped character seen so many times before. Some lines, some chases. And he got an Oscar for the Best Performance in Supporting Rol;e??..Oops?? The plot develops slowly, dragging to the happy end we are sure must be. And last but not least, the court room scene when the prosecutor uses the answering machine tape with the last words of the main character's wife as the key evidence to prove that the defendant is guilty is so soap operish. It just makes me laugh.</fullReview>
