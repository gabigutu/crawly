		<shortDescription>Clichéd, illogical, unscientific but the first hour really delivers even if the second hour is like the 1970's never happened</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After years of warning about global warning, Jack Hall is horrified to find all his predictions coming true much faster than he could have imagined. Hail stones the size of footballs decimate cities, typhoons destroy Los Angeles and New York becomes flooded. As the big freeze crosses the northern hemisphere, a small group of survivors try to fend off the cold as the world prepares for a dramatic change in the world order.This film may be a modern blockbuster but in almost everyway it is a 1970's disaster movie where an event happens after some build up and we then spend the rest of the film watching the survivors trying to, well, survive. In that regard the film carries all the usual problems that the genre carries but happily benefits from the fact that the effects are much better than 1970's movies could manage. For this reason the first hour is great ? it has dramatic pace, is involving and looks fantastic even if we have seen it before in different variations (how many times has New York been destroyed now?). However after the sheer global terror is pretty much finished we suddenly become much more small scale and the film looses much of it's impact and it's pace. After the initial danger has passed the film uses illogical and silly plot devices to put the survivors at risk ? a cold eye of a storm, blood infections, creeping ice and wolves are among the problems. While this is OK on a genre level it doesn't compare to the first hour and it gets a little dull and plodding at times.The clichés are all present and correct: the politicians, the upright scientists, the sacrifice, the daring rescues and so on. It's fair to say that if you are looking for more than a basic script then you will be looking in the wrong place here. All this film does is to provide spectacle and moments of dramatic action ? if you want to think about it then you will only hurt your enjoyment of the action. The film tries to deliver an environmental message but in a way this film will not help the environmental movement because it is too exaggerated to be taken seriously (like the idea of Celtic and Man Utd reaching the Champions League final ? during this season? Please!), however it does include several surprisingly barbed attacks on the US administration (could the VP look any more like Cheney?). Just a shame that the film message is delivered with all the subtlety that Segal showed when he did something similar in his environmental action film On Deadly Ground.The script doesn't really create characters either and it means we don't care that much about what happens to them in the final hour (countless millions are dead for goodness sake!). The dialogue in the first hour is nicely gruff and scientific and very genre but the second hour is more human and the lines aren't suited for that ? not even in the hands of an impressive number of good actors. I like Quaid and he is a good lead here, he gets the good scientific stuff and only is lumbered with the rather silly notion of walking to New York from Washington. Gyllenhaal must have upset legions of cult fan boys by appearing in a big budget movie but he does OK with the role (despite looking too old to be in school). The rest of the cast are fairly mixed but, as with the genre, they are just filled even if some are good. Welsh is good even if he was cast for his similarity to Dick Cheney, Holm adds a small bit of dignity in his role as well as being supported by the very fine actor Lester in a minor role. Faces like Sanders, Mihok and a few others don't really matter as they are merely victims waiting for their turn to be used for dramatic effect.Overall the first hour of this film is good on a blockbuster level, but it blows it's wad too early (don't ya hate it when that happens?!) and is left with a second hour that is right out of the 1970's with all the weaknesses that that entails. Generally I enjoyed the film because I was just expecting a big noisy movie to pass a few hours ? bad script, no characters and lots of clichés? Why would I be surprised by that? It's par for the course and you should not watch this if you know these aspects will annoy you. As it is, it's an average film but one that is noisy and spectacular enough to pass muster in the summer blockbuster stakes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gorgeous movie to watch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Look people, what it comes down to is this: you don't go to an "end of the world" movie for the plot. You go for the special effects. And I can honestly say these are some of the best special effects I've ever seen in my life.I work a lot with computer graphics, and can distinguish them (AND miniatures) by sight. This movie blends them seamlessly. The only other movie I've seen that does that is Lord of the Rings. If you want to see a movie that makes you believe that what's happening is real, watch this. If all you care about is plot, there are better choices.I give this movie a 9 based on exactly what I expected of it. Mindboggling visuals.Hope you've got a big-screen and surround sound. You're gonna need it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this film by director Roland Emmerich a great deal. It is a fast-paced, exciting, suspenseful film filled with wonderful images, great CGI effects, plausible acting, and even a coherent script. How realistic is it? I hope not at all, but the director made the film so that it seems very real and like something that MIGHT happen. The story revolves around some major climatic shifts that cause the entire Northern hemisphere to become Artic tundra. New York City is devastated as are other major cities all over Europe. Dennis Quaid gives a good performance as a climatologist that predicted some of these events. We see things through his perspective and that of his son for much of the movie. The acting in general is good in this film. I particularly liked Ian Holm's role as the British meteorologist stuck in the middle of nowhere while these changes advanced. Much of the credit for the film's success must go to Emmerich. This is easily one of his best films. He keeps his viewer on the edge of his/her seat through the entire film. Action is the film's primary objective, but Emmerich also uses a lot of humanity in what his character's motivations are, and I for one, enjoyed seeing that side of humanity rather than what I probably would see under similar circumstances. As a previous viewer noted, this is a great popcorn movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's the end of the world as we know it, and I feel okay.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Day After Tomorrow" is a disaster movie, but it isn't a disastrous one. But if Roland Emmerich really thought he was making a movie with a message, he didn't quite succeed - to be honest, Emmerich is to serious film-making as Naomi Wolf is to recommending "Voluptuous" magazine. The fact that the movie begins with the Twentieth Century Fox logo under stormy skies doesn't make it any more significant.Well-intentioned it may be, but the movie's plot takes second place to the imagery - the opening credits over an icy landscape, the massive weather systems over the planet, colossal hailstones pelting down on Tokyo, snowstorms over India, tidal waves - and the numerous effects houses make it an eye candy feast, especially for people with a grudge against the Big Apple (kudos to Industrial Light and Magic, Digital Domain and all the less renowned FX companies involved). So on that level, it works; the music by Harald Kloser and Thomas Wanker is also a bonus, being more restrained and serious in its support than is usually the way with Emmerich movies.And then there's the script - it has a whole load of characters but doesn't do much with any of them. Example: Climatologist Dennis Quaid's relationship with son Jake Gyllenhaal doesn't seem to be as estranged as it's intended to be, and similarly the friendship Quaid has with a longtime colleague gets about as much emphasis as the crush his younger colleague has on fellow scientist Tamlyn Tomita (and the movie pays for it later on in a sequence shamelessly ripped off from "Vertical Limit," which has little of the emotional resonance it should). In fact, all the human elements - Gyllenhaal's repressed feelings for classmate Emmy Rossum, his doctor mother Sela Ward's problems with a young patient, etc - all of them are underdeveloped or just plain undeveloped, and some moments practically scream "Contrived Climax Ahoy!" Those moments are there because "The Day After Tomorrow" doesn't have an enemy as a natural outgrowth of its story; the elements aren't really villainous as they have no concept of right or wrong, and the closest thing to a villain here is the current administration in the White House, so Emmerich and co-writer Jeffrey Nachmanoff have to impose a tangible enemy (why else are those wolves there?) on the proceedings. This does help things from getting totally boring in the second half, though it's still pretty watchable even then - but if some more thought had been put into the screenplay, like exploring the characters or developing the promising ideas therein (like Americans fleeing to Mexico, or further looks at the Government side), it would have carried more weight and made the movie into more than an improvement on "Godzilla." As it is, it's a competently done if implausible attention-holder that wants to be more; that it actually had the potential to be more makes it a bit of a disappointment, but at least it's a watchable one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst movies of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The folks who actually like this movie are the reason Hollywood makes very few quality movies any more. If you don't care then why should they? This movie is so bad from the beginning. Numerous tornadoes pummeling a West Coast city and there are actually people flying in helicopters to get a closer look. That's a brainy idea. Buildings freezing and crumbling yet the people outside don't seem to be affected so much. The "walk" from Philadelphia to New York? And in record time no less. I do like the fact that they had the foresight to have Antarctic weather gear handy for just these occasions. What of the tent that was able to withstand the chill but not the Empire State building? Call your local Army Navy store....they really need to stock these tents. I also found it amazing that any lines of communications were not really affected, including the under freezing water pay phone. The only ones who had communications losses were, of course, the main characters.....ah drama!! I know they were in a library but you think they could have possibly tried to burn all the wooden tables and chairs around them? Seems that they would burn warmer and for longer than books. The acting was horrific, the directing was terrible, the script was unbelievably bad and the special effects were anything but special. It certainly rates up there with Godzilla 2000 and Armageddon......it actually makes Independence Day look like one of the all time greats!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I could write a better story by "The Day After Tomorrow"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is TYPICAL Hollywood. And by that I mean it's all glitz and glamour without any substance. Don't get me wrong? the special effects are great (although weather effects are easy to pull off at this point). But the movie has no point what so ever!!! Whatever little plot there is, is terrible. *Spoilers* OK, basically it goes like this? Big storm comes, and spreads around the world in a matter of days threatening humanity with the 2nd ice age. Storms destroy all the big cities, blah blah blah? Since the movie follows Sam Hall (Jake Gyllenhaal) most of it is set in New York. So NY gets hit with tidal waves, and then it all freezes over and then you have everyone stuck in the NY public library. Not bad so far? but that's it. Jack Hall, Sam's father is some kind of weather expert specializing in Alaska and global warming so he predicts this whole storm. So when he finds out that his son is trapped in NY he WALKS (drives to Philadelphia and then walks the rest of the way) from Washington D.C. to NY in like two days (All during this 2nd ICE AGE!!!!). No trying to stop the storm or anything? he just WALKS. He's not even trying to save his son because he can't? he just walks hundreds of miles to meet his son. That's it. Oh yeah, and during the middle of the movie the kids trapped in the library in NY must venture out in the 'STORM' for medicine? and as luck would have it (or Hollywood overkill) they're attacked by a pack of wolves that escaped from the zoo. And the wolves look TERRIBLE. The special effects for the weather are easy so that all looks great? but these wolves looked horrible. Like these kids were being attacked by cartoon rejects from 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit?'They just made this movie cause they could make the effects... there was no thought put into anything else other than the effects. I've seen porno's with better story lines.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely Pathetic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>--WARNING: Spoilers below-- Terrible writing, terrible acting, terrible plot. One of the worst films I've ever seen. How convenient that right after Jack Hall discovers the plate breaking away in Antarctica and right as he presents this to the "Global Warming Conference," all his predictions begin to come true! Wow, what a coincidence. What an insult to my intelligence. At least have all that take place &gt;75 years prior.  From there the movie gets even more ridiculous, with nothing but plot devices tossed in an attempt to pull emotions of it's viewers. For example, Dr. Lucy Hall decides to stay behind with a dying boy because he can only be removed via ambulance. How touching - he's going to die anyway, lady, and he has absolutely nothing to do with the film. But wait, her morals are rewarded as someone manages to get an ambulance to them despite 13 feet of snow! In a scene involving the President we see the Seal of the President of the United States displayed prominently behind him in a random room -- so the target audience would know who he was just in case the plot got too deep for them.Then another plot device is delivered as a Russian ship ends up right in front of the library where Sam and his cohorts are hiding out. Usually with a plot device you at least try to disguise the fact that it is nothing more than a plot device. Nope, not in this movie! So someone has an infection and we need medicine. Well what do you know - "THERE HAS TO BE MEDICINE IN THAT SHIP!" clearly. And what do you know, the bottle they need is the only one designated in English. These guys are very lucky. But wait, some wolves that escaped a holding cell earlier happen to find the ship many miles away just as the kids are attempting to retrieve the medicine!! I didn't realize this was a comedy!I could go on with these examples for hours...don't even get me started on the homeless man and his faithful dog. But I think you get the idea. Do not go see this even for the special effects - you've already seen them in Armageddon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ridiculous Story, But Fun To Watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was leery of a heavy propaganda piece on "global warming," but I still saw this and found that, yeah that's what it was but it was really more of just a straight adventure story than anything else.....and not a bad one, at that. The first 50 minutes of this two-hour film have the "fun parts" where the special-effects dominate. We see all kinds of radical weather disasters that are extremely dramatic and entertaining to watch, even if they don't make a bit of sense.After the blizzard and sub-zero, unlivable weather conditions arrive the movie settles down to a young romance and survival story with Jake Gyllenhaal, Emily Rossum and other people trapped in a library in New York City and Jake's father, played by Dennis Quaid, walking all the way from Philadelphia to rescue him. Yes, it's very, very far-fetched - the whole thing - but it's a fun adventure story with nice people. It's especially refreshing to see Hollywood portray a father as being so loving and selfless. The romance wasn't overdone and the young people were not profane and/or annoying, as so often is the case.Except for the over-exaggerated and extremely erroneous scare tactics of this movie, and a ridiculous portrayal of the Vice Preseint of the United States, the movie works strictly as an entertaining fantasy-adventure story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Completely predictable, sadly lacking, and fatally flawed.. (some SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well for me this film wasn't one I was looking forward to, initially when I saw the adverts I thought I wanted to see it, but after reading some blurb about it I was concerned that it was going to turn into the usual Hollywood 'adventure' drivel...Sadly my thoughts came true.I thought the movie started well, all the science seemed to be dealt with in a good and sensible fashion, and you do feel a sense of impending doom. The early disaster effects are typically top notch, although I felt a huge chunk of ice falling on someone's head would have made them bleed! And strangely for a Hollywood movie they didn't depict their administration as being infallible, which made me think maybe I was wrong to prejudge the film.Sadly, things then deteriorate into the typical Hollywood fare. The hero does everything you'd expect, in the way you'd expect. The good old stiff upper lipped Brits perform their background tasks and do the usual (i.e. Die in a research bunker that turns out to have less stocks of the essentials than a New York library (where can I buy a vending machine that provides sustenance for 6 or 7 people and a dog for a week or more?)). When the 'hero' becomes all heroic the major mistakes become evident. We've all touched something ice cold and had our skin stick to it, so surely someone holding onto to frozen metal with blood oozing out of their hands would suffer a similar fate (especially considering how cold it's alleged to be!). They also seem quick to remove their facial protection, without a care in the World.The other thing that makes you go uhmmm is that the temperature at one point is supposedly dropping at a rate of -10 degrees every SECOND, yet it clearly takes the hero, and his son and friends for that matter, well over 10 seconds to get to safety. This despite earlier in the film someone in similar circumstances freezing on the spot in less than 3 seconds! (oh and it was also cold enough to freeze aviation fuel, but obviously American film stars have more in their veins than everyone else!? )The temperature drops so fast that all the windows shatter, uhmm except of course on the building where the stars are! (either that or their room would have literally been snowed under, like the rest of New York!). Added to the fact that their chimney seems to work despite being blocked by snow and ice, surely if they hadn't frozen to death due to having no windows, they'd have choked to death on the smoke flooding their room since it had nowhere to escape to (this can be seen near the end because the hero can't even tell that he's reached his destination, and you certainly can't see any smoke coming from where the chimney should be!).Oh and to cap it all, once the hero finds his son (bet you never thought he'd do it..YAWN!) the sun miraculously appears, as do hundreds of survivors! (can anyone tell me how they'd survived in skyscrapers that had no windows, and had been ravaged by tsunamis earlier int he film!??!)All in all I found myself wishing that it had been an English film, for then some reality may have been preserved.Sadly this film completely loses the plot half way through and all credibility goes out of the window.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, this wasn't as mind-numbing as "Alexander", and I did see it only on cable...but the whole time I was watching it I felt uncomfortable, as if I was looking at a really bad multiple-vehicle collision with lots of injuries. You know you shouldn't, but some morbid part of you won't let you turn away...As for the plot...Global Warming can lead to another Ice Age. This is bad enough, like saying that setting fire to your house will help to keep your beer cold, but in this movie the Ice Age takes only fifteen or twenty minutes to get started. You no sooner set a match to the gasoline-soaked drapes than the entire house is encased in ice. Oh yes, and you are being hunted by wolves who escaped from the city zoo. These are the only animals that escaped from the zoo, and as the snow got deeper and the temperatures lower, they didn't have the sense to head South while they could.I really doubt that there could be such a thing as the snow super-hurricanes as depicted in the movie, but these were the chosen special-effects-ex-machina to jump start the glaciers. A hurricane is a heat engine, driven by the accumulated warmth of the sun on tropical waters. What drives a super-snowcane? The answer to that one is easy: A bad writer's overheated imagination. We get not one, but three of these things, all appearing overnight and sweeping down from the North Pole simultaneously. The one that hits New York also generates a storm surge.A real hurricane's storm surge is a dome of water under the eye of the storm. It's there because the air pressure in the eye is much lower than anywhere else. A storm surge might go eight to ten feet for a big hurricane. The super-snowcane generates a surge high enough to slap the face of the Statue of Liberty and submerge Manhattan. It comes in from the east (The supercane winds would be pushing all the water the other way) and arrives several minutes...sorry, hours...or maybe days...before the eye of the storm does. The pacing in this movie is astonishing whenever it isn't simply unbelievable. I think the passage of time was sped up in order to cram as many really cool, nay, chillin', special effects into two hours as possible.The storm surge then does not leave. No, it stays in Manhattan, enjoying Times Square, the Guggenheim and all the other cultural attractions for a while. Gravity cannot pull it away, or perhaps the ecology is so unsettled that water can no longer flow downhill. A Russian supertanker joins in as another sightseer and then it all freezes solid. Sea water can apparently freeze in minutes.The New York supercane is monitored from space. The other two, ravaging Europe and Siberia, are apparently less interesting. At one point, we are told that the temperatures at the eye of the supercane are dropping by ten degrees per second. Now, it doesn't matter if the degrees are Fahrenheit or Centigrade. In less than a minute, this storm will be freezing the air itself solid, but this doesn't happen. Apparently the CGI budget could only go so far.This unprecedented disaster forces the evacuation of the entire US. No mention is made of what happened to the Canadians. In fact, I don't think any mention at all is made of the Canadians. Maybe to them it was just a chilly Spring, eh? Mexico, on the other hand, is mentioned a couple of times, since all 300 million Americans seem to be trying to get there. Just how they get there is as unmentioned as the Canadians, since early on we are told that neither planes nor trains can operate in the weather. Could SUVs?At the end of the movie, we are treated to a sermon about how We Should Respect Nature More, and Not Exploit Our Precious Resources. There's also a humble obesiance to all the Third World countries who so charitably took us all in. Got that? The US has been destroyed by its own arrogance, and maybe now we'll appreciate subsistence farming and outdoor plumbing a lot more. The special effects were impressive, but they followed each other so quickly and bewilderingly that it was a lot like being punched repeatedly in the head by Mike Tyson. Some of the special effects shots were views from a space station. At the end of the movie, we see that this was an Ice Age to top all Ice Ages. The snow and glaciers reach all the way down to the Rio Grande. They stop there, though. Apparently Mexico wouldn't let them in. But...During the last Ice Age, which only reached as far South as Chicago, the sea level was a couple of hundred feet lower than it is today. In spite of glaciers now occupying Phoenix, San Diego and Orlando, in THIS movie, the sea level hasn't changed at all and the coastlines are exactly the same as they were the day before yesterday.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie takes a look at what the world would look like if the greenhouse effect and global warming continued at such levels that they resulted in worldwide catastrophe and disaster, including multiple hurricanes, tornadoes, tidal waves, floods and the beginning of the next Ice Age. At the center of the story is a paleoclimatologist Professor Jack Hall (Quaid), who tries to save the world from the effects of global warming while also trying to get to his son, Sam (Gyllenhaal), who was in New York City as part of a scholastic competition, when the city was overwhelmed by the chilling beginnings of the new Ice Age. In addition to all of the other challenges Dr. Hall faces, he's also going against the flow as humanity races south to warmer climes, and he's nearly the only one going north.The special effects are excellent, and keep you entertained. While the script is below average and the acting is just OK. Overall its enjoyable but there just isn't much here except good effects.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The day after tomorrow... I still will be angry to have wasted 2 hours of my life. Plot holes as big as the holes in the ozone layer, bad performances all around that send cold shivers down your spine (in a bad way) and an embarrassing attempt to manipulate emotions by creating forced drama. Roland Emmerich showed us once more that he is not capable of making a good film, although the original idea of this movie is interesting.Emmy "I'll warm you with my body" Rossum offers two facial expressions: being cute and looking confused, both not very convincing. Jake Gyllenhaal is up there (or should I say down there?) with Miss Rossum,followed by a stiff Dennis Quaid, who tries to walk from Philadelphia to New York in record-breaking time just to fulfill the Happy End a la Hollywood.There is so much nonsense in this picture I don't know where to start. It tries to be smart but it fails miserably. There were a bunch of hungry CGI wolves that looked so artificial that I nearly wet my pants (laughter not excitement). The only interesting thing in this crap-o-rama is to witness the destruction of NYC, but that's it. Toss everything else into the garbage. If you are a Homer Simpson-type you might enjoy this movie, otherwise I advise you to avoid this disappointment and read a good book on Global Warming instead.I'll give one star for the New-York-Destruction-Sequence. I also would have liked to see some Wallstreet-broker horribly drowned by the flood but I think that's too much to ask for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scientifically, global warming/climate change should, by now, be unquestioned by most folk. However, this film will do little to help the environmental cause because of its hysterical stand. Scientifically, this film has the time frame all totally wrong. Melting ice caps, both north and south could not happen in such a short space of time as suggested in the film (DAYS?). And if this premise is wrong, then all that follows based on that, will be wrong as well. The three northern hemisphere storms shown on the computer monitors are rotating anticlockwise, i.e LOW pressure (as in hurricanes, with hot air rising UP) so it is impossible to be sucking cold air DOWN from the stratosphere. High pressure systems in the northern hemisphere rotate clockwise. How do land-line telephones operate under water? Why burn paper books, when there is so much more heat-efficient wooden furniture? The Statue of Liberty must have a pretty strong base to with=stand such a 50 meter surge wave. The list of further improbabilities could be rather long. And the acting/script is predictable/pedestrian.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Good; The special effects duh. Min blowing and bigger than Elvis. Whole lot of fun and if it wasn't for them this movie would be crap(er). Characters have a whole lot of potential if you completely ignore Dennis Quaid and there are some humorous moments in there. It's visually engaging and not too taxing on the ole noggin. I enjoyed the ending especially the fact that the so called first world now rely on the third world. So petty much an entertaining film HOWEVER.......The Bad; Great plot, story lines, sh*t* script. I mean REALLY! With some of the lines in that film I would sit there and just *cringe*. I understand that Emmerich or whoever worked on the script had less money to spend on writers and obviously more to spend on CGI but Oh.My.God! There also seems to be an obsession with the word 'cataclysmic'in this film again blame humiliating script. I mean why not try OTHER WORDS but I suppose the usage of the word cataclysmic over and over again was to attempt to make the plot 'seem' smarter. Somehow they failed that. But wait there's more crap...the science! Or lack thereof! What the hell are they talking about?! Some serious research should have been done into this and then maybe we wouldn't all be dying in the cinema aisles of shame.Plus the characters aren't given enough of a chance to develop and you get the feeling that Sam Hall doesn't really care for his mother and there is no explanation for why Jack Hall's character doesn't freeze to death. Does he only live through his magical powers as a lacklustre climatologist?The Ugly; I guess the wolves?.....oh no Dennis Quaid's facial expressions. He has all of three expressions; annoyed, really annoyed and constipated. All in all it's good to watch if you ignore the stale script and even staler acting. Some characters are interesting but of course since the world of Roland Emmerich revolves around the Hall family we don't find out much about the other folk in the film like the billions that died instead there is more attention paid again to the Hall family and extra girl played by Rossum. God forbid Emmy Rossum should get septicaemia and almost die screw those others out there (literally) freezing to death and let's just focus on her and her weird American accent. *Sigh* Despite this there ARE some memorable moments and it has truly excellent CGI. I would still recommend watching it because, despite it's many failings it *is* an entertaining movie. I gave it a rating of 8 purely because of Jake Gyllenhaal and the CGI. There I've said it. Watch it with suspended disbelief or when drunk. That way you can ignore certain Rhode Island wide plot holes. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great FX but big flaws insulting the intelligence!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The music during the opening credits is beautiful and the movie is full of great CGI, but sadly that is all you can enjoy. Unfortunately, there are so many flaws in the film from start to end that make it very implausible.1) Three scientists appeared working in Antarctica and they had an accident with an ice crack. One of them is stupid enough to jump 2 times crossing the crack just to get some stuff. It is impossible to walk on ice without hooks on your feet, and even more impossible to jump!2) Dennis Quaid, the main character, predicts a kind of ice age during a global warming conference. It is too much coincidence that this "cooling" happens one day after.3) The weather changes are all over the north, but all you can see about north is some places in US and a storm in Tokyo, nothing else. What about the rest of Asia, Europe and Canada!4) Dennis Quaid and his son (Jake Gyllenhaal) have an estranged relationship but this is not plausible. There is no character development. Jake Gyllenhaal is in love with his mate Emmy Rossum, but there is not one bit of emotion in their eyes, nothing.5) During tornadoes in L.A., and during all the movie, people prefer to stare at the sky than to run and hide. There is a chopper flying over there! Helicopters cannot fly in those conditions!6) In this movie the vice president is more powerful than the president himself! The president almost does not exist.7) The young guys go to stay in a penthouse. Suddenly one of them wants to go and pick up his brother. ALL of them leave the penthouse. Why all of them? Then when the girl says "Maybe we should just stay here" Jake Gyllenhall answers "No. We need to get home"... HOME? I thought they were going to pick up the guy's brother!8) There is a kind of zoo scene. What kind of zoo is that where wolves can destroy the cages and escape?9) The cop needs a translator to save people who are trapped inside a car? No kidding!10) Laura was getting a bag for the French woman and the tsunami was going to beat. How brave was Jake Gyllenhall for running and telling Laura "Hurry up!". He saved her life! Give me a break.11) Cell phones do not work but the pay phones underwater do?12) Jake Gyllenhall and the girl went to use the pay phone. He stays under water several seconds. The girl just waits for him to come back. If you were there you would probably dive and go for him!13) The girl finds a big wardrobe with many dry clothes. How can she find that place so quickly and in a library???14) In the library most people decide to go out and walk. The policeman encourages everybody to go out. It is OBVIOUS everybody will get frozen outside and where do they go walking?15) The people who stay in the library go to a fireplace to burn books and get warm... This is crazy! OK... Paper is combustible, but not a good one! Paper only works to start the fire but not to keep it! In a library there are many chairs, tables and bookshelves, lots of furniture made in wood, and still they prefer to burn books! These guys are supposed to be intelligent.16) This enormous library has just a lounge room for employees but not cafeteria? Can you believe that? They only have a couple of vending machines. They have a Gutenberg bible but not a cafeteria?17) More about intelligent nerds! The girl cut a leg very bad and she does not pay attention to that. She knows how to take care of her mate's body temperature but she just forgets her own hurt leg?18) They burn books to stay warm in the library. What about the smoke and oxygen? They stay in a place with all windows closed! How can they breath there? Writers forgot that fire consumes oxygen too? The chimney is blocked with tons of snow. Where does the smoke go?19) Dennis Quaid WALKS from Philadelphia to Manhattan in record time, in the middle of a snowstorm with two co-workers. There is a risk scene about a rope, that is clearly taken from another movie: Vertical Limit. But here the scene is very unrealistic. They are walking on a glass roof, the sled crashed the glass and the 3 people start falling, then Dennis Quaid sticks a pick in the snow and stops the fall, but the pick does not crash the glass!20) When the guys discovered the girl has a cut and she is in shock, they diagnosed her health status and everything reading a book! Anyone can be a doctor!21) Why do these guys are so sure that there are medicines in the ship? And how do they find them so quickly?22) At the end Dennis Quaid character finally made it. But if you think for a while... what was the point of this? Just to keep his promise?23) Finally, it seems the storm has gone, but what about all the massive floods you are supposed to expect once the sun melt all those tons of snow?All in all, it was entertaining but writers DO have to learn a little more before writing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The plot is almost the same as Independence Day and Armagedon (two other pretty bad movies), the dialogue is awful, there are wholes in the plot everywhere (when did a fast food restaurant protect people from a super-freeze?), the characters are miscast (Jake G. was a high schooler maybe ten years ago), and the actors all reach new lows (poor Dennis Quaid). Some parts make no sense (like when Dennis Quaid walks 40 miles through a blizzard in less than a day). On top of all these problems the movie seems like nothing more than a slap in the face of the Bush administration for not dealing with global warming. There is even a Cheney-look-alike vice-president. I would rather light my hair on fire or be pricked in the eyeball with a poison needle than sit through this thing again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some impressive special effects and not much else</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoiler If you've seen the trailer, you've already seen the best this film has to offer.Los Angeles being ravaged by multiple tornadoes and New York being literally drowned by the Atlantic Ocean...but you already knew that.As for the rest of the film...Well, once the world is laid to waste by the forces of nature or "acts of God" as insurance people like to call them, Jake Gyllenhaal and his mates basically sit around in a library burning books to keep warm and exchange some of the most cheesily-written and downright embarrassing dialogue that i have heard since seeing Gigli, which just like this film was an error born out of curiosity to see "what all the fuss was about".Dennis Quaid also waltzes his way through this turgid tripe trying to pull the most serious face and decides, after telling everyone "NOT TO GO OUTSIDE OR YOU WILL ALL FREEZE TO DEATH", to go outside into the snow and ice covered world to walk to New York to find his son.Predictably, two of the companions who heroically decide to travel with Dennis Quaid, die predictably dull and meaningless deaths but the weird thing is that their deaths don't make any difference to this film or Dennis Quaid's character either.They both die and Dennis Quaid forgets about them and continues to walk to New York, despite the fact that we know that his character has worked closely with these two men for a number of years and for such tragic losses they should be to him - he seems to take their rather tragic deaths extremely well, in that they die and Dennis Quaid doesn't really seem to be heartbroken by the events at all.Basically those two deaths are desperate plot fillers for a story that already ran out of any heat and steam right after New York has been flushed out by a huge tsunami.Another desperately sad plot filler is when a ship comes floating spookily past the library Gyllenhaal and his mates and they decide to raid the boat for food, for some reason some wolves that escaped from a nearby zoo have managed to escape being drowned and turned into fishfood in order to chase them through the ships many narrow corridors for a minute before going back into the library to wait for Daddy Quaid to save him.And its a bit obvious what happens at the end of the film, lots of people survive and everyone smiles cos despite the fact that half our planet has been turned into a series of Haagen Dazs metropolises, the underlying message is that in the face of such tragedy - we all find hope in our hearts and minds to keep perpetuating life, despite the fact that i thought the movie was designed to tell us to start thinking carefully about what we are doing to our own planet.The worst thing about this entire film, apart from the script, dialogue and acting, was the fictionalised parts of the story - "global cooling" where everything is frozen within one second????.So in a cheap desperate bid to rush the story forward and save on special effects costs, we are to led to assume that when this global cooling nonsense happens, it turns millions of people from the length and breadth of Canada to Europe and also the Middle East and most of Asia into human popsicles within a matter of seconds despite the fact that the many denizens of Washington and New York don't seem to be affected at all by global cooling and go out walking in the snow as if they're dreaming of a white Christmas.There was so much Roland Emmerich could've done with this film and such great potential has been wasted on an extremely flimsy and weak script, there is little or no character development and you don't really care for any of the characters at all and after Emmerich has had fun destroying the world yet again, the story literally grinds to a halt and limps painfully toward the finish line.If you need to know anything about this film, just watch the trailer and save both your money and a couple of hours of your life by not watching this entire film.The only spectacles to behold are two disaster sequences and nothing more.Its the end of the world as we know it, and i'm feeling sleepyEasily the worst film of the year so far.....2 out of 10 for the two special effects sequences alone</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What an annoying movie! The Day After Tomorrow is filled with every disaster movie cliché in the book. Why does there have to be a child with cancer who is too ill to move as the impending doom threatens? Why is it necessary to have people fall in love during the middle of a crisis? Why should we care about characters that are only on screen for a few minutes before they die? Why does the homeless guy know more about what's going on than most anyone else? Why did the parents in the movie have to be estranged, only to resolve their differences as the disaster strikes? Why does the Dick Cheney look-alike Vice-President, the most prominent government official, have to be such a narrow minded character? If you've seen on disaster movie, you've no doubt run into a few of these examples of the lack of originality found in The Day After Tomorrow. Most every event and character reaction to those events can be predicted with incredible accuracy.On top of the clichés, plot points are handled in such heavy-handed fashion. Director Roland Emmerich will suddenly show scenes and events that are totally unrelated to anything that is going on. You just know the minute you discover that the wolves have escaped from the zoo that they'll inevitably come back to create an even more dangerous situation for the people in the movie. Why else would the scene of a couple of zookeepers discovering the empty cages be included in the movie? And you know the minute that one of the characters gets hurt trying to save someone that her injury will come back to haunt her. Why else would we get a quick glimpse of her bleeding underwater? As a viewer, you're literally beat over the head with these plot points in an incredibly ham-fisted manner. As I said earlier, it's all so annoying.I suppose that if you're into CGI you might find a thing or two to enjoy. The special effects are, for the most part, well done. But the special effects completely dominate everything else. It's CGI overload. Why even bother with actors? The actors don't act in The Day After Tomorrow. They spend their time reacting to special effects that were generated long after they were finished with the movie. Once again, it's annoying.Finally, did anyone ever think for a moment that the people trapped in the library were in any real danger? If you thought for a second that Jake Gyllenhaal or Emmy Rossum's characters were in any real danger, you've apparently never seen a movie before. Why should I care about these two character (or anyone else for that matter) when you can spot who's going to live and who's going to die 10 minutes into the movie? For the last time, it's annoying.I'll stop here as there are really so many other annoying facets of the movie I could cover that I could write pages. I haven't scratched the surface. I've already spent more time than I should have writing about The Day After Tomorrow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flash, Glamour, and Faulty Science</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an atmospheric scientist I was intrigued to see this movie. The basic premise of this movie is based on the idea of anthropogenically induced (human) global warming resulting in a catastrophic set of weather events that in a matter of a week will plunge the Earth into its next ice age.This movie above all else is a fictional, over exaggerated drama of well done special effects, poor acting, the most basic and mundane of plots, and a romance between two characters trapped in the New York Public Library. The main theme of the plot is a a classical man v. nature struggle with a father trying to rescue his son and several friends after a climate changing storm that left behind meters of snow and ice, a group of friends who struggle to survive in New York during and after the storm, and the romance that develops in which the girl becomes ill because of an injury.As an atmospheric scientist I was very disappointed. Their are very few scientific truths in this movie. This movie came out in response to a surge in global warming alarmism and portrays the cause quite well in that it is completely over exaggerated, is primarily a political tool, utilizes faulty science to scare people, and is all flash with no meaningful substance.While not the worst movie of all time it is very close to the bottom.Summary: The acting and plot are poor. The science in the movie like that behind global warming alarmism is highly flawed. The only thing that saves this movie is its special effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A review by someone who actually SAW the movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>May Contain Spoilers. Unlike some reviewers (RoboSlater) who happily bad-mouth movies they clearly didn't watch here's a review from a genuine movie fan who watched and greatly enjoyed The Day After Tomorrow.A great cast headed by Dennis Quaid and Jake Gyllenhall give a solid heart to the movie, and unlike other disaster movies where you find yourself not really caring here you are rooting for them all the way.The film digresses from the usual Hollywood approach where the Yanks save the day. The day cannot really be saved, and in contrast the American President is taken to task for not listening sooner. Countless lives are lost because of his failure and I found this a nicely ironic touch mirroring the current US political situation and adding to the drama.Another reviewer seems to think an America without a Good President to act as moral compass is unbelievable - when we all know it's become de rigeur.This apparrently professional reviewer also apparrently wasn't paying attention to the movie, as he criticises Quaid's character - "When tornados hit Hollywood and start ripping up other cities instantaneously, he still lets his moody high-school-age son (Jake Gyllenhaal) go to New York on a school outing." This isn't the case at all - we've already seen Jake on the plane before the tornados hit and that is the first clue that Quaid's predictions of climate change may actually be occurring much sooner than he ever thought possible.The troubled father-son relationship is in fact well played throughout, and Jake's character develops nicely. Quaid is charming as ever.The Special Effects are amazing - of course there are many set-pieces and they all just took my breath away, yet you are never too far removed from the human drama.OK, bottom line this is a popcorn movie, a little cheesy in places, perhaps a bit contrived, but come on what did you expect? What I will say it's just not your run-of-the-mill Hollywood popcorn movie, and I guarantee you will be entertained.Ignore the negative reviews from those who weren't paying attention, go see this film Tomorrow, because who knows what will happen after that!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is so typical of Hollywood that it is unbelievable. This movie not only was the most implausible film I have ever had the displeasure of experiencing, but it redefines the phrase "political agenda." Global Warming and climate change are the hot issues of the last few years so, naturally, the movie industry lends itself to spitting out irrelevant garbage about the subject. The main idea of the movie is that man is destroying the planet, neglecting the environment, and abusing nature....... SO MOTHER NATURE RETALIATES!!!!!! New York is flooded, hit by massive tsunamis, and frozen, LA is decimated by tornadoes, and three gigantic freezing land hurricane blizzards obliterate everything north of the equator. All because we have hit a critical desalinization point which is a fancy made-up Hollywood word for not enough salt in the ocean. You may be thinking: wow, this movie sounds pretty implausible, but it gets better.... much better. All of these cataclysms happen in a number of days instead of the rather consistent million year cycles the earth generally operates on. In addition, during the freezing of New York, the buildings freeze from top to bottom which blatantly disregards the fact that heat rises. One may say, you are taking this movie way too seriously, but I think that movies like this are genuine problems for society. The political overtones in this movie are anything but subtle and now we're going to have a bunch of global warming activists running around that think bs like this could actually happen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than most disaster movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>spoilersThere are three groups of people who would automatically switch into high gear in the bashing of Day After Tomorrow:1. Ultra-sensitive, paranoid Americans who take it personally 2. Those who equate CGI with the root of every evil in the film industry 3. Those expecting to emerge from a movie and become a saint If you are none of the above, congratulations. Sit back and enjoy.Arguably, not every movie is for entertainment. A disaster movie, however, is. It does this mainly in two ways. The first is visual and audio and that needs no elaboration. The other works on a more subliminal level but is hardly profound, simply appealing to our relished sense of security (our own) while watching other people's plight.DAT delivers three fantastic catastrophic scenes, not to mention numerous other lesser, but still quite impressive ones. The ravaging of L.A. by numerous cyclones comes almost without warning, with such intense brutality that only CGI (very good CGI here) can recreate. The killing tidal wave that plunders Manhattan is no less devastating. Finally, with an imaginative change in taste, the eye-of-the-storm freezing-death menace is introduced first with casual reference to the ice-age mammal in the museum, then the abrupt destruction of the helicopters, and finally culminates in the cliff-hanger escapes of father and son, at two separate locations. In addition to these sequences that relate directly to the main theme of climate-related catastrophes Emmerich spares no pain in borrowing exciting elements from elsewhere. While admittedly he does sometimes go overboard, I tend not to complain if someone bends over backwards to try to please me. Examples of such efforts are aplenty: life-line cutting from Vertical Limits, phone booth scene turning into underwater escape right out Poseidon Adventure, and pursuits by menacing wolves reminiscent of Aliens.DAT's 'human stories' are better than most in other disaster movies. The father (Dennis Quaid) and son (Jake Gyllenhaal) line here is refreshingly uncontrived. Unlike many other exaggerated, twisted situation, what we have here is simple, straightforward and realistic, just a father whose work takes him away from the family a little too often. Simple, nevertheless moving. As a rare treat, we have the low-key three-men British climatology team facing disaster with stoicism but not without emotion. Playing the leader of the team is Ian Holm, showing the mastery of minimalising.There is humour, but not the kind of long worn-out snappy punch lines that have been used indiscriminately in most movies. A good example is the book burning (to keep warm) scene. In a painful struggle to find books that will cause less anguish to burn, someone comes across an entire section of tax regulations.Finally, there is a fine cast. If not brilliant, Quaid is always dependable, and particularly suited to the not extremely demanding role here. Gyllenhaal is among the finest of actors in his generation, as he well demonstrated in Moonlight Mile. Emmy Rossum, whose brief appearance in Mystic River is enough to leave quite an impression, has a very audience-pleasing role here, and please the audience she certainly does. Last but not least is Ian 'Bilbo' Holm mentioned before, who played Puck in Mid-summer Night's Dream on screen thirty-one years before Stanley Tucci did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Day After Tomorrow starts in New Delhi at a United Nations global warming conference where palaeoclimatologist Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) tries to tell US Vice President Becker (Kenneth Welsh) that the world is headed for another ice age if they don't sign up to the Kyoto Accords &amp; cut greenhouse gasses immediately. With the Vice President more interested in the US economy Hall's pleas fall on deaf ears. Then shortly after British scientist Terry Rapson (Ian Holm) contacts Hall to tell him his equipment has detected a sudden &amp; drastic lowering of temperatures around Greenland caused by huge icecaps melting &amp; breaking off into the Ocean. A climate imbalance causes massive storms across the Northern Hemisphere &amp; minus 170 degree temperatures which freeze &amp; kill anyone caught in it on contact, as America begins to freeze solutions are sought but it might be too late already...Co-written, co-produced &amp; directed by Roland Emmerich this action blockbuster warning about the perils of global warming was a huge hit when originally released although I have to say I didn't think it was any better than average. The script by Emmerich &amp; Jeffrey Nachmanoff is basically a modern updating of all those natural disaster flicks from the 70's like Earthquake (1974), The Towering Inferno (1974), Avalanche (1978) &amp; Meteor (1979) in which nature strikes &amp; causes havoc &amp; danger only The Day After Tomorrow gets the mega budget Hollywood treatment &amp; revolves around the currently very topical issue of global warming &amp; our changing climate. The first thing to say about The Day After Tomorrow is that it is not scientifically accurate &amp; doesn't really try to be, the events in the film which take place over several weeks in reality would takes decades if not centuries. I thought it went on for too long, at two hours in length I found myself becoming increasingly bored with it &amp; I just don't think there's enough story here to maintain ones interest. Then there's the horrible attempts at soap opera style emotion &amp; sentimentality with the final twenty odd minutes set what sounded like violins as it rounded up all the 'human nature' stories &amp; subplots as Jack found his son (if Jack was aware that the storm would kill anyone out in it why did he travel to New York when realistically speaking he would know he would have been killed too?), the cringe worthy speech at the end by the President thanking other countries for their assistance &amp; the perils of ignoring global warming &amp; taking our planet for granted, the scenes of people having survived in New York on the rooftops, the scene of the boy in Hospital being saved &amp; the final shot of a clear unpolluted Earth from space are just ever so slightly embarrassing. The character's are pretty thin, I didn't really care about anyone, all the coincidences are just daft although there are some seriously impressive CGI effects &amp; some memorable imagery such as the scenes of destruction in New York.The one thing that does save The Day After Tomorrow are some terrific set-piece action sequences &amp; some impressive CGI computer effects. From the devastating affects of tornado's sweeping through Los Angeles to huge waves crashing through New York to the image of a huge tanker ship sailing though the streets &amp; between the skyscrapers of Manhattan. The film was promoted with the claim that it was the first Hollywood film to be 'carbon neutral' &amp; environmentally friendly I suppose. While the special effects are impressive &amp; there are some good set-piece scenes I still found the film rather slow going, a bit heavy handed especially when it came to the emotion &amp; sentiment at the end &amp; just too long.With a supposed budget of about $125,000,000 The Day After Tomorrow had an opening US box-office weekend take of $85,000,000 which is huge, to be honest although all the impressive CGI effects make for a great looking trailer I still don't think the actual film is much better than average. The acting is alright but nothing great, Quaid is OK as the hero while Ian Holm is wasted in small cameo role.The Day After Tomorrow is a OK if unspectacular environmental disaster flick that I found hard to remain interested in, sure the CGI is great but the story &amp; character's are fairly weak. Not bad but not great.</fullReview>

That's basically the extent of anything remotely scientific. If you have an IQ over 60 (anything under 80 is legally retarded) I suggest you watch world's wildest home videos or some crap like that instead, I assume that is only a 30 minute program and you get the exact same thing. *SOMEWHAT OF A SPOILER* During the film the really crappy explanation of all the snow is that the storm is pulling hot air down from the upper troposphere, which is actually the hottest region of the atmosphere ("wow" exactly words when i heard that was the explanation). I hope no one is stupid enough to make a movie like this again, geared solely for people who just like big explosions. "BOOM" can't make a movie.</fullReview>

The story may be fairly boilerplate, but the effects and acting make up for that in a pinch. It is about the next natural disaster striking every corner of the Earth and the movements put forth by many to try to do something to that end. While the situations displayed in the film are applicable only loosely to real life, that makes all the less difference, as the film is ultimately good. This film has good situations for some and is ultimately good for a rainy day...no pun intended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film deals about ice melting of the Arctic created by global weather change of the hole ozone. The movie is impressive , New York's flood is overwhelming .The plot summary centers in Dennis Quaid a climatologist who predicts disaster and he goes to looking for his son Jake Gyllenheal to New York staying all the way freezing cool fighting against amount dangers because middle United States are frozen. The F.X. of computer generator are first rate , better than the classics 7o and 80 :"earthquake", "Inferno towering" and likeness to "Volcano" or "Armaguedon". Thrilling screenplay dispenses absurd excitement as well as spectacular scenes and lots of action . This is a fast-paced, stylized disaster-spectacle film . Cinematography and musical score by Harald Kloser are breathtaking . Direction by Roland Emmerich is fitting as in all spectacle film that he makes . Roland Emmerich estimated that at least 1000 digital artists worked on the film . The motion picture was well realized by Roland Emmerich . Roland made his feature length film in 1984 : ¨The Noah's ark principle¨ , he subsequently made ¨Joey¨ . In 1997 wrote, directed, and produced the critically acclaimed "Moon 44" . Filmmaker Roland Emmerich quickly understood the freedom and malleability that direct in USA presents and has gone about creating some incredibly interesting genre fare in ¨Universal Soldier¨, his first American movie in which displayed an acute understanding of the action genre . Roland ulteriorly directed 1994 Stargate , 1996 Independence Day , 1998 Godzilla , 2000 The Patriot , 2004 The day after tomorrow , 2008 : 10.000 , 2011 Anonymous and his last movie 2013 White House Down .Rating : 7/10 , above average. The picture will appeal to disaster genre fans . Well worth seeing .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. That was my first word to my friend with whom I saw this movie as soon as I stepped from the theatre. Wow because, to be honest I could barely believe that this movie made it past Hollywood quality control (not that it's been known to be all that efficient anyway). There are 2 reasons I actually felt mental anguish watching this movie, and 1 marginally redeeming quality. To start with the latter observation, I have to give them credit for putting together some quality special effects. All of the disaster sequences were excellently done, and at no point did I feel that it was too computerized or lacked visual believability. It could be worth the watch just for the effects.Now, on to the two big critiques... (and let me emphasize big).1) Screenplay, Acting &amp; Story.Quite possibly the most painfully clichéd screenplay I have ever seen. Not to mention that it was not really written in English, but rather "Kindergarten". I mean, we don't go to big budget movies like this to feel inspired by philosophical dialogue, but come on, you can at least do better than this. I actually felt pained watching some of the scenes (especially those melodramatic ones from Dennis Quaid going after Jake Gyllenhaal in NY...) and I know I wasn't the only one. I had never heard so many groans so frequently in a theatre before. Furthermore, the wafer-thin plot about the "distanced father" who realizes his mistake of not paying enough attention to his son on account of being too committed to his job, etc etc etc is so overused and boring it does nothing but detract from the rest of the movie.The acting was mediocre, but don't get me wrong, I like Jake Gyllenhaal and Dennis Quaid... it's just that there isn't much they could have done with this crap. 2) The "Message".Now, let me preface this by saying that I realize this is "just a movie", but still, it is a movie that is meant to have a highly political message.... and the way they pass off this supposedly wise message ensures that this movie goes down in my books as one of the worst I have ever endured. OK, global warming is a controversial issue, and there opposing opinions, and this is just one of them, fine. But, I felt that the whole time the makers of this movie were just trying to stuff every conceivable facet of social justice down my throat at every possible opportunity. It wasn't just global warming, it was third world debt relief, anti-statism, the rich-poor divide.... etc etc etc. Regardless of my personal view on climate change (I think it's a complicated issue, and I did my degree in evolutionary genetics and had all the opposing and supporting arguments driven into my head, so I am not just some left or right clone on the matter...) I couldn't help but feel somewhat violated by the constant presence of such an over-arching political agenda - almost as though the director felt I was an idiot and would buy these messages as profound or substantiated. Probably the worst was the new President's speech at the end when he starts talking about Americans "reaching out" to their 3rd world guests, and that whole line where he basically says "We used to think we could burn fossil fuels with reckless abandon. We were wrong. I was wrong."... I almost choked on the cheese. Another was the "classic" scene with the homeless man showing the rich-kid how to stuff newspapers in his shirt for warmth... how touching...and transparent. I mean, couldn't you guys have just stuck to the one message (global climate change), rather than trying so obviously hard to force every other possible social justice issue in? In some ways this movie may as well have been a propaganda film for the Green Party and/or Comintern. And for those that would respond to me by saying "it's just a movie", yes, it is, but so is "Triumph of the Will", and I believe this movie comes close to deserving the same skeptical treatment we give to that, otherwise well-done, film. And also, before anyone accuses me of being a "Bush-Clone" or "right-winger" or some nonsense, let me point out that I would have equally scornful words to say about a movie that promoted the opposite agenda in such a ridiculous way. On a side note...I can't imagine how anyone who is actually concerned about Global Warming or these other issues could really feel this helped their cause... if anything it presented the case in such an amateur and dumbed-down way that it actually takes away credibility from the issue.So, overall, I conclude by saying this: Great effects, decent disaster scenes, but clichéd to the point of physical discomfort, inexcusably bad screenplay, and, worst of all, intolerably riddled with thinly veiled (if at all) political messages that are forced down your throat at all opportunities (appropriate or not).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Left-wing nonsense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All summer movies want to create buzz, but rarely is the intended buzz "Support the McCain-Lieberman bill." The movie is "The Day After Tomorrow," the global-warming flick that aims to gin up support for the sort of greenhouse-emissions regulation sponsored by John McCain and Joe Lieberman. The premise of "The Day After Tomorrow" is as laughable as its dialogue. "I think we've hit a critical desalination point" passes for snappy repartee in the film, as global warming melts the polar ice caps. This disrupts the Gulf Stream, plunging North America into a new ice age. Tidal waves devastate New York City, which is then buried under ice and snow (ensuring the defeat, by the way, of whoever is running City Hall, since New Yorkers would never tolerate a mayor who couldn't clear the streets after a snowstorm). Al Gore has given the movie two green thumbs up, and the left-wing group MoveOn.org is promoting it. Never mind that the movie's scenario is absurd. There is no such thing as a flash freeze that makes helicopters fall out of the air. Nor can an ice age descend in a matter of days. More sober environmentalists worry that the very ridiculousness of the film will discredit their cause. The innocent moviegoer will be confused that a movie about global warming features so much snow. But this is keeping with the trend of global-warming advocates laying claim to any unusual weather. When winters are bitterly cold, it is a sign of "climate change." When winters are unseasonably warm, it too is a sign of climate change. It is an all-purpose phrase, since the climate is always "changing" and therefore by definition vindicating environmentalists. That said, global warming is a fact. The surface temperature has gone up roughly 1 degree Celsius since the mid-19th century. The warming during the past 30 years might even be partly a result of manmade emissions. But we're talking very small and gradual changes that aren't causing the disruptions environmentalists sometimes hype, like extreme weather or dangerously rising sea levels. Any regulatory fix will have only the slightest effect. Climatologist Patrick Michaels estimates that the Kyoto Treaty -- McCain-Lieberman is a watered-down version of the treaty -- would prevent only 0.07 degrees Celsius of warming over the next 50 years. The best solution to greenhouse emissions is the kind of technological innovation that Bush has put forth that has made America's economy steadily cleaner. Economic growth is the environment's best friend, creating both new, cleaner technologies and giving people the luxury to worry more about the environment and less about their own sustenance. But anti-growth environmentalists don't want to hear that, which brings us back to "The Day After Tomorrow." Why is New York the setting for the film's most graphic mayhem? It is the iconic American city, so it's always a tempting backdrop for disaster movies. But something else might be at work. As environmental writer Iain Murray has argued, New York is the emblematic expression of America's capitalist civilization, and is therefore something of an affront to critics of that civilization, foreign and domestic. The makers of "The Day After Tomorrow" revel in the prospect of our civilization being brought low, humiliated for its sins. In the film, desperate Americans flee illegally across the Mexican border to escape the weather cataclysm. Get the irony? After the disaster, the Dick Cheney-look-alike vice president apologizes, essentially for the fact that his country has been running a modern economy lo these many years: "We were wrong. I was wrong." Even with America's economy destroyed, even with millions dead, there is a bright spot. At the end, an astronaut comments from far above our frozen continent: "The air has never been so clear." All the SUVs are buried under the tundra! "The Day After Tomorrow" might not be much of a movie, but it is useful for providing a glimpse into the soul of left-wing environmentalism. Pretty chilling.- Rich Lowry</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Aside from the poor science, writing, acting, plot, etc., the single most baffling thing in this piece of trash was the burning of books. If you're in a metal box surrounded by books fine burn 'em. But there was furniture and fixtures and doors that would burn much better then books. They would burn hotter, longer, and more efficiently then books. So anyways watch this crap if you want to see some nasty fake storms. That's about all this film has to offer. On a side note though, seeing a fake Cheney having nature slap him in the face with devastation was nice. And the fake Bush being so insecure and weak willed that he couldn't make a decision without his VP explicitly instructing him on the "correct" course made me giggle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's all been said. This movie was as big a letdown, if not bigger than the Matrix sequels. This movie was an insult to the intelligence of anyone with an education beyond 8th grade. Nice to see the minorities represented. Hispanic janitor, intelligent Asian woman, homeless African American. Not to mention the stereotypical librarian. Jake Gyllenhaal was awesome in Donnie Darko so I figured if he was in this that it had to be at least decent. Sneaky bastard Jake! I don't know how he managed to do decent acting using the horrible script and the vomit inducing acting that took place all around him. Kudos to Jake for managing to keep his head above water in this one, despite the constant dragging of everyone around him. He obviously couldn't carry the movie but he made a valiant effort it would seem. I'm ashamed of how naive I was to think that this thing wasn't going to be as cheesy and corny as it was. I've seen few movies this chocked full of both. Even if you take it at a base level and look at this totally for the brainless entertainment factor, again, unless you're an ignorant moron, your intelligence is going to be offended. The action sequences, people managing to run several yards, up flights of stairs from a 14 story wall of water had me squirming to run out of the theater, in hopes that I might salvage the rest of my evening. Need I mention the emotional insult? Next to no character development, half assed at best. Unless you're extremely shallow, you're going to gag on the convenient store, prepackaged, freeze dried, preservative filled, single serving emotional scenes. This movie dropped the bottom out for how low the bar can go. I heard someone start to clap behind me at the end and I had to lie to myself that they were clapping because it was over, otherwise I would have had to strangle them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW Aspect ratio: 2.39:1Sound formats: Dolby Digital / DTSUtterly routine blockbuster, loosely based on scientific predictions of disastrous climate changes due to global warming, in which the Gulf Stream is essentially 'shut off', triggering a series of freak weather conditions (giant hailstones in Japan, tornadoes in Los Angeles, tidal waves in New York, etc.) which culminate in a new Ice Age. Dennis Quaid is the obsessive climatologist who struggles to convince sceptical authorities of the impending catastrophe, and who is forced to rescue his son (Jake Gyllenhaal) after the boy becomes stranded in Manhattan following torrential floods and the subsequent Big Freeze. Industrial Light &amp; Magic unleashes a wealth of attention-grabbing visual effects during the film's impressive opening stretch, effectively sidelining the crudely drawn characters and half-baked melodramatics, but the superficial script (by Jeffrey Nachmanoff and director Roland Emmerich) fails to sustain the initial momentum, and the second half becomes bogged down in Quaid's ho-hum rescue mission. To be fair, the movie DOES contain a number of awe-inspiring sequences (the massive wave which rises from the ocean to engulf New York; the view from space as three colossal storms circle the entire northern hemisphere of the earth; a trawler floating serenely down a flooded Fifth Avenue), and a couple of satirical jabs are surprisingly potent (most notably, the mass exodus of American citizens INTO Mexico!), but the movie amounts to little more than smoke and mirrors, all flash and no substance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first third of the movie features some actually gripping scenes. The special effects are definitely astounding, the tornados or the big wave flooding New York. The problem with this film lies in the screenplay written by director Roland Emmerich and Jeffrey Nachmanoff. Nobody expects an exceptional character development in a catastrophe movie like this. That's due to the unofficial rules of blockbusters, where producers seem to be in agreement: The dumber, the better. But the characters here are written so one-dimensional, it's literally an attack on every thinking man's and woman's intelligence. After the imminent threat for the people in the library caused by the flood is passed away, absolutely harebrained situations are introduced to put the characters in danger (look e.g.: wolves, blood poisoning). Further clichés (or rather stupidities): oh so bad vice president, good president leaving the white house as last person, noble scientists, ?; but as I said, the first third is at least pretty much fun (but please don't use this film for a discussion about climate problems, this would be an insult).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DAY AFTER TOMORROW : Terribly Clichéd Story Picked Up A Bit By Top Notch Effects...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE DAY AFTER TOMORROWRoland Emmerich's roller-coaster ride of Global Warning terror is every bit as over-the-top as you could imagine. From the first previews of THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW it was clear the audience was in for a disaster film to end all disaster movies. The destruction of the world as we know it. The problem is, seeing the movie adds little to no emotional weight to the "ooo's" and "aaaah's" we experienced when we first got a glimpse of the trailer.THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW takes place on a day when Global Warming strikes the entire Northern Hemisphere. Only a handful of scientists are aware of the oncoming slaughter before hand and as a result half of America is trapped with no place to run from a deadly storm that includes tornadoes, blizzards, floods, hail, and sub-zero temperatures. Stuck in a public library with a few of his friends is Sam Hall (played by Jake Gyllenhaal), the son of leading American climatologist Jack Hall (played by Dennis Quaid). Here's the shocker though, they have an estranged father/son relationship and Jack must travel across the frozen wasteland that was once the northern USA to save his son.The main problem with this film is that the emotional center is painfully contrived. Why couldn't they have gone against the loop and had the father/son actually be very close? It would have given the film a fresh, less-familiar tone. Every time the film tries to delve into the drama of Jack and Sam's relationship I couldn't help but roll my eyes. One of my biggest pet peeves with movies is when I can tell the director is trying to make his audience cry, instead of just telling an honest story. Unfortunately, THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW is filled with scenes like that. To name a few:- The scene with Jack in the tent talking about getting to his son. - The random cancer patient Sela Ward has to stay with through the storm (apparently there is only 1 patient who couldn't be moved and he just happens to be a 12 year old child?) - The death of Dennis Quaid's long-time friendAll of these scenes dragged the film to a screeching halt for me as I had to excuse myself to laugh at the lame-ness.However, what THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW promised to deliver on (crazy action, fantastic effects, overwhelming danger) it succeeds at wildly. The sequences where the storm first approaches are nothing short of phenomenal. Especially the flooding of New York. All of these scenes don't even try to ground themselves in reality... they embrace the over-the-top edge to this story. It is these extensive action scenes that manage to keep the film alive despite the tiresome and clichéd story.As usual, Dennis Quaid manages to make more of the material then it deserves. However, Jake Gyllenhaal, though clearly a talented actor today, offers a completely confused performance. Perhaps if Sam were played better, the father/son story would have been more gripping... but as is, Gyllenhaal's performance does nothing to help the film. Ironically, I found this to be Emmy Rossum's best performance so far (not too challenging considering how unimpressed I was with her in both POSEIDON and PHANTOM OF THE OPERA).Overall, THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW is more then entertaining enough to pass a few hours. However, it's not nearly strong enough a film to stick with it's audience more then a few minutes after the credits. It's too bad too, b/c a massive blockbuster about Global Warming could have probably been a little bit richer.... C ...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Irwin Allen reincarnated, again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CAUTION: Many Spoilers Within.In all our human arrogance, let this film be a stern warning to us all: no matter how much money Independence Day might have made, you cannot create another blockbuster by simply using that screenplay as a template for another movie, and merely changing the bad guy from space aliens to mother nature. In The Day After Tomorrow, Roland Emmerich (Irwin Allen reincarnated, apparently) has attempted just that, and the result is more catastrophic than a 7-10 day return to the Ice Age. Or was it 7-10 hours? Or weeks? Who the hell can tell how long this tale of woe was supposed to have covered? (My woe lasted 123 minutes, your mileage may vary).The Day After Tomorrow may win an academy award for special effects. But that has to make us wonder, what is the point of that award when the special effects ARE the movie, while characterization, plot, factual accuracy, etc. represent nothing more than... well, the icing on the cake that special effects serve as in all other movies. After watching this topsy-turvy world gone mad for two hours I felt like I had watched the final attack on the Death Star for two hours, with 23 minutes of cutaways to Darth Vader trudging around the bridge thrown in sporadically for dramatic effect.Granted, the special effects are good. Very good. But when they ARE the entire film, there is no longer anything special about them. They're routine. Is there an Academy Award for Routine Effects?Yes, as a resident of Southern California who used to live in Kansas it was interesting to see Los Angeles get blown away by tornadoes. It was quite a lark to see the Exxon Valdez go off course yet again and cruise down Park Avenue. And it was amazing to see tourists taking photographs in New York City without the police or Swat teams descending upon them as potential terrorist threats. The special effects were that good, okay? OKAY???But the story sucked. The Irwin Allen formula (brief character sketches, two hours of action, then a sigh of relief when most of the character sketches survive catastrophe) may have worked for Independence Day, but it fails miserably in this film, for several reasons:* The only sympathetic characters out of a dozen or so characters were the homeless man and his dog. * There was really no story. * The brilliant nerdy girl was played by a Beverly Hills 90210 lookalike who would have been better cast as a cheerleader or a Hilton sister. * There's no time frame to the events portrayed in the film. * The science is beyond ludicrous. * The morality plays (bureacratic shortsightedness, environmental protection) were about as subtle as the morality plays in Traffic. * Product placement included Fox News, as if Fox News would ever admit that global warming exists even after an Ice Age suddenly descended upon us. * A Scottish research center manned by characters who have no Scottish accents. * An Asian woman who speaks better English than 9 out of 10 American teenagers. * As near as I could tell, the hero walked from Philadelphia to Manhattan during an Ice Age blizzard--in a day or two. * I couldn't distinguish the scientist hero from the putz President, and I still don't know if the main character was played by Harrison Ford, Bruce Willis or someone else. Worse, I don't really care. * A little kid with cancer was included in a cheap attempt to manufacture some tiny strand of concern for at least one character. * Everything in the entire Northern Hemisphere is frozen absolutely solid as a rock--except for door hinges. * The President addresses the nation on the Weather Channel. * An off-the-shelf screenplay recipe that includes 1 act of heroic self-sacrifice, ten thousand acts of human stupidity and ignorance, and a couple dozen shakes of deus ex machina.In other words, you never doubt that the main characters will survive in the end, and you don't really care who lives or dies anyway (except the homeless guy and his dog), and that spells disaster for a little thing that Hollywood used to call a "STORY".The only thing good about this film was the first 5-10 minutes of special effects (before they became routine and boring), and the not-so-subtle irony of watching Mexico deal with millions of illegal immigrants flooding INTO Mexico.To summarize, The Day After Tomorrow left me cold. I give it 3/10--one for the homeless guy, one for the homeless guy's dog, one for the tornadoes in Los Angeles, and one for giving Mexico a taste of its own medicine. Minus one for not allowing us to fast-forward or otherwise escape the opening trailer for some other lousy movie when you insert the DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quote:"Not too long ago I adapted a novel into a screenplay. I had to start from scratch. It was a disaster book about a meteorologist who discovers a new ice age approaching. No one believes him, of course, and when the weather changes it's too late. The new ice age begins. The meteorologist and a group of other scientists are sent to examine the glacier in Iceland, but the ship freezes in the ice. The novel ends with the main character freezing to death."That was the book. A disaster story of 650 pages that's a downer."I decided to keep the main character, but I wanted to place him in emotional conflict for more dramatic value. So I made him a politically outspoken professor, who was being considered for tenure at NYU. His 'irresponsible' statements about the impending ice age could possibly jeopardize his appointment."Then I had to figure out what to do about the story. I needed to change the ending into an 'upbeat' or positive one. I wanted them to live, not die in the frozen ice. So I had to construct new elements BASED on the novel. I began knowing I wanted an exciting opening. I went through the book and on page 287 found the main character traveling to the glacier in Iceland to measure glacial movement. I decided to open there, on the vast ice plain. A visual element. As they descend deep into the heart of the glacier an earthquake occurs, causing an avalanche. They barely make it out alive. It's a strong, visual sequence and sets up the story appropriately."When the professor returns to New York and presents his findings to his superiors, they don't believe him. The first blizzard of the year, the warning, then becomes the plot point at the end of Act I... The shape of things to come."The second act was another problem. I reduced most of the action to three major sequences: one, the main character organizes a world-wide network of scientists to try and solve the problem; two, New York City freezes; and three, the people finally accept the truth and try to formulate a plan. I strung these sequences together with incidents from the book, knowing I had to avoid all disaster-movie clichés; there was no market for disaster movies at the time. As I mentioned, the original ending didn't work and had to be changed. I ended up with a futuristic survival story."The above quote is from the 1982 edition of the 1979 book SCREENPLAY, by Syd Field.It has been reproduced without permission.Like this movie.</fullReview>

I bet it will threaten her life somehow later in the movie." or "Wolves escaped? I bet those wolves will hunt down the main characters in the terrible blizzard of epic scale." I wondered these things and laughed them off, believing that no one would ever use such clichés. I was ***WRONG***. My wrongness provided much enjoyment for both me and my friends.The science.

The poorly executed premises are always accompanied by the lame cliché stories and predictable outcomes, which they also never fail to deliver. I will hand it to them the first half of this movie is somewhat entertaining, although only due to the disaster sequences which are attuned with a bit of touching music from time to time. You could almost say it 'felt real', but alas it still grows horrendously over the top at times. Like the scientists who just had to have those samples for instance....yuck, suddenly I have a bad taste in my mouth.But once all the water freezes, the film becomes hopelessly boring. Dennis Quad did all right and Jake Gyllenhaal did so as well with the script he was handed. Everyone else is mildly dove into, but not enough to hold my attention. The story basically struggles to find things for everyone to do. The end bit with a 'ice age temperature eye-of-the-storm' was a hit and miss climax that just wasn't that involving.All together your in for the same old eye candy visuals, but you might always take the disc out once the first half is over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jack Hall is certain that another ice age is imminent due to the effects of global warming, but the government just wont listen to him. Sure enough the climate changes and the world is at threat from perilous frozen weather, worse still for Jack is that his son is trapped in New York City!Roland Emmerich was the perfect choice to direct this particular piece. There is no denying that he has no little panache when it comes to destroying and blowing things up, think Independence Day, Stargate, Universal Soldier and Godzilla. What runs true thru an Emmerich picture is that he is great on the CGI money shots and knows how to whet an appetite for destruction. Sadly what is also true is that his second halves rarely deliver on their promise, so shall it be with The Day After Tomorrow. Even allowing for the expected mawkishness that comes with disaster/survival pictures, this picture relies too much on its contrivances, thus completely losing sight of it's eco-conscious heart, something that I'm sure the politically aware Emmerich set out to deliver at the start.Packing his picture with solid and professional performers {led by the always watchable Dennis Quaid as Jack Hall}, Emmerich is all too aware that his money shots are what the popcorn masses have chiefly come to see. Tornados, floods and the subsequent freeze are all excellent moments in the piece, but now, some years later the film has to be called out for being the shallow showcase that it is, in fact the CGI looks unintentionally artificial. It's a missed opportunity to make a blockbuster with an intelligent heart, sadly Emmerich, either thru boredom or ignorance? Failed to seal the deal and craft one of the better genre entries. Just about average for the destruction sequences, but very little else to recommend here I'm afraid. 5/10</fullReview>

Movie shows all this happening over a few days time and does a very good job of it. Really superb special effects.Unfortunately the show also decides to have a bunch of stupid, inane, and boring personal relationships. A couple of dumb teens are falling in love. A father is worried about his son and decides to go out in temps of -100 F and find him!! I fast-forwarded thru all that crap. Seems like all disaster movies insist on showing the "human side" of what's happening but this movie went overboard. Plus i hated the silly ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brave attempt, but it falters with the story and other basic film principals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Day After Tomorrow is a rather entertaining film which combines good CGI and character development and mixes them up into a film containing elements of a rather delicate subject; namely global warming.Unfortunately, the CGI and character development is all that this film has going for it when it comes to the basic principals of good film-making. The whole 'moral message' about the global warming and stoppage of environment destroying is made very obvious, very early on. This is rammed into our faces with some very disorientating montage sequences, very early on in the film with various natural disasters occurring through out the world. From the beginning, we are immediately shown some of the flaws this film has. It moves from one thing to the next at a confused pacing and annoying things like this crop up at various intervals.The early montage scenes, as I've mentioned, are very sudden. There is no real build up to these scenes; it's just random hail in Japan amongst other things in other places. Here, a bit of character build up would have worked so that we can sympathise with the people going through hell thanks to the weather, but there isn't any so we don't really care that much and this detracts from the experience. Another thing is the editing, which is sloppy. I can understand shaky camera work in a moment of panic and chaos but only if it's from someone's point of view. In this scene, it's just blurred and too chaotic to even notice/care what the hell is happening. Some patience and some build up would have worked.Another thing is that the initial disaster of the tornados around L.A happens a little too early on for me. The film makers were probably a little eager to show off the CGI, but they had the chance to do that with the earlier scenes, of which they could have executed a little better. Here, it seems L.A. is eliminated and just brushed aside for the rest of the film in an odd message from the director consisting of: 'Right, here's the shock and awe of the weather in this film. Something as big as L.A. is gone so forget about it'. We don't find out what happens in the aftermath and in the end, the whole attack probably didn't even need to happen to advance the film; as I said - it was merely a show off.During the bulk of a film, especially a thriller like this one, you need some suspense or build up. In The Day After Tomorrow, there isn't any. One half of the characters in the film are attempting a rescue mission, the other half are staying in the same place for the entire film. That's not going to work. The only real fight the hero(s) have is the chase on the large boat against the wolves which floats into the city, in fact the wolves, in their brief appearance, are actually more of a match for the hero(s) and are more 'frightening' than the weather is.So, you get the idea that this film is rather slow in the middle and after a good beginning (bar the ridiculous early montages) it falters further and further before stumbling over the finish line with a bit of a silly ending. The character development is good but with the un-thrilling middle this film has, that's all the characters CAN do: talk. One good thing that this has through out is the CGI. Right from the beginning, the opening track shot of the ice glazier leaves you guessing whether or not it's actually real! and this momentum and consistent superior CGI is maintained through out, rivalling that of other releases of around this film's time that contain CGI, so at least it's good to end on a positive note.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Amazing Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Day After Tomorrow, simply, is a great movie. Great acting, great plot, awesome special effects, keeps you on the edge of your seat, and, of course, Jake Gyllenhaal. There is really nothing negative to say about the movie. You may need to watch it a few times in order to fully understand it, if you are at a young age, but it's definitely very captivating, especially the first time you see it. The movie also has some educational value. A lot of the facts about the earth's climate are untrue, as was done on purpose, but if you watch the movie enough you will learn something. Also, I found it quite a good statement, in this day and age, that they had Americans crossing the border into Mexico. I feel this promotes good feelings towards Mexicans, even if it is only a movie. On the topic of the acting, Dennis Quaid was very convincing as a busy, somewhat obsessed father who doesn't have much time for his children. Jake Gyllenhaal and Emmy Rossum were brilliant as two high school students, and all the supporting roles in the film were done stupendously as well. Another good thing about the movie was that it had a lot of variety. There were funny moments, mostly in the beginning of the movie, there were sad moments, when people died, there were lots of suspenseful moments, and there were moments that were close to terrifying. The special effects in the movie were done amazingly well, and the plot was rock solid. Admittedly, I saw the movie for Jake Gyllenhaal, but I ended up loving the whole thing! If you haven't already, definitely see The Day After Tomorrow, and if you have, good choice!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The day after is just like it sounds for bread</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Day After Tomorrow takes the most extreme timetables for global tragedy and ratchets them forward by a factor of 100. That's permissible for a big-budget Hollywood spectacle. The problem is that in the course of the compound cataclysms amassed by this movie, there's never a sense of how profoundly and permanently lives are impacted. And though hundreds of millions of people surely perish, there is--astonishingly--no sense of that incalculable loss. Instead, we're stuck with turgid melodrama interrupted by far too little of the dazzling f/x promised in the trailers. An Antarctic ice shelf cracks; Los Angeles is destroyed by a horde of supersized tornadoes on steroids; Tokyo is pelted with hail that is bigger than a breadbox. The worst horrors are reserved for New York City, soaked in torrential rains, then subjected to a storm surge which washes away anyone at street level. Soon the cold descends, a nasty chill which lowers temperatures at 10 degrees per second and dips down below minus 150. Hey, is that Fahrenheit or Centigrade? Guess it doesn't much matter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big and Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the man who brought us such disaster areas as 'Independence Day' and 'Godzilla' comes this latest disaster; The Day After Tomorrow. As you probably already know, The Day After Tomorrow is about bad weather. Lots of it, all coming at once; we've got hurricanes, tidal waves, hail stones, snow and, well, actually that's it. For a movie that professes to have lots of disasters; it's seriously lacking. The disasters, when they're on, are a huge disappointment. Judging by the trailers, you would expect the disasters to make up most of the film, but this isn't the case. The effects are outstanding, but the disaster scenes themselves don't last long at all, and they're not even very exciting. The scenarios tend to cut off before the money shot kicks in, so what we're left with is several 'half' disasters and, overall, I get the impression that Roland Emmerich can't handle the vast scale of the film. Between the disasters, we are given the staple 'human drama behind the disaster' set-up, and like most disaster films before this one; it's terrible and very much something that you will be better off missing. In fact, if you've seen the trailer, then really; you've seen the film.As you might expect; the film is set in America. As if America is the only country on earth, all the action is centred there and all other countries have to either make do with a mention, or more commonly; nothing at all. We are treated to sequences such as The Statue of Liberty sticking out of the snow; but never any others. Where's the Eiffel tower while all this is going on? Buckingham Palace? The Taj Mahal? Stone Henge? Nope, because if it's not America, it's not important. Or at least that's the case with this film. Somehow, there's time for a scene where the American flag freezes, but there isn't time to show what's happening to the Kremlin. Ridiculous. Speaking of ridiculous, let's move on to the human drama side of the film. The main story follows a father (Dennis Quaid) who must travel all the way to New York to rescue his son (Jake Gyllenhaal) who has become trapped in the snow. For a start, this plot is ridiculous; the weather shown in this film is so extreme that you'd be taking a risk walking to the local post office (assuming it's still there, of course), but somehow this guy is able to walk halfway across America? Something tells me that Emmerich doesn't fully respect his audience's intelligence. The drama is also dripping with sickly fake sentiment, which only serves in being pathetic. The film is also far too upbeat; it centres on a disaster that has killed millions of people, and yet we're supposed to feel good because a father has managed to save his son? What about all the other people that have lost their lives?Good points? Well, the film does have some interesting sequences. One of which sees a reporter get whisked away by a piece of debris while reporting on the tornado's that are sweeping the country, another sees a helicopter pilot freeze instantly, and there's also a sequence that involves our main character being chased by a pack of wolves; which would have been interesting if the wolves weren't so obviously CGI. It's not even good CGI, for god's sake. The cast aren't bad, but nobody shines. Jake Gyllenhaal probably wanted a change from doing small independent films, and I can understand that; but he impressed in those films, and he doesn't here. Stick to what you're good at, Jake. Dennis Quaid tries to be the intellectual hero, but misses the mark due to an entirely rigid performance and Ian Holm is the British man that goes out on a tribute to Manchester United. Don't get me wrong, Man U deserve a tribute; but would you really be toasting a football team when you're about to killed? Just another of the film's silly sequences.One day, someone will make a good disaster film. One that doesn't just focus on America, one that takes it's subject material into account and doesn't turn a disaster into a uplifting drama. One that does it's human drama in an interesting way, and one that does what it says on the tin where the disasters are concerned. One day that will happen, but today isn't that day. And neither is The Day After Tomorrow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The hype leading up to the release of this film was substantial. I remember co-workers talking about how "it's based on fact!" Like that is something really amazing. I saw it on opening night with my girlfriend. We were the only people who laughed at the uber-patriotism blanketing the film - most likely in an effort to prevent the prescence of the idea of global warming from being written off as a 'liberal media event.' This film doesn't have much to offer. Yes, some interesting weather effects, but really not much else. I felt no connection to any of the characters, and I didn't come out of the movie feeling particularly entertained. I didn't have an outright dislike for it either. I suppose that it is an acceptable movie to watch if it's on TV. Maybe rent it if you've been curious. But own it? Never. Canned dialogue as the material featured here does not deserve space in a personal collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the better Disaster Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is most likely Mr. Emmerich's best film so far. The plot and science may be a bit "off" but generally it's an enjoyable film. Disaster films aren't Pulp Fiction or The Godfather, in fact, every disaster movie ever created is below the 7.0 rating on this site. The movie here isn't boring and has some very suspenseful scenes. And there is plenty of disaster. Most movie today use CGI and slop it in to their films, and it looks really realistic. However, this film is a completely different story. The effects in this film are most likely the best I've ever scene, only Jurassic Park and some parts in LOTR beat what this movie has to offer. The special effects alone are well worth going to the theater. Tornadoes destroying L.A and a giant tidal wave rushing in to the streets of New York has never been done better. You can tell they spent quite a bit of time on the Special Effects. This movie isn't Top 250 material, but it's not bad either, and the characters aren't stupid, brainless idiots either (i.e Armageddon). I recommend you see it.</fullReview>

The first week out it broke the record for biggest opening worldwide for a non-sequel. If you haven't seen it go! It's a movie that has a meaning behind it of family, love, the planet itself.

		<fullReview>"The Day After Tomorrow" had an implausible plot, flimsy dialogue, and TV-movie acting, but it was the best cinematic experience I've had since "Apollo 13". Roland Emmerich is good at making movies on an epic scale, and here he pulls off his best ever. This is a good disaster movie, with an important message. Forget that the events happen faster than naturally possible: the point is that they can happen. The walls of water and tornadoes sure are burned into my memory. I was surprised to see that Emmy Rossum was in this movie, since I've never heard of her. Even though her romance with Sam was cheesy, it was sweet. A nice distraction for those with fragile hearts pounding as a result of tsunamis and frozen bodies.</fullReview>

This movie begins with a bang... a large bang and ends with a bang. Nothing stopping it in between. You will be breathless (especially if you live/have visited some of those place so you can say "Holy crap! I've been there and it's flooded!") for many parts of the movie. Honestly, at one point I couldn't breathe because I was overwhelmed. My eyes couldn't leave the screen. As you seen LA torn apart by multiple tornadoes and New York being destroyed by the powerful seas, you WILL think "wow."Wow. That's all I can say. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocre disaster film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW is your typical disaster movie: At a conference meeting, a climatologist named Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) states his theory that with the continuing elevation of global warming, in about 100 years, the world's icecaps will melt, thereby causing disastrous floods, and then the globe will freeze over again, causing "the next Ice Age." Even though most people can see the sense in this, the board he is speaking to doesn't. Little do they know, this theory rapidly becomes true, in much less than 100 years--more like 2 days. Gigantic pieces of icebergs in Antarctica break off and then melt, increasing the water level in the ocean and causing terrible flooding all over New York City. The only people who survive are locked in buildings with little hope.As far as disaster movies go, THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW is either at the better end of the stick or right among the pack, depending on how you look at it. On the one hand, all of the cliches are present, from the turned-away scientist looking to earn his son's love back, to said son's inevitable love interest, to said love interest's possibly lethal condition... etc. The acting is pretty poor, even from Jake Gyllenhaal (as Jack Hall's son Sam) and Dennis Quaid, who actually are good actors, but are given nothing to work with. The script is almost laughable (some people sitting behind me did laugh, actually), with more than its fair share of cheesy moments. Particularly the ending, which almost did make me laugh aloud. The direction is acceptable.But, on the other hand, there are some good points. There are several humorous moments, as well as several genuinely tense and even scary ones. The special effects are extravagant, namely in the scenes of floods overtaking New York City. And of course, the fact that this could (and probably will) happen one day, not to us, but possibly to our grandchildren or even great-grandchildren, is pretty terrifying. Even if it is a little far-fetched.Overall, the bad points outweigh the good ones. A simple rewrite would've done the film a lot of justice. 5/10.</fullReview>

(i.e., Armageddon, Godzilla, Independence Day, etc, ad nauseaum), and really really bad science.&lt;SPOILER ALERT&gt;Just about every trope that the far left holds dear was trotted out for this flick. There's a Veep who looks just like Cheney and he runs everything, including the saavy environmental policy that ends up trashing most of the CONUS, but of course, nobody but a maverick working for NOAA (and 50 million people who've watched the Discovery Channel) could ever have imagined that the Atlantic current would be flooded by fresh water, resulting in a new ice age. Guess he was too busy worrying about that supervolcano in Yellowstone that's gonna blow soon and cover the USofA in 3 meters of ash (followed by the inevitable ice age)!And the Prez (who looks a lot like Dubya) never actually does anything, whenever there's a decision to be made, he looks right at the VP.The cause of the crisis? Why, we didn't sign the Kyoto treaty! Forget that no 1st world country has signed it (and Russia's either just un-signed it or will soon). Jeez, if it wasn't for all the fossil fuel emissions and CO2 in the air, we'd *already* be in an ice age!! Thank global warming for the fact we're not hip deep in snow 9 months of the year.Hail the size of oranges hits Japan--guess the script writers never heard of gravity. Hail *can't* get that big!Our intrepid heroes are struggling to get to NY, they walk on the glassed roof of a mall and one of them falls through. Now, this roof is made of girders covered in glass, so of course when the weight of the guy who's fallen through starts making the glass crack, the other guys grab onto the girder and save him, right? right??! No, even though one of the guys on the roof *has his hand on a girder* it never occurs to him to belay his friend to it. Shades of contrived scene from "Vertical Limit".When the heroes finally reach NY and are looking for people stranded in a library, there's a real Hollywood moment where you don't know if they're still alive in the library. Except that when they find them, they're in a room with a roaring fire. Hello, anyone ever seen a smokeless chimney??? Sheesh! The smoke from that fire should have been visible for miles.Don't waste your money or brain cells, go see something more intelligent and realistic, like Shrek 2.</fullReview>

So what the hell made me think that tonight would be a good night to watch environmental disaster flick The Day After Tomorrow?Well, what better way to hide from the horrors of reality by immersing oneself in a patently fictional disaster, a piece of glossy escapist entertainment (albeit with an important message at its heart) which at least offers a faint glimmer of hope for humanity, and where the spirit of mankind prevails against all odds? Roland Emmerich's film is the perfect antidote to the constant portents of doom and the very depressing images currently playing on my TV: in this big budget Hollywood vision of 'the day after tomorrow', the future may be bleak, but it isn't over for good; and even though the planet may be frozen, the warmth of a father's love for his son can never be extinguished. So, despite all the death and destruction, it's actually a feel-good movie?just what the doctor ordered.Plus, only in a CGI-laden disaster film like this can you see an awesome sight like a tidal wave crashing through the streets of New York before turning into a massive block of ice WITHOUT dying as a result.

By the time the disaster hits most people will be pretty pleased with story so far and the effects during the disaster certainly don't disappoint at all.From here on in the movie falls apart. It quite simply becomes boring to watch and although the acting among the survivors is talented and believable it doesn't stop you thinking there should be more to enjoy. As usual for the genre, some of the science is flawed, and although this is often forgivable, the failure to keep the audience entertained, only makes them think about these flaws all the more.Ultimately 'The Day After Tomorrow' peaks too soon, and rather then build to a climax, it's over way before we are satisfied.6/10 should have been way better</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS I'm guessing that my summary line (sentence above) kind of says what i'm going to say in my comment, though i hope people will sit down and read my opinion anyway..I had actually none anticipations for the film, i only went because my friend loves disaster movies. At first i was pleasantly surprised that the whole plot was about global heating, a subject i've been worrying about for some time now. i think it is nice, no great actually, that someone has tried to tell the world what an important issue global heating really is. something has to draw the publics attention to it as it may pose a risqué on our kin some hundreds of years from now..but no matter how good the though behind the movie was, it could not hide the fact that is was a lousy film..plain and simple.I have hundreds of reasons for why "The day after tomorrow" sucked, but i'm guessing i don't have room to write them all.. first of all, it was a typical American movie..i love America, don't get me wrong, but wasn't it a bit weird that we heard nothing at all from the rest of the world..it was all about how America handled the challenge of a world entering the ice age... we heard nothing from Russia, china or even canada! we saw seconds of images from japan, and a whole damn movie about America!It was a total clish? that the father found the son at last.. but to me it was just stupid! i would never let my father go through such a big risqué that the father character in the movie went through, and it even turned out (surprise surprise) that the son didn't even need his father to come!!!! and the scene about the wolves...PLEASE! how stupid and totally innecessary was that?! OK, so four/five wolves suddenly escape from a zoo or something, find the three guys that was in a boat looking for medicine for a girl who got blood infection from cutting herself on a taxi when she was trying to reach a bag that wasn't even hers, and the guy (sam) decides to lure the wolves away (of course, who wouldn't?..haha, like everyone on earth!) from his friends by jumping trough some window and make the wolves run after him....puh.. i have to catch my breath! that whole scene was not necessary, complicated and not to mention totally fake!And then (surprise surprise again!) sam falls in love during the movie.. who couldn't have guessed that would happen? haha! so we have a disaster movie with love, drama, animals, intrigue and lots of comical moments brought together and blended into one, massive, mess of a movie! The film was totally predictable and it had a lousy title because no one knows what "the day after tomorrow" has to do with global heating. half of the people that have seen it barley know that it was about global heating, and not about a gigantic wave crushing the us!!! it is hysterical really, how newspapers where all over it, and asking scientists about the film etc. etc... my mother who works on things like that had several calls from newspapers asking all sorts of questions..one question was even "is the continental plates going to break" (or something like that)after seeing this train wreck of a movie, nothing has changed..i am so annoyed and sad about the fact that the public remain the same, our society remains like it is, inconsiderate towärds our nature and our world as well as other human beings. i had hoped that this film would open our eyes, and make us realize what we're doing, we're not only destroying our planet, but also dooming our grandchildren or even further away generations to an almost certain death, and a new ice age. i had hoped that "the day after tomorrow" would be stunning. the moment i realized what the plot was, i prayed that it would be a knock out, and would stun people and help them see the situation in a different light..i am disappointed. not only did they manage to make a idiotic movie, they also took away the possibility that someone else will make a new movie about global heating, no one wants to be a copy cat about movies, do they?so there it is, in a short version, why i though of "The day after tomorrow" as a train wreck of a movie, and a disaster made to annoy and sadden me. i think that the plot was excellent, but no matter ow excellent, it can not make up for the fact that THE FILM SUCKED.</fullReview>

I'm angry because I believe Emerich could have written a check for the 125 million it costed, and donate that much to any charity group, or scientific studies against cancer or even against global warming (now that he cares so much). He could have fed thousands of hungry boys around the globe, instead of making a movie that makes us lose 2 hours of our time.Aaaaaand, the movie has no ending. Sorry if I spoil it, but just when life on Earth is about to extinguish, and they say nothing can be done to stop the awful weather behavior, IT STOPS ALL OF A SUDDEN, magically! ES, THERE'S NO ENDING BUT A STUPID HALT TO A STUPID STORY. By the way, I liked the idea of the Americans crossing the border to Mexico in need of shelter, at least it was different and original. But, I think Emerich should have gone check the original river they have to cross, because in the movie, people is walking through it, even carrying their suitcases on their heads, perfectly normal and easy, but IN REAL LIFE, people dies cause of the currents and depth of the river in the Border, and of course it is impossible to carry suitcases with you. So then again, an original idea, gone bad. Take an advice and don't watch it'please. See the trailer for the 3 good efects (you can see them there and avoid the torture of the movie)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>wasn't worth the admission price</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starts off OK, but after about an hour or so the movie just gets very boring and very predictable. To sum it up, go see it if you like mindless entertainment and nice special effects, but not if your looking for a plot. The dialogue is definitely the worst I've heard in a long time. All the parts that were meant to be funny were horribly unfunny, while I was laughing during all the "serious" parts because they were all so...cliché. I could also point out a dozen plot holes off the top of my head, which I'd be willing to let slide if some of them weren't so ridiculous. Not to mention the little side story with the cancer kid that was so lame it almost ruined the movie by itself...4.5/10 for special effects, fails in every other aspect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Day After Tomorrow (No Stars)Ahem, no. This film is bad. This film is very, very bad. What makes it so bad? Oh, where to begin? It started with a character saying "Shouldn't you be checking the weather or something?" while making out with a weather station operator. I figured, 'okay, I'm in for a stupid movie. Maybe I can enjoy it if I just shut my brain off.' Didn't work. This is one of the most idiotic, convoluted messes I have ever had the misfortune of seeing. One of the film's many opening scenes (it has to introduce every flat, flawless character involved, natch) has the impassioned scientist (played by Dennis Quaid, natch) giving his hard pressed speech to the stern, enviornment hating Vice President, who just happens to look like Dick Cheney's mongoloid twin brother. He doesn't care about the scientist's concerns, and leaves the world set on self destruct mode. Can you blame him though? Even I wouldn't buy that, and I hate Republicans. Naturally, because mean old Mr. Cheney wouldn't listen, the world decides it's time to make him suffer, and goes ape on L.A. After this little incident, the government still doesn't care about Mr. Quiad's doomsday foray. Cause he just has to be so different to make an action movie work. Which brings me to my real complaint. EVERY CHARACTER IS DUMB AS A CHICKEN! How the hell could I believe these people are capable of tying their own shoes, let alone being the only people in Manhattan capable of surviving a second ice age? When a movie makes you feel nothing for the characters, the movie has failed. When the movie has you cheering for them all to die, there is something seriously wrong with it. I wanted them all to die violently. This film evokes all the emotions it isn't going for. Its eight or nine attempts at jokes fall flat every time. The blatant 'Look at me, I'm being funny!' level humor is not only pointless; it's also a little insulting to audiences. The films tongue-in-cheek product placements were obnoxious at times, and downright ridiculous at others. Fox News, The Weather Channel and Wendy's were the most insulting bits; though I did laugh when a Fox Newscaster gets smacked with flying debris. If only that was the reaction they were going for. This wouldn't be the last time a laugh at what is suppose to be a tense moment. There is a scene, in which three characters are looting a ship and are attacked by timber wolves escaped from animal cages. I'm going to repeat that. This movie about surviving a natural disaster... has a scene... in which characters are chased through a ship... by escaped timber wolves. If it takes you more than five seconds to comprehend how idiotic that is, then this movie may be for you. Not only was the scene awful, the CGI wolves looked so horrible that I couldn't stop laughing throughout the entire scene. The production as a whole was, without a doubt, one of the worst action sequences I have ever seen. Avoid this film for the infected hemorrhoid that it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nevermind the political debate supposedly swirling about this film's treatment of greenhouse gases and their rather deleterious effect on our environment, it's a non-issue. Ultimately, this is just another Roland Emmerich film. Boring characters played by good actors are subjected to various catastrophes realized by marvelous special effects. The real question is, after three movies depicting its ruin, why does Roland Emmerich hate New York? And don't miss the film's bizarre glorification of book-burning; as the film's characters are huddled in the ice-bound Public Library and can't find anything else to build a fire with. -- Because there's certainly no wood in a library. Don't bother. Rent the DVD when you can skip from chapter to chapter.</fullReview>

Now think of all the money wasted in making this steaming pile..The guy was probably thinking "Hey I got an idea! Lets make a 2 hr sequence of the Earth getting destroyed by weather and pass it off as a movie". There is a 5 minute although ridiculous sub plot, which will unfortunately not remove your headache. This junk was overly hyped and great special effects were expected. Yet in the very first scene, you can easily make out that the orangy panoromic sky background is fake. It looks as if a 2 year filled in color and they wrapped it around the set to make a sky! You can make that out through fake depth that you usually see in older video games for sky.You keep waiting and waiting and waiting for a story but when the movie finally ends, only then do you realise that there absolutely was none. Nothing. Zilch. The weather comes, does its thing and goes. This movie is certainly one of the worst I've ever seen and even fails in special effects for which it was exclusively made. Some movies are a timepass but this one will just give you a headache.Do not see this movie.</fullReview>

So, to the extent it raises awareness that there is an issue, it warrants the one point I have allocated to it.Unfortunately, this film adds nothing to intelligent discussion of the issues. Rather, it does for meteorology and climatology what Jurassic Park did for biology and palaeontology.If we then add the clichéd story line, the ham acting, and the mawkish and utterly irrelevant 'human interest' to the pseudo-scientific stupidity, the other nine points disappear like Los Angeles in a tornado.

		<fullReview>Not that we might face another ice age at some time, but that this truly awful film could take so much at the box office.I knew this was a disaster movie before I saw it and so did not expect too much. Disaster movies are more about shock/thrill factor than anything else, but most of them in the past have been, at least somewhat, believable. What I did not expect was to watch a film where everything but special effects was dis-regarded. It would appear that the old saying about what makes a good movie has changed. Instead of script, script and script.. It is now special effects, special effects and CGI.And it gets worse..Even when the movie is not using special effects and relies on the plot or characters to make a point it fails miserably through lack of thought and plausibility. The best example of this (and only one of many implausible plot points) is the book burning scene(s). Forget if you will, for a moment, the philosophical issues and think about the practical issues involved:We need to keep warm : OK let's find something to burn in the fire : Hey look! Loads of books, they should burn well.Ahem, look around you.What are books stored on? Yes, that's right, bookshelves : What are bookshelves made of? Very good, you're getting the idea now. Now the final question, and this is the real tester: What burns longer, better and gives off more heat, paper or wood? And while you are trying to resolve that little problem in your head, look around you. What do you see? A library that is full of tables and chairs. The walls are panelled with what?Our forlorn heroes could not work this out. And we were told earlier in the movie that one of these heroes is so intelligent that he is smarter than the teacher that had the audacity to flunk him. The same high IQ possessing hero that had the intelligence to chat on the phone while he stood in a rising flood of icy cold water that was to be his doom in seconds flat.Oh well, enough said. This film is really awful, but it will probably win the gong for best special effects. Mission accomplished.God help us all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's the end of the world as we know it, and I feel fine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this laughable attempt at a global disaster movie, Dennis Quaid plays Jack Hall, a government paleoclimatologist researching the cause of the previous Ice Age in Antarctica when the entire Larsen B ice shelf decides to take a walk. He warns the United Nations that global warming is causing the icecaps to melt, which will ultimately result in a massive disruption of the Northern Hemisphere's moderate climate and a new Ice Age. Asked when this will occur, he opines, "Maybe a hundred years, maybe a thousand." Turns out he was about a hundred years off: the next day, the British Isles are at the centre of a massive storm system drawing supercooled air from the upper atmosphere, and all the Brits are Individually Quick Frozen. On the other side of the world, massive tornadoes unexpectedly destroy Los Angeles.Meanwhile, Hall's son Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) and two friends are in New York City for an academic competition where, unbeknownst to them since the geniuses don't turn on the news, the next superstorm is forming right above their heads. A massive tidal wave strands them in the public library. After the newly formed Lake Manhattan freezes over, the majority of the library refugees decide to take their chances outside. Sam, his classmates, and about half a dozen others take shelter in a reading room and burn the books to keep warm, resulting in a pointless argument about censorship. (They couldn't have just burned Danielle Steel instead of Nietzsche? Better yet, how about the wooden furniture?) In the meantime, back in Washington, Hall learns that Sam is still alive in the Big Apsicle and, drawing on his experience in arctic climates, mounts an expedition with his two co-workers to rescue him.To call the science in The Day After Tomorrow "implausible" would be an understatement. Willful suspension of disbelief is simply impossible. Apparently Emmerich, wanting to sound a warning about the dangers of global warning, was aware that superstorms simply could not form in such a short time, yet decided to accelerate the action anyway for entertainment value. Put another way, he tried to make a serious point with a deliberately stupid plot. (Good plan.)Meanwhile, the human story is equally wretched, with the characters one-dimensional and the situations manipulative. Hall's wife, a doctor, elects to stay behind after everyone else at her hospital evacuates, so she can take care of the cute little bald boy with leukemia whose parents are missing. (Feel that tugging in your chest? It's Emmerich pulling on your heartstrings.) While walking to New York in a blizzard, tied together for safety, one of Hall's buddies falls through the skylight of a buried shopping mall. He cuts the rope, plummeting to his death, to save the others. ("Nooooooo!!!!")On the other hand, the CGI (supplied by major effects houses such as ILM, Dream Quest, and Digital Domain, amongst others) is breathtaking for the most part, except for some rather obvious CG wolves.When you see "Written by Roland Emmerich" and "Suggested by the book The Coming Global Superstorm by Art Bell and Whitley Streiber" in the credits, you know you're not going to see a Nova documentary. Art Bell never saw a bit of crank science he didn't like. Once upon a time Emmerich wrote a wonderful movie called Stargate, but since then his screen writing talent has devolved into movies that are long on eye candy and short on intelligence, such as Independence Day and Godzilla. Emmerich appears to be in competition with Michael Bay (Armageddon, Pearl Harbor) to see who can produce the loudest, stupidest blockbuster before he dies. Thanks to The Day After Tomorrow, Emmerich takes a solid lead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has got to be the most lame disaster movie in a decade. The premise of global-warming-leads-to-new-ice-age is ridiculous. And even the actors in the movie respond as if they are just going through the motions of reading lame dialog. It's almost bad enough to be considered a spoof of disaster movies. The only thing worth watching in this film are some of the special effects. The drastic change in weather and tide, shall we say, in NYC is pretty interestingly portrayed. But the results of those same phenoms are unbelievable even in the context of the movie. Does anyone -- even the director -- believe that the Statue of Liberty would still be standing after that? It's insulting to the audience and it pulls the rug out from the rest of the movie. Nothing else has any credibility after that -- even when trying to suspend reality for the sake of enjoying the movie. So the whole movie is lame, lame, lame. And so far as this movie being a "statement" about the danger of global warming, it does more to highlight the absurdity of that argument than the opposition could ever achieve.</fullReview>

And as for that modest rise in sea levels they're predicting, lets make it a colossal tidal wave slamming into New York.Looking good! So what else do we need? Hey, how about a new ice age. One that descends right across the northern hemisphere in about five minutes flat. And how about vast super-storms that freeze people solid in a couple of seconds! And huge tornadoes smashing up LA! Looking real good!Now, I guess we need a few characters, and some sort of a script, don't you think? Hey, do we still have those chimps on contract? You know the ones with the typewriters. Yeah, give them an infinite amount of time and they'll type out the complete works of Shakespeare, or something like that.No, we don't have an infinite amount of time. Just go with their first draft.

		<fullReview>I've been too tired at night lately to watch anything except action flicks. So I got this one after seeing some pretty cool special effects on the preview.If your enjoyment of a movie is derived solely on special effects, this one is pretty good. Every other facet of the production is lacking. The acting is amateur and melodramatic, the plot (if you can call it that) is choppy, and the theme seems entirely centered around environmentalist politics. The politics are especially nauseating. The opening scene depicts the fracture of an ice shelf (a common environmentalist sermon). The movie goes on to present the typical global warming doomsday scenario, except that the doomsday results are squished into a period of days rather than thousands of years. The focal point of the film becomes three "super hurricanes" that form over land and suck down huge amounts of lethally cold air from very high in the atmosphere. The final scene of the movie involves an astronaut on the space station remarking how clean the air has become, implying that "mother nature" healed herself through the power of these storms. Pleeeeease... Give me a break!I've seen lots liberal agendas advanced in Hollywood, but this is the most blatant I've ever come across.Get a life, Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where do I start? I could write several pages of continuity errors, insanities, stupidities, inaccuracies and basic logic failures, but a review should never strive to be as boring as its subject matter. Let's cut to the chase. I can not recommend this film. If you've read any of my reviews of poor films, you may remember that I reserve the rating of 1 for big-ticket Hollywood films that do more harm than good. Although I have fairly rated DAT with a 3, I should mention that it very nearly got a 1.Why can't I recommend this? 1. Great deal of scientific misinformation. (I teach geology at a university, I am not making this up) 2.Lacklustre screenplay showcasing special effects and a poorly developed family drama motif.3. Not very interesting characters. Nothing wrong with the performances. Quaid is particularly good, but Jake G is terribly miscast. Characters are clichés - Quaid is a martyr good guy scientist/overworked dad who is on the verge of losing his family. Gylenhaal is a gifted lovesick nerd who outsmarts his teachers. Sela Ward is the not-very understanding but well intentioned mom. Ken Welsh is an idiotic conservative politician who doesn't seem to be able to distinguish science from political debate.4. Absurd general premise (one day special delivery Heisenburg event) coupled with cliché characters (above) and under-developed emotional reactions.You don't even need to see the trailers to know what to expect from this movie. Quaid plays a scientist who is desperately trying to get the USA's political machine to understand global warming one week, and a father trying to rescue his son and a handful of survivors from a megastorm which is ushering in the destruction of the developed world in the Northern Hemisphere in the next week. Though Quaid is convincing, the rest of the cast joins the special effects in failing to make this believable. Not their fault. Nothing could be done! I am a sci fi fan and have no objection to fantasy. What I have problems with is science fantasy that pretends its something else. People are already terribly under-educated with the real practical and globally important issues that science contends with. We don't need Hollywood confusing matters even more. Blaming this mess on Roland Emmerich seems a bit over-simplified. He does some interesting stuff with cinematography and story telling (The Patriot), even in this film. I am not really sure where this film derailed for me. But with the elements discussed above, it's hard to imagine it doing otherwise.The film sports some pretty interesting special effects. If you're seeing it to watch New York get partially glaciated and to watch Dennis Quaid give a passable performance, then you have an excuse. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of or the worst movie I've ever seen. I just can't see if there's something about this film, that's worth the 2 hours...As much as I can see this is nothing more than 21st century propaganda. It uses the idea of us (humanity) destroying our own world. It uses the Theory about the global warming, which makes the movie in the eyes of the dump viewer a BLOCKBUSTER! It may be so, but this doesn't mean, that the acting is bad, the script is bad and, of course, the scenario is bad.As usual all the action is in... what do you know... THE UNITED STATES OF America! It starts with the stupid cliché of a scientist warning the nations of the world about an upcoming global disaster, and no one believes him, except for one guy. Then comes the holocaust of course, and the movie makes the idea of "USA, the only nation to survive the apocalypse".The same way the movie goes on and on, whit more clichés, and finally - the end!But a part from all of that, it seems that no one took the liberty of checking if some of the things in the movie are possible... Like the new helicopters, that the TV companies have, that can fly in meters of a tornado, which even military choppers can't do. Or the "Black hawks" that crashed, which can fly in weather, in which I doubt that even airplanes can. They really crashed, but not because of the strong wings, but because of the low temperature. And one other thing really interested me - a tent, that looks like a normal tent for camping, but in reality is stronger and better isolated than a building made of bricks. And let's not forget - peaces of paper burn better than massive wood!I can talk about idiotic stuff like that for hours, but this isn't the point! The point is that this is a very crappy movie, and it doesn't worth watching it, unless there is ABSOLUTELY nothing better to do in the meantime (like my case).But still, what did we learn from this movie? - If there's an apocalypse and you're not American - you're dead!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie and was speechless. Cliché and one-dimensional characters pop in and out of their scenes in this disconnected mess. It's as if the director/writer made the movie by deciding to paste together every cliché from disaster and action movies ... and then thought that by pasting these things together everything would be OK. Things happen to people but, because no character and relationship development has occurred, you not only don't care but you wonder if your brain zoned out and missed entire pieces of the story.There are so many worn-out characters, borrowed from so many formula movies. We have the smart scientist in the antarctic who gives the standard selfless and 'save mankind' speech. There's the main scientist guy who tries to warn the politicians and, of course, has not paid attention to his son and the disaster now proves his mettle. We have the standard low-caste society guy (homeless dude) who teaches people when the disaster comes (and the standard message that we can find out what's really important and how equal we are when normal society structure is uprooted). There's the policeman who recites these horribly canned lines and takes the authority, etc. etc.Now, I can take cliché. I can even take canned lines. But in each of these characters, there's almost no development - the father ludicrously decides to trek to his son who's in NYC ... and what should be a moving moment because of the father's failures in the past becomes nothing because the failures and introspection of the father hasn't occurred. Scene after scene occurs like this -- the director wants to have these emotionally-charged scenes where you're affected but, because there's no foundation, you don't care.And ... if the tired clichés weren't enough, we get illogic at every step. I can go with a movie and accept things that even bend reality but once the movie asks you to go with it, it also then play within the physical rules. The cold acting as if it were the blob in form of ice chasing them was ridiculous. The bureaucracy thing w/ the scientist trying to get the message out was so silly that I kept shaking my head. The dialog of some of the characters during the disaster made me realize that the writer wanted to get things across but failed to realize that it wasn't in sync with the context.I'll stop here. A horrible waste of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Special effects 50 million, script 50 cents</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>50 cents being the going rate for 11 year old script writers in Hollywood.I'll have to come clean and say that I was gripped. Mainly because a climate change such as this doesn't seem impossible somehow. However, the total is ruined (yet again) by a terrible plot that makes no sense. Now sometimes you can over look certain incongruities. But when the entire film structure depends on them - you can't see around them I afraid.SPOILERS Yet again we have the rather hackneyed contrasting parallel story lines - the one following the son 'staying put', and the other 'the father on rescue mission'. But putting the banality of this structure aside for one moment - we are led to believe that the father is rather bright. He's the only one to spot what's going on. He knows the storm will last 6 or 7 days - and he knows that to be caught outside is certain death. He tells his son to stay put and inside. Then what does he do? He sets off against the traffic while the storm rages. Duh?! He ends up killing his longtime partner, injuring another - and arrives a little before the helicopters - which if he'd waited back down south - he could have caught a ride with in the first place.What did he hope to accomplish by making this futile journey? What help would he be when he got there? Either the son was OK - or he wasn't - the eye of the storm didn't last that long remember. It's dumb dumb, dumb. Yes - okay it's a plot mechanism. But these still need to be rational. They need to make sense in the context of the characters as they are told to us.All that money on effects - and none on substance. Just once - you'd like them to invest in both.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hollywood keeps recycling its old, semi-forgotten titles--and when the beleaguered producers run out of those, they simply recycle the clichés therein. This doomsday thriller seems patched together with scenes from old Irwin Allen movies (although, granted, it's better than several of Allen's hackneyed yarns). The special effects are the star as the Northern hemisphere is headed for a new Ice Age; that doesn't seem to really bother scientist Dennis Quaid, who just wants to find his son (a resourceful lad who manages to find a working pay-phone in New York City's downtown library). The director is a hack who sets up the same momentum in every lazy circumstance: panic situation, near-peril, rescue, reward. It may keep kids satisfied, but those of us over 30 have seen it all before. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My stone-cold opinion...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We all know about Roland Emmerich's uncontrollable desire to destroy the world ? New York in particular ? by now. After unleashing Roswell'47 aliens (Independence Day) and a giant Japanese salamander (Godzilla) upon NY, Emmerich now finds inspiration in the global warming problems. What if ? a sudden new Ice Age presented itself? The basic premise of `The Day after Tomorrow' is much more logical and realistic than Emmerich's previous films, thus therefore the whole disaster takes place in a period of only a week! So far so good? I mean, you can't judge a film negatively because it's far fetched. The whole thing may be scientifically unjustified, but it has to remain a little appealing to the audience, no? The dreadfulness of this film lies in the same old, disastrous clichés that keep on getting repeated over and over again. The characters couldn't be more stereotypical and the oppressed sentiment is so fake you'll feel the urge to vomit. Dennis Quaid is the dedicated workaholic who got estranged from his wife and son, but in times of need, he walks thousand of miles through snow in order to save to save his boy. And do you think he'll make it??? It gets worse? The quiet, introvert boy heroically saves his girl while the boisterous older colleague sacrifices his own life by cutting the rope. And that poor, poor little cancer patient?Do you think they'll be just in time to save him??? If that isn't exaggerated and fake enough, the film ends with a giant moralistic and ethical speech by the brand new President of the U.S of A. Granted, The Day after Tomorrow stuns quite a few times with amazingly impressive bad-weather effects. The professionalism of the special effects department would have been terrific if it weren't for the computer engineered wolves. They look so primitive they belong in a Stephen Sommers movie, actually. The last (positive) comment goes out to young actress Emmy Rossum. She's a beautiful teen actress who obviously has the required talent in her. I hope to see her starring in many (better) films after this. She's much better than most other cast-members, including Dennis Quaid who merely looks like a cheap Harrison Ford clone here. Jake Gyllenhaal ? apparently still able to play a 17-year-old adolescent ? isn't bad, but modest and intelligent films like his Donnie Darko deserve my respect a lot more than this. If you have nothing better to do with your time (when it's freezing outside or something), The Day after Tomorrow is a fair time-waster. Otherwise, it should just be skipped.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is easily the worst movie I have ever seen. Up until last night, "Dude Where's My Car" held the number one position, but then I viewed the sneak peek of "The Day After Tomorrow" and I have to hand the title over. This movie lacked so much I don't even know where to begin. The dialog alone was enough to make me scream. I feel that this movie insulted my intelligence, and I am sorry that I wasted two hours of my life on it. I want that time back. The only redeeming quality was when Jake Gyllenhaal took his clothes off. Even that lovely sight was not enough to make this a "good" or even "decent" movie. I was in agonizing pain through the whole movie because of how bad it was. It literally sucked all of the energy out of my body, and I felt the need to apologize to the friends that I brought with me. There were several points where we almost stood up and walked out.I wish we had. Because we would not have missed a single good thing. The plot line was weak, dialog awful, special effects dismal, and has been completely over-hyped by the people who made it. I give this movie the award of Crapfest 2004.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I ever get a job as a screen writing guru I shall tell my students that under no circumstances should they write an environmental thriller . Films with a message that we're destroying the planet do not make good cinematic ventures . NO BLADE OF GRASS is annoyingly sententious but is still compelling due to John Christopher's source novel . SOYLENT GREEN is poignant but much of that's down to it being Edward G Robinson's last movie . Do I need to mention Steven Segall and his pathetic attempts to entertain while educating us and failing at both ? I don't think I do The problem with THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW is that its trying to do two things at once . Both entertain the audience and get them to think about global environmental disaster . One can't help thinking that if there wasn't so much debate about climate change then the producers would have made a much simpler movie . Unfortunately by taking the film so seriously a critical audience are able to recognise the scientific implausibilities along with the stupidity of the characters . Of course there's little wrong with having stupid characters in films because many genres like horror rely on this to further plots , but even so you can't help noticing a lack of internal logic Another problem is that the film does feel a bit too epic in its scope . We're shown events happening in The South Pole , India , North America and Scotland . Personally I would have preferred a much more intimate film with less locations and characters . This is the strength of the 1970s disaster movie where the characters are drawn up early in to the film so the audience can clearly cheer the hero whilst booing the villain I rated THE DAY AFTER Tomorrow six out of ten which means I didn't think it was a bad film . But I'm sad to say this could have been a much better one if the producers had focused the story more while making things a little less serious</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When The States Freeze Over</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is perhaps one of the most unintentionally funny, illogical, ridiculous, pretentious and trashiest piece of crap to emerge as a Hollywood blockbuster. 'The Day After Tomorrow' pretends to be the ultimate disaster movie but instead ends up being one of the ultimate disastrous movies. Roland Emmerich seems to have stolen an elementary schoolkid's story that he had to present as homework. The plot and characters are terribly clichéd. His direction is pretty amateurish and obviously people would go and watch it for the special effects (which aren't so bad). Of course there are some hilarious sequences, such as the state forgiving Mexico's debt in exchange that they allow American refugees to seek refuge. Poor Europe (America's current rival) is already under ice and Asia (America's current 'enemy') and Africa (whom America does not give a damn about) too experiences the same fate. The performances are equally bad. Dennis Quaid, Jake Gyllenhaal, Emmy Rossum and the rest of the cast act as though they are playing with little children. Sela Ward is the only one who gives a suitably restrained performance (as long as she's not crying on screen). Basically, this is just another one of those films that shows how America equals the world and it's all that matters and that needs saving. Forget the rest of the world. So okay, it's just a movie but it only entertained me at the cost of being a hypocritical piece of garbage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, this is the sort of garbage you get to sit through when you go to visit your parents for Christmas and they rent a movie, coming home with something that was recommended to them by the video store clerk. "It has a lot of special effects" being the precise quote.First off, it's an utterly run of the mill disaster flick. Every cliché known to modern man is piled on here. The main actor walks 40 miles through the blizzard of the century to save his kid, in a couple of days. His wife is a doctor who is willing to face certain death, just so she can be there with her little cancer patient. His son is so brilliant that his calculus teacher flunked him for excessive brilliance (It's more than a bit obvious that the people who wrote this never made it past 7th grade math). In the end, guess what? All the main characters survive. After causing the death of his buddies by making them go on this ludicrous trek, dad arrives to save his son, who doesn't need saving at all. They hug and dad announces that they'll spend more time together, you know, playing catch and stuff. Mom successfully finds an ambulance to drive hundreds of miles through 15 foot deep snow, and her little cancer patient survives, opening his eyes as the happy theme music swells in the background. For the love of god, this thing just sucks. There are enough subplots to fill an extra large chamber pot, all of them sappy and idiotic and totally unbelievable.The special effects are pretty lousy as well. Although the scene of New York getting hit with a massive tsunami looks okay in spots, it looks pretty bad in other spots. Most of the other special effects just scream COMPUTER GENERATED EFFECTS!!! There's even a pack of wolves running around that are obviously CGI.As far as the science behind this "very serious" global warming propaganda piece from your left-wing liberal folks in Hollywood, well, there's really no sarcastic put-down that even comes close to summing up the idiocy of it all. As someone else said, it's like the aliens from Independence Day came back, this time armed with a big freeze ray. It makes one wonder - if the people who are running around yelling "the sky is falling" are really this utterly imbecilic when it comes to science, well, my god, why are we listening to this tripe?I would recommend this movie only to people who say things like "I loved the new Star Wars trilogy. Jar Jar Binks was my favorite character!".</fullReview>

His direction is undirected, the actors say the lines but without believable passion. The dialogue is lame and reminiscent of those banal disaster films of the seventies, although the effects in this are excellent. The film is plodding, dialogue is boring and one cliché scene after another with out any of the humour that made Independence Day, formula film that it was, fun and entertaining. Dennis Quaid is uninspired and not believable at all. He just was collecting a pay check. Day After Tomorrow is a big bore, a typical Hollywood piece of big budget junk. The only people that need to see this film are those who are totally into special effects more than anything else such as plot, storyline, good directing and believable acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some great destruction scenes but not much else</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Day After Tomorrow is entertaining during the first half of the film but by the second half of the movie it starts to drag. Global warming and the greenhouse effect have devastating effects on the earth when a series of hurricanes, tornadoes and tidal waves kick off a second Ice Age. Professor Adrian Hall (Quaid), a leading scientist studying weather patterns, must try to save the world as well as find his son (Gyllenhaal) who was in New York City when it was struck by the sudden weather catastrophe. This type of movie has three factors that it needs to have if it wants a wider audience. First, Are the destruction scenes thrilling? Judging by the trailer alone you can see that they are. Second, Is the science sound? In this case it isn't as global warming is a big issue and making a joke out of it will upset some people and turn them away. And third is the dialog good or will you laugh out at some of the scenes? Well there are some unintentional funny moments when they are trying to be serious but it sounds too stupid and its hard to take seriously. If you want the last two factors in this film then I recommend you don't watch it, however if the destruction scenes are good enough for you then its worth it. Roland Emmerich has a good eye for destruction and he makes this movie very action packed but left out everything else. The cast is good for the most part with the best being Dennis Quaid who really made up for The Alamo and does a good job in his role. Jake Gyllenhaal was good and I am kind of surprised he isn't more popular in Hollywood since he is a very good actor. Emmy Rossum, Sela Ward and Ian Holm all play their roles fine and try their best with a unrealistic plot. The first half of the movie is great with tons of action and with a lot of great scenes like the tornadoes in LA, though I think they should have destroyed another city. The second half starts getting boring and there's not much action also it has a very cheesy ending. Rating 6/10 it was a decent destruction flick and it was very entertaining in the beginning but loses steam by the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Day After Tomorrow was one of the best "disaster" movies I have seen. The special effects were so realistic, you really felt you were there. The movie kept me on the edge of my seat. What you see in the promos is only the tip of the iceberg, no pun intended. Dennis Quaid was just perfect as Jack Hall. You could really believe he was a paleoclimatologist, as well as a devoted father. Dennis' acting is so natural, he makes it look easy. Jake Gyllenhaal was perfect as his son, showing the typical emotions of a teenager, unsure of himself at first and then starting to take control of the situation, proving to be as capable as his father. Emmy Rossum was very credible as Jake's girlfriend and Sela Ward was just right as Jake's mom. Ian Holm was the elderly Scottish scientist, keeping a stiff upper lip while the weather was going haywire. This is a must see movie if you are a fan of "disaster" movies like Twister and Earthquake. I will probably see this movie again in the theaters because it was so enjoyable. It is a great way to spend 2 + hours.</fullReview>

So forget the millions he might of saved on the way. Loads of Places are destroyed, yet only America is seen getting destroyed. Yawn. The acting is ok and there are a few moments of humour, this to me was Twister meets Deep Impact meets The Poseidon Adventure meets Godzilla and the last 10 minutes of On Deadly Ground where Steven Seagal gave a lecture on global warming, only this lecture lasts half of the movie. I do not go to a summer blockbuster for a lecture, or to have better movies ripped off. Disaster movies need all star cast's with suspense and characters in real peril. The young guy Jake seemed too interested in being a moody Peter Parker. Dennis Quaid is just a poor man's Harrison Ford. This is so boring and dull that i suspect the big opening it will no doubt receive, will then be blasted away by the other summer blockbusters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Roland Emmerich must truly hate New York City (and consequently, the United States). He has this thing for lovingly conveying destruction on a massive scale and setting it in the City that Never Sleeps, although his appreciation for the country that made him a household name extends to Hollywood as a tornado rips through its name and tears through the streets of L.A. This is his third time on the merry-go-round, though, and hopefully it will be his last. But I get the impression he sees himself as this Merlineque wizard, holding a wand outstretched, willing some elaborate way to get rid of New York City, and then when all would be done, outstretch his hands to the skies, reform the city, only to destroy it again. Why? Probably some perverse need to trample over Capitalism? Oh, who knows -- and who cares. Two to three years from now he'll concoct another pile of dreck from his cauldron, feed it to a dumbed-down America who will eat it as if it were McDonald's, make millions, and repeat the cycle.Am I going to review this movie, you would say? Well -- I just did. Because there really is nothing else to say about something so completely and unabashedly bad. Except that I didn't watch this over dinner, else I would have lost my appetite.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Do you like a good old-fashioned action-packed Summer movie with a good story and scientific accuracy? Welp, you best keep on looking because you won't find those ingredients in "The Day After Tomorrow."This is one of those movies where the entertainment value is in how much you can make fun of it. And believe me, Stephanie, Mr. Shade, and I poked fun at the movie for the entire two hours. What else can you do with a movie this ridiculous? I'll admit the special effects are really good. The problem is that they're used up in the first half of the movie. I was expecting a full 2 hours of action and chaos, but they got all that out of the way and the rest of the movie focuses on the characters and their attempts to survive.How cheesy is this movie? Let me count the ways...1) Gyllenhaal supposedly fails his math class because on his final exam he only wrote the answers. He did all the work in his head, you see. That's just how much of a genius he is. So he and Quaid determine the teacher just failed him because he's jealous. Um, when I was in school I had to show my work. Sorry to be the bad guy here, but it's easy to see why the teacher might be suspicious. But this is a final exam, so wouldn't this issue have been addressed earlier? Sigh. I thought for sure later in the movie Gyllenhaal was gonna save the world but he was gonna figure it out in his head so the movie wouldn't have to explain to us how he did it. Thankfully, the movie didn't get quite that extreme.2) This movie leads us to believe that a tornado warning cannot be issued until turning on the news and checking the weather report.3) You gotta love the overdramatic delivery of dialogue: "Looks like a hurricane." *dramatic pause* "Only hurricanes DON'T FORM OVER LAND!"4) The temperature supposedly starts to drop 10 degrees per minute. Riiiiiiiight. So within an hour the temperature would be 600 degrees below zero? And as the temperature starts dropping, we see everything freezing. Particularly ridiculous is when Gyllenhaal and his buddies are in a library and we see the floor freezing and chasing after them. They manage to jump in a room and close the door JUST IN TIME! For some reason the door magically shields them from the cold. Whatever.5) Quaid and his friends are able to survive walking in sub-zero temperatures with little more than parkas and gloves. And they have these tents that apparently have magical warming powers because once in the tents they're able to take off their gloves and hats and not be cold at all!I could go on, but I think you get it. Ohhh, and what was the point of Quaid walking all the way from D.C. to New York just to find his son? He knew his son was holed up in the library, and he didn't show up with a rescue squad or anything to take him home. Oh yeah, he made a promise. Mr. Shade leaned over to me and said, "If I ever promise you that I'll meet you at the movie theater and the whole world freezes over, then don't expect me to be there." Fair enough. It was obviously supposed to add an emotional element to the story, but it did nothing for me. Quaid should've just waited and taken a helicopter to New York after the storm died down. It would've been better than risking his and his partners' lives.I could write a thesis on the absurdity of the science used in the movie, but I won't bore you. There are plenty of articles by climatologists you can read that state how the events in the movie are impossible, especially a glaciation of this magnitude occurring in three days and catching the ENTIRE WORLD by surprise. Folks, Memphis weathermen interrupt my regularly scheduled programming whenever a drop of rain is registered, so you better believe they'd be on top of this.Let me just add that this movie is based on the book, "The Coming Global Superstorm" by Art Bell and Whitley Strieber. Strieber wrote another book called "Communion," in which he claims he was told of the Earth's upcoming apocalypse by aliens. If that's who you wanna get your science from then go ahead. I hope you'll excuse me while I point and laugh at you.I feel sorry for fringe groups who are actually using this movie to tout their political agenda. Saying this is a movie people should watch to prepare for a possible global warming catastrophe is about as legitimate as saying people should watch "Dawn of the Dead" to prepare for what would happen if zombies attacked. I'd say they're on equal ground in regard to scientific accuracy. But I doubt too many moviegoers are gonna take this seriously.There's so much more to make fun of, but I'm gonna stop myself. I was extremely disappointed in the movie, so there's a good chance you will be also. This is the type of movie that shows a weatherman get hit by a huge billboard during the middle of the storm, and the only emotion it prompts is laughter. You've been warned."The Day After Tomorrow" is the kind of movie that might have scared me when I was 6 years old and uneducated. Now I can't help but laugh at the absurdity of it all. But hey, if you like movies with overwrought dialogue, a lame attempt at a love story, a severe lack of tension, no emotional pull (other than laughter), less believability than "Independence Day," and one of the most anticlimactic endings I've ever seen in a Summer blockbuster, then this is the movie for you.Now if y'all will excuse me, I'm gonna head to the bathroom and take a Day After Tomorrow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is most likely Emmerich's best film so far. The plot and science may be a bit "off" but that doesn't take away from the fact that it's an enjoyable film. Disaster films aren't Pulp Fiction or The Godfather, in fact every disaster movie ever created is never rated high.Jake Gyllenhall gives a great performance as does Dennis Quaid. It is always important to have strong Actors to tackle on serious drama films. I doubt this film would've been enjoyable with Zac Efron and Jim Carey as the son/ father duo. Jake is now a true power house of an Actor, and Dennis has been for a while. The rest of the ensemble does a fantastic job as well. The story is by far the weakest link in the movie. While i'm not referring to the whole global warming, i'm actually talking about the decisions that the Characters have to make in the film and the consequences that follows. The Science too, but that can be forgiven with the all time favorite three words "Suspense of disbelief"The CGI in the film was great. Arguable better then most films that had a bigger budget that were released the same year or later, The whole disasters were pretty cool. the atmosphere that the film builds does put you on edge and you do feel part of the story,which is awesome. Like i said before, this is an enjoyable film, with great cast and great CGI with the only few downsides being some story plot holes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, yes, it's implausible, and sentimental at times, but this is a heck of an exciting movie. From the very first scene its momentum is so strong that even though I know exactly what is coming, there are at least half a dozen points when I marvel at the way Emmerich delivers the thrills. Los Angeles destroyed by a tornado, the crashing helicopters, the wave hitting New York, the wolves on the ship, the fall into the galleria, the sudden plunge in temperature. For edge of the seat excitement this movie is up there with Terminator and Aliens. I am surprised by the hostility of many reviews, especially those implying that it's dumbed down. Actually the script is intelligent and at times funny, and the relationships are touching. But it's the sheer visceral drive that continues to impress most.

The first hour shows us a concentrated version of climate change, not next century, not next decade, but... next week! First there is huge hail stones, then a tornado that destroys the "Hollywood" sign in LA, then a flood that swamps New York, and finally, a dramatic fall in temperature that will turn the earth into another ice age.How can we possibly survive? Most, it seems, don't. Some clear off to Mexico, gosh, won't that be fun? There are distracting sub-plots which don't really add anything to the story, teenagers, a street hobo with a mutt. And minor characters whose role and identity are not clear.Apart from Quaid in the main role, the others are quite ordinary and none of them get really great lines to say. How many times does someone say "Are you alright?" Too many times, and then Doctor Lucy changes it to "Are you OK today?" The DVD has "Bonus Features". I was hoping they might tell me a bit about how they did the special effects. Alas, it's just guys burbling away about nothing in particular. I suppose getting the Russian ship to drift up 5th Ave is easy enough, but what about when it crushes the bus with its great big bow-bulb-thing?I know it is fantasy and that much of what is shown is artistic license, but I was disappointed.Oh, one great line is when they need heat while waiting in the NY library and so start burning books. Someone says "More books" loudly. (to put on the fire! including Friedrich Nietzsche!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Short review of "The Day After Tomorrow"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Day After Tomorrow" is a disaster movie directed by Roland Emmerich, released in 2004. The director of this movie is well known for "2012" and "10000 BC" which are also related to the environment or changes happening to the earth. The most attractive aspect of this movie is the setting which shows extreme situations well. In addition, the film reminds us that people are weak beings who have no power in front of Mother Nature.Jack Hall, the main character, is played by Dennis Quaid and he has two important duties; as a climatologist, and as a father to his son, Sam Hall. As unexpected weather events like falling hail and a rapid drop in temperature happen to the world, it implies that something very strange is going on and some terrifying disaster is coming. Eventually, the awful calamity occurs on the American continent, which is the main background of this film, and people all around the world are in confusion. Jack is torn between performing his task to save the world and leaving to save his son in New York.Because The Day After Tomorrow is focused on climate disaster, most of the scenes take place in extreme conditions such as buildings which can not be recognized because they are buried with a snowdrift due to a heavy snow storm, or the sudden strike of a tidal wave. So it does have some tremendous visuals and awesome special effects which make the scenes more realistic and audiences can be absorbed in the screen. Despite all the climatologists' efforts, they cannot do anything against nature. Thus, the film makes the point that people are very weak, so we should not harm the earth for our selfish advantage and convenience.The Day After Tomorrow warns us that if we don't follow the flow of nature, nature will swallow up our lives some day. I would like to recommend this movie so that audiences can experience the lively and exciting action with great special effects, and think about the Earth's environment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overall an enjoyable film - Could've had a more in depth conclusion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this film and have loved it since the first time I watched it 10 years ago. It has great acting, great CGI for a film that is 11 years old and could be a somewhat plausible scenario; an ice age has occurred in the past and may very well happen again. I love that it highlights the problem of excessive pollution to our atmosphere by burning fossil fuels at an extraordinary rate and the damages that may come into effect if this issue continues for years to come. The overall plot was brilliant... ...BUT! In saying that, as a member of the audience, I really do WISH the conclusion was better written. The film goes for 120 minutes as is but it didn't feel nearly that long because it has an intriguing and empowering plot with the ability to really lure you in, so there would have been no harm whatsoever adding an extra 20-30 minutes onto the film to fulfill a greater overall conclusion. I would have liked to see nation wide search and rescues, survivors being reunited with their surviving relatives and loved ones, and time passing (months to years) after the cataclysmic event to showcase the ultimate rebuild of western civilization. I feel this movie ended way too prematurely, which lead to many loose endings and unanswered questions. Where there are unanswered questions, a sequel is recommended and/or desired, but you cannot create a sequel to a movie such as this because it's a scenario that would likely happen once in a substantial amount of time, so the writers/directors were fools not to conclude better. Such a pity really; this movie is great, but it had so much more potential. Instead of being a "great" film, it could have been a "10/10! Stupendous! Highly recommended!" film. Nevertheless, still an overall good movie to watch at least watch once. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take It For What It Is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Day After Tomorrow is a global warming Earth disaster movie. A it does pretty much what it set out to do: have a lot of big special effects scenes, have a basic plot, and some dialogue that will advance the film from scene to scene. Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) is a paleoclimatologist who warns world leaders about the dangers of global warming. He is laughed off by many, but Jack believes that it will be the next generation that pays for it never his own. However, sooner than he predicted extreme weather events pop up all over the world and the another ice age looms. The film then takes the turn of Hall going to save his son Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) who gets stuck in New York with Laura Chapman (Emmy Rossum) on a school trip. This is pretty much the movie in a nut shell. And this doesn't ruin it because when you go into it you get exactly what you're expecting. It succeeds for most part on the big special effects scenes, it succeeds in having a basic plot that does enough to keep you watching, and it succeeds in having dialogue that you can tolerate that will bring you to the next scene without cringing, for the most part. The Day After Tomorrow isn't going after Oscar Nominations, it's just there to give you an entertaining watch. If you decide to turn on this movie take it for what it is, a popcorn flick.</fullReview>

The movie is fast paced with each scene having the thrill and its not any sci-fi teenage film , Jake gyllenhal and emily rossum and a nice movie . I think its the whole package . And the concept of the movie is not that bogus as the haters have put it in their reviews , it is almost real and I think you should watch this movie for its Photography and concept.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has it all:good acting, excellent cinematography, and a great story to boot! It features a climatologist who figures out that global warming is triggering a new ice age, and he races against the freezing weather and time to get to his son, who has gone to New York to a contest. Dennis Quaid was great in the lead, and Jake Gylenhaal was good in the lead. The movie features a good supporting cast, too, with good performances from Sela Ward and Emmy Rossum.I loved the scenes in the library where they tried to keep warm, the extreme flood scene in the streets, Quaid's trek scenes, and the views from space. Someone once put it best when they called this, "good movie, lousy science!" Hey, I liked the movie! *** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The dialogue in this film will make you wonder whether a first year screenwriter student penned it. The entire plot is formulaic and predictable, and contains so many dated references you'll instantly realise you're watching a film from early 2000s. The action scenes are stupid and unrealistic, and incredibly clichéd.The acting is passable, I think the actors do the best with what they've been given, but their performance falls down purely for being framed within such a nonsense film.Special effects aren't bad for the time, but they aren't great. Definitely not worth watching for them alone.Overall another weak, tiring and preachy film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This disaster movie is not one of the best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Out of Jake Gyllenhaal's finest movies and roles, The Day After Tomorrow is, exceptionally, the worst I've seen. It's fair to say it's not his movie, it centres around a science professor played by Dennis Quaid, who predicts an earth catastrophe that is near - which includes tsunamis, snow storms and, ultimately a second ice age - but neither the characters nor the plot itself are in any way interesting. It's tragically bent on clichés. The direction of Roland Emmerich isn't good, nor is the dodgy screenplay, dialogue, nor the characters - and the irritating clichés even include ridiculous lack of character development - even our lead actor, whom is Dennis Quaid, portrays his science professor in way to convince the audience that he's more interested in the safety of his son (Gyllenhaal), in the tragic ice age, than of the many millions of hopeless survivors living in the States.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If one were going to choose the poster child of disaster movie clichés, they would need to look no further than The Day After Tomorrow. This film is almost the culmination of every disaster movie set before it. There's the protagonist, a scientist (Dennis Quaid) who is always right, the ignorant politician who is always wrong, the obnoxious media reporters (one of which who has an almost comical death involving a billboard), and the supporting members of the protagonist's group, one of which will surely die. Finally, there is the estranged family member who the protagonist will inevitably make up with in the end. Overshadowing all of this is the antagonist disaster, in this case being a runaway climate that manages to go completely out of control in about a week's time.The special effects of The Day After Tomorrow are incredibly well done. The global storms that terrorize the Northern Hemisphere throughout the movie look and feel massive providing a sense of horrified awe whenever you see them. Unfortunately, the visuals cannot make up for the unoriginal dialog and characters. Do not watch it expecting to be blown away by the acting, but if you are looking for something exciting to kill an hour and a half on a week night, this is the movie for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Far As Roland Emmerich goes, This Is Pretty Darn Good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whether you loved this movie or hated it, this is the only Roland Emmerich film I've ever enjoyed. Sure I can vouch I enjoyed "Godzilla" (1998) as a kid back in the day, but growing up and looking back these asses ripped off "Jurassic Park (1993) so bad. I suppose I can see the appeal certain audiences members have for these kind of disaster pictures, but why do they always have to be weighed down by worse than cardboard cut out characters and awful dialogue. I guess this film finally won me over due to its take on global warming. I particularly loved the fact it wasn't space invasion or end of days predicaments, yet that doesn't mean this film is flawless.Of course this movie is built on nothing but effects. However, we have some decent actors to keep the flow going considerably well, when 3/4 of your time is spent in government labs &amp; meetings. One thing I really enjoyed as well was the movies soundtrack. Yeah they repeat that one song a little too much, but if I'm going to complain about that small thing I might as well declare myself pretty narcissist.Final Verdict: Forget "Independence Day" (1996), and "2012" (2009). Check out this disaster film that actually has a decent script attached to it. 7/10.</fullReview>

These issues are important but this movie speeds up the timeline by 100x so that events that should take 100s if not 1000s of years all happen in the space of 25-50mins, not to mention we have a lovely teenager and a girl or wait I got that backwards, whatever, two Jews that happen to be rich and wealthy and well, there is your love story; meanwhile the few black people or other characters are just pushed to the side. CGI special effects, based up on a poor opening story (sorry if you are a black dude/gang banger/Latino/Chinese/ or any other ethnic group - yes gang bangers are an ethnic group, you don't belong here). Very little merit to this film, even toasting a soccer team - really? Thats all they thought of. One of the worst disaster movies out there.</fullReview>

I where did the wolves come from? people walking in below zero temperatures, no face masks, no shivering. Dennis Quaid's character's son was in a library in Manhattan just a few feet away from the Statue of Liberty, which is not in Manhattan. this movie is good for two things: watching ice glaciers on a very hot day and taking notes on how not to make a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Day After Tomorrow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Title: The Day After TomorrowCondensed Storyline: The Earth has entered a new ice age so a paleoclimatologist called Jack Hall must travel over frozen remains of America to find his son Notable Acting: Meh, I found the acting in this movie, bland at best. They are all good actors as well, but that is why I have such a problem with them being so bland. I've seen all of these actors in other movies which they were great in, but this seems to be the exception. Except Dennis Quaid, this was a good movie for him.Noticeable Camera work: This is a typical action destruction porn movie, there isn't any interesting angles or shots used. Not that I expected there to be. The framing is nice and used to how you that destruction porn, which is funny in a sense as this movie is basically porn for those with destruction fetishes. Bad acting, plot hole filled plot, decent CG, etc Graphics: The CGI of the tidal wave, the tornados, the polar vortex were all great and fun to watch as they looked realistic. The CGI wolves on the other hand were semi-decent, for some reason movies seem to find it hard to CGI animals such as sharks, wild mammals and giant lizards. Incorrect Science: Roland Emmerich may know how to direct films, but he knows nothing about how science or UK football work. American glaciologists in Antarctica are using US measurements, so self respecting professional scientist would use US measurement. All scientists use the metric system regardless of their nationality. Roland Emmerich changed this to allow the American audience to understand what they are talking about. We get another example of this where the professor states the freezing point of helicopter fuel in fahrenheit, another point that was made for American. Hurricanes do not form over land, but in the case of the UK, the island is too small and without enough land mass to prevent a storm of that size from forming. The Sky news report is trying to show the snow in Britain, but is showing American because the cars are on the wrong side of the road. I'm not a football fan, but even I know Old Trafford when I see it, even if they say it is Celtic's home ground. The Russian cargo ship wouldn't be abandoned as it is still sea worthy, just as penicillin would freeze in that temperature if stored in liquid form. It's liquid form is also milky white and not clear. The only way the American flag would freeze within a second would be if it was soaking wet and if it was soaking wet it wouldn't be flying as it would be too heavy The British helicopter survivor isn't wearing any gloves (Which are required by aviation law) or cold weather clothing (Which is common sense) Indian people are chanting in English in New Delhi where it is snowing. Overall Feel: This movie is just so wrong on most of its science it is unbelievable, but regardless of that fact, this is one of my all time favourite disaster movies. It is a typical Roland Emmerich movie, it has destruction of public landmarks, one man who saw it coming, people coming together to because of the destruction, all that typical stuff. The movie is also very politically charged, with that guy who was hired to look and play the role of that old grey money obsessed politician who no one likes. This movie would have just been better with just Jack Hall in the movie, forget the rest of his family and give him another reason to go to New York, that would have made this movie much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How to deal with the issue of climate change with a sledge hammer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2004 was a year in America when it appeared that the conservative right held all of the power and the issues of the environment was being conveniently ignored by the captains of industry so it is not surprising that Hollywood came out with a movie that effectively dealt with the issue of climate change with what is effectively a sledge hammer. Not only do the president and the vice-president look like Dick Cheney and George Bush (respectively) but the movie was tries to suggest that this is a issue that needs to be confronted immediately because the impact of our destruction of the Earth could cause wide spread destruction faster than we can blink.It is just a shame that the events in the movie are just so unrealistic. My suspension of disbelief was pretty much destroyed when the tornadoes touched down in Los Angeles, and while the tidal surge in New York was visually spectacular, once again it is simply so unrealistic that it pretty much ends up undermining any message that this film might have. I remember that the Greens back in 2004 arranged a screening of this film, and in the end those who believe in climate change are unlikely to change their views, and those who don't, probably walked out of the cinema laughing.Basically, after the storm surge in New York, the film pretty much becomes dead boring, to the point that I simply want to go to sleep. Further, this film is a carbon copy of those 1970s disaster movies that we all loved, except that they threw a bit more action (such as the completely unrealistic hail storm in Tokyo, and the aforementioned tornadoes that completely demolish Los Angeles, which seems to be in the movie simply for an excuse to completely demolish Los Angeles).It is also interesting that they suddenly decide to have a scene where all of the Americans are fleeing over the border into Mexico and, guess what, the Mexicans decide to close the border, so America, as a way of appeasing their Southern neighbour, decides to forgive their debt, not that there is anything left of the United States after the end of the film. It is also funny that the whole event causes Dick Cheney, oops, I mean the vice-president of the United States, to have an epiphany (which is too late) that maybe being a climate change skeptic was a bad thing (as if the complete debacle that was the war in Iraq caused them to have an epiphany ? especially since they are still trying to defend that particular adventure, and are saying that the Arab Spring of 2011 was a result of the war in Iraq, not that the Arab Spring has actually resulted in the people of the Middle East and North Africa actually having a better life).Visually, for the first half, this film is pretty good, but after the storm surge in New York, it simply becomes another disaster movie that really does little to advance the cause of man-made climate change.</fullReview>

This movie was idiotic. Dennis Quaid decided to kill his friends and walk from Philly to Manhattan to what....Say what's up to his son. Oh great now we have to feed two more people. And good thing as soon as they got there the storm stopped and they were rescued. And the damn tent. People are dying all around from being outside. They couldn't walk from the Library to Brooklyn. But if you have a tent rather than the warmth and comfort of a building you're in better shape. They even were taking there jackets off in the tent and exiting not wearing gloves or a hat, but were totally fine. Somehow the eye of the storm (which is the calmest part in real life) is causing everything to freeze but they're outrunning it. Oh yeh and if your a wolf you can survive sub freezing temps like its going out of style. This movie would have been better if Jake G shot Dennis Quaid when he walked in thinking he was a wolf.</fullReview>

These people are cinematic criminals who should be permanently barred from making films.Think Irwin Allen's The Swarm and you get the idea of just how bad DAT really is.

		<fullReview>The Day after the LieReview by Mr.TThe Day after Tomorrow is a Science-Fiction movie about the effect of global warming within an IceAge and some other extreme weather conditions. Besides there are a little group of young people arrested in a library and fighting for there lives. One Group member is the Son from Jack Hall the discoverer of the big disaster and Jack started a rescue mission.The movie was directed by Roland Emmerich and released worldwide in 2004.I will review four aspects: -At first the plot -Secondly the actors -Thirdly the camera movement -Fourth the musicThe Plot is shaped by Roland Emmerichs Style for example he love the big Show far away from the reality and mixed with some emotion. The dubious Story of the Movie could never happen like this and with this fact in your mind you can detect a lot of unrealistic points. For example there is only one Person (Jack Hall) who can warn the world , the world falls in a new IceAge within a month and the whole East coast of America got hit by a giant tide. These three points are only some of a lot. Nevertheless the Story is unpretentious and I got this feeling because the scenes are predictable but its a interesting presentation of an oversubscribed disaster imagination.The actors are boring and low they can not transport the action and drama from the special effects around them out of the Screen. Because of that i got the feeling that this is "Acting" like a Job they have to do without passion. The camera is filming on a high level there are a lot of beautiful scenes created by the best Virtual Artists in the world. The pictures are more addicting my emotions than every acting from the actors. I have nothing to crisis on the camera.The Same with the Music its such a good orchestra and created an important scenery in the background. The Music have a more important role than the actors in the Movie because I can watch the movie in a unfamiliar Language an got the interesting feeling of the Music which is pointed in the scenes very good.All in All the Movie is good for action and Roland Emmerich fans but as expected The story is flat and predictable as well as unrealistic.5 of 10 Points(School Project by JT)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very usual catastrophic movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie The Day After Tomorrow from Roland Emmeric published in 2004 deals with the scenario of a global natural disaster caused by human activity. The main characters are Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid), Laura Chapman(Emmy Rossums) and Sam Hall (Jake Gyllenhaal). Jack Hall works as a professor specialized in thermal environment moreover Laura and Jack (Son of Jack) are students. While watching the movie one will remark that the movie is similarly compared with 2012. The story is about a professor (Jack Hall) who study the climate change. He is the first who realizes that the climate is changing. As result he trys to alarm the government but there is no reaction with regard to him. Little by little the climate becomes more dangerous. The world is going to a ice time. The scenes play in a lot of famous cities for example Tokio, New York and Carlifornia especially the scenes in New York are very impressively because whole New York is iced including the Statue of Liberty.The music underlines the action scenes very well. The composer used a lot of strings and other classical instruments this arouse the public. That one can see for example in the first scene which plays in the Arctic.In my opinion the special effects are not realistic and seem too simulated. The wolves appear very unrealistic that fact takes a lot of the tension. The story line was not very interesting. The usual love story. The usual father and son conflict nothing that makes the watcher interested. The love story between Laura and Sam is a typical story line made by Hollywood in according to this the plot is predictable as result one is bored by that plot. But what is the message of the movie? Maybe we all have to change our way of life for getting a better future. Of course the producer wants to influence the public to buy a ticket. Apart from this the movie deals with a serious topic that will concerns all of us. As a result of watching the film the people make some minds about global warming. In conclusion the movie gets 5 of 10 points. I dislike the story line only the action scenes do not make a excellent film. So the movie is only for people who like a lot of action without a good story line and poor animated enemies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A few billion dead people, and a f***ing happy end?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there were a belittlement of the film "2012", then it would probably be "The Day After Tomorrow". Indeed there is no tidal wave going over the Himalaya, but a completely frozen New York has nothing to do with the reality. You can call it a minimized version of the disaster movie "2012". In the following review I will show you the most important aspects of the doomsday movie "The Day After Tomorrow"."The Day After Tomorrow" was directed and produced by Roland Emmerich. The main actors in the film were Dennis Quaid, Jake Gyllenhaal and Emmy Rossum. The film deals with natural disasters change like tornadoes, tidal waves, hurricanes, etc.. This disasters were caused on account of the climate change and the tearing off the Gulf stream. Furthermore there is the climatologist Jack Hall who wants to warn and evacuate the people in the USA. Moreover his son Sam and his classmates are in New York fighting to survive the beginning of a new ice time. This is part is relative realistic in contrast to the rest of the story. Well, a helicopter freeze while it's flying, but people can survive in a completely frozen library by burning some books?In first place the effects look really impressive, but you can see immediately that it is only animated. One example is the huge tidal wave in New York which is so extreme slow that the people can easy go to their cars, get their baggage, save some stuck families and reach the library. No problem. Indeed the message is creditably, but the implementation is so overdrawn, that the film seems ridiculous. Thus, naturally the message gets lost too. At least the music, camera work and the setting is well-chosen. A good scene to show that is the opening in the Arctic. As well as the location, the music is very epic and the camera looks like it is flying over the white landscape.In conclusion I can say that there was done a good job on the secondary aspects like music or camera work. However the substance of film, like the story, connection to the reality or the effects are abysmally poor and exaggerated. So if you don't use your brain and do not want to watch a film with a deep meaning, then "The Day After Tomorrow" is the perfect movie for you. Definitely only for your eyes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A catastrophically catastrophic filmStarting with the review we have to say that the film "The Day After Tomorrow" is an effective and on the global problems based film from Roland Emmerich. Dennis Quaid, Jake Gyllenhaal and Emmy Rossums present the characters Jack Hall, Sam Hall and Laura Chapman. It could be compared with the film "The Day The Earth Stood Still" which is also based on environmental problems.The places are exciting because of its popularity. We see for example California, Tokyo, New York, Dehli and the Arctic. The music underlines the dramatic scenes and makes you feel with the people. You especially feel the fear, the despair and the hopelessness while for example the tornadoes are destroying the city and while the ice is freezing the whole corridor where the main characters try to hide. Faulty chosen are the special effects. They are very unrealistic and poorly animated. The best example for this are the wolves which come into the ship. They do not look like real wolves.Furthermore the character play is unsatisfying. For example, the father-boy-relation is not as deep as it should be. The love between Sam and Laura is unconvincing and a bit too predictable. The message is delivered clearly to the audience. Global warming is a global problem which calls cross-border acting like Mexico and USA. A fantastic example in the film, for this part, is the borderline from Mexico which is closed for a moment so that the other people recognize that they are dependent on their help.All in all the film gets 6 from 10 points in our rating. We can recommend the film to viewers who like many action scenes and less acting. For watching this film, you should not like realistic movies and effects because of the many animated scenes which are not as marvelous as we wished for a good film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Long Drawn Out Doomsday Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Look okay first of all if your going to comment or rate a film you must first establish what genre the film is. This film is an Action adventure disaster film so straight away don't expect great acting and story lines, expect clichés and the same old over the top and ridiculous scenes.Anway as an action/disaster film i find this film very average, Its about global warming causing an extremely fast mini ice age.And the film centres around some smart kid who's old mans a meteorologist.So you can gather the plot, kid stuck in NYC in massive snow storm dad who's away makes a promise that he will come to rescue his son.I wont tell yous what happens but i personally think the first hour is alright for action and big disaster scenes but than it all gets a bit slow and boring for the last hour.In my opinion its only worth a watch if its on the box and your at home lazing about on a Sunday evening and nothing much is on but you see this film is starting, apart from that i would not bother going out my way for this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Roland (Independence Day, 2012) Emerich may be in the same special fx league as Paul Verhoeven, Ridley Scott and James Cameron, but they have vision. Emerich is blind.The high concept is one our children (and their children) will all be taking seriously. And it could have been so easily developed into a meaningful story instead of a platform for big-screen computer games sfx.I'd have built the film around the main character of a veteran conservative pol who's seen the light but can't get his party on board because the constituents are so anti-scientific. Chairman of a powerful Senate committee, he has the opportunity to push a climate change agenda, but he caves in to pressure. We see him watching his committee kill the bill on C-SPAN with his grandson. He looks at the boy, wondering...The pol's taken enough bribes to stash sufficient money to have himself frozen when he dies... and buried in the Northern Canadian permafrost. They wake him up 70 years later. They =had= to. The ground's thawed.His grandson's there. =He's= a Congressman now. Canada's part of the US. The Chinese have taken over Siberia. The Indians (that are left) have taken over Tibet. Antarctica is an Islamic state where the Australians have been turned into slaves.You can guess the rest.Yeah; I've written a few. But if I can dream this up in two minutes, why can't this guy?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Day After Tomorrow Okay But Flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Day After Tomorrow is okay but flawed from director Roland Emmerich whose admirable in making this movie about a climatologist who must go to New York to save his son because global warming has caused a large part of the world to be taken over by a new age. The cast are good in their roles including Dennise Quaid, Jake Gyllenhaal, Ian Holm, Emmy Rossum, and Sela Ward but even their talent can hide the flaws that can be found in this film. No offense to Dennis Quaid because he is a good actor and he is the main character in this movie sort of but at least to me I felt his character played second fiddle to the special effects and most of the action sequences. Except for one action sequence early on and then a few near the end Quaid's character sort of takes a back seat in this one and lets the special effects take over for large parts of the movie. Most of the people in the cast kind of do but some of them including Gyllenhaal are in a few action sequences. I thought Gyllenhall had more to do than Quaid who for most of the film is warning ignorant people about the possibility of a new ice age that will change their world forever. The rest of the cast are okay but like Quaid they don't have much to do. The special effects are the big highlight in the movie because they're incredible even though you can tell it's CG but it works none the less. The action sequences are intense but there could have be more of them. The pacing was slow at times and the dialogue wasn't the greatest occasionally either. The only reason why I gave this film five stars is because of the attempt by the actors and the special effects. If it wasn't for those two things I definitely wouldn't have liked this movie. Overall The Day After Tomorrow is a decent sci-fi apocalyptic action drama with an interesting premise, great special effects, some intense action, and good performances by the cast but this movie could have been a lot better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very troubling disaster movie that makes my bottom list.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie for the first time about four years ago, not knowing what it was about. The movies that I love are those that are dark, mysterious, and twisted. Movies I don't like are those that include disaster, intense end-of-the-world themes, or viruses. Anything in between may or may not be okay, and as you may know from the plot summary, this is disaster movie (which could be the end of the world) which makes my bad list. This movie really bothered me. A scientist is trying to find out what's happening to the climate of the Northern Hemisphere while his son and his friends are trying to survive an "Ice Age"-like epidemic in New York City. Large waves are ruining and flooding the streets, snow covers the world, and a large burst of cold air is going to cover the entire Northern Hemisphere soon ? all because of global warming.Don't get me wrong, the film does have a good message, but I really didn't need it at that intensity at that age. I personally was disturbed by the film and have refused to watch it since.However, for those of you who do like such films, I would recommend it to you, but this is not the film for me. Thank you.Good: It had some cool special effects and a good message.Bad: Too intense. Story needed work. Just another large-scale disaster movie.Overall: [2/10] A very troubling disaster movie that makes my bottom list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So What's Wrong With The Recent Disaster Movies ?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WEAK DRAMA : Nearly there isn't much of a drama but the main event's noise. There isn't running theme but being a hero, a human who can sacrifice, or not. Some may die because no dramatic reason. As the disaster is insane so the screenplay must be too ! NOT TOO MANY STARS : One very important point. The 1970s' memorable disaster movies were cleverer. The producers knew very much that there was not much of a drama. So : hire big names to cover the small story- lines, the bad dialog, and the unfound purgation. Every movie was a star-studded, which was smart tradition that disappeared during the 2000s. Maybe because of the shameful reputation of some of the previous era's movies as proud turkeys; (The Swarm ? 1978) is damn good example. Or maybe the big budget of the CGI left no money to bring golden casts. Or the stars of today refuse being in a movie that may not focus on them inasmuch as the disaster. Anyhow, now they deal with one star (sometimes half a star !) with bunch of unknown people, which exposes the crappy scripts and lessens the attraction. The funny thing is that the only disaster movie in the last years that crowded all star cast was the black comedy (Mars Attacks !).HYPED CGI : Let's be honest, now the majority of the movies has obvious special effects. I hate, in most of the cases, to see that computer work and exaggerated too ! I'm an old fashion guy maybe, but the good old stuff was somehow more believable, coarse, and effective. At the 2000s, it's just so exposed and adolescent. And they put the real thing proudly at the making or as a DVD's bonus !! Sometimes as advertisement while the movie is shown ??! They ruin the whole thing by their own hands !!!! Just compare (The Towering Inferno ? 1974) with (Independence Day - 1996) it's like live on air from a disaster zone vs. video game ! I'm not who you can call : a Stanley Kubrick's big fan, but at least he said about 8 thousand extras for Spartacus's battles : "This Is Not Enough". You can call me a fan of that !THE TRUTH : WAW, maybe the only time to witness the 1970s beats the 2000s in something !THANK GOD FOR : The TV, CABLE, DVDs, etc.. to re-watch that again. NOW ABOUT THIS ONE : (The Day after Tomorrow - 2004)WEAK DRAMA : I didn't like its drama. Yes, there was a father who wanted to reach his son, but there wasn't more ! The strangest thing I saw was that this movie got, unlike maybe all its likes, an issue to arouse and a case to propound (the abrupt global warming). But it dumbly didn't serve it much, since dramatically I didn't live the selected characters to catch on some lucid meaning out of their deaths, or even got emotional because of their performance; not only because they're not stars, but because there weren't respectable roles basically ! So the honorable "end of the world" wasn't the hero here intellectually as it was visually.NOT TOO MANY STARS : Although the cast presented fair performance, but the flat characterization didn't even make me worried about them. God. Even the connections between them wasn't strongly built. They transformed into marginal cameos in a skillful CGI show; old fact about disaster movies ! I know that ! But this time the presence of (Jake Gyllenhaal), (Dennis Quaid), (Emmy Rossum) didn't make me lenient with it !Not-HYPED CGI : Save the phony wolves, it has some of the most sane CGI, and it's in fact the whole show. Missing this movie in theaters is something to regret about as it's the thing to be watched there. The movie's CGI was the very-well made thing, and maybe what this movie was all about.THE TRUTH : Compared to Roland Emmerich's previous 2 "end of the world" disaster movies, Independence Day (1996), and Godzilla (1998); it's less glamorous, less intense, and less fun. And in itself, I consider it a little adventure movie, yet sad, with good image and some inside message. But I didn't find any attribute that could make it my movie, or qualify it for a second watching.THANK GOD FOR : There is no sequel ! Yippeeeee..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Supreme silliness doesn't stop The Day After Tomorrow from being lots of fun for connoisseurs of epic-scale disaster flicks. After the blockbuster profits of Independence Day and Godzilla, you can't blame director Roland Emmerich for using global warming as a politically correct excuse for destroying most of the northern hemisphere. Like most of Emmerich's films, this one emphasizes special effects over such lesser priorities as well-drawn characters and plausible plotting, and his dialog (cowritten by Jeffrey Nachmanoff) is so laughably trite that it could be entirely eliminated without harming the movie. It's the spectacle that's important here, not the lame, recycled plot about father and son (Dennis Quaid, Jake Gyllenhaal) who endure an end-of-the-world scenario caused by the effects of global warming. So sit back, relax, and enjoy the awesome visions of tornado-ravaged Los Angeles, blizzards in New Delhi, Japan pummeled by grapefruit-sized hailstones, and Manhattan flooded by swelling oceans and then frozen by the onset of a modern ice age. It's all wildly impressive, and Emmerich obviously doesn't care if the science is flimsy, so why should you?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly entertaining first-half let down by dull second-half.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Roland Emmerich of Independence Day and the shoddy Godzilla Remake fame brings us probably the least accurate but best looking global warming warning to date. Don't worry just yet, Emmerich clearly hasn't got his facts right but this is a movie and for entertainment purposes he must e3xagerate a little. A 30ft tidal wave sweeping through Manhattan? Most of Britain under ice? Tornados in Hollywood? It's a tad stretched but for what it's worth the first 40 minutes of The Day After Tomorrow are sheep brilliance dabbling into emotion and not being afraid to dazzle with its monuments effects.It's a crying shame then that once those 40 minutes are up the film revels its dull serious side. Jumping from unconvincing problem to unconvincing problem back upped by the ultimately charisma drained Dennis Quaid and a forgivably forgettable performance form Jake Gyllenhal makes The Day After Tomorrow a very mixed bag.Directed by Roland Emmerich, this mega-budget, special-effects-laden epic revolves around the onset of an international series of crises brought on by the long-term results of the greenhouse effect.At the eye of the storm is paleoclimatologist (a professor dedicated to the study of weather patterns throughout the ages) Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid), who voluntarily takes on the preservation of the world in voluntarily takes on the preservation of the world in the dawn of the next ice age and all the disaster that comes along with it -- violent hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, tidal waves, massive floods, etc.Hall must also contact his son, Sam (Jake Gyllenhal), who was in the middle of an academic competition in New York City when the chaos begun. In addition to facing the largest-scale onslaught of natural catastrophes in the history of humankind, Jack, in his journey north, must contend with the masses fleeing south in an attempt to resettle in a warmer climate. The Day After Tomorrow also features Emma Rossum, Sela Ward, and Joe Cobden. All of whom do a respectable job at providing the often much needed support.Director Roland Emmerich has had his ups and he has had his downs. Anybody's whose read my 10,000 BC review will know what I mean by downs and what with that terrible Godzilla remake still leaving a mark its odd how the director of the critically acclaimed Independence Day can sink to such a low quality. With The Day After Tomorrow despite its flaws it does enter the group marked the Directors best what with this and Independence Day being his only real success.My Final Verdict? If only this movie were 40 minutes long then maybe the ending wouldn't be so darn dull. Even still this is entertaining viewing that should not be missed but never should be taken seriously. Global Warming truly isn't such a problem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Roland Emmerich rehashes his favourite theme of epic-scale worldwide destruction. Nothing new, but easy enough to sit through.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roland Emmerich clearly likes destruction on a grand scale. He had aliens decimating various cities and landmarks in Independence Day; he had a giant lizard flattening New York in Godzilla; and here in The Day After Tomorrow he has the entire Northern Hemisphere becoming uninhabitable due to the onset of a new ice age. In Emmerich's films these catastrophic disasters are always depicted on screen with vivid state of the art special effects. But there's always something a bit lacking in the character department; Emmerich deals with one-dimensional people, the kind of people who stay square-jawed and heroic in a crisis, the kind of people who have a cool one-liner for the most hair-raising of moments. The Day After Tomorrow has the usual spectacular destruction, convincingly staged as ever, but when the human story takes precedence during the second half it becomes clear that the director isn't sure what to make of it.Climatologist Jack Hall (Dennid Quaid) gives a speech at a climate conference warning that global warming could change weather patterns on the planet to such an extent that it could send everything into reverse, causing a new ice age. He is largely ridiculed, his theories dismissed as scare-mongering by the likes of American Vice President Becker (Kenneth Welsh). Yet within a few weeks, Hall's predictions start to become reality as temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere plummet and inexplicable weather hits various places. Freak ice storms cause destruction in Japan; temperatures in Scotland drop so low that fuel freezes in the tanks of helicopters bringing them crashing to the ground; LA is ravaged by multiple hurricanes; and a tidal wave brings devastation to New York. Jack's son Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) is in New York for a college quiz contest, and gets trapped when the extraordinary weather freezes over the entire city. Jack embarks on a perilous cross-country journey to reunite with his son and rescue him ? and others - from the big freeze.The scientific background of the film is loosely true ? a severe enough change in the climate caused by global warming could affect the gulf streams so much that another ice age might happen. But the timescale for such a change would be centuries, as opposed to the handful of days it takes in the film. Emmerich delights in entertaining us with the destruction of more famous places ? in one scene he even gives us a twister ripping the famous Hollywood letters from their hillside spot over Tinseltown. The performances are OK within the limitations of the characters ? Quaid simply has to look and act brave as the worried father, while Gyllenhaal proves himself agile in a few energetic action sequences. The second half of the film deals with Dad trying to reach Son and is largely uninvolving and unconvincing. But the spectacle in the first half is enough to remind us that no-one does end-of-the-world pictures with quite as much boyish enthusiasm as Roland Emmerich! This is easy viewing ? nothing new, nothing special, but watchable enough in its overblown way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Roland Emmerich does disaster films as well as Dairylea does cheese, but there was something missing from The Day After Tomorrow.We have come to expect, in the 21st Century for intense special effects and a hard hitting storyline. However, something not on the agenda is in depth character detail. Unfortunately, it was this that The Day After Tomorrow desperately needed to stop it from being a pointless flick.The effects ultimately dominated the entire film, the characters felt like 2D cutouts who didn't get to do much but speak average and sometimes boring dialogue.Yes, the film hits home about the threat our planet is under from Global Warming, even though some of its ideas are a little far-fetched.Yes, the effects are superb and all in all flawless.What i cannot forgive however, is lifeless characters who blend into the background of a film. I was excited as i entered the cinema, but left feeling rather cold.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movies crafted from nothing by one man as both writer and director always pay dividends on the screen because the director has a clear idea from his own script of every character's motives and methods. In directing the actors on set, this knowledge obviously comes across, therefore giving the actors an insight straight from the writer allowing them to give their characters a depth that often sets the finished movie apart. Richard Kelly, Brian Helgeland and Stanley Kubrick to name just three. The Day After Tomorrow, from writer/director Roland Emmerich, seems to be a noteworthy exception. Some good performances (Gyllenhaal and as always Holm) don't rescue this film for me, though. Too many incoherencies, too little to believe in and a plot so predictable you could very probably set your watch by it. Yes, big effects, yes some good CG work but on the whole, barely watchable. The one high point? To quote the movie:. Simon: To England.... Terry Rapson (apparently correcting him): To mankind!The kind of world view (from German-born Emmerich) that other politically lopsided American movies often lack.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an awesome disaster flick!, that's very exciting,with incredible special effects and fantastic performances!. All the characters are just great, and the story is really cool as well!, plus all the characters are extremely likable, as you will be rooting for them to survive!. Some people complained that the 2nd half wasn't as good as the 1st, I have to disagree as I thought it was just as good!, plus Jake Gyllenhaal and Emmy Rossum had fantastic chemistry together. Yes some of the dialog is kind of hokey, however that's a minor thing, and the film is surprising and unpredictable throughout!, plus Dennis Quaid was surprisingly solid as the main lead. The opening is really cool and tense, and I thought the situation that all the characters were in kind of scary, plus one of my favorite moments in this film is when Gyllenhaal and the rest of the characters head to the library, to race against the tidal wave!. It's extremely well made, and I thought the ending was great, plus all you need to do to enjoy this movie is check your brain at the door!. This is an awesome disaster flick! that's very exciting, with incredible special effects and fantastic performances, and i say it's a must see!. The Direction is great!. Roland Emmerich does a great! job here, with wonderful camera work, awesome angles and lots of cool shots, plus he kept the film at a very fast pace!. The Acting is fantastic. Dennis Quaid is surprisingly solid as the main lead here, he is very likable, focused, intense, and even though he had some bad lines at times, and was wooden in certain parts, he still did a pretty solid job in my opinion i liked him. Jake Gyllenhaal is excellent here, he is very convincing likable, had great chemistry with Emmy Rossum, had a cool character, and was very resourceful!, I really liked him. Emmy Rossum is also excellent here, she is gorgeous,had very good chemistry with Gyllenhaal, and just did excellent with what she had to do she was great. Sela Ward is decent here and did what she had to do adequately. Ian Holm is good in his role and added class. Kenneth Welsh is pretty good as the vice president I liked him, even if his character was a bit of a dick at times. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall a must see!. **** out of 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This story of the coming ice age starts off very well, as several people have pointed out. In fact it is rather like one of the great John Wyndham's stories (Days of the Triffids, etc.). The special effects are great. Unfortunately, it soon has to appeal to the teen market and instead of continuing on a scientific / political course, we have to become involved in the usual rubbish about a Dad who simply loves his son - but has had a row because the son got an F in his exam! We then have to follow the son (who looks about 30), mooning after a fellow-student - who looks like a well-preserved 32. The parents meanwhile are very distraught about their son. The chief scientist (father) goes to New York by car and on foot and finds him; the young folk are in the New Yortk Public LIbrary burning books. I was doing my knitting and making tea at the time, so missed a few beats. They seem to have access only to the more recondite type of books (no newspapers apparently - that they could use for insulation) - so that we have to endure another young idiot lecturing the resident intellectual about Nietzche and the Bible etc. Extraordinary that the intellectual pays any attention to the views of this silly person (it is of course a girl, PC reigns supreme in this film). However the special effects were great and all ends well - what a surprise! In fact my TV went on the blink in the middle - so I thought that a very appropriate end had been reached - but it was only a glitch!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have rated this film 8/10 because I enjoyed it. Reading some of the dreadful comments on here about a movie makes me think that some people really did misunderstand its intention.If you make a film that is too hard hitting and intelligent, you go way over the majority of viewer's heads. Not everyone understands the way the world works and the way our climate system is affected by our presence on this planet.The special effects are awesome, thats a big part of this film and yes it is lacking in story... but what do you expect? What would you prefer to happen, the world freeze and everyone die? People need hope and ideas of change to inspire them to actually do something. This world one day will eventually feel the wrath of mother nature; We've seen a lot of it in the past year with crazy weather.I think one of the bigger points in this film is situated at the end, where one of the astronauts says 'Hey look at that, i've never seen the air so clear' - a sign that the planet is just performing a natural clean up process and might eventually return to a 'normal' state.If you look at the Planet Mars, there is a large amount of carbon dioxide present in the ice caps. Sure, this could be simply due to a different composition of the atmosphere and of the planet itself, or it could be pointing at the fact you would essentially 'store' a lot of the gases within the ice caps itself.By all means I am no scientist, but from what that last bit said, it was my interpretation.All in all, it was very entertaining if you aren't looking to be a critic and rip the film apart. The end of the day, its not a great deal of money to watch a film, and I have paid to see a lot worse!</fullReview>

They just want to have control over something that needs no control, and pride themselves on scathing, pointless critiques of movies that just make them sound like bitter, depressing people.

My only gripe is the use of CGI wolves instead of realwolves ....it made the whole scene a lot less intense than it couldhave been. There were several missed opportunities like they couldhave shown a beached whale floating across New York or aircraft crashlanding on tops of the buildings... that would have looked awesome.Hope they are planning a more expansive and detailed Director's CUT forthe DVD as well as some compelling extras giving us the true storyabout global warming.</fullReview>

Guess what? It wasn't... far from it! If you're expecting Oscar performances, riveting plots, or captivating script work... you will feel a little jilted. However, if you want to see great eye candy and you love mass destruction movies... this is an awesome movie... probably one of the BEST!!You'll notice that the destruction starts immediately and gets really bad before you get a third of the way through your popcorn... name one (I'm sure there is) destruction movie that does that? The trend is or was to build the suspense and have destruction occur near the end. But then I wander what is the outcome... how do they survive... what are the long-term effects. With this movie you get a good glimpse of the results and how the world is changed.Sure there's an environment lesson here, so what? Name me a movie that doesn't? Imagine the complaints if there weren't any political or social lobbying in the movie... why go watch it? At least there is a glimmer of realism here that can't be ignored... you should be a little more considerate with your environment... at least for our children's sake.Overall this movie is well put together, definitely a must see this summer and for sure on the big screen!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... or for that matter, relationships; nor it seems, logic! This isn't meant to be as harsh a criticism as it possibly sounds. The shortcomings in logic are most easily dismissed - the movie was meant to be nothing more than an impressive CGI spectacle, so the fact that resorting to the 'fantastical' is sometimes too easy for the makers to resist should come as no surprise. Ordinarily though, I'd find myself a little peeved when a movie also prefers to skimp on the verisimilitude of emotional drama. Strangely enough, however, this time that didn't harm my goodwill toward TDAT.With such a shortened timescale as the film (again) erroneously presents, emotions may well be condensed and virtual strangers could easily find themselves compelled to behave as if they'd known each other their whole lives - in the context of events, these four days ARE their entire lives!My only real complaints were that I felt the relationship between father and son wasn't really established well enough for it to later become the emotional fulcrum of the picture. This isn't a slight upon the performances of Quaid and Gyllenhaal, for they are fine - but if it's decided that mere human oiks are going to be secondary to dwelling on destruction wreaked by the elements, then don't try to manipulate our sympathies for them by the end of the disaster! Similarly, the characters alternately get a little corny/triumphalist at the denouement; something I found hard to stomach given that footage which stems from mankind's ignorance is lingered over lovingly by Emmerich regardless. Still, who expected Hollywood to have a sound ecological conscience? Not me, and despite the contradictions between "this could really happen!" versus severe artistic license to make it more entertaining, this still remains a decent enough time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is it really good? Should people realize this?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People think way too scientifically these days. This is a movie that shows you something that could really happen. The movie is certainly good, but because people find that it was unlikely and unreal they mark everything down. Some of the classics are unreal and they don't mark it down. I don't see why they should make such a deal out of mistakes, movies should enjoyed or in this case at least paid attention to, but not to a point where critics have a go at how unrealistic it is!!!! The scenes are nicely put together and the tension is well judged, right where it should be. Yes, you can say that it wasn't that realistic with all the minor details, but you shouldn't stop enjoying yourself because it isn't like an encyclopedia! Personally I think that this is a great movie from the director of "Independence day"!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the most touching part of the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the most touching part of this film is that the Statue of Liberty was still standing, untouched by the disastrous weather, and the movie just glossed right over it. This is unfortunate in my opinion. Some might think that how they feel about the Statue of Liberty is personal and therefore there was no need to put an emphasis on the Statue being "untouchable." However, I feel this was an incredible statement of how the world handles such traumatic and "in the face of death" events. I would definitely recommend this movie. It's kind of perfect timing for the release of this film, as well, considering all the weird and dramatic weather we have been getting the past few weeks. GO SEE THIS MOVIE AND SEE FOR YOURSELF! It's really intense...in a very good way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Giant tornados slash across Los Angeles, snow falls in New Delhi, hailstones as big as coconuts deluge Tokyo, and polar ice shelves crack off and float away. What is this all about? Easy--global warming has accelerated to such an extent that massive aberrant weather patterns are appearing all across the globe. World leaders are alarmed, yet the US vice-president Becker (Kenneth Welch remarkably resembling Dick Cheney) scoffs at climatologist Jack Hall's (Dennis Quaid) theory that global warming will produce another ice age of disastrous proportions.When the situation worsens and the matter comes before US president Blake (Perry King), who incidentally is a dead ringer for Al Gore, all the Pres. can say is 'what do you think we should do?' to his VP. This sort of corny dialogue is typical for film, nevertheless with such awesome and fantastic special effects, who really pays that much attention?Much of the film centers on Jack Hall's brilliant and handsome son Sam (Jake Glyllenhaal) and his two friends who have gone to New York City for an educational decathlon. After a massive hurricane unleashes a gigantic wave sweeping across New York Harbor, nearly submerging the Statue of Liberty; it rages through the streets of Manhattan, destroying everything in its path and drowning or crushing tens of thousands of panicked New Yorkers in a matter of minutes. Sam and his friends are now trapped in the flooded New York library on Fifth Avenue with hundreds of other survivors. After an almost underwater phone call to his Dad, Sam is promised by Jack that he will come to New York to rescue him.After the hurricane has subsided, a blizzard with sub, sub-freezing temperatures covers the city in thirty feet of snow and kills anyone caught outside without the proper clothing protection. Through all these whiteout condition, Jack Hall and his buddies stomp through the blizzard to rescue his son trapped in the library. What he plans on doing once he makes it through the fiendish weather is too absurd to speculate. Naturally, in the meantime, his pretty son brilliantly uses his ingenuity and courage to fight the elements and other mishaps to save his colleagues. The plot is clearly an expensive adventure in cornball and predictable lines that one needs to forgive as we are jolted with one splendid and horrendous catastrophe after the other. The picture is spellbinding, yet could have been vastly improved by some serious editing of the more clichéd and unnecessary scenes.Roland Emmerich, the director of this $125 million movie, has wreaked havoc on New York twice before, once with the help of aliens in "Independence Day" (1996) and two years later with a big lizard in "Godzilla." Yet, those movies were made before the 9/11 attacks forced movie producers to rethink plots involving deadly mayhem. Warner Brothers delayed the release of "Collateral Damage," with Arnold Schwarzenegger as a Los Angeles firefighter tracking down Colombian terrorists to appease the wounded nation shocked by the mayhem in New York.This film had an excellent opportunity to reveal and demonstrate the cause and effects of global warming; however, Emmerich instead chose to exploit the extraordinary effects by making the film an implausible scientific fluke. The real effect of global warming is a very slow process, not virtually overnight as depicted here. Nevertheless, the film is an incredible experience that I would highly recommend to anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>****MINOR SPOILERS*****We went to see this both with different expectations and both came away with different feelings about the movie. I thought it was great, lots of action, lots of fun, very enjoyable. I, as I always do, suspended my disbelief, as one has to do when watching a disaster movie (take the core as an example) and as such had no trouble enjoying the snap frozen people, the multistory wave overtaking New York. And as such I also excepted the ending. My partner came out wanting more out of the ending, expecting some great 'we're human, lets fix the problem, isn't there a bomb or a mad scientist we can throw at the problem'. But alas it wasn't so. When it comes down to it, you can't beat Nature. I have heard lots of complaints about the computer graphics and the extreme use of them in this movie, personally it didn't bother me a bit, after all I don't know of any Mayor of New York that will let you flood the city just for the sake of a movie. All in all, I enjoyed it, it was fun, fast paced and a good couple of hours of movie release. Will it win any Oscars? Not a chance, but it's still worth the $13.50 for the ticket (yes, thats what we pay for a ticket here in Australia!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read some of the other comments and felt that many of the critics were lost. They didn't understand the flick, despite complaints of a fifth grade script. It is ironic that the people who complained about the intellectual level of the movie were unable to put together a proper sentence. A good example of misunderstanding on the part of other critics is the repeated reference to 'rabid wolves'. This shows a basic ignorance of animal behavior. The wolves were frightened and hungry. Any of nature's creatures would attack under these circumstances. The person who thought that a child with cancer was funny needs therapy. The individuals, who scoffed at the idea of global warming causing catastrophic disasters, elucidated my point.This is a very exciting movie. With the exception of a few minor flaws, this film is worthy of multiple viewings. It is almost good enough to become a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Disaster Film Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As far as Man vs. Angry Mother Nature goes, this is as good as it gets- The film has perhaps the best special effects seen in the 2004 film season, and combines 'Twister' with 'Perfect Storm' and hey, just for the sake of it, 'White Squall'. The acting was fairly well done, with a moderate performance by all actors with the exception of Jake Gyllenhaal, who stands out as he does with many of his films. Definitely a future star. (current even?)What does make this movie stand out against other disaster films, like deep impact or Volcano is that the film is deeply grounded in science. The inspiration for the film came from Coast to Coast AM host Art Bell's book "The coming global super storm" (an excellent read if you have the time) The film explains that salinity of the ocean is affected by ice shelves falling into the ocean and melting polar ice caps, which in turn would break the north Atlantic air current.This movie is made to display special effects, and in many ways does drag on with many side plots (see Peter the Cancer Boy) The Day After Tomorrow Delivers!7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING-SPOILERS AHEADI wasn't expecting much from "The Day After Tomorrow"-a big budget disaster film from the guy who gave us "Godzilla"? Yeah, where do I queue...?But I was very pleasantly surprised. The effects served the story, rather than the reverse and there were a wide variety of strong performances, especially from Jake Gyllenhal and Dennis Quaid. Despite it being a big summer action movie, it had a very human heart and wasn't overly "America rules", like Emmerich's previous works. I was very fond of some the overwhelming bleakness, such as the science post in Scotland, the fate of the President and the fact that many people are killed and there is no "happy ending". This added more humanity and a touch of realism.My only real complaint was the ending was quite rushed and some of the science was questionable. But these are minor issues in the face of all the film's strengths.I give this movie 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly good film with a good point to prove.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>****Possible Spoilers****"The Day After Tomorrow"A movie where Mother Nature kicks the hell out of humanity for its constant abuse.Most people will 'burn' this film for being a 'popcorn movie' and 'with no scientific basis'.#1 is true, but then why see this movie? It was obvious from the 'teasers' and 'spoilers' that it was going to be a 'popcorn movie' for the summer. Most of these don't contain much good acting, so you had to see that coming.#2 is actually false. There is scientific basis behind this movie. The levels of unsalted water (melted from the polar ice caps) are increasing, creating an imbalance in the thermohaline circulation. If this keeps up, it will shut down the circulation. It may not cause a new Ice Age, but it WILL make everything a lot colder.Overall, I thought the movie was very good, with a lot to prove. Dennis Quaid may not had added much to the movie and the beginning scene was a bit hard on the credibility factor. I liked how the director added the 'irony' of US Citizens illegally entering Mexico. It adds a comedy factor to it. The movie does have its share of 'human drama'. It may be a bit bleak, but it gives the movie more substance. Finally, I liked the ending because of its significance and how people prevail over all odds. There were a lot of technicalities with the movie and some scenes, but nothing serious.For people who think the movie is bad because of the timing:"We pushed the time period in which an ice age could occur for dramatic purposes...When scientists talk about an 'abrupt' climate shift, they're speaking in terms of five to ten years, not a few weeks. Our goal was not to make a complex scientific issue in a two-hour movie. We wanted to make a fantastic summer movie that might- just might -leave people not only entertained but perhaps a little more enlightened as well."--Mark Gordon, Producer, "The Day After Tomorrow."Think about that before you jump into conclusions.</fullReview>

There are no boring sequences of formulas, or pedantic lectures. The story is action oriented but remains true to the basic science. There is a great deal we don't know about our own weather and climate history. Could there be a real "Day After Tomorrow"? The movie will make you think about it. Good acting, great special effects, and interesting cast. I thought the young brainy high school girl was a nice touch. Shows you can be brainy and attractive too. It was a little over the top on the political correctness meter. Especially ironic since the movie was produced by Fox, and features Fox television news often.

		<shortDescription>Quite impressive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a fan of this genre. I went solely on the strength of the trailer which tweaked my interest. I'll sit through most anything that has a giant tsunami. (What can I say?) But after seeing the film, which I thought was thrilling, I decided the negative reviewers were just a bunch of sour-pusses. The film is tightly paced, convincing in terms laid out in the film (those who criticize it's "science" didn't seem to have the same problem when reviewing "Independence Day"...someone explain that to me), a plot that sets up the sole reason we bought a ticket (to see impressive special effects...and these are stunning), and to have a good time.I worried that I'd seen the whole movie in the trailers, but there's a considerable wealth of images that are in store for the ticket holder. Particularly, images from the Space Station were stirring. And a sequence on a Russian tanker was surprisingly tense. The audience I saw the film with were quite sober. There wasn't laughter (laughter at) except during the times the film invites laughter to break the tension. There's a post-apocalyptic 9/11 burn to the film that isn't exploitive. But after learning that real disaster can happen in New York City, it's difficult to see even more, even though this is fantasy. So the film has an emotional depth that isn't necessarily earned. These are cartoon figures which the genre demands; otherwise we'd be thrown into the unbearable state that films like "Testament" (1983) illicit. We're not in the theater for a lecture, any more than we "learned" something about cloning from "Jurassic Park" or life on other planets from "Independence Day." This film was as much fun and as visually important as the "Jurassic Park" series, and I hope everyone will give it a go. (Environmentalists who are picketing the film need to direct their efforts toward Congressional leaders...not movie producers.)In my experience it far out paces "Earthquake," "Poseidon Adventure," and the leaden "Towering Inferno." I even think this is more successful (as a work of film art) than "Independence Day" which was cloying in it's nationalism. Here, we're given a fairer portrait of our Washington leaders, and those who feel it's "controversial" because it shows a "strong" Vice President seem to be the same people who are complaining about the "science." If this film is meant to criticize any particular administration, it's a very lame jab. The Vice President in this movie is a stock character in these kinds of films. If you're offended you're being way too thin-skinned (or perhaps defensive). Have fun. Go see it. It's a great popular entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite Science, Disaster Movie Has A Lot of Heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spectacular effects along with good characters and smart script regardless of the science. Finally, a movie comes along that has the excitement and thrills of disaster of disasters along with a strong characters and a good relational development that is usually lacking in most disaster movies. Usually the stereotypical Airport or Earthquake movie is mostly bypassed in this movie except for the poor and downtrodden and a dog. But people die...sometimes unexpectedly...but realistically and poignantly.The fusion of a good story along with a fantastic backdrop makes for a definitely superior kind of movie. Dennis Quaid comes through as does Ian Holm. There is a spattering of humor in the right places to ease the tension, but unlike most movies it is done with tact and is never over the top - mostly real, informal humor. While there are a few unbelievable sequences and the specific science controversial, the entertainment value and the fundamental premise are intact.Eight out of Ten Stars.[11/11/07 - post-script: The special effects fail to hold up on the small screen, allowing the more pedestrian script weaknesses to make more of a presence. While the over commentary remains the same, some of the glamour and big splashy physical experience and impact have become dull. Likely Seven out of Ten Stars.]</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some of those who have trashed this movie do so on the grounds of the science. But the fact remains, many animals from the pleiostene flash-frozen in Siberia and China. So at some point 10 to 20 thousand years ago there was indeed a huge rapid temperature drop. It may not have happened the way the movie depicts, but so what? The cast is good and the special effects are great. The pace is a bit rapid, but then weather needs some pacing in order to stay interesting. I would have liked to have seen more scenes from Europe and Asia, but the NYC stuff was spectacular. The Russian freighter drifting down Fifth Avenue was quite memorable as was the depiction of flash freezing fuel lines on British Royal Airforce Helicopters. Highly recommend this movie for anyone even remotely interested in climate and weather and smart hot high school coeds.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am surprised at the mud slinging the movie received. This movie must be watched for its special effects. In a movie theatre here in India, there were loud claps when the map showed that the storm will not affect the southern hemisphere including India. Another aspect I liked about the movie are the soft moments amidst all the nature disasters such as the romance between Sam and Laura, the team spirit showed by Jack, Jason and Frank and the jokes by the nerd Brian and homeless man Luther. Overall, a good time-pass, not to mention that I have become more careful now with my 'polluting' habits. I give this movie a rating of 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't go in to see The Day After Tomorrow expecting to love it, but that is exactly what happened. I really love this movie. It throws in just about every disaster film that you can think of (tornados, earthquakes, snow storms, hurricanes) except for asteriods. The movie may have a far fetched premise (global warming causes an ice age?) but once trouble begins, it never stops. You are hooked to your seat throughout most of the movie. I honestly didn't if there was a right time to go to the bathroom. I hope this movie makes people listen to environmentalists that say that the continued use of fossil fuels may seriously hurt the Earth. Though this movie is fiction, I do think we need to rethink our energy policy. Are you listening President Bush and Vice President Cheney? Note: the actors in this movie playing the President and Vice President who take no action until it is too late bear a striking resemblance to our current President and Vice President. I think that is intentional and I think it is deserved. The acting in this movie, lead by the always watchable Dennis Quaid, is above average.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Today, Tomorrow, Who cares?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK... first off, let me say that I am a devout disaster movie fan. I have a number of disaster DVD's in my collection which range from subtle messages (The China Syndrome) to the slam, whish BANG (Towering Inferno). So, usually going into a disaster movie, I know not to expect too much because the genre, at many times seems to kill itself by it's subject matter. Case in point, The Day After Tomorrow. When I saw the previews, I knew I had to see it. So, I went out on it's first day of release and saw it and I have to say that I was totally dissapointed in this movie. I concluded that Mr. Emmerich has either watched too many or not enough disaster movies in his time. The movie was filled with evey cliche' (I need to find my son, whom I need to spend more time with, NOW that I'm faced with the fact that he may be dead), every stupid villian (the MEAN vice president), the token special effects that override every other thing in the movie (twisters in LA!), and most of all , the citizens of the United States, being cast as the dumbest, spoiled, inconsiderate people on the face of this earth. (Because obviously, the president knows everything.)Anyway, let me sum it up, as someone else has commented, this film could have been so much more... I would have felt great about the movie if I could have walked out of it feeling scared as hell that this could actually happen. I would have felt good if the destruction of the world (because we all live in New York and LA) could have been spread out in more than the first 30 minutes of the movie, and I would have felt OK if everyone in this movie wasn't so gosh darn stupid (because obviously, if a twister touched down in our backyards, we would try and videotape it from 30 feet away while our house is being torn down.)I'll probably buy the DVD when it comes out at christmas time and when I hear Dennis Quaid in the behind the scenes documentary on the disc (AND IT BETTER HAVE ONE) say "Roland really knew how to write a smart, thrilling disaster movie" or.. "this film really shows what could happen with the way that we are destroying our world" I will laugh out loud, while riding down the street in my H2 and in the same sentence complain about how much I'm paying to keep it filled up, because it's my duty as an American!....... Right?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, let's get the politics and the science out of the way... This is a movie - designed first and foremost to sell tickets and entertain folks. If it happens to leave some people thinking serious thoughts, that's a by-product. Many people are reviewing this film based on their perceptions of its perceived political agenda vis-a-vis their own. Others are reviewing it based on scientific accuracy. Both approaches miss the point.The basic science underlying this film is solid. The extrapolation and time compression needed to compress processes with time scales in decades, or even centuries, into a two hour movie are, predictably, kinda silly. The politics is simply there, whether you agree with its portrayal or not.I've believed for quite some time that Dennis Quaid is arguably the most underrated actor of his generation, and this film does nothing to shake that belief. However, all of the parts in this are well cast. As with all Emmerich films, the plot has logical holes thought which you could drive several freighters of the size he shows floating through a flooded New York City.Still, overall, the film works. It has perhaps one too many subplots and could have been more tightly edited. I saw it with a late matinee opening day audience and everyone seemed to appreciate the same things. And I don't mean the truly awesome CGI. The things the audience appreciated were the thinly veiled depiction of Vice President Cheney and some simple jokes used to lighten the mood. One of the ones which received the best reaction was one where the good guys were in a library trying to decide which books to burn for heat.Is it a substantial movie? Not really, but then neither were the other Emmerich summer blockbusters. It does do a good job of explaining in simple terms the paradox of how global warming could trigger an ice age by the Earth's climate's own self healing properties, so that much is useful. Still, viewers would be wise to remember that the show's educational value all occurs within the first 10 minutes. After that, it's all flights of the script writer's fancy. Even at its silliest and most illogical, it does raise one serious question, though - if we know our actions will result in catastrophe, should we ignore them if the catastrophe happens in our children's or grandchildren's life times?Whether you want to think, learn, or simply enjoy a good summer movie with lots of awesome special effects, this is good value for your time and money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gave this movie a 9, not so much as a comment on its intellectual status but on its effect visually. I was ducking and weaving objects hurtling toward me. The visual effects are the most entertaining part of this movie. And in my opinion the actors weren't necessary , apart from "let's show what happens when you stand out in a storm". Considering that about half of humanity is wiped out there is surprisingly very little blood actually shown,( a disappointment to 'Kill Bill' fans ). A few chuckles were to be had, mainly at the "only in America scenes". The best actor by far is the dog, and the worst "wimpiest portrayal of an American President".This movie will probably not be the huge blockbuster hit that its makers hope, with a $125,000,000 budget and a probable 75 mil on promotion, this movie will struggle to break even. It will most probably get nominated for visual effects in the 'Oscars', but there are few other redeeming points.</fullReview>

They could make or break this film, and to be they made it.The story is much more than "father tries to rescue the world and his son", it's about the compassion in others, our abuse of natural resources, learning from our mistakes, and our political stance in the world.This is a very humbling film with great visuals and a story so extreme it can't be completely impossible.If you want an easy to down 2 hours, get this film and watch it, just be sure to get it in the best quality possible, you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>End of the world movies these days seem to be dime-a-dozen, like Die Hard-esquire action flicks were years ago, and like PG-13 horror remakes sadly seem to be these days. This is another one of them, a prolific, epic film that tries as hard as it can to be intelligent and gripping. It wants to impress you with knowledge, special effects, and a very moving, risky, adventurous plot. But is it worth all that if your plot turns out half baked and unfinished? That's the deal with The Day After Tomorrow---there are the pieces of a really great thriller/action/post-apocalyptic film here, but nobody bothered to put them together.For instance, a plot involving our main character's wife and a young disabled boy whom she treats in the hospital where she works. This would've likely been a pretty good plot element, and it was touching from what little we saw, but nobody bothered to expand on it and make it an actual part of the story. It was just a tidbit on the side, barely even an element of the plot at all. The romance elements as well were there, just not expanded upon enough. In fact, most of the characters in general weren't as fleshed out as they could've been. Expanding upon their rather shallow exteriors could've made for a world-class movie, but alas that was not to be. The ending as well, felt very hollow, like they just had to end it to meet a deadline. It wasn't a bad ending, but it could've been so much more. And thus, we're left with a movie that feels like they didn't work as hard as they could've. This is a movie that tried to fit in elements from adventure films, a bit of romance, and of course some current world issues into one film, which apparently was too short to house all of it. All of these things just crush the film with their weight. Expanding the running length with a more fleshed out plot and characters would've benefited this, but it's entertaining nonetheless.It's not without it's merits, though, for this is still worthy of an 8/10. This is a movie with big money behind it, and of course all of the visuals are stunning, beautiful, yet absolutely devastating and terrible, chaotic. All of the special effects here were orchestrated perfectly, and thus this is a film best viewed on a large screen with surround-sound speakers. Tidal waves, tornadoes, snowstorms, and more, all in their whole, destructive forms. That's the best thing about this one, I'd say, the special effects. Too bad they sacrificed plot elements for it.

		<shortDescription>The end of the world never seemed as photogenic as it seems in this disaster film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>German director Roland Emmerich, who never ceases to search for new ways to destroy New York City, outdoes himself once again in this spectacular epic that took my breath away over and over again just from watching its trailers. Emmerich, who already wreaked havoc across The Big Apple with aliens (Independence Day) and monsters (Godzilla) recruits the biggest villain of them all to cleanse the city of its immoral ground this time around ? mother nature itself.When an abrupt global warming occurs, a father (Dennis Quaid - Innerspace, Dragonheart) swears to do anything he can in order to save his beloved son (Jake Gylenhaal - Brokeback Mountain, Donnie Darko), who is stuck in the middle of a damaged NYC. While this little tale might feel touching and cute at times, it's obvious that the main characters of the film are the special f/x that amaze the viewer over and over again. Being such, Day After Tomorrow serves as a "must see" for anyone who values big-budgeted disaster outings, and doesn't mind having a side plot pretending to be "Finding Nemo" on ice and hurricanes. Because in the bottom line - the end of the world never seemed as photogenic as it seems in this disaster film that stars Quaid alongside youngsters Gylenhaal and Emmy Rossum (Mystic River, The Phantom of the Opera).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not quite top notch...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Day After Tomorrow is overflowing with brilliant special effects, epic scenes of death and destruction, a meaty subject matter and a famous cast and director. Could anything be better for this film? Well, the answer is... yes. The Day After Tomorrow was good, by all standards. But it really is just another big budget Hollywood blockbuster, and won't be changing any environmental policies anytime soon. The film was very predictable from start to finish - it would have worked better had it been more realistic, but there's always got to be heroes and glory, hasn't there? The character development may have been shoddy and non-existent, but at least the people we followed felt like real people rather than a faceless mass thrown into a CGI-filled world to be put in danger and narrowly avoid death. And to be fair, this film was never boring. We actually had an idea of the struggles our main characters went through - even if they all just seemed to merely pass by before our eyes. The special effects are breathtaking and the action is top-notch - Roland Emmerich has created a film worthy to be called a hit. This film probably will have you thinking - could this happen to us one day soon? But with the constant sentimentality running throughout the film and unrealistic narrow brushes with death, it's hard to say this film is a realistic depiction of a possibly destructive nearby future. Though to be honest, this really is just another popcorn movie. And teenagers will love it. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overall, The Day After Tomorrow was not impressive when examining the plot. Basically, a killer storm strikes the world with no past symptoms, solely caused by global warming. Or maybe it was the demented man further south playing with his weather machine, which in reality is easier to swallow than the entire situation in this movie. To watch The Day After Tomorrow, just turn your brain off (which I did) and it is entirely watchable. The actors all had great performances, with no cheesy lines that are memorable. Also, the special effects are good for grabbing your attention. Another good aspect of The Day After Tomorrow was that many of the characters were likable. Now for the bad points of this movie. Firstly, the gigantic bursts of death that froze people were laughable. So, it's 27 or so degrees in one part, but -200 or so degrees just inches away because of the killer storm. The winds are so quick that they can chase down and down a helicopter (by instantly freezing the fuel... riiiight...) but Gyllenhaal can outrun the "freezing winds of death" without breaking a sweat. Just when the wind is about to enter the final room in the library and kill everyone there instantly, the door is closed locking the air outside - but actually, only a little air gets in. That's OK, because a pocket-sized fire is enough to save them. It always has to happen that way.The CGI wolves were hilarious. Especially when one of them pounces for the kill, only to have the door closed just in time so that he goes splat. Just another cliché, and there's a long list of them. Spoilers - The end was OK. It was a bit cliché, with an entire phalanx of Chinooks landing simultaneously as the camera pans out to show the massive ice layer that swallowed New York. I can't say this movie was good, but it wasn't bad. I would recommend it for a rainy day, but it's not worth watching otherwise.6/10</fullReview>

I disagree. There is a scene in the movie that takes place in a museum. Sam and company are looking at a diorama of a mammoth with a voice-over explaining the circumstances of its death. When I first saw that scene, it reminded me of an actual mammoth found in Siberia. What was remarkable was that the only damage to it was on it's head. The locals who found it were carving it in to steaks. Also, upon closer examination, the mammoth was found to have buttercups in its stomach and in its mouth, meaning it froze to death before it could swallow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plain terrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(some spoilers may be ahead) For a movie that's listed #39th in the international box office (at time of writing), I thought this movie was plain terrible. It started off with an exciting storyline, but nothing in this movie lived up to it. The worst part was the acting and clichéd moments. The part where Dennis Quaid was trying to save his friend from falling through the ice, it was too dam cheesy, total lack of creativity, too predictable, poor attempt to create drama. This movie tries too hard to be an movie of epic proportions, but it never came close. The focus on the movie should have been lots of mother nature disasters happening all over the world. But too much time was wasted on the characters relationships, the unnecessary dragged out dramas. It's just that these sort of movies you couldn't care less about them, you paid to see earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, stuff like that. I guess we did get a fair chunk of it, but I guess I wasn't satisfied.Good parts of the movie? Not a lot, it had a cute girl in it. That Jake Gayenhael had a wee little love interest in her, I liked that part.Special effects? Well I'll admit they were pretty good. Cool tidal wave effects, cool tornado effects too. Would have like to have seen more buildings and stuff get blown away, but hey you gotta stick to your CGI budget these days.Overall its an OK movie to waste your time on, but its not something you'd go into expecting excellent things out of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The special effects are awesome, but the film itself is a disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Day After Tomorrow is just another Roland Emmerich big-budget extravaganza which pays little attention to trivial aspects of film-making, such as a good plot, dialogue or even a large amount of excitement. But hey, it has awesome special effects, so who the hell cares? In my opinion, The Day After Tomorrow is overrated - it's 6.2 rating on IMDb is a bit too high for my liking. Not only that, but the ending is both stupid and inconclusive.Anyhow, The Day After Tomorrow revolves around a father, son and the world around them, which suddenly suffers the effects of global warming. Los Angeles suffers tornadoes and twisters, while Washington D.C freezes over. In fact, the world enters a state of climatic flux. There is an underlying subplot indicating how their struggle for survival has brought Sam and his father Jack closer together, but I see it as little more than an excuse for Emmerich to showcase more special effects. The dialogue is also substandard, but I more or less expected this. This movie's greatest fault is that it is simply not exciting enough. For a high-budget disaster epic, it is rather boring and unengaging, which is a surprise. Another issue I have with The Day After Tomorrow is with its ending. The film ends just like that, leaving me with a quizzical expression on my face and a reasonably sour taste in my mouth. On the other hand, the acting, particularly by the leads Dennis Quaid and Jake Gylenhall, is quite decent, as they both manage to capture some of the urgency which would be prevalent in such a precarious situation. The rest of the cast are OK, but no outstanding performances come to mind. Did I mention that the special effects in this movie are bloody awesome and are among the best that I have ever seen? Some people may think that I have not given The Day After Tomorrow much of a chance. Well, if you are thinking that, let me tell you...I really wanted to enjoy this film, I really did. I have tried to sit through it multiple times but I have only managed to once. This is because I feel that The Day After Tomorrow is little more than an overrated bore which tries to compensate for its lack of entertainment value by using (admittedly great) special effects. If you are a special effects buff or a Roland Emmerich fan, by all means, go see The Day After Tomorrow as it is one of his better pictures (not like that's saying much). But if you want to see a good disaster movie, go see War of The Worlds.2.5/5 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In movies like "Twister" you only get one real disaster, although admittedly it's a doozie. In movies like "Earthquake" you can get several disasters for the price of one -- the ground shakes, dams burst and cause floods, there may be a fire. In movies like "The Day After Tomorrow" you get no end of disasters, and you flirt with the end of the world too.Let me see. Floods. Tsunamis. Cold snaps beyond belief. Tornadoes. (No fires.) A sick child threatened with abandonment. A sick adult who needs medicine that can only be found in a super dangerous place. A gigantic crevasse in the ice into which men and machines fall. (This will have to do in lieu of an earthquake.) Hurricanes. Blizzards. Airplane crashes. The doomed team having a final drink of twelve-year old scotch. A middle-aged man hiking in snowshoes from Washington to New York hauling a sled, in order to be with his trapped son because "I promised him." Other things of similar ilk.I didn't mind so much seeing LA get it. Nothing against the Capitol Records Building (which takes off in a tornado like a stack of frisbees). It's just knowing that the storm is taking along with it several dozen Taj Mahal Motels painted day-glo purple. And the "Hollywood" sign, which, to borrow a phrase, looks like "an explosion in a shingle factory." On the other hand it was tragic to see New York first inundated by seawater and then frozen solid. The notion of patrons in The White Horse Tavern frozen stiff while still hunched over their chessboards brought tears to my eyes. And the frosty statues in Julius's, immobilized during a sip of a martini, pinkies still pointed upward.Actually, the special effects are very good. The flood in New York is naturally much better than George Pal's justly celebrated earlier version. And there's something appealing about scenes in which people creep about on deserted ships.That, by the way, reminds me of the one big surprise in the movie. Hundreds of people are trapped by the flood on the upper stories of the New York Public Library, shouting at one another, and suddenly everyone goes quiet. A very low rumble is heard from the avenue outside. People rush to the windows and what we see is shocking -- the prow of a huge Russian tanker proceeding uptown with slow majesty.I guess, from reading the "trivia" entries, that the director was serious in his concern about global warming -- as he should be. The movie doesn't really convey that anxiety. I know a little about climatology but the explanation got passed me. (Maybe the book made more sense.) As it is, the science we hear is very sketchy and given by fiat. (Why does atmospheric subsidence over the Canadian north bring with it storm and snow instead of stability and low temperatures?) Because Dennis Quaid's model says it does? Anyway, I was lost.The last ice ages left us with our immediate hominid ancestors ("Cro-Magnon"), woolly mammoths, and who knows what else? This one seems to leave us in thrall to tropical third-world countries, which should make for an interesting sequel.I enjoyed the movie's visuals. (It's impossible to comment on the acting.) What's worrisome is that global warming -- despite a multitude of attempt to muddy the scientific waters -- is now pretty much universally accepted by investigators without vested interests. "The Day After Tomorrow" turns it into an excuse for just another expensive disaster flick.It's worth watching though. That Russian ship groaning past the Public Library is a gem.</fullReview>

But in this stupid "the day after tomorrow" they didn't even drink one BIT of water!!!! How can they even live??????Fifth, the whole city was full of ice, and it's even higher than some buildings.

But the scene where NY freezes "instantly" all the windows break, but the concrete buildings keeps standing, that's impossible since the concrete would break as well. So folks don't do as I did, save you money, wait and fall asleep to this movie when it's on TV in six months.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think of really good horror movie when I watched this movie.Its scary to even think of that even happening to any part of the world(especially NY).This movie also had really good casting like Jake Gyellenhal.I hope this movie is nominated for an Oscar.The special effects were really really convincing.It felt like New York was really getting this crazy storm.I think if I was in that situation I would die because I get very worried in just little situations.This movie showed the next Ice age (if it were to happen),this movie showed that the whole north part of the world being attacked by the blizzard.I would rate this movie BIG 10 STARS!Must see movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first fun summer popcorn movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is exactly what the trailer promises: A fun summer popcorn movie. Sit back, relax, entertainment has returned to the multiplex. Not since Twister has there been an action disaster film filled with this much fun. So the global warming issue may be on the exaggerated level, don't let the right-wing fools talk you into avoiding this rollercoaster ride! If I were to have one complaint it would be that the film is too short and did not show enough actual disaster footage. The filmmakers could have shown a far more indepth look at what a major pain in the butt evacuating half of the country would be like but they didn't. It was more of a footnote than a subplot. The first attack of bad weather in Tokyo is very cool. First time I can remember seeing hail used in a disaster film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Apocalyptic Movie Which Does Justice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Day After Tomorrow, while drenched with some of the richest special effects seen since The Lord of the Rings, The Matrix, and Star Wars, is rich in both character depth and plot quality. It is easy to be awed by the movie magic but one must be careful not to overlook the important message imbued within the movie. The political importance of the concern with global warning is an undertone throughout the entire film (in some scenes it is more prevalent) but it does not take away from the grand scope of The Day After Tomorrow. Not since Stephen King's, "The Stand" has a movie of global disaster done the genre justice. Movies such as "Deep Impact" and "Armageddon" fall far short in their attempts to lure the audience in with the promise of a cataclysmic event, only to find that the heroes come through in the eleventh hour to save the world from dire calamity! In The Day After Tomorrow, the heroes do not save the day for everyone in the world, or, more specifically, in the Northern Hemisphere. While there is a bit of stark heroism intertwined with the plot, it is not so trite as to be tacky. The Day After Tomorrow is WELL worth the wait and should serve as a benchmark for future disaster movies to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is a movie in which the (possible) dramatic consequences of Global Warming are displayed. The message is simple: If we, and that is especially the U.S., keep on destroying our environment, there is the terrible danger that someday, nature will strike back. In Emmerichs movie, this "strike" is a new Ice Age.End of message, end of movie.But: All people here seem to be caring about is how dull the plot was and how insolent it is to bother Americans with such a topic after 9/11.I really feel for the victims of this tragedy, but the essence of the movie is lost is these complaints. Because if some kind of weather crisis would actually someday be happening, it would be far worse than a hundred 9/11s together. It is always simple to escape into dream worlds - but the truth remains out there, and it is not about a quarrel between Liberals and Republicans, but about our future. Let's hope Emmerichs vision will never come true. But don't look away from the reality of pollution, wasting our natural resources and Global Warming. That would be an insult to your intelligence...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Movie This Year!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK I have just got back from seeing it and all I can say is wow! Actually that is not true I will go into more about it (without spoilers) and make an argument against all the trolls.The movie has spectacular, realistic visuals. Some of the scenes are breath taking... Much better than scenes from similar movies like Deep Impact, as they are realistic and sudden. One of the beauty's of this film is the sudden events and changes, just like the weather believe it or not. The story is pretty linear, which in my opinion goes perfect in this kind of movie. Do not expect to go to see a movie with a complex storyline or deep character development because that is not what this is about. The other thing I loved about this movie compared to other disaster movies is it actually shows what happens after the disaster. I read one review saying the ending was rushed, too be honest I do not think he even saw the movie. For once you get to see what happens after the disaster. Independance Day for example just ends when the Aliens are defeated, it doesn't go into what happens to mankind after, this does a little more. By this I don't mean it tells you everything, but you get the idea or direction after the storm.OK about all the people saying "this is anti-republican" or "this is unrealistic", I just don't understand you guys. Firstly, this is not anti-republican, its simply a disaster movie. It says global warming is to blame, yes, but it just says its mankind's fault. This has pretty much been proven many times before that we are causing damage to the environment (CFCs from before, CO2 emissions from vehicles). Anyway the other thing about realism, people are saying "how can global warming cause an ice age", well it is only a theory, but it is to do with the desalination of the oceans (reduction in salt) and this is due to the melting of the polar icecaps. Basically this increase in cool, desalinated water effects the speeds of currents, effecting the speed of currents then can effect of major currents, i.e. the gulf stream. Anyway, this leads to the chain reaction and I'm sure you have seen the trailers. Again its to do with air pressure changes due to current changes, etc, etc.Anyway I will shut up now, go and see it expecting a great action movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good summer stuff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know why people can't just watch a film and not dissect it. 'The Day After Tomorrow' is a summer blockbuster, not a treatise on the effects of global warming. and as a summer blockbuster, I really enjoyed it. Okay, so the subplot about the kid with cancer was pretty lame, but they had to give the Mum something to do while the Dad went off to save the kid. and as for that - why wouldn't Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) go to save his son (Jake Gyllenhaal)? He has the knowledge of how to protect himself against the elements and has a belief that he can save him. Dennis Quaid is actually pretty good in the film, though I think that it's really made by the subtlety of Gyllenhaal's performance. He manages to be believable as a 17 year old kid who is forced to be heroic, all whilst trying to romance the girl (who might be blind - why didn't she snap him up sooner?).It isn't the best movie ever made, but it certainly isn't the worst. Anyone see 'The Phantom Menace'? 'Godzilla'?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The scientific evidence for the basis of the movie has been muddied by a propaganda campaign by the oil and gas industry to continue business as usual. The fact of the matter is that the atmosphere is a "closed system" and people have been adding cultural air pollution for decades.It is true that heavy sun spot activity or vulcanism can "trump" incremental changes from man's pollution of the atmosphere. However, what is being added to the atmosphere IS not helping the climate but making it much more difficult to predict the weather. Thus, it is difficult for the weather guessers to comfortably predict from season to season what is happening. My "hat is off" to Roland Emmerich for raising the issue in this film to cause the discussion. I do not know if the variability will cause a sudden change but there is evidence in the fossil record that things can happen very quickly. They fact of the matter is if the ocean currents shut down as predicted in the film, a lot of folks are not just going to be inconvenienced. They will simply die just as quickly as the mammoths who died with butter cups in their mouths. Sign this from a geologist who has thought about this for decades.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Day After Tomorrow, released in 2004 and starring Dennis Quaid and Jake Gyllenhaal is a natural disaster apocalypse film from the director of Independence Day; Roland Emmerich.This CGI packed action adventure gives the audience everything they could hope for and much more. The lead roles played by Quaid and Gyllenhaal are superbly acted, especially when Quaid's character must choose to trek through the fast approaching ice age to save his son (Gyllenhaal) at any cost.The story is immaculately written and portrayed on screen, delivering a message that will stick with you long after watching this film.When given the choice between more recent apocalyptic film 2012 and The Day After Tomorrow, I would pick the latter every single time. They are both excellent films, but The Day After Tomorrow brings a sense of realism and believability with both it's scenario and story line. I came away from watching The Day After Tomorrow actually scared that something of a similar nature could very well happen.This isn't just another "Inconvenient Truth" styled documentary film, but a fictional story based on events that could possibly happen. The Day After Tomorrow is a film definitely worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly, pretentious nonsense. However well intentioned</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roland Emmerich must really hate the world. Otherwise he wouldn't keep destroying it. He had aliens shoot the hell out of it in Independence Day. Godzilla stomped on it. And now in The Day After Tomorrow, Mother Nature trashes it.I must admit to not being a particularly huge fan of Roland Emmerich. His films exist only as action spectacles, with a thin semblance of plot connecting each loud setpiece together, populated by stock characters with easily predictable arcs and motivations.Independence Day may have been the top money-maker of 1996, and attracted a wealth of A-list actors, but all the criticisms I mentioned above apply. And they apply to The Day After Tomorrow too.But, I think TDAT is a slightly better film. Don't get me wrong, I know it's cheesy. Some of the dialogue is unintentionally laugh out loud funny, and the science is completely off the charts. But what allows the film to transcend the silliness is its theme of global warming. How we are slowly destroying our own home.There were times during TDAT I felt like I was watching a ballooned up documentary on the dangers of environmental hazards. But its nice to see a well budgeted flick with something profound to say in this day and age. Even if it hammers its message across to do it.Years of consuming vital fuels and polluting the atmosphere are finally beginning to take they're toll. Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid), one of the world's foremost climatologists leads an expedition to the Antarctic to measure climate shifts. But Jack and his team barely escape with their lives when the ice inexplicably breaks apart.Jack addresses his concerns to the Vice President that if we don't stop squandering our natural resources, there will be consequences. And he's proved right not long after when weather patterns all around the world go crazy. Tornadoes wreck LA (including the Hollywood sign), tidal waves flood New York, and worst of all, the world is about ready to enter a new Ice Age. As freezing winter closes in, Jack and a number of others have to ride out the storm until it blows over.As long as you're prepared to ignore the absurd science, clichéd situations and really quite laughable dialogue, you may actually have a fun time during The Day After Tomorrow.Like Independence Day, the film chooses to focus on a select number of people weathering (OK, bad pun!) the insurmountable odds in their own way.So we have Dennis Quaid trying to get to New York on foot from Washington to reunite with his estranged son Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal), who's trapped in a frozen NY library with potential love interest Laura (Emmy Rossum).Quaid's wife, Dr Lucy Hall (Sela Ward) stays by the side of (wait for it!), a dying cancer patient.And meteorologist Professor Terry Rapson (Ian Holm) is trapped in a weather station with two colleagues, resigned to their fates that they will never see another sunrise.Roland Emmerich does have a rather annoying habit of sketching his characters in easily guessable scenarios, but the good news is he's polished his act in the interim since Independence Day. There are still a few of the usual faults that crop up in just about every film he gets his hands on, but TDAT is still more enjoyable than most of his efforts.Credit is due to the cast, who give more than the film deserves. Dennis Quaid is good as always, giving conviction to the clichéd role of the inattentive father. Although I thought Sela Ward was wasted in a very thankless storyline. An actress of her talents should have been allowed to contribute more to the story.Jake Gyllenhaal is OK but he's been better in other films. What he needs is a sharp script and taut direction to bring out his natural strengths as an actor. Films like Donnie Darko and October Sky. TDAT tends to place him in a generic subplot with no real opportunity to flex his acting muscles.One bright spot to Sam's story is the actress who plays his love interest, Emmy Rossum. She's quite an appealing actress with a beautifully expressive face. She makes Laura a perfectly rounded, intensely watchable character. I'll be looking out for Emmy Rossum in films in the future.And Ian Holm does what he can with the limited screen time he's given. He's not provided with much of a part to play, but he's a good enough actor to flesh out his role with warmth and humour, without the slightest bit of pretension.Still, Emmerich can't resist including one-dimensional stock characters. Like the bureaucratic VP who doesn't see sense when it could have made a difference. One thing that is surprising about Roland Emmerich is he's German with an almost absolute reverence for the good old US of A. The Americans in ID4 almost single-handedly fought off the alien invaders, defending the flag, the pie and the 4th of July.Interestingly, Emmerich seems to have modified his views since then. The Americans no longer seem as squeaky clean in TDAT. Dennis Quaid pointedly brings up the Kyoto Accords, and there's a wonderfully amusing moment when the Americans become illegal immigrants in Mexico, because its warmer. There may be hope for Emmerich yet.The special effects are just as good as you'd expect. The sight of tornadoes shredding the Hollywood sign is awesome. As is a frozen solid Statue of Liberty. But the way it all passes over in a matter of days is startling in its narrative silliness.Still, The Day After Tomorrow is a worthwhile film. It has many glaring faults and some unbelievable acts of heroism, but it is one of Roland Emmerich's better films, it has a few gentle surprises, superb FX, and it's that rare thing. A Hollywood blockbuster with something to say.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Plea For Kyoto</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm certainly in no position to comment on the science put forth in this film. When I was going to school, I remember being taught in science class that the Ice Age was a gradual process that took place over thousands of years and then it took thousands again to reverse it. Of course we didn't have man around using all the planet's resources for industry. But scientist Dennis Quaid says that the Ice Age will dawn upon man again and soon. But it happens a whole lot sooner than even he predicts and the nations of the world pay for it.The first half of the film is Quaid's struggle in vain to persuade our government, particularly a Vice President played by Kenneth Welsh who bears no accidental resemblance to Dick Chaney of the folly of its environmental policy.When doomsday strikes, the action shifts to Quaid trekking to New York to rescue his son Jake Gyllenhaal who is trapped in the New York Public Library with other kids from an Academic Bowl they were participating in. IF the science is open to speculation, the special effects are spectacular. Personally the sight of that freighter sailing up a flooded 42nd Street is something to behold. And the whiz kids who survive prove to be pretty resourceful.The Day After Tomorrow is Hollywood's appeal for the USA to sign and obey the Kyoto Accords. Hollywood has taken up worse causes.</fullReview>

It contains a lot of troubles in the New York city, traffic jam, flood, "tsunami", and a freezing weather. The main part of this film is survive. I wonder, if I am the one of the people there, maybe I will freeze the fastest before another, because I can't survive more longer in the minus temperature degrees! So, I'm impressed with this film.

		<shortDescription>A sensible contribution to the Global Warming Debate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roland Emmerich's film was and still is a massive visual contribution to the Global Warming Debate as well as its seamless blending of computer graphics and actual action. I am working on a genetically modified Amenity Turf as one small contribution to more efficient carbon fixing as well as providing much more land acreage for us and our children to get enjoyably healthier throughout Europe. So many commercial schemes are now being offered to offset Carbon production but for once this film concentrated on the purification of sea water by the melting of the ice cap putting the high cost of similar desalination in the Arabian Gulf into perspective] and its effects on currents and then ambient temperatures. Having helped develop very cold chambers for human athletes the freezing effects in this field were stupendously accurate as were the predicted timings of death which would happen in under eight minute in our unit which of course goes down to much lower Minus Degree Temperatures than occurred in New York elsewhere in this film. But above all this film hopefully makes everyone who watched all of it think about what they would do under a similar scenario and perhaps that it was not as unlikely to happen as we all previously thought ? Not in my lifetime should become as universal as not in my backyard ? So next time any of you smugly pay Hundred Dollars or so to Carbon Offset a recent journey to a third party allegedly intending replanting any of the 20% of the Brazilian rain forest which has been converted to Cattle Ranching or Maize and Soya cultivation, think again just who your payment will benefit and whether you could and should contribute more directly and practically ? And thank you Roland Emmerich for composing and directing this quite excellent and still timely addition to our fund of available feedback.</fullReview>

But when i watched the movie i found out i was wrong. Emmrich has put a lot of effort in this film, in both special effects and a story and it shows.The movie begins fast with natural disasters occurring all around the world. This captured my attention from the beginning of the film and kept it till the end.Some people argue that there was no storyplot. I disagree. The basic storyplot is a father trying to find his son and battling the obstacles.The special effects are nothing less than breathtaking. A monster tsunami destroying manhattan is superb to watch. You don't want to even blink as the the massive chaos is worth to watch. Buses getting flipped, Statue of Liberty half covered in water, windows shattering and the wall of water surrounding new york is terrific. Other awesome special effects include instant freezing and monster tornadoes which are a eye pleasure. Even though i knew it was CGI animation, i was led to believe it was real. Good work on the effects.The acting is good in some parts and bad in some. but mostly good.This movie will keep you glued to your chair the whole time.

		<fullReview>The most disturbing thing about this film is that the events depicted are all too plausible. Ok, I'm not so sure about the super-cool air, but the rest of it all makes perfect science sense. I actually saw a documentary about a year ago about how if the Gulf Stream was stopped (due to desalination in the sea) then Britain would become like today's Northern Canada. This film makes use of that and serves as a chilling warning about what will happen if we continue to pollute the Earth. The acting was overall good, and you did care if the characters were going to live or die. The plot was a little predictable at times, but in a disaster movie they nearly always are. But the main thing about this film is respect. Respect for Nature. Now I don't claim to be a great eco-warrior, but it is concerning when you see just how easily these events can occur. If just 1 person in 100 in America or other heavily-polluting states stops and thinks about what their country is doing, and takes steps to stop by doing a but more recycling, then the film will have achieved its purpose. And the film is that good that I think it will. So please everyone, let's do just a little but more to recycle, or switch a lightbulb off, or not revving your car engine so much, just that bit more to help save the Earth. Even something as simple as not littering will help. This film portrays a harrowing account of what will happen if we don't. Maybe not tomorrow, but probably the day after tomorrow.</fullReview>

I have never seen a rainy day look so creepy! I wanted to just get in my car and head South!I know the critic's gave this movie mostly bad reviews. Just shows how jaded they are. I'm glad word of mouth seems to be working, the first two theatres I went to for the afternoon show were sold out!It's a great movie, well worth seeing on the big screen and later adding to the personal movie library. This one I'm going to watch again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perfect family movie- no vulgarity or sex. No-one used the F word even once.Imagine being able to make a movie without it. Lots of action and catastrophic weather scenes. The science is a little weak, but at least it has some science in it. The problem solving is a little weak, but movies have long since given up being credible. People die, but it is not emphasized. No bloody, gross scenes. No children are shown dying. The family relationship is one of a over worked father who has lost sight of the importance of family. He resolves this and saves the day.This is a good combination of Twister, Vertical Limit, and Deep Impact. I will buy it when it comes out on DVD and watch it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I walked into "The Day After Tomorrow" with both excitement and caution. I love disaster films, but I'm not a fan of Emmerich's work. I sat down and had one of the most enjoyable 2 hours in a theatre I've ever had.The special effects were simply amazing, and it raised the bar for impressive effects. The FX are so convincing and look so real that I wasn't thinking of mistakes (because I couldn't see them), I just sat back and watched in complete awe as the world began a new ice age. The detail put into the graphics is amazing... from cars being pushed away from the NYC wave before the wall of water reached them, to the sparkling snow on the statue of liberty, to the shattering windows during the Deep Freeze. This was incredible work, and I recommend seeing in the theatre... you won't be able to catch this detail on a TV.The story was typical, but it wasn't terrible. And there's some good morals behind it all.4 1/2 out of 5</fullReview>

To think they created all of these places (Tokyo, Scotland, New York City, Washington D.C.) in a little studio is amazing. There is also another reason why this movie is wonderful.

		<fullReview>I think my toe nails went numb when I saw this in the theater. First of all, I live in Long Island, New York, so the effect and the way I can relate to the movie is to the max.Second, the special effects were beyond breathtaking, and can you imagine that the two blocks of New York that is shown in the movie was just built in a sound stage with water falling from the ceiling? I think this movie is not only awesome but it defines awesome.The only complain i have is that most of the actors are cardboard characters. The only one to have a complete story, well an almost complete story is Jake Gyllenhaal's character, and probably his father comes close. Everybody else just support the plotline to the point where they are needed and thats it.There is not much foreshadowing of a catastrophe that happens here. In just a few minutes, if you can measure time in that moment, you are dipped into the whole story and there is no turning back. From there its open mouth wondering and accidental cursing that just starts pouring out.The Weather with a capital W, plays the main character here. In some creepy way, It knows exactly how to predate on humans with its Monster ball hails, Uber snow storms and blinding speed temperature drops as some of its weapons.The Devil be damned, its God's Nature that needs to be stopped. And there is not a single thing that can stand in its way.A 10 out of 10.WM</fullReview>

The effects were great, the acting was great and the story lines were good. The only thing that I thought was unnecessary was the man with the professor in England who had the wife and baby that he sent to Spain. They could have left him out and the story about the professors two grandkids and it would not have mattered to the movie. Otherwise everything was good. One other plus about this movie is that it WAS NOT predictable. Even watching Independence Day, you basically knew what was going to happen scene by scene.

The story was good, the acting was fine, the special effects were great, and at times the movie was even suspenseful. There was even some emotion in the story that effectively showed through in the acting. The movie addressed relationships between adults, young people, parents and children, the government and the people, and our government and other governments. Whether realistic or not, it takes you for a ride that illustrates aspects of any real world catastrophe. In my view, It was well worth the ticket. Dennis Quaid has made his return, and there are some new faces I'm sure we will see again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Going into this movie I had such high expectations maybe too high because almost all the special effects were in the trailer. If your expecting a lot because of the awesome effects in the trailer you may just want to stay home and rent some movies or go see something else because this movie is more about the character relationships. The Plot: A huge storm is in effect and all these people are left in separate places trying to survive. A father hasn't been there for his son a lot and is trying to make up for it by saving his son. I'm trying not to give to much away because I hate when people give even little parts away. The acting is good, but sometimes they are given little to work with. The effects will blow you away, but don't expect too much because there aren't too many storms. This an exciting movie though that will have some people on the edge of there seats.

Have you slapped Deep impact, the core, Independence day, every disaster movie and then allow you to judge films that you hate with all your strength. What you commented to do if these films like there? The film, I think is great, as special effects, such as history, as it develops and the recitation of Dannis Quaid. The storyline is likely, it is very likely a future climate change like this unless countermeasures are taken. A good movie can only see people with the more open-minded. I remember the most not to follow the judgements of mass hysterical. The film is great. For these people only apply dramatic films ... If this movie was Spielberg would have had more. Since these strontium on the assumption that a film must be beautiful to be directed by big names like Spielberg, Lucas, Jackson, Cameron. .. All these assessments are wrong you understand the level of bad opinion of this site. Only films for intellectuals can be saved. This film was produced with many dollars and the optimal use of special effects make the place as among the best science fiction film Americans. Finitela of using double standards when judged as a movie, try to be objective because they give 3.8 a film of its kind and reward a crap how terrible sin city with 8.2 is really a 'offense.

		<shortDescription>An utmost entertaining modern disaster movie with a very important message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Day After Tomorrow tells the story about a select few who has to endure and fight for their lives to survive a new ice age brought on by global warming. What this film has going for it the most are the special effects which are absolutely mind-blowing a majority of the time, not to mention how stunningly believable they are.The film also offers a good story about courage and the importance of working together to overcome obstacles, told with the genre conventions of a good disaster movie. It feels like a good change that for once the main characters are everyday people (a homeless man, young students etc), while the people with the supposed power like the president and the Dick Cheney-lookalike vice president are little more than fools. The forces of the weather are a little bit too much even for the president of the United States, who can do nothing real when faced with the reality that he has ultimately helped to create.The greatest achievement of this film is however Roland Emmerich's way of putting the very important message of the environmental issue, into this high-concept film without doing it too obvious. Still, perhaps it's a bit too much in your face since I believe this is the main reason why people don't like this film. The average moviegoer doesn't want to be told that their lovely cars that they drive around in every day can cause a big disaster. People don't want to be told to be aware of the environment in any way, and just go about their business consuming the way they are used to.My only gripes with the film: 1. Jake Gyllenhaal doesn't look even one tiny bit like a 17-year old. 2. The wolves look fake. 3. The three Scottish persons saying "For England!".</fullReview>

I thought that at least one of the parents or teachers should have come to this great competition. It is not completely factual, but that was not the goal. If you want facts about this type of event go see a documentary. I liked Jack and Lucy uniting in their concern for each other and their son. It was refreshing to see teen-agers that were proud of being smart. Jack reminded me of Harrison Ford, he even held his mouth the same way Harrison Ford does in movies when he is upset. I especially appreciated the lack of sex, alcohol, profanity, and other negative behaviors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Action/Disaster with great effects and a good story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the saying goes: there's no accounting for taste. So, I strongly disagree with the negative review featured on this movie's info page. One should note, however, that the reviewer, "Libertio," gives high praise to several of the visual effects and calls the satirical scenes "potent." I think Libertio misses the point when he criticizes the story which I found plausible and of more than ordinary interest, particularly for a disaster movie. Please be aware that my "10" rating is based on a comparison with other movies of this type; it is not absolute.Furthermore, I think movie ratings should be "conditional" rather than absolute. Isn't it unfair to compare, say, "Something About Mary" with "Schindler's List?" Along these lines I would ask Libertio what other action/disaster movies does he consider superior to "Tomorrow?" As for myself, I found the effects chilling (pun intended), surprising, and awe inspiring. The scientific thesis underlying the story may be unlikely or even false as some scientists have stated, but the vast majority of scientists in the field do think that the earth is undergoing a warming period and that humans are contributing to this phenomenon.So, the-end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it story this movie postulates does reverberate in the popular mind. May I suggest that the plot may be a bit too plausible to be really enjoyed by the popular mind? Otherwise, I, for one, find it difficult to account for the overall lowish rating given in IMDb's survey.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure Entertainment: Tornado, Flood and Freeze Warning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Written and Directed by: Roland Emmerich. Starring: Dennis Quaid, Jake Gyllenhaal, Ian Holm, Emmy Rossum, Arjay Smith. Running Time: 124mins (approx). Rating: PG-13 (US). 12A (UK).*MINOR SPOILERS*8 years after he graced our screens with his Sci-Fi 'End of the World' blockbuster, Independance Day, Roland Emmerich is back with a different take on the 'End of the World' experience, The Day After Tomorrow focuses on global warming melting the ice caps and causing a change in the Ocean's currents, ultimately causing a pattern of severe weather changes.Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid, Traffic), a Government climatologist discovers the afore-mentioned weather change before it actually happens, but as it goes, no one is listening to him as he reveals the up-coming pattern change at a UN meeting in Dubai, where - to no ones curiosity, it starts to snow. As killer-hailstones start to fall in Tokyo and snow covers most of Europe, the powers-that-be in the US - Still not listening to Hall, dismiss them as simply a case of bad weather. As things get worse and Tornados hit Los Angeles and New York is flooded then frozen, the old, I Told You So factor comes into play, with the President and his men trying to bargain their way out of it. Here comes the journey... Jack's son, Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal, Donnie Darko) is stuck in the Great Public Library of New York with a few friends, with no way home [to Washington]. Jack decides to brave the weather and attempts to get to New York to save his son from impending death.No heroics in this one as there is nothing to do to prevent the weather change, no lasers to fire to make it all better, this is the brutal force of Mother nature and what will happen if we keep on treating the Earth like this. Well, Thats the message I got from the film and what I believe Emmerich is trying to say. Politics aside, this film does nothing but entertain, from the turbulence in the plane as your stomach actually drops along with the passengers in the plane (Which you can relate to if you've ever been in a plane with turbulence) to the awe-inspiring Tornados ripping Los Angeles apart. With a few laughs (both intentional [See: Homeless bum] and un-intentional [See: Large Objects + High Winds = Big Hits]), some moments of nail-biting thrills, and suspense to keep you holding your breath as you root for Sam and his friends (See: Wolves), You are guaranteed to be leaving the cinema with money well spent. As for the script, there was never any reason to believe you were going into a film with any quotables or any standout speeches to come away with. The script wasn't written with that in mind. The acting was not great (See: The Godfather) but it wasn't anywhere near bad (See: Paul Walker and Vin Diesel in The Fast And The Furious). Jake Gyllenhaal looks promising and did well as young Sam should come to more peoples attention and cement himself as a big-time actor (After Donnie Darko, it was only inevitable), Dennis Quaid held up well as Jack as he didn't disappoint. And, a co-starring appearance of Arjay Smith (The Journeys Of Allen Strange [A Classic]) which made me smile. On the whole, this film should appeal to everyone of all ages with its PG-13/12A rating this looks to be a sure fire hit at the box office, and with plenty of mind-blowing effects and enough story to keep you interested and on the edge of your seat, with the super-sensitive people in the audience maybe shedding a tear for those helpless victims like Ian Holm and his crew who are coming to terms with reality. Its not Oscar material, but who cares? Its worth the price of Admission, and in this day and age, isn't that, truly all we ask for?6-Word Analogy: Solid film with Mind-Blowing effects.Best Acted Part: Sam Hall (Jake Gyllenhaal)Oscar Worthy?: If there was an Oscar for special effects, Yes. Otherwise, No.Best Moment: The Flooding of New York is good, but the Tornados ripping up Los Angeles takes this one.Vedict: 8/10</fullReview>

Dennis Quaid and Jake G. are father and son who gets caught in the worst storm the earth has seen since the last ice age. They battle their strengths and weaknesses to survive this storm. As I mentioned above, the effects were outstanding. I liked the tornadoes in LA part the best. The acting is superb especially with Quaid. Not to sound so political, the theme is a real-life issue. Global warming is a big problem with the earth's environment. I am surprised about all the negative reviews about this film. I guess critics dislike just about everything these days.

		<shortDescription>Thrilling, eerie, bitter sweet, frightening...a terrific epic that had me enthralled</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suppose I expected a rainy version of ID4, with nature assuming the role vacated by the earlier movie's alien invaders. Now as much as I am a fan of ID4, I would be the first to point out its numerous flaws...notably its "US saves the world" take and a healthy helping of cheese (and also the fact that its satire was a little too close to straight imitation). Instead, with TDAT, I found a much darker, more interesting film with real heart, and a terrific, if frightening message. The cast all excelled, and characters that seemed destined to provide the film's mandatory cardboard cynics actually were given a chance to develop into something with a bit more depth and much more unexpected realisation. The story had sufficient pace as to keep me interested from the very atmospheric opening credits, through to the dark, if hopeful finale. It dealt with the epic scale of events wonderfully (placing an orbiting space station into the story with helpless astronaut witnesses was a brilliant move) but never lost sight of the characters, and as much as the effects were on par, if not better, than anything I have ever seen, it is some of the more character based moments that have stayed with me.Yet the effects! The tornado sequence in particular, using a mixture of sweeping camera work, on the ground point of view and news broadcast footage really gave me a sense that something wild and horrifying was happening. The scenes showing the ice-covered aftermath were almost beautiful, if not for the fact of what they meant. I felt an explanation for why the wall of water appeared, and targeted New York went begging (unless I missed something), but aside from that I really lost sight of these images as artificial effects.I hate to say it, but I wonder if the non-involvement of Emmerich's long time producing partner Dean Devlin may have contributed to the fact that TDAT is a significantly higher quality film than ID4, Godzilla and Stargate.True, this movie is not going to re-write film lore, or win consistent praise for its originality or artistic freshness, but I really think that it is an extremely well made entry into the disaster/action thriller genre; put together by a team who felt they had a great story to tell, and top quality skills at hand to do it with. I understand it has not done as well in the US compared to its international success, which I think is unfortunate. Among my friends and family who have seen it here is Australia, all have come out buzzing with excitement. Even a few friends who normally avoid the genre have agreed that TDAT is fantastic.Mr Emmerich, wherever you may be...you're on to something good here!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Roland Emmerich has never been really given much credit for making films, but this film is pretty good. The special effects are decent to great, and the story line is very good. Many people have written bad reviews about this film, and up to this day, I don't know why. Global warming is a real problem, and an ICE AGE is a possibility. We at the Walters Judson Group don't like too many films after the year 2000, but we have this film highly rated. This film has human interaction, well defined characters, a problem with global warming (and its consequences), and the acting is pretty good. We give it a "9". Also, some people believe that this is "science fiction" - it is not. Anything is possible this day and age. Daniel Tyler.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Possibly the worst -- certainly the dumbest -- big-budget Hollywood disaster epic ever made, "The Day After Tomorrow" offers a nonsensical CGI-filled escalation of climate change effects that happen over the course of a few days rather than a few centuries. But don't worry, because we're assured in the end credits that the film is "carbon neutral." This is quite a comedown in quality and entertainment value from director, story author and co-author of the screenplay Roland Emmerich, whose "Independence Day" was a fine example of this kind of film done right. Its only notable achievement is not one but two career-worst performances from two successful American actors -- Dennis Quaid and Jake Gyllenhaal. Quaid (whose brother Randy had better luck with Emmerich in "Independence Day") plays up the full melodrama inherent in the overwrought script and loads every pregnant pause, concerned reaction, and Cassandra-like warning declamation (he has several) with actorly pomposity. Because the material just isn't there, he looks ridiculous. Gyllenhaal, on the other hand, is mostly checked out -- his scenes are an effective sleep aid. I hope he stayed alert enough to cash his check.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best of Emmrich's work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, seeing as Roland Emmerich's Independence Day: Resurgence is out today! (Review coming to a blog near you) I though I would do one of Emmerich's earlier films for a #throwbackthursday and no, it's not going to be the first Independence Day as I don't want to write about another alien invasion twice, back to back from the same film maker. Instead I'm choosing The Day After Tomorrow (which would be Saturday) because it's probably my favourite of his. I'm not a great fan for Emmerich. Not forgiving him for what he did to Godzilla and his recent disasters have been, well, literally disasters in my opinion. I thought 2012 was more like an elaborate Final Destination and I was actually willing John Cusack's character to die and with 10,000 BC being of average fare. I did enjoy Patriot, and I liked Stargate, but The Day After Tomorrow is my favourite out his movies. We see Mother Nature wreck havoc across the globe, bringing an abrupt ice age but not before bringing floods and hurricanes across it's cities. Out of all of Emmerich's disaster movies this seemed the most believable. The effects were good for its age and you actually get emotionally invested in the characters more than the other films. It's also got a good balance between the rest of the world and the stars of the story which it centres around. Son of Global Warming specialist trapped in flooded and sub zero New York whilst father does what any father would want to do, go get him. There's even a little romantic interest thrown in there that isn't silly or overbearing. I think it's fair to say Jake Gyllenhaal was still relative new to the big screen getting his major breakthrough with Donnie Darko in 2001 and this being his next great recognition playing Dennis Quaid's son. Dennis Quaid is believable as is the rest of the cast. Ian Holm giving his final wish as a piece of advice, Shameless Emmy Rossum (Mystic River, Phantom of The Opera) being the girl next door love interest and Dash Mihok (Silver Linings Playbook, I Am Legend) is great as Quaid's trusted assistant/buddy. It's seems the mixture was just right, well balanced, well structured and one that really brought it home about global warming. Even Emmerich's regular composer Harald Kloser does a fine score to suit the movie. Out of all of Emmerich's sci-fi/disaster movies, this one has the most believability and character investment. It lacked the usual silly characters Emmerich normally has in films for comedy relief like Woody Harrelson or Randy Quaid, this one, seems to takes itself seriously.

		<shortDescription>Great effects and indifferent plotting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another lacklustre offering from Roland Emmerich, the German director who last scored with the ultimate Hollywood blockbuster cheese-fest, INDEPENDENCE DAY, in 1996. Since then we've had the abominable likes of GODZILLA and the Brit-bashing antics of the Mel Gibson starrer THE PATRIOT, but nothing that equalled the spectacle or splendour of Emmerich's earlier offerings. So comes THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW, an unsurprisingly cheesy, and surprisingly disjointed, Hollywood effort that blows the bucks on special effects, and offers a sub-par script and a mindlessly derivative plot along with it. The film starts off well, with killer hailstones in Japan and tornadoes in LA, but after the first hour things fall apart so quickly that you're reminded of the game Jenga.The film is chock full of plot holes and flaws, including scenes where Quaid impossibly treks across America and survives out in the storm, when even the Empire State Building falls (he's clearly stronger than a huge building) and a laughable interlude where our heroes must face down the most poorly animated killer wolves that I've ever witnessed; like the "superstorm" itself isn't bad enough! There's the usual combination of sorry sentiment and cheesy action, although the proceedings are bolstered by the appearance of Jake Gyllenhaal, although the proceedings are clearly below an actor of this calibre; give him something decent to work with next time! Ian Holm returns to the screen after a serious illness, and whilst I welcome the return of the actor, I'm sorry to say he's relegated to a minor role as a British weather expert (along with Adrian Lester) who disappears about halfway through, presumably dead.The film works a lot like that. There are loads of loose ending and not much that ties up very well; it just kind of ends at an anti-climatic emotional moment that feels nothing like the adventure that has come before. So, then the reason to see this movie at all is obvious: the special effects. Sadly, some viewers (myself included) may feel cheated as all the 'best bits' are in the film's trailer. Shots of New York City being swamped by a massive tidal wave are excellent value for money, as are the flying buses, random pedestrian deaths, and the fearsome freezing ice which'll kill you in about five seconds if you're unlucky enough to get caught in it. So there you have it, THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW: a disappointing adventure movie recalling the '70s disaster flicks, in which cliché rules the day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just Another Disaster Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Day After Tomorrow" is the typical clichéd disaster flick. There's destruction, there's fake tension and there's build up to a climax which falls quite short of the expectations created by its first half. The film gradually loses its scale, from being a global disaster fest o a more focused and somewhat dull piece. The only two things that redeem this whole nonsense are the special effects and Dennis Quaid's and Jake Gyllenhaal's performances, which can be over the top sometimes, but quite decent, in general. The effects are up to par with the best in the genre, even for today's standards, although they can seem a bit video game-like sometimes. Aside from these two factors, you won't find major quality in this work.The direction is what we've come to expect from Emmerich. In other words, balls to the wall action and disaster, with nothing more than a thin logical line driving the plot and the character's actions and motivations. Ultimately, the film drags for too long and becomes far too USA focused for any foreigner watcher to relate. Not the most enjoyable watch, but still worth of your time as a ten-year old disaster film with pretty decent VFX.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A surprising waste of good actors and special effects budget, this movie appears to be what happens when a screenplay takes a backseat to a movie's theme (Global Warming). Without getting caught up in a science debate (hey, it's science fiction), 'The Day After Tomorrow' remains a nonsensical romp with a script that just sounds ridiculous. With every cliché and stereotype that could be mustered, the movie stands out as a guide to screenwriters on how to sell your soul. Newscasters calling Americas illegal aliens as they run across the border into Mexico, the poor and homeless being left outside to die, the smug rich being killed by the vengeful storm. The only consolation to the actors was the ability to cash a paycheck.The cinematography was inconsistent, but at times interesting. Only the significant special effects work saves this story. How ever contrived the plot, the storm sequences are visually compelling. Profitable? Yes. Worthy? No. Every department clearly did a good job to make this movie a success, but the director and producer were apparently unable to see how poor the script was; and how re-writes could have led to a compelling storyline.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the better disaster movies...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Day After Tomorrow" is one of the those type of movies that you can watch every so often, because it is entertaining and has good special effects. Was it predictable as almost every disaster movie is? Yes. Does it go from a dire situation that threaten the world to being honky dory? Yes. But that seems to be a requirement for the disaster genre.The story is about catastrophic climate changes that plunges the world into a new Ice Age, and amidst it all paleoclimatologist Jack Hall sets out to find his son before it is too late.Yep, that was basically the storyline summarized in a single sentence. But what drives the movie are the special effects and the destructive forces of the natural disasters, and also some good enough acting performances.While the movie is corny and predictable to the core, then I come back every couple of years because the movie is entertaining, and the special effects still hold their own by today's standards.If you like disaster movies and not already familiar with this movie, then you should take the time to sit down and watch it, because it is one of the better disaster movies available.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this much more than I expected to. The plot is of course absurd - the idea that an Ice Age could descend in 48 hours surely can't have helped the climate lobby's credibility much.But that aside, it's a rather good disaster movie. The special effects are spectacular. It had me enthralled throughout. There's storms, tornadoes, floods, snow and rampaging wolves. You really couldn't ask for more.The plot follows a pretty standard structure. Father-son relationship and boy-meets-girl fare.But you watch this to be thrilled by the power of the weather, and on that it delivers in style.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emmerich tried again...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this film, directed by Roland Emmerich (the man who likes to destroy the Earth again, and again, and again), the Earth is sent back to the Ice Age by an enormous system of storms that freezes almost all the globe. In the midst of all, one paleoclimatologist (this exist?) Seeks to save his son, trapped by snow in New York.In a world obsessed with global warming, Roland Emmerich heard of global cooling theories and the threat of a new ice age and seems to have been interested. Nothing special about a man who already has in his curriculum about six attempts to destroy the planet (in movies, of course). Of course, this kind of film, which was very usual in the seventies, is popular again thanks to the elaborate computer visual effects that allows them to have. Nothing more than that. Therefore, in these new disaster movies, the most basic mistakes (like plot errors, scientific mistakes and improbable facts) are growing and taking disastrous proportions. That's what happens in this film, where the start is going well, with some logic and an interesting plot. It is from the middle of the film that things start to go wrong, with situations increasingly senseless to happen with the characters. It's nonsense destroying the film, as snow destroyed New York (New York is always in these films... just in case, I wouldn't live there)! Despite these flaws that the smartest audience will quickly detect, the film has a good cast (led by Dennis Quaid, Jake Gyllenhaal and Emmy Rossum), the characters were developed in a positive way and there's some romantic scenes that soften the tension of events."The day after Tomorrow" is a film that is able to entertain the audience. It's not an exceptional or particularly striking film and definitely is not better than many similar films of the seventies (only on the photography and visual effects) but it's not so bad that should be thrown in the trash.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Enjoyable As It Is Ridiculous!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the director of Independence Day, The Day After Tomorrow arrives as another disaster movie by Roland Emmerich that discards the science to create its own logic but when taken as a work of fiction, it makes up for one thoroughly enjoyable, entertaining &amp; satisfying ride, thanks to its impressive set pieces, state-of-the-art visual effects &amp; sustained thrills.The story of The Day After Tomorrow follows Jack Hall; a paleoclimatologist who, based on his research, discovers that the world is on the brink of a major climate shift when extreme weather conditions all over the globe engulf the planet into a super storm which would lead to a new ice age, and covers the daring trek he makes across America to rescue his son who's trapped in New York.Co-written &amp; directed by Roland Emmerich, The Day After Tomorrow is my favourite work of his despite the numerous shortcomings for the plot never stays static, the extreme climate events are over-the-top yet spectacular to look at, the set pieces are meticulously detailed, visual effects is its strongest aspect and while the plot is ridiculous at times, it isn't difficult to follow &amp; unfolds pretty smoothly.Cinematography captures the drama effectively with some nicely employed camera angles while the cold colour tones bring a chilling vibe of its own. Editing provides a brisk pace to the whole narrative, Harald Kloser's score is another positive highlight for the mesmerising tracks seamlessly integrate into the picture and although the performances aren't any great, the cast does whatever they can with their bland characters.On an overall scale, The Day After Tomorrow is an effects-driven flick that one expects from Emmerich and while he is notable for making terrible movies throughout his career, all in the name of popcorn entertainment, this one isn't as bad as they say. I still remember the fond memories of sitting through this picture for the first time, which was over a decade ago, and while it has lost much of its grandeur since then, it still isn't a complete disaster in my eyes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Day After Tomorrow (2004): Dir: Roland Emmerich / Cast: Jake Gyllenhaal, Dennis Quaid, Ian Holm, Jay O. Sanders, Emma Rossum: The day after tomorrow I may seek counselling after sitting through this dull science fiction disaster film about the future. An ice age happens upon us too quickly. Chalk full of useless clichés including Dennis Quaid unable to warn everybody that tomorrow they may be popsicles. Jake Gyllenhaal plays his son who is trapped in a library amongst others trying to stay warm. Ian Holm is much too talented to be wasting time on airhead projects such as this. Jay O. Sanders also appears in what will not be his grandest acting move. Emma Rossum also drew a short straw to appear in this junk and it won't likely be the talk of her career on any biography. The production is massive with the biggest blizzard to ever hit anywhere, but it is still a yawner with every stupid cliché in tact. Roland Emmerich can direct but he has a problem with stupidity in his films. The ice age is basically a substitute for the aliens in the idiotic Independence Day, or the big lizard in the big budget groaner Godzilla. Either way, it sucks worse than a snow covered rock to the side of the head. The purpose has nothing to do with any weather problem. It is advertised fully upon its massive budget and should be buried somewhere in the Atlantic. Score: 3 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very down to earth disaster movie ! Compared to others it does have more reality to it, which made it a lot better ! It was interesting to see the build up before it all happened and get to know characters, which at the time, you didn't know we're main or not. This then results in a few being taken out of the story due to the twists and you are left with the main few. It was an easy watch, with no real proper concentration needed. Come the end it seemed very anticlimactic, simply... One thing happens, which results to something else and that was it. No BIG event really, and I was left expecting more ! Once again it was good to see something so recognizable be turned upside down by such a big event, BUT it needed more of an impact for me to give it anymore than 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a trip to the library they'll never forget.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The New York Public library at 5th Avenue and 42nd Street never got such a floor mopping as it gets in this silly but sometimes exciting disaster movie that is at its weakest when dealing with the family situation of climate expert Dennis Quaid and doctor Sela Ward. He's too busy predicting climate changes to really be a husband to the compassionate Ward and a father to somewhat nerdy Jake Gyllenhaal. Jake happens to be in New York for a science seminar when the world's climate prepares to shift majorly.When the film's outrageous special effects take over, the movie is at its most compelling, but rather than just presenting these characters dealing with the disastrous situation, it takes them into a level of soap opera that fortunately most disaster movies of the 1970's only hinted at. Quaid prepares in the face of disaster to get from Washington D.C. to New York, ending up walking there from Philadelphia and desperately trying to hide from "the eye of the storm" that would freeze him to death instantly. That freezing is shown happening to a helicopter pilot caught in the eye, and also shows some solitary scientists facing their last moments with dignity in the coldness of Scotland. The stranded people in the library in New York includes a disgruntled librarian (possibly based upon some of the real staff I've seen there) who doesn't believe in God but refuses to allow them to burn the Guttenberg bible, the oldest written document in the world. That bible has been on display at the library in a glass case, and makes an interesting metaphor for the spiritual emptiness of a world which had gone cold long before the poles started melting.Of course, New York isn't the only place affected by this disaster. Los Angeles is shown being ripped apart by a super tornado (a combination of three smaller ones), and the destruction of the city (particularly the erasing of the Hollywood sign) is just a preliminary to what the same director would do 8 years later with the even more outrageous "2012". Like "Titanic", the special effects gets at some point to be just way too much, but there are some moments of intensity that just can't be surpassed. At two hours, this isn't overly long, even though the whole "family" message could have been shorted by at least 10-15 minutes. The more interesting characters are the minor ones, particularly the homeless black man with the dog, the atheist librarian, as well as Quaid's partner who makes a sacrifice to save him.Having experienced potential disaster in L.A. by living through the 1994 Northridge earthquake, I noticed that movie watchers at the video store I worked at became fascinated during this time by disaster movies, and as a result, films with earthquakes became much requested rental fair. A viewing of the film "Volcano" at the Beverly Connection had the audience in cheers when the very building where I was got to be blown up. Fascination with disaster and seeing destruction of famous sites seems to be much more interesting to viewers going to these movies than the personal drama which took too much time to set up and lacked in the excitement of the rest of the movie. Still, this movie will always have a special place in my movie going memory with a huge billboard both in Times Square and the Sunset Strip where a frozen torch at the tip of the Statue of Liberty was seen barely coming out of the snowy base.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, the movie as a whole. Well, the characters were okay, Dennis Quaid gave a great performance and Jake Gyllenhaal did well, too. The writing was okay, the effects were very good, and the execution was pretty good. Some complaints with these things are Emmy Rossum's acting, which was not good, how clichéd some of the dialogue was, I mean, "Save as many as you can" is totally an original line, and a certain continuity error was glaring (the Earth isn't in the whole polar vortex even though Jack says that it will happen in "7-10 days"). Now, my big problem with the movie, the science. Call it nitpicking, but, being a science buff, it prevented me from giving the movie a nine. For one, climate change takes place over decades at least, not days. Also, if the polar vortex hits New York and drops the temperature by 10 degrees a second and considering that it is less than about 15 degrees at least, it should be absolute zero in less than a minute (which is -459.67 degrees F), not to mention they outrun it, yeah, no.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So, the answer to the question that I wanna know is "Does he, or, Doesn't he?", meaning, "Does director, Roland Emmerich, love New York City, or does he loath it?"If my math is correct up to this point Emmerich has now trashed NYC 3 friggin' times. That's a lot of trashing of one city, if you ask me. I'm surprised that by now there's actually anything left of NYC to trash.So, let me re-cap this triple-trashing of NYC in a little more detail.First NYC Trashing - Independence Day - Emmerich specially arranges for some mega-slimy Alien-Goons to come down from Uranus to blast NYC to smithereens. (They do it real good, too, if I do say so myself) Well, at least I think these Alien-Goons were from Uranus. I mean, by just one look at them I knew they had to come from someone's Anus. So, I guess it might as well be Ur's.Second NYC Trashing - Godzilla - Emmerich invites, with open arms (practically), a gargantuan, mutated-hybrid lizard, that's just oozing with radiation from exposure to nuclear-bomb testing in the South Pacific. Godzilla, along with plenty of impressive help from the US Military, kicks NYC's ass (big time) like it's never been kicked before. The toppling of the Chrysler Building was a true highlight of destruction, thanks, not to Godzilla, but the friggin' US Military. (I feel safer already) I actually think that the Military did do more damage to The-City-That-Never-Sleeps, than Godzilla did.Third NYC Trashing - The Day After Tomorrow - Since there was pretty much no one else left around to call on for a decent NYC trashing by now, Emmerich e-mails an urgent S.O.S to good, old Mother Nature. Emmerich cleverly tricks a usually sober Mother Nature into drinking an entire 24 of beer, then, when her bladder is about bursting, he gets her to take the biggest whiz she's ever taken right on top of The Big Apple. Very effective. But since everyone knows that it's not nice to fool Mother Nature, especially an intoxicated one, she commands her whiz, which is now flooding the streets, to instantaneously freeze upon exposure to the open air. Little did Mother Nature know that this otherwise devastating special-effect would put Emmerich into NYC destruct-o heaven. With dollar signs lighting up like lightning bolts in his eyes, Emmerich, literally, got more than he bargained for and his virtually pointless and plot-less movie was now, at least, something "pretty" to look at. He'd just have to worry about all that irksome plot-stuff later. A dire message of global-warming due to excessive fossil-fuel burning would be mighty effective movie-fodder.Anyway...Thank you, Mother Nature. Thank you, Godzilla. Thank you, you Uranus Aliens. And, yeah, yeah, Thank you, you bungling US Military, too. Emmerich couldn't have done any of it without the likes of you.So, what I wanna get back to is my original 2-cent "question" - "Does he, or, Doesn't he?" I'd say that Emmerich is having a serious love/hate relationship with NYC. He truly loves it. But he also loves to destroy it. He loves to see it lay totally wasted. And, like "God" he loves to have the power to build it all back up again, so it can be trashed again, and again, and again. Wheee! What a blast all this make-believe destruction can be! The bigger the disaster the more entertaining it gets. That's kinda screwy, don't you think? So, as I asked before (Ho-Hum) - "Does he, or, Doesn't he!!??" Well, I guess only Emmerich's "hair-dresser" knows for sure.......Oh, Really!!?? And who cares what some frickin' hairdresser knows, anyways! (Ooops!! Hee-Hee! That one sorta slipped out by accident. It did.) I mean, hairdressers are totally essential to the balance of modern-day life and the environment, too. They are. And, say, would you just look at the great bob that one of 'em did on Godzilla's hair!! Zowie!! If there is a "next time" (hope not) I wonder how Emmerich will choose to entertain us with Round #4 of a NYC trashing.</fullReview>

Additionally, Gyllenhaal, Rossum, and Glenn Plummer bring charisma to their characters that transcends the script and makes you care about what happens to them a little more.For more reviews and a kick-ass podcast, check out: www.livemancave.com</fullReview>

This is a true "suspension of disbelief" that is a definite requirement for any chance of this having any entertainment value.Basically it is another CGI disaster movie that delivers mass destruction on a mass scale that is always a fun, if kinda sick, thing to watch.

Sure, imagining and actually witnessing a city flooding are two different things, but that's all these films really have to offer. Plus, these kinds of events only happen once. Disaster films normally do not include the main event, and then a second dose of the same thing.This movie actually has a political agenda to it as well. It is easily noted that director Roland Emmerich was picking sides with this. It is clearly stated that Emmerich picked Kenneth Welsh as the vice-president to resemble Dick Cheney from the Bush Administration, and Global Warming, which is the topic of main importance in the plot. Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid), is an engrossed climatologist who has a hard time convincing authorities above him that Earth's climate will change drastically if something isn't done soon. Along with this is the relationship with his son, Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal), whom he's struggling to maintain close to and his wife Sela Ward (Mrs. Hall). And then out of the blue, all the predictions Mr. Hall made came true, but much sooner than he predicted. Eh...like that wasn't expected. A lot of the struggling scenes involve peril and they do keep the viewer on the edge of their seat, but much of it is so predictable. For example, before the disaster even happens, we learn Sam is going on a field trip for the possible reason of a girl being involved. Nothing more needs to be said; we all know where this is going.It's not to bash on the acting. The acting is definitely there. It even contains a few comical moments to relieve the audience from recalling that the main characters are in the middle of a global crisis. But screenwriter Jeff Nachmanoff must have not put much thought into the story at all. Nothing really makes this movie stand out like any of the other disaster films. The background music by Harald Kloser was effective. He made scenes tense and emotional when they had to be. But once again, there wasn't much of a reoccurring theme. If a film and a composer really want to be remembered, there should be a repeating theme. The only other bone I have to pick here is the continuity. There are scenes where they describe how intense and deadly the weather is; yet I see characters walking around in the weather, which was just described, with nothing covering the important parts of their body. Um hello, Mr. Nachmanoff, where are you again?The movie would definitely have the support from Al Gore, but even he wouldn't have much influence on how the film plays out. There are various elements that make it enjoyable but the story is lacking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A review about "The Day after Tomorrow"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Do not make important dates, maybe the coming day will not exist This movie "The Day After Tomorrow", directed by Roland Emmerich and published 27.05.2004, show you the consequence of the true global warming. The special about this film is that R. Emmerich directed near to reality, although the directer exaggerate. Because this things happening to fast.To begin with Jack Hall, a climatologist, finds in his expedition that a catastrophe climate change will be happen. For this reason he presents his findings at United Nations conference. But the Vice- President and many other people too are doubtfully consequently they do not believe Jacks theory. Despite the saying from the Vice- President the catastrophe and disaster, including multiple hurricanes, tornadoes, tidal waves, and floods happen. And the next Ice Age is beginning. Jack wanted warn the world with his theory around to save the world from the effects of global warming. While the catastrophe reaches New York he tries to save his son, Sam, who is in this city. On account of this he travels with his two friends to New York. On of his friend died, but they do not give up. Finally he founds his son and saved him. Simultaneously they found that many other people are alive. So the situation was not so hopeless. The Music was really dramatically and was suitable to the film scene. Moreover were the special effects really engrossing and quit real. Both together were really excellent, and keep you entertained.In "The day after tomorrow" you can see what will be happen if we do nothing but the director exaggerates the situation a little as already mentioned. But the movie shows us the consequence of the doing from the human race. All the people in the world destroy our earth and they do nothing respectively they do not take it to the knowledgeable. But supposing that this catastrophe will be happen, what will we do or it will be too late? That is why we must do now something. If I were the director, I would create the movie just as. All in all in my opinion is the movie really succeeded and the message at audience arrived.Sümeyye Kilic and Zozan Örper</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Day After Tomorrow is clichéd beyond belief, ridiculous in huge amounts and full of unnecessary scenes that drag the film. It centres around climatologist Jack Hall (Quaid) who of course predicts the doom of mankind this time (movie scientists in general predictions context) due to global warming. Of course the governments don't listen and in a matter of days the world is in the midst of a new ice age thanks to a global climate shift caused by that pesky old global warming. Now Jack must rescue his son and co from the clutches of the new ice age in New York City. The film actually begins quite well with half decent pacing and plot development. It doesn't waste any time telling us what its about and pretty much gets straight to the point.Films like these are sometimes guilty of trying to sound too intelligent when face it you're around for the special effects.Those effects do not disappoint,for all the film's flaws they are brilliant and they are enjoyable every time the film is viewed. The second half does sort of rid the film of the spectacular effects and focuses much more on the characters. Okay so that isn't so bad right? Well they were quite boring at times although I did enjoy the interaction between Jack and Ian Holm's character and colleagues which was quite entertaining. Apart that it was pretty dull. There are things I can nit pick but I'm... oh what the hell what about the part when they were being chased by the ice in the New York library? If you've seen it I won't have to rip it to shreds but yes it is a head scratcher. Aside from all of these factors it is more or less satisfactory and I can't really say much else because its all it was. Overall worth watching but just not great.That is all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many had put Roland Emmerich in a corner. After quite a few event movies, he was being called "US-friendly". Not in a good sense. While you could argue about that description of his, he himself tried and went another route. He made "The Day after tomorrow", which is anything but American friendly.Nor could you call it an "Event movie" per se. It's more a Disaster movie in the fine tradition of the 70s. Of course digitally enhanced and looking "awfully" (no pun intended) great, this is supposed to be a warning shot. And as it seems, Mr. Emmerich seems to like the Disaster idea, as his new movie choice shows -&gt; 2012! We'll see what that's all about, until then we can watch this movie, which is technically perfect and has the acting chops of Dennis Quaid in it, but still lacks the emotion and the heart of other disaster movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't expect this movie to make sense - it is posited on a concept which is there solely as a hook to hang the eye candy on.And the eye candy is pretty solid - there are some great effects here, some really convincing disaster sequences, and some fabulous shots set in flooded New York.The cast, too, play it straight-faced for all it's worth, with complete commitments to their part and the material. I think, on balance, this is good.The story is spurious at best. The "message" is hokey and less than credible, "cause of the month" material. Although it does generate and sustain some suspense, to be fair. However, this is more than balanced by the "Why did they do that?", and "How on earth did they survive that?" moments.Ian Holm did this movie for the money, I think.But the effects - my word, they are special.</fullReview>

In that respect it succeeds as the Special Effects are frequently awe-inspiring. However, the film is also saddled with a brainless plot filled with illogical events and coincidences. The best way to enjoy this film is to put your brain on hold in the theater. My favorite scenes include the triple tornadoes in Los Angeles and the massive floods in New York. The opening scene showing cracks in the Antarctic ice-shelf was also very cool. Overlong but watchable.Overall 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you look at this from the point of view of a film connoisseur, The Day After Tomorrow is simply awful. The plot doesn't really make sense, the science is nonsensical, the acting is nothing special, the dialogue is downright horrendous, and the film sort of seemed like Independence Day and Deep Impact smushed together into one giant cliché. Well, I enjoyed both of those movies, and I enjoyed this one. There's something endearing about it despite how truly poor quality it really is. You can practically see what's going to happen before it does, yet somehow you still get excited when it does happen. I watched the ending 3 or 4 times in a row. And the special effects, which are really the only remarkable part of this movie, are spectacular. The science is bad, but they twist the explanation just well enough that you can convince yourself that it MIGHT be possible, sort of like Jurassic Park. The acting gets the movie done. The only really awful part is the dialogue, but as long as you're not too finicky, you will probably enjoy this movie. Two-star film, but I had a five-star viewing experience and would watch it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, let me clarify some things: some people asked: why didn't sam and JD stay in the apartment? well, sam was anxious to get home, but planes were grounded and train lines were flooded, so he accepted a ride to philadelphia so he can catch the train there, to washington.libraries are often chosen as evacuation centers due to their size and height above sea level, and so are stocked with emergency supplies out of reach of floodwaters. this is why sam and JD went there after it was clear that car's weren't going to be able to navigate the clogged and flooded streets.now, the plot holes and mistakes: in a major event like that, sam should have been smart enough to get home as soon as the competition was over, instead of waiting a day like he did. even if he did do some sightseeing, he could have taken a train that night, or told JD about the upcoming storm (surely, it would have been on front page headlines, or the internet) and get a ride south then, or even have rented a car to drive down himself.just because the power's out doesn't mean the traffic has to snarl up. hadn't they heard of four-way stops?? they could have burned the chairs and tables in the library, but many people have already pointed this out, so i'm not going to go into details.sam WAS correct about the phones being powered directly from the phone lines, but that is only the case with regular phones. pay-phones need external power (which is not available at the time) to operate the credit-card machine, the coin taker, the digital display, etc. without it, the pay-phones won't work.Jack comments on global warming and is against it, yet he still drives a heavy-duty Dodge pickup truck. i know what you're thoughts are, that he has to cause it's too snowy, and you're right. but he could have asked sam to take the bus, or the train that was in the background as they were driving, and if he was going to talk to sam about his calculus grade, he could have taken the bus or train with sam.When jack's colleague fell through the roof of the mall, jack and jason could have lowered themselves down through the hole as well, thus sparing all their lives. there may even be valuable gear stowed in the mall that they could have used, and to get out they could have simply dug a hole through the snow at the main entrance. or get out through a less-fragile section of the roof.many people also pointed out the no-chimney mistake, so i'm not going into details on this either.now, i'm not an expert on new york, but i believe that there is an a-train connecting parts of the city. they could have taken that, instead of walking, to Victor's car. and as it is above ground (and the floodwaters), it would have still been running (electric trains are not affected by power outages; if one area's power is out, the train line can draw power from another area that still has power).the scientists in Scotland did not leave their posts. however, a responsible one would, in order to complete his research and contribute to humanity. they would know that dying would simply be a waste of their talents (especially considering that they're world-famous scientists) and that they would leave their work only half-done. obviously, they didn't think of their families' reaction to their deaths either.because ice is less dense then water (1cm3 of ice would have less mass than 1 cm3 of water, resulting in it floating on water), melting arctic ice would only result in water taking the ice's place, and won't actually raise the sea level. the glaciers and ice of greenland, canada, and northern europe will melt, but that would only contribute to a small rise in ocean levels.i could ramble on and on about this, but i'm not going to. all in all, the movie wasn't half bad. it could've just been a lot better. it just needed more polishing up, and some revisions to make it more believable. 3/5-good.</fullReview>

Also, a scientist gets to act superior, because he knew it coming and nobody would believe him and see what that got you. There! Just as one might expect from the pretentious title and subject matter, there is much attempted thought, but this being directed by one of the men that brought us Independence Day and Godzilla, it's just a special f/x bonanza in scholarly clothing. Which isn't to say that it isn't satisfying in a one dimensional way, the f/x are quite special. The flooding of New York, and subsequent freeze, is a real sight to be seen. The cast, much like real people would, become lost in the computer generated masses of mother nature's fury. In the end, the movie represents a piece of popcorn, just like a snowflake, which has no two exactly alike. You eat it and it's gone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unrealistic, Unsicentific, but the special effects and acting cover for that!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this movie. It had some good thrills and BREATHTAKING special effects. I only had a few problems with the film, otherwise I enjoyed it about 98 per cent.PROBLEMS 1) There was no need of the freezing sequences. Sure it was cool and thrilling to see things freeze up, but it was pointless. It is pretty predictable for Sam, Brian, and J.D. to make it back to the library unfrozen before they got to the library. Which would be highly impossible especially since J.D. was hurt and all. They would have frozen into a Popsicle before they would have even reached the library in reality.2) A temperature drop of 10 degrees per second would mean that it would be 100 degrees below zero in 10 seconds. So Sam, Brian, and J.D. would not have made it back, they would have frozen. Because as soon as they left the ship, the temperature dropped and everything started to freeze. And it took them about 2 or 3 minutes to get back to the library. Which would mean the temperature dropped... 180 degrees. So they wouldn't have made it back in a lifetime! Plus, it showed that everything froze slowly, if the top of a building started freezing, it would keep freezing all the way down, that is far from possible, if something was freezing like that, it would freeze all at once, with the 3 of the boys freezing on the way to the library.3) Fire wouldn't stop them from freezing. Fire isn't strong enough to melt that cold of air. That air is at least 600 degrees below zero by then, there fore the hot air would have to be at least 100 degrees hotter than the cold air, but that wouldn't work anyways since the cold air keeps freezing every second.4) How come when Jack and Jason entered the Wendy's they didn't freeze? I mean all Jack did was light up the frozen deep fryers and they didn't freeze. They would freeze mainly because that flame is only hot enough to fry your french fries and chicken sandwiches when you go to Wendy's.Otherwise this movie was thrilling and interesting and a break from reality. Of course it wasn't realistic, but movies aren't supposed to be, and it was not scientific, but it isn't school, its Hollywood. So enjoy it if you can.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film on the big screen and got it on DVD and i must say i like it. Just a couple of problems i had with it though.1, its too American. It seems like the film makers were only concern with the effects the weather was having in the USA and nowhere else in the Northern Hemisphere. One piece the President said (must admit he was the weakest president I've ever seen in a film) "What about the people in the north?" meaning the northern USA. Hang on? Wouldn't the entire north be trying to help each other out????? Instead of saying What about the North? How about: What about the North and the Canadians? Seems like they didn't matter. Felt like asking the president. What are the Canadians doing? laying back and having a fag? With this also, once the bit in Scotland was over, that was it for the rest of the northern hemisphere. 2, second point. I have put this on Titanic as well as its relevant. Why do American script writers think us English say the word Bloody in every sentence? All in all i liked this film. Emmy Rossum is gorgeous..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are those who will be hitting themselves for paying to see this film, and I don't blame them! It is by far one of those films that are based on nothing more than an idea. Dennis Quaid does some of the worst acting I have ever seen, being a superman in disguise as he climbs every mountain to safe his son (Gyllenhall) from freezing to death. It is really a terrible movie. However, it is one of those films you can watch again and again as the action begins almost immediately. You don't have to sit through a lot of talk or unnecessary explanations. Everything you need to know is being conveyed to you within the first ten minutes of the film, making you able to just detach your brain and watch how nature finally kicks man's butt! Go nature!So my advise is watching this after a night out or if you're just feeling down, as this surely will get you in a good mood again. From laughing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, large-scale adventure film with simplistic motives.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Emmerich seems to have a penchant for demolishing U.S. cities and landmarks! In "Independence Day", the White House, among other places, was destroyed. In "Godzilla", New York City took a beating. Now, Los Angeles, New York City and many points in between (and a few token areas around the rest of the globe) are devastated for the audience's pleasure. Quaid plays a climatologist who attempts to convince the leaders of the world that global warming is coming, probably within fifty to a hundred years. It turns out he was a bit off in his calculations and that the planet is actually going to endure another Ice Age in less than a week! This means that his son Gyllenhaal, who is in NYC for a school trip, is right in the path of a massive snowstorm that crystallizes everything in its way. It also means that his estranged wife Ward will have to sit in an empty hospital, dewily reading to a young cancer patient who can't be moved in anything but an ambulance (apparently freezing to death instantaneously is better than trying to transport a sick boy in a car?) Meanwhile, tornadoes, hailstorms and tidal waves are decimating territories all over the place as the U.S. Government (headed by President King and Vice-President Welsh) waffles on how best to handle the situation. When a tsunami, which is later frozen solid, traps Gyllenhaal and a few of his pals in the NYC public library, Quaid decides to trek from Pennsylvania to Manhattan, mostly on foot (!), to rescue him. In a film like this, it's all about the special effects. Fans of CGI will be in hog heaven as the over-the-top visuals dominate the lion's share of the film, starting with a showy opening sequence that features not one crumb of actual terrain. Again and again, highly-detailed computer imagery floods the screen with overwhelming images of natural disaster and destruction that, while breathtaking at times, never for a moment seem real, but more often look like scenes from a very expensive video game. Alas, this is the Hollywood of today. Nonetheless, given that this is the current method of action cinematography, the effects are top of the line. As in "Independence Day", there are a ton of characters that are hastily sketched in prior to dying. A handful of actors get to flesh out their roles a bit further, or at least have the charisma to let the audience think they have. Quaid does a solid job. Gyllenhaal and his sweetheart Rossum are appealing (she, however, needs to get out of this genre after "Poseidon" lest she becomes the Veronica Hamel of the early 2000's.) Mihok is exceedingly likable as one of Quaid's cohorts and Sanders is strong as another one. Ward does as much as she can with such a thankless, inert role. Holm is probably the most prestigious member of the cast and adds dramatic weight to his smallish role. It's nice to see King (albeit briefly) being used in a major film. The film's eco-message is presented with a sledgehammer. Welsh is blamed for not listening to Quaid's predictions, yet the predictions were given only days before the disaster and without the urgency that was truly needed due to the off-kilter timeline, so what was Welsh expected to do? The film's barely veiled agenda is to blame Republicans for the destruction of the modern world and, unfortunately, nothing is ever that simple. However, taken purely as a popcorn disaster flick, the movie delivers rather well. There's a lot going on, some of it very arresting, and the climax is actually surprisingly moving and hopeful, despite the complete and utter implausibility of virtually everything shown on screen. This is best enjoyed as a mindless adventure/disaster movie while ignoring the ludicrous science and politics of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I actually enjoyed some of Roland Emmerich's past movies, Godzilla and ID4 for the spectacle and FX, but this one, based on bad science is the most un-SciFi of all his movies. Much of global warming is based on bad science, so here we have the ideas played out to the level of the ridiculous.I particularly gagged on the plot point of Dennis Quade's character predicting the resulting devastation based on his computer models. The same ones environmentalist used to prove global warming only to have reality prove them wrong. And tweak their models, only to have them proved wrong, and - well, you get the idea.I've been conditioned to expect a few you've-got-to-be-kidding moments in Roland's movies, just not this many. Most of these disconnects from logic have already been described, with all the climatic rescue scenes forming an unbelievable whole (or maybe that should be "hole").Is any of this plausible? Apart from the human drama, which can almost be seen in isolation from the catastrophe, meteors striking the Earth pose much more of a threat, and we know how that played out in the movies. Those hoping for Armageddon, might want to go back to the bible.For the rest of us, please give us a well-written SciFi movie that doesn't violate logic at every turn, or cover it up with CGI.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Day After Tomorrow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ronald Emmerich returns after a 4 year hiatus to bring us his next disaster movie, The Day After Tomorrow, a CGI marvel but, like his other films, too clichéd and thin to be taken seriously enough. Now we all know that films such as Independence Day (1996) and Godzilla (1998) aren't designed to be taken seriously ? they are the ultimate in "popcorn" movies ? but audiences are generally not content with a blockbuster anymore unless it shows a little character, or a little plot to pad the film out a bit. Sadly, this is exactly what The Day After Tomorrow lacks.The film starts with Dennis Quaid trying to persuade the world that, unless kept in check, global warming will make the polar ice caps melt and the world would be struck by "superstorms" all over. This, needless to say, would be bad. He says it could happen as soon as in 100 years, except he miscalculated somewhat - it'll actually happen in a few days. Just before it all starts his slightly estranged son (Jake Gyllenhaal) flies to New York for a school competition where, unbeknownst to him, is where the centre of one of these superstorms will end up. Then the storms start, and after a quick "up yours!" and a "told you so!" to the American government, Quaid sets off to New York to get his son out of there. Meanwhile, his son is trapped in the New York Public Library, trying to stay alive long enough for his dad to reach him.And that's it ? the plot in, just about, it's entirety. I've summed it up in 150 words. Yet Emmerich has made a 2 hour film stretching this story as far as possible. It's not exactly a bad story or script, and certainly not as clichéd as Independence Day (although it does have its moments, especially where some wolves escape from their cages ? guess when they turn up? Just as Jake Gyllenhaal leaves the library and is completely defenceless, of course...), it's just that there's not enough story/plot to fill the time. Of course, this is where the special effects come in, and they certainly do hit you like a tornado hitting LA (wait a sec?). There are 3 major set pieces for these effects: the aforementioned LA tornadoes, the flooding of New York, and then the "superfreeze" which we see affect both New York and England. And what special effects they are! They may not always be photorealistic, but they are close enough to the real thing to begin worrying when it starts to rain when you leave the cinema. The film has set a new standard for disaster movie effects, and Emmerich has once again proved that he is more than capable of destroying the world whenever he wants to, and in any way he wants to. He is definitely more confident in his destruction than in his characterisation scenes, which to be honest feel heavy and forced, although all the actors do pull off a good job with the script they are given.The best part for me was actually what was lacking ? a single man who could save the day. Not even Bill Pullman or Bruce Willis can stop this apocalypse, and this is shown when Dennis Quaid draws a line through the middle of a map of the USA and tells the government quite plainly that no one north of that line (which includes New York) can be saved, and that every one else must be evacuated south, towards Mexico. The film does have an optimistic ending (we see lots of New Yorkers coming out of the buildings they took refuge in when the rescue helicopters arrive), but the implied off-screen death toll is catastrophic, which makes this film feel a tad more real than Emmerich's others, as if this really could happen. The effects are fantastic, the plot spread too thin, but it is still a worthwhile piece of entertainment, and recommended to be seen, even if only once.Rated: 7.5/10More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Roland Emmerich. Where would modern film be without Roland Emmerich? His Independence Day was a classy action flick, a hand-crafted original in a day of cheap cash-ins. His new picture, The Day After Tomorrow, is another of Emmerich's disaster films, but fails to reach the heights of Independence Day. The Day After Tomorrow stars Dennis Quaid, as Jack Hall, and Academy Award Nominee Jake Gyllenhall as his son Sam. Jack is a climatologist, and is predicting the end of the world via a new Ice Age. Sam is Manhattan and gets caught up in the ice storm, and is confined to a small room in the library. Jack ventures across America to save his Son.Co-Writer/Director/Co-Producer Emmerich gets his game on for the actual disaster scenes, but he falls flat when directing the limp dialogue between the supporting cast. A largely boring disaster picture, with actors at their worst.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Day After Tomorrow tells us about why global warming is bad. In a sped up time frame, we are shown as global warming causes weather impossibilities all over the world, cultivating in a giant super storm that covers 3/4 of North America in ice.The movie starts out good, establishing characters and adding some emotional drama into the budding story. The special effects are amazing when the storms start to happen, and it's almost worth the price of an admission ticket. The tidal wave hitting New York was obviously the climax of the whole film, and it was amazing. We focus on a group of survivors fighting to stay alive in the freezing New York Public Library and on the rescue effort on the way to save them.Unfortunately, this movie resembles a TV disaster film way too much toward the end. What I mean is that throughout the whole movie, it is predicted that the super storm will get larger and larger, and realistically, the entire cast should die and the world should be in ruins. Instead, only North America is destroyed, and the storm just clears itself up, no problem. Also, everybody lives. Just a little ridiculous. Also, Dennis Quaid's acting is only worthy of a TV movie. Everybody else in the movie like newcomer Emmy Rossum and relative newcomer Jake Gyllenhall does a good job.Overall, this is an enjoyable movie, but don't expect it to be the most amazing film you've ever seen.6.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, this movie is really good, the tornado sequence was fantastic, especially when the sign whacked the reporter in the air. Also the hail storm. Imagine that. Hail battering down, killing many people.The flood was great but could've been longer. I thought it was pretty funny when the fat bus driver look at the review mirror and saw the flood.But after the flood. What happened? It was cool on how it shows the people trying to survive and Sam has to think about going out with Laura. JD forgets about his little brother later in the movie. Talks about him a couple times and then forgets him.It was a good movie, effects were great, but after the flood and people surviving. It does get pretty lame.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Day After Tomorrow/2004/***Main Stars: Dennis Quaid Jake GyllenhaalIn the great movie- Independence Day, and the flop- Godzilla, Roland Emmerich's next movie- The Day After Tomorrow was another great movie. The special effects were astonishing and the acting was not bad for a disaster movie. What I mean is that in disaster movies, there is normally terrible acting. As you've seen from the previews, you probably think this movie had to do with horrid weather. Well, if you guessed that, you are correct! At the very beginning something happened to make the storm happen. Of course, if you want to see it soooo bad, I won't tell you anything that happened that would really spoil it for you. In my opinion, I haven't spoiled it for you yet. All I said was this movie had to do with horrid weather and the special effects were astonishing. I don't think I've told you many things at all. See the movie please and I hope you enjoy it! Movie directed by Roland Emmerich.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is so wrong!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK.....so the world is flooded by the melting polar ice caps? Water is the only substance on the earth that doesn't follow the rules of contracting and expanding under freezing and thawing. A normal element would contract when it freezes and would expand when it thaws....NOT WATER. When water freezes it expands and when it thaws it contracts....THE EXACT OPPOSITE. So the way I see it, if the polar ice caps are already ice, when they melt they would take up less space and would there for lower the sea level! This is the reason that after the ice age there was more land mass exposed because water takes up less space than ice. This is such a huge error in the movie and I cannot believe that such a fundamental concept can be screwed up so badly. The worst part is the fact that so many people buy the idea and never question it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is about a group of friends competing in a contest in New York. One of the friends father discovers an ice age is forming there. He also discovers global warming is occurring all over the world! The friends are stuck in New York as the father tries to go and save them along with great peril.The special effects in this film is brilliant. A great part in the movie is when a huge wave washes over New York. Your eyes will be amazed over all of the action sequences in the film. Gyllenhaal's, Rossum's, and Quaid's performances are great. This is a first rate edge-of-your-seats thriller! The beginning starts off with a cool action sequence where Quaid's character and a group of his friend falls in cracks of ice.Of coarse, there are clichés in the film. There are extreme peril in the film that will make your heart racing fast. This film is long. It's over two hours long but it won't bother you as you feel for some characters to not die. This is a great popcorn flick for the summer and will not leave you disappointed.This is not a classic but it's a great movie. Expect a great thrill ride when you walk up to the 50 foot screen TV, like me, and enjoy yourself as much as you can!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When anyone begins to talk about a contemporary special effects film, he needs to start out with the fact that if you throw enough money at something, it will look impressive. What makes it a good movie is plausibility. Are the characters possible? Is the situation possible? Are there things that just don't work. The stuff that happened in "Independence Day" is happening again. It's not aliens; it's us. We have opened the Pandora's box and let out all the evils with our radiation, our ozone layers, our whatever. So all of a sudden, the world is pretty much ending. There are so many remarkable things that come to pass, but the main one is that there are people who seem to understand everything that happens; they are experts on uncertainty. Give me a break. If things were as bad as this, the shock wave would be way too much to handle in such a short time. The only people who would survive would do so because of being lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time. I was astonished by people running down streets being chased by a wave of cold. Holed up in the big public library, burning books and furniture to keep the temperature up. It's just too much. The rescues are too unbelievable because they call for too much knowledge to pull off. It was a visually exciting film. If you are willing to suspend a ton of disbelief, you could get caught up in it. I never did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Day After Tomorrow...Brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rolland Emmerich has done it again. Firstly the day after tomorrow is one of my favourite films ever, because it is amazingly accurate with its information and although the scenarios are exaggerated it shows the threat of what people are doing to the planet. Not even to mention the mind blowing computer graphics, which are among the best any film has ever produced. And the appointment of Donnie Darko star Jake Gyllenhaal who is an up and coming actor as the main character is brilliant, and he acts his heart out in the film. If there is any criticism i have of the film is the part where the wolves are on the ship - not the best part of the film at all. And the film shows to finish that even the most stubborn person to change eventually changes, and that is the president, who it is great to see gets his nose rubbed in it a few times throughout the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The day after tomorrow- A superb plot and an outstanding cast....But unrealistic. The plot line of this movie was aimed to educate the end of the world as we know it and aware people of the global warming effect. However, due to the movies lack of realism, the vast majority of people didn't seem to pay much attention. The fact that this movie shows helicopters instantly freezing over seemed to put me off this movie as helicopters can't do that ! This may seem mean to say, but I did find it rather amusing when a giant clump of ice fell on some random guys head..... Oh I am so immature ! The semi plot with the wife and the kid with cancer I though was very good as it showed the bright side of this disaster and that people can escape terror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Back to the glory days of disaster movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Roland Emmerich's new blockbuster, "The Day After Tomorrow", is a small surprise in this days of big budget movies with zero brains and little or no value. Emmerich has mastered the blockbuster techniques and delivers entertainment at its purest form. Sure, "The Day After Tomorrow" is not a masterpiece of film-making, and it willingly sacrifices realism for dramatic purposes; nevertheless, it follows its pattern and delivers simple minded entertainment complete with social message."The Day After Tomorrow" is a throw back to the days of the disaster movies of the 70s, movies where a natural disaster was used as a plot device to make dramatic scenes of survival and triumph of the human spirit spiced up with romance and family values.Like its predecessors "Earthquake" (1974), "Avalanche" (1978) and even "The Poseidon Adventure" (1972), the movie bases its plot in a disaster; in this case, a climatic change that creates a new ice age. Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) is a scientist that has been studying the weather; being the first that discovered the change, he gets frustrated as his predictions come true faster than he thought and the U.S. government does nothing to protect the people. things get complicated when he finds out that his son Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) is in one of the cities that will be more affected by the storm: New York.Just as a classic disaster movie, "The Day After Tomorrow" makes a display of special effects in order to portray the magnitude of the disaster. In this aspect, Emmerich succeeds as the weather effects are presented in an accurate (albeit very exaggerated) way. However, it is fair to point out that Emmerich went too far at including computer generated wolves instead of real wolves.The acting is pretty much standard for this kind of movies, nothing spectacular. Quaid and Gyllenhaal are good on their roles, but those were not particularly demanding roles. Rossum is quite average at best, probably her real thing is the singing like she demonstrated in "Phantom of the Opera". However, much of this could also be blamed to the script, that follows the formulaic pattern of the disaster movie.As usual, Emmerich does a good job directing an action movie, he has a good eye for action sequences and heavy use of special effects; while his handling of dramatic scenes still is forced and again, formulaic, it has increased a lot since his days of "Independence Day".To summarize, "The Day After Tomorrow" is a good entertaining movie but nothing more than that. It has received a lot of undeserving bashing lately but it is a good movie in its own terms. It is not a masterpiece, but what else could be expected of a blockbuster? 6/10. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Bad Plot, but Action and Actors Make Up For It"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roland Emmerich has created another special effects bonanza with "The Day After Tomorrow". The plot is basically how global warning causes a New Ice Age. Chaos ensures, of course. But, after this happens, the movie loses its momentum. The storyline is "Robert Altman Lite" with all these story lines sort of fitting together. The scientist trying to save his son and redeem himself for a lifetime of not being there. The son falling in love in a library in New York. The mom, a doctor, stuck in Washington with a sick patient. (Will they get out alive? Of course.) The president is also stuck in Washington (Will he get out alive? No. Because the mean V.P. has to be in charge of the country. DUH!) The scientist's Scotish colleague and his team who end up dying. (AWW!) I have to admit that the main reason I got this movie was that Jake Gyllenhaal is in it. I love Jake Gyllenhaal and I'm happy for his Oscar nomination. In this movie, he is pretty good as is Dennis Quaid and Emmy Rossum (woefully underused in the third act because of her sickness which you knew was coming). Sela Ward is also underused because of her main job in the plot is to be Dennis Quaid's love interest and that is done with in the first act. So, good action, good action, but bad plot. It's a good popcorn movie and definitely worth the money.</fullReview>

He must also get to his teenage son (Jake Gyllenhaal) in New York, which is being taken over by a new ice age.Its cheesy, but surprisingly enjoyable, with frighteningly realistic special effects. The plot may not hold up to close scrutiny but the movie still has enough to keep you interested throughout.From the makers of the 1996 smash hit Independence Day, this film knocks spots off that one, and provides good entertainment for the best part of two hours.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a terrible movie. I don't mind a bad 'B' picture but to spend so much money on a stinker.... Now, for example, when people fall into flood water they come out dirty and stinking. Even after days without food or sanitary facilities, the 'survivors' look neat and clean, even scrubbed.... and where was the beard stubble? And confronted by the end of present civilisation, no-one would emote about their personal feelings - the 'hierarchy of needs' kicks in i.e. you concentrate on survival. And how did the survivors (and the wolves) get into the ship unless the deck was on the level with the ice (which it wasn't)? Was it seriously suggested that in a matter of days millions of people flooded (sic) into Mexico? Where did the rescuers find arctic survival gear? So much attention paid to CGI effects - they lost the point, in that they were so obviously CGI effects. Oh for the days of real stuntmen, and .....imagination. And credible characters. And good screen writing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>could have been a lot more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The earth's climate is change, at a phenomenal rate. From effects of global warming, the earth is unable to take this ever increasing disaster. The counter effect of the global warming is a climate shift to the next ice age. Natural disasters are occurring one after the other; tornadoes, hail storms, relentless rain, all growing in magnitude. Stuck in the middle of it is Jack, who had predicted this change of weather. In New York is Jack's son Sam, on a school trip. Stuck in New York after a giant wave flooded the city, Jack is determined to get Sam out before the city falls to the impending storm.The day after tomorrow is an interesting look at the current weather trends that have been predicted by scientist. At its core there is the message that we have to start looking after our earth or this could be our fate of the future, and it does present this well. The downfall though is that this doesn't elevate itself from the standard disaster film. It has all the clichéd characters and events; iconic monuments being destroyed. The dramatic scenes are over done with no help from the over acting cast. Dennis Quaid is no stranger to over acting, being the main culprit. Jacke Gyllenhaal gives the only good performance, though nowhere near his best.Though this is not an exercise of brilliant acting, its the spectacle of the disasters that take center frame, and they are outstanding. The tornadoes ripping through Los Angelas, the hail storm in Japan, the gigantic wave flooding New York and the eye of the storm instantly freezing everything are amazingly captured by Roland Emmerich. They are so captivating and wonderfully done with the special effects. But though the disaster side of Day after Tomorrow are great, they don't care the slack of the human elements and the plot holes of the story.It isn't the best disaster movie, though it's no where near the worst. It's an interesting look at what may happen.</fullReview>

In several scenes the storm is circulating the wrong direction (Clockwise instead of counter-clockwise) 2. Three times in the movie the actors refer to their GPS unit, a Trimble Geo XT. The screen shot is only of the satellite locations, and shows NO geographic data. It's too bad that they didn't exploit the unit's true capabilities for better screen shots. Other than that, it was a great movie. The Global warming issues that are the core of the movie were not exactly correct, but the premise is good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong - I love spectacular special effects as much as anyone, and the effects in this movie ARE spectacular, particularly the flooding of New York City. However, to judge the overall quality of this film, try and imagine watching it without those CGI eye-popping scenes.What would be left that is worth watching? Nothing more than you can see on any "Movie of the Week". Trite and tired story line, boring and unsympathetic characters, ludicrous situations and improbable (if not impossible)plot developments.Sadly, this is the case with most disaster films. CGI is totally replacing plot, dialogue, and acting and someone thinks we're too stupid to notice! It's really too bad, since the idea of a new Ice Age (or massive volcano etc.) is interesting and the movie could have been really gripping and frightening, but instead it was another formulaic, predictable and yawn-inducing bore. The first half, which contains all the best effects and the tightest action isn't bad and you almost don't notice that the characters are one-dimensional, except for Ian Holmes whose performance is believable and moving, but short-lived.If you really want to see it, watch until Dennis Quaid drags out his arctic gear for his ridiculous and pointless trek to New York, then hit the "Eject" button.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Science Fiction - Hope that it Remains Fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of Roland Emmerich's best films. The first thing I would like to say that this does not fall under the category of a "disaster" movie. Most of the disaster movies from the 1970s seem designed to scintillate the viewer for the sake of entertainment. This film should be considered science fiction and although it is scintillating, it does not do so for the mere sake of entertainment alone, but rather, to deliver a message about the inherent consequences of damaging the various components of earth's ecosystem. Hence, it is an example of speculative fiction that discusses a possible outcome of global warming as it affects the overall weather mechanisms, in this case, an example of a possible ecological and meteorological consequence if the delicate balance (in this case, in terms of oceanic freshwater and salinity ratios)within the ocean currents is drastically changed (in this case, by excessive polar ice melting) altering the heat capacity of the North Atlantic current as a result. The probability of this happening is very remote, if not totally nonexistent. However, phenomena such as this still remains a subject for further research due to the fact that much of the supporting data is brand new. Climatologists and other earth system scientists have generated a number of different Global Circulation Models (GCM) in order to explain the subtle patterns underlying earth's climate and much remains under study. Before the 1980s, no one was aware of the ongoing destruction of the ozone layer in the stratosphere represented by the "hole" over Antarctica. . The ozone layer in the stratosphere is critical to life on earth's surface because it filters out excessive ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Before the work of Crutzen, Molina and other specialists, atmospheric scientists were at a loss for understanding how this could be happening in the stratosphere. As it turns out, a vortex effect underlies the transport of halogenated hydrocarbons to Antarctica where it is dark six months out of the year. The release of halogens occurs when incoming sunlight reacts with the compounds releasing the halogens to react with molecular ozone to generate gaseous oxygen. Now, with the banning of CFCs, there seems to be a chance that the overall ozone can be restored to its normal level. Once again, this is still subject to further research.Again, the film's premise is wildly fantastic and probably far-fetched. However, it provides an excellent speculative example of what could possibly happen if we ignore the danger signs that we can witness from changes in the weather. Many scientists believe that the deadly hurricanes hitting the American South (such as New Orleans) are the result of warmer ocean water which could also be the consequence of global warming. We need to think about this very carefully. If we choose to ignore these danger signs, we do so at our peril.I would like to add that one of the most moving scenes in the whole movie was when one of the refugees was embracing and protecting a Gutenberg Bible inside the library. As the refugee comments, one of the turning points in the history of civilization was the creation of the first book which was critical for the development of the Age of Reason. Imagine holding a copy of the first book ever printed !!! I personally don't know how I would react if I came in contact with something like a Gutenberg Bible, but I would probably be moved to tears and treat it reverently. Being a Christian believer, the Gutenberg Bible would probably hold me in awe. But in the movie, in the course of trying to keep warm under incredibly dire circumstances, sometimes by burning books at random, it was still possible to maintain a sense of one's own humanity, spirituality, courage, and reason in trying to preserve the most precious creation of the past millennium and indeed, a hallmark of Western Civilization.Movie Rating 10/10.Dan Basinger</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie begins in Antarctic where a huge crack occurs whats surprising is the there is no water below that ice. Then at the global warming meeting in NEW DELHI our hero Dr.Hall (Dennis Quaid) explains his theory about the changing climate and says that an ICE AGE can be seen in another 100 yrs. But what happens next is what the film is all about. The predictions made by him takes effect immediately and the result is multiple hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, tidal waves, floods and the beginning of the next Ice Age.The result of this is the entire northern hemisphere is turned in to ice up to the head of the statute of liberty and ships coming into Manhattan city is captured beautifully on camera. Between this is a small sentimental touch (INDIAN STYLE) between the son Sam (Gyllenhaal) and the father (Dennis). Sam is in N.Y and hall is in D.C and the journey of a father to rescue his son is the rest of the story.Directed by Roland Emmerich the director who gave us THE INDEPENDENCE DAY decides to choose the biggest villain nature. The fight of a FATHER Dennis quaid against the MOTHER nature for rescuing his SON gyllenhaal is a family action adventure.Another important man to notice is ueli steiger the man behind the camera and the visual effects crew.I saw the film with my friend and when we left the theater guess what it was RAINING !!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

The list is endless, and this movie has become more of a joke than its source of intended entertainment. One could spend forever eyeing and listing errors, so I won't even bother. It seemed the makers of this movie were too concerned in using their work as a scare tactic to frighten the people into being more environmentally friendly rather than illustrating convincing facts. I guess the only question left to be asked is, Was the film an effective means to educate people about the consequences of global warming and persuade them to stop it? The answer is quite debatable. I personally think it has not made much of an effect on the daily human behaviors contributing to global warming. However, all the hype and hoopla surrounding this film did instill these frightening images in the back of everyone's minds. Today, with grass growing in Antarctica, snow in Dubai, and above all, the series of disastrous 2005 US hurricanes, particularly Katrina, people at least pause for a minute to wonder, Could this be because of global warming?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>what was Roland Emmerich thinking when he made this film he obviously thought that special effects makes a good movie well he might have been missing some key ingredients including plot and better acting. but even with those the movie still would have sucked what was with that little boy with cancer in the hospital did he have anything to do with the movie it was like every one else in the world is dying and nobody does anything for them but as long as they save the boy with the terminal disease it will be okay. and what was with everything being okay as soon as Dennis quaid got to his son. i guess id have to say besides good special effects this movie flat out sucked but its still entertaining to see. my advice to yow would be go see it and find out what all the hype is about. but if you ask me this movie sucked</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The scariest thing, I think, about this film is that you cannot stop nature from occurring, no matter how bad. This film is all about a new ice age forming and people trying to survive it around the world. It is also an incredibly moving story about a fragile bond between father and son. Jake Gylenhall plays the son who is going on a trip to New York to take part in a contest with a girl, who he finds out that he likes. They get stuck in a library when a huge wave kills hundreds. The water freezes and if you go outside you will 'freeze to death!' Jake's (who plays Sam) dad Jack (played by Dennis quaid) sets off through the deadly conditions to find his son and bring him home safely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie appears a lot more realistic after the December Tsunami and the Mumbai floods. Yes, it has been over-dramatized to an extent, but they needed to make a movie out of it. All the masala ingredients are in it, father-son relationship, little bit romance, edge of the seat excitement, great special effects...really makes you think of the power of nature! The Manhattan, Statue of Libery shots have been done quite well. Scientific details inserted at appropriate junctures - to prevent a documentary feel to it. This movie also touches upon the shift in power, the level playing field that the world is heading to...Definitely worth a see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not too bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Movie was not nearly as bad as I thought it was going to be. In fact I even sort of enjoyed it. It starts of pretty weak, apparently Dennis Quaid is the only person in the world to be able to predict a huge storm that is going to change the climate and the world forever. What caused such a storm, pollution. Of course the US government ignores him, wouldn't you, and terror ensues. This movie is basically a run of the mill natural disaster movie with with descent special effects. Nothing all that special, but if you enjoy natural disaster flicks you will probably like this one. The movie would have been way better had Donnie Darko and Dennis Quaid had died at the very beginning and the homeless man was trapped in with a bunch of supermodels. However, it did not happen that way and there is only an OK and not great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you talk about catastrophe movies, the catastrophe has to be something that is plausible, otherwise the catastrophe becomes a joke. This is the case in this movie. This movie suggests a scenario that is so preposterous, even for a science fiction movie, that it reduces the movie to the level of a farce. When the entire northern hemisphere freezes in a few hours and a freighter winds up in the middle of Manhattan, the movie takes a turn that makes it fundamentally ridiculous. And to watch characters trudging through a blizzard reminded me of Dr. Zhivago trudging his way back to Lara, except in Zhivago's case there was actually a plausible story with which to associate Zhivago's actions. This is not to say that I did not find the special effects intriguing because I did, but special effects themselves are not enough to sustain a movie, which this movie proves. If you like cold weather this is the movie for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor Script and Direction Finished Crippling a Lame Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I figured that this would be primarily a special-effects movie, so I didn't have high expectations. Unfortunately, those expectations weren't met. I had hoped that solid acting by Dennis Quaid and Jake Gyllenhaal could make this a character-driven action movie. The writing and direction removed any hope of that.When watching the movie, I was surprised to find that the acting of Quaid and Gyllenhaal was quite bad. Since I hold these actors in high regard, I blame the script. It quickly digressed into unimaginably simplistic melodrama. Perhaps the actors had as much problem believing the dialog as I did. For crying out loud, they even threw in a kid with cancer as a whorish attempt to generate some emotion, although it added nothing to the plot.The special effects were exceptional. If that is sufficient for you to enjoy a movie, this is a movie for you. If you require good character development and a creative script as I do, then this movie is likely to fall well short.</fullReview>

Too bad. This movie is totally ridiculous, and would have been hilarious as a puppet-fest.The science in this movie is just silly. Even if it is possible that global warming could trigger ocean current changes that might, for example, make Great Britain resemble Svalbard, no one has suggested that these things could occur in a week. Cinematic license is one thing, but this is ridiculous. And why, o why, does it make sense for our hero to set out after his son, when half the population is fleeing? It's narcissism and solipsism run amok.Still, even the real live action version can be seen as a hoot, if you're in the right frame of mind.</fullReview>

I guess people really enjoy seeing natural disasters on an epic scale because this movie was basically boring.

I guess.I can only assume that this movie made scientists around the world cringe and I'm guessing had a few dead ones turn over in their graves. I actually believe that the burning of fossil fuels is harmful to our environment but this is not the way to try and convince people of this fact, since the premise of this movie is so ridiculous.Why does every disaster movie have to involve the President of the USA?!?! It was such a stretch in this movie in particular, but it's good to see that "Riptide" has not completely faded away... ;)Well I'm sure this is not the last we've seen of this style movie, since it did so well at the box office, and probably not the last of it's type from director Roland Emmerich.Glad I waited to see this on DVD...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ha, well, I gave this crazy new ice-age story a 7/10 for, mainly, the quality put into this film. The story was a little overdone, and I wish that we saw more of what might happen to different countries than our own. This director loves natural disasters and space...whatever relation those have together we never are sure of.Dennis Quaid played an average guy (his specialty), who happened to work for the climate watch for the government, who is out to save his brainy kid (Jake Gyllenhaal) from the perils of the new ice-age coming to sweep what seems to be mostly New York.A depressing and stark reality view of what might happen if New York keeps driving cars...no not really, but you can't help but feel guilty after seeing this. We really don't care if things get this bad like they are in this film, but apparently we're supposed to. Or else the Statue of Liberty gets it! I liked the music, some of the disaster scenes (some were completely predictable), and, again, the quality of the shots involving a lot of stuff happening at once. I DIDN'T like the wolf scene, the hum-drum characters and their reactions to everything, no buildup to anything (except getting away from that damn area), and the ending! The ending was just "poof" and everything seemed to be all better within the last 10 minutes! I was quite angry. Well whatever, 7/10.</fullReview>

This movie is nothing if not an endless series of clichés ripped off from just about every disaster movie ever made, from "The Poseidon Adventure" to "Earthquake" and "Twister". The only thing missing were the dinosaurs from the Jurassic Park films, but I guess they would have frozen to death in the new "Ice Age". At least with "Independence Day" the Producer/Director Roland Emmerich never tried to insult the audience's intelligence by presenting that film as anything other than big budget summertime brain candy.3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie Day after tomorow was pretty much what the trailer showed it to be, meaning that it only had speial effects going for it and good sound.The acting in the movie was superfluous as they could just as well have cut out all the characters and shown just the effects. There is almost no character growth, the script was basic and predictable and the emotional scenes almost seemed to be a secondary option. The stunt scenes such as the one where they fell through the mall roof were utter nonsense as any person would be able to extricate themselves from that position, save the poor bloke at the bottom and still be able to keep their gloves on that were supposed to stay on any way(I mean who the heck takes off their gloves to support themselves against a girder that is damn cold)The special effects were "ok" there were a lot of scenes where the 3d dynamics were wrong and stupid showing where the animator cut corners. One scene at the end looks like it was done by a 3 year old on a Macintosh.Overall I found that the sound was great but when you have 2 hours of bad visual effects, bland acting and good sound then the latter seems to loose its punch.Overall i hope they don't release a DVD of this movie,that would be a waste.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very silly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not averse to sensationalist disaster movies that have special effects as their main plot-motivation. I actually liked Independence Day. But at least that contained some humour. This movie takes itself so seriously that you're constantly aware exactly how silly it all is. Or have you ever seen a TV-anchor reporting live while standing a few hundred metres from not one, but TWO tornado's. I say, he deserved to get hit by that piece of debris!The characters are all utterly uninvolving, so that you really don't care a hoot what happens to them. Random subplots are inserted to add interest, but fall completely flat. What's it with that sick boy the scientists wife is looking after? And oh yes, while the whole nation is crumbling under an unprecedented natural disaster, they're sending an ambulance through the blizzards especially to pick these two up...!? (Not to mention the army of helicopters flying into NYC to save daddy and son - as if that is all they have to do). The ship drifting into the NY streets is ludicrous, of course, but worked in a surrealistic way. The wolves however are the movie's worst idea, and badly done at that. I must say that in general I did not find the special effects particularly impressive, with the exception of the tidal wave flooding New York. All in all I found this pretty boring and instantly forgettable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Only in Hollywood could thousands of centuries of global climatic changes occur in the span of a few weeks (or for the sake of this movie, in less than two hours). How senseless and naive can one be?Okay, I admit that The Day After Tomorrow does tend to keep one on the edge of their seat with a steady dose of action, but come on, this plot is so hokey that even a whacked out environmentalist would be scratchy their heads.They could not even get the cataclysmic weather sequences right. I'm from the Midwest and believe me, those tornados that struck LA were pure Hollywood fabrications. I suggest the director and special effects supervisor spend a little time in Tornado Alley before doing another storm scene. The massive storms were called super cells? Wrong, super cells are large isolated thunderstorms not inland ice age cyclones. Watch the Weather Channel a little more, please!On the positive side, I was impressed with the special effects in The Day After Tomorrow, as improbable as they are. My wife spent more time with her eyes covered than not, so kudos to the effects.Would I recommend this movie, sure, as long as you take its socio-commentary with a grain of salt. The earth is not going to end as a result of global warming by this weekend, honestly!6 out of 10 from Tornado Alley!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shallow Impact</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*contains what some may consider minor spoilers*I watched this on election night in Australia. A disaster movie seemed like a good idea.Actually I'm kind of fond of good disaster movies. Lived through the original craze as a kid, starting with 'Poseidon Adventure'. You learn not to expect anything profound - just some well done, big-scope action/adventure fun in a well-done example. Such an example of the more modern variety was 'Deep Impact', which was followed by a parade of increasingly more tedious clones, right down to the utterly awful 'Tychus'.Whereas 'Day After Tomorrow' isn't that bad, it's no 'Deep Impact', either. Maybe it's the subject matter. Having run out of disasters to have disaster movies about, the makers of 'Independence Day' turn to Global Warming. Only trouble is, this is a cataclysm which takes place over decades, or maybe centuries, so they speed it all up into a few weeks. Unfortunately not even this is enough to obscure the fact that, in disaster movie terms, watching things get frosted over really quickly isn't exactly jaw-dropping.The first 45 minutes or so are fairly strong. The appropriate sense of awe, as in 'something awful is coming', with scientists trying to convince skeptical politicians (including a VP who looks far too much like Dick Cheney to be coincidence), and people saying "Oh my God" in hushed voices a lot. You've seen the same thing in 'The Towering Inferno', 'Deep Impact', 'The Arrival', perhaps even 'Contact'. It's what happens when the action part of the film eventually gets under way that lets everything down.A tidal wave hits New York (this isn't a spoiler, since it says so on the back cover). The thing is, there is zero build-up to this, nobody says "Oh, my God, a tidal wave is going to hit New York" in hushed tones; and when it does arrive, frankly it's rather sluggish-looking. Even the tornadoes in LA are sort of blown off (if you'll excuse the expression) without summoning what should have been the appropriate amount of awe and dread.What really kills the thing though is having Dennis Quaid trudge for ages across the snow while his son sits about in a library in Manhattan. There's nothing really wrong with the film moving into this phase. Every disaster movie has its narrow-focus human story part, after the macro-focus cataclysmic event part. It's just that whereas in say, 'Poseidon Adventure', this part was genuinely exciting, in 'Day After Tomorrow', it's genuinely dull.Unlike some disaster movies, this one isn't a disaster itself, but it fails to deliver much beyond the opening sense of awe. Not quite 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Day After Tomorrow is another in a long line of modern disaster movies, more or less started by Independence Day. True to form it provides popcorn nonsense and appalling dialogue.Dennis Quaid is Jack, a climatologist (Or something) who has, as they always do in these films, a troubled family life due to his workaholic mentality. However, being not too bad at his job (as they always are in these films) he discovers the Polar Ice Caps are melting as a result of global warming due to our usage of fossil fuels etc and the current of the Altantic is being altered by the flooding into the sea of the reservoirs of ice.*phew*Essentially he tells anyone who'll listen that an impending ice age is on its way, and fortunately a few kind souls believe him and give him time to prove it.The next stage is the son, played by Jake Gyllenhaal who's isolated in Manhatten with some school friends and others as a result of the crippling weather. Yeah, you can predict the ending already...This is pure utter fluff. It's hardly even worth skimming any more of the nonsense plot such is the sheer lightweighted nature of it. The substance, if that's the word, of the story is based on the appalling dialogue and cheesy delivery of it. The amount of cringeworthy material here is enough to sink the Titanic, never mind an audience's tolerance.The special effects are the real star of this, and it must be said they're pretty darn good. The storms look breathtaking, and the tidal wave is fairly convincing. Furthermore the panoramic scale views of cities is pretty impressive as well.Without question the effects save this from being absolute tripe, and fortunately the players here are aware this is hardly serious stuff and seem to ham it up on purpose. There are plenty of moments which give an unintentional laugh from the director's point of view, but intentionally from the cast. They never seem to take it seriously for a second. Well, either this or they're just *really* bad...It's mindless drivel and absolute rubbish but it's personable enough entertainment for a couple of hours if you're bored.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think that most disaster movies fail when they do not develop both the disaster and the characters at the same pace. In The Day After Tomorrow, I found the science that dominated the first half (albeit a little unrealistical) to be very interesting and I was looking forward to seeing how it would play out. About halfway through, I was very impressed. At that point, it seemed they ran out of plot lines for the disaster and had Dennis Quaid undertake a dangerous journey to try and fill time, which is about all it did. I think if they had added some more scientists to the writing team, they could have removed all the wasted character development (and I use that term loosely) and come up with a real interesting nailbiter.B for effort.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>clumzy's Take on The Day After Tomorrow (2004) - Rating - Worth RentingI've never been a involved in a natural disaster. The closest I've ever come was having my cruise ship diverted from Cozumel, Mexico to Key West, Florida because of a Caribbean hurricane. We had a few waves, I hurled, no biggie. But there is something compelling about a disaster that takes regular people and rallies them around a common cause, a common threat. That is the magic of these epic disaster movies.Present day America, Jack Hall (Dennis Quad), an adventurous environmental scientist, presents startling research about a coming Ice Age to political delegates of the world. None heed his warnings and before you know it we've got swelling seas, three giant super-cooling hurricane-like storms and a subsequent icing of the Northern Hemisphere. To add to the drama, Jack's son, Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal), is fighting for his survival in New York, while Jack braves the elements to find him.We've seen this kind of movie before, like Deep Impact, Volcano, and Perfect Storm to name a few in recent history. Success hinges on playing up the "bad guy", the natural disaster, being bigger and badder than anything we've ever expected. We can't get too action oriented here lest we come up with an Armageddon or Independence Day type of implausible ra-ra Go America patronizing drivel. The story must be grand enough to apply to the entire globe but focus in on a few brave characters. And of course in true Hollywood fashion we need to be stuffed with more "spectacular" CG than we can possibly choke down in one sitting. This is the pitfall of this film and it has successfully skirted the perimeter of this waking chasm without plunging in ... too much.One of my biggest beefs in modern movies is the use, or over-use, of so-called "ultra realistic computer graphics" that guarantee to blow the mind and most film studio budgets. Day After, uses CG in a way to augment the story, leaving the actors to act and the special effects to dazzle ... mostly. I respect this movie in that the CG, although over the top at times, was used in an inanimate way. Besides the CG wolves who make a brief appearance, the storms, tidal waves, helicopters, a frozen New York and a few explosions were quite nicely done. So I'm glad we don't have to endure a spandex-clad CG Dennis Quad swing from building to building looking for his lost boy. The script holds together decently without any significant gaps in logic for the casual viewer. The story does fall slightly into the "everything that can go wrong does but ends up turning out okay" mode, but can be accepted by this film-goer's suspension of belief. Quad and Gyllenhall perform admirably in the limited roles they've been given, facing adversity, fighting for their survival where others would fail. Hokey love mush is kept to a minimum and to a certain extent the human running, jumping and sliding stuff actually does add to this mostly grand scale movie. Let's just leave it at that.I'm convinced that they could make a killer natural disaster movie if they put together a meteor hitting the Earth at the same time that a giant hurricane was tearing up the coast and a volcano was exploding and then the ice age came and froze everything up. Oh ya and let's throw in some aliens and a twist ending like 6th Sense and we've got a masterpiece. Let's be glad Day After only hits one of those. The only other issue I have with this movie is that Canada is apparently completely decimated by the ice age and we all die. Man, we're Canadians, if there was ever another ice age we'd all be out skiing, snowshoeing and playin' hockey. Sheesh, Hollywood!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful effects but forgot the story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**HERE BE SPOILERS**Jack Hall (Quaid) is a climatologist workaholic and absent father. During a conference he warns that the melting of polar ice might in the future be enough to disturb the ocean distribution of heat from the equator to northern regions (this concern is for real people, even if a lot of other "facts" in the movie seem implausible). Naturally the politicians don't take him seriously, accusing him of not considering all the facts and just talking out of a scientific point of view, not considering economics or politics. He returns home to continue his work. At the same time his son Sam (Gyllenhaal) goes to New York to be in a science competition. Unfortunately Jack's predictions seem to come true in a matter of weeks. The mother of all storms evolve devastating everything it passes and bringing the next ice age in its wake. New York is in the middle of it all and Sam and his friends get stuck at the public library. Now Jack has to go get to him.The idea to the story, the effects and views are stunning. Unfortunately those things cannot cover all the holes that the story then uncovers. For example, a crucial point in the movie is that, at the middle of the storm cool air is sucked down to the ground, freezing everything instantly. I seriously doubt a lot of things in these scenes. For one thing, the cold will not affect you if you have closed the door behind you. Another question I thought of is what Jack intends to do once he reaches Sam. Apparently he plans to bring his son, who unlike Jack has no gear to be outside in an ice age, on a trek and walk for several days out of there. A third question that arose is why Sam and his friends in the library started to burn books. Sure they burn nice enough, but paper burn quickly. I would have started with wood, there must to be some wood furniture at a library. There are a lot others questions and loose ends in the plot. Altogether they result in that the movie never really got hold of me. It never really created any suspense. It never really tried to interact with its audience...So, nice effects but too much holes in the plot... unfortunately, it was a good idea.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>as far as disaster movies go, this is a decent film.first off, the effects are great and worth a view alone, gotta love cgi and the amazing images we get these days. this may not be considered fine art by any means, but "wow" comes to mind. next is acting, nothing of golden globe or Oscar caliber, but you don't ever feel like your watching actors playing a role if you know what i mean. there have been comments of lower caliber actors, but if bruce willis or some other big shot was the lead, i think it would take you out of the story. story wise, it seems quite plausible even if it is rather fantastic and don't forget this is a movie after all. i will make notes as i watch this film and give specific details, good and bad...*spoilers ahead* how does a film maker tell the story of a global disaster and keep it on a very personal level, of course you follow a few lead characters in the struggle dealing with the catastrophe. so let's get into some details and what i feel was good or could have been done better.there's a nice intro to what's going on with the earth and why this global disaster is happening, these are issues we can all identify such as global warning. the scientific details are kept to a level we can all understand. starting with India at a scientific conference, it is snowing and gives us a little hint at what's coming. next we move onto japan into a baseball sized hail storm. it is a relatively short scene and does not feel real. next we get some details and establishment on our lead characters. nothing too exciting and i feel pulls us away from the catastrophe waiting to happen. we slowly get brought back in with small signs such as animals freaking out , flocks of birds escaping south, and few other scientific things.watching los angeles getting destroyed by tornadoes left and right is awesome! the only part that seemed completely contrived was watching the Hollywood sign getting obliterated, guess that's l.a. for you (that's why i left the place). let's move on, we go back to our lead characters and there struggles as things get more intense. there is of course the antagonist in the form of the vice president, who refuses to believe in the oncoming disaster. our scientists give us a countdown of the impending doom. we also get a description of what the monster, hurricane-like storms will do and that is freeze anything instantly and i mean anything.onto mayhem in new york. it's been raining for days and the streets are flooding. the city has come to a complete standstill. as the statue of liberty is up to her neck in a tidal wave, we know the impending doom of new york. our hero's narrowly escape to the new york public library. these scenes are again fantastic and very well done. if there's anything that bothers me, it's the inter cutting of lead characters and the disaster. i want to watch the whole thing as if i'm reading this in a history book, not seeing the characters jumping over cars to get into the library, because i already know they're gonna make it.now we are at the part of most disaster movies i hate, everything comes to a stand still. kinda like being in the eye of the storm, to coin a phrase. our characters are coming to terms with the situation, being inside a new ice age. of course, our scientist hero who has figured out what's going with the world, now has to go save his son stuck in new york. all of the sudden it feels like everything has come to a stand still. the president has agreed to evacuate the united states from the middle of the country on down. one thing that bothers me at this point, this is a global catastrophe, yet we focus on the u.s. and only a few characters. you really want me to feel the drama of all this, take me on a tour of the world as we all suffer. we watch our hero and his two companions, struggling to trek through the snow to new york. here's the scene from backdraft, where one of them sacrifices himself for the other two. you wanna give sacrifice, then show me a mother giving up her child to survive as she passes in the storm or something. this is ultimately where this movie went south for me and became Hollywood blockbuster cheese. our hero's show us a moment of romance... the president doesn't make it, putting the vice in charge... our heroine is close to death... astronauts in the orbiting space station show us the magnitude of the storm... the storm will be at it's worst point shortly... there's a pointless wolf chase scene... our hero's narrowly survive the instant freeze from the eye of the storm... the storm relinquishes... there are some more amazing effects of new york in the new ice age, but we've already been pulled from the scale of it all, by the previous scenes... scientist dad finds son in new york... the new president gives us a message of how we brought this ice age on ourselves, by using up the earth and that we shall prevail... there are survivors! we see people getting rescued from the rooftops of skyscrapers... our hero's are safe.so what's my conclusion, worth watching. great start, fantastic scenes, but fell short at the end and didn't present a global catastrophe fell as advertised.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>it's a disaster, all right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Day After Tomorrow" is (drum roll please) a disaster movie! For those of you who aren't familiar with this genre, what this means is that lots of big man-made objects (buildings, ships, planes, etc.) get blown up/knocked over/washed away/sunk, or whatever. That's what you should expect in a movie of this type, and sure enough, this one delivers the goods. But if you're looking for plausibility, or character development, look elsewhere.To be sure, the overall plot device (the near-instantaneous global warming) is ridiculous in the extreme; but hey, sometimes you have to suspend belief to make a movie work. (Besides, it's not all that more implausible than an experienced ocean-liner captain turning his ship broadside to a tidal wave, a la "Poseidon Adventure"!) But given the means the film makers chose to kick-start the action, couldn't they have at least made some of the details more believable? I'll give one example: as the water ominously rises out of the subways, sewers, and storm drains of New York (all of which are underground passages not famous for their hygienic cleanliness), what is the reaction from you, the audience member? (1) "Oh no, doom is at hand! They're all about to die! Run for your lives, people!" Or, (2), "Look how astonishingly CLEAN the water is! Why, it's practically transparent!" If you picked No. 2, then you'll feel right at home with this film. It's no wonder all those blase New Yorkers just mosey on down the sidewalk as the city slowly sinks beneath them; why flee in terror when you've got a great new swimming pool right there on Fifth Avenue?Speaking of that (fleeing in terror), this film really dropped the ball on that part. Every fan of disaster movies knows that the evacuation scenes can be some of the most gripping of all. (Personally, I think the scene near the end of "Deep Impact", when the desperate evacuees take over both sides of the interstate plus the median strip, was probably the most intensely realistic evacuation scene yet put to film.) Here in "TDAT" we have probably the largest mass evacuation in human history. An entire movie could have been made just on that one aspect alone! But instead, all we get is a quickie shot of people flooding the Mexican border crossings. What a letdown!If you like story-line implausibility, and one-dimensional characters played by decent actors trying to put some feeling into their cardboard dialogue, and (most of all) lots of stuff getting destroyed in spectacular, eye-popping fashion, then this is the movie for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ridiculously implausible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a ridiculous flick.Global warming leads to ice melt which leads to the cooling of the Gulf Stream. OK, fine, there's some plausibility in that.But sudden supercyclones over the northern hemisphere with eyes so large and powerful they suck supercooled air from the upper troposphere and freeze the planet in 48 hours? Gawd that's totally unrealistic.There are other events like tornadoes in LA and a massive surge of ocean water that floods NY that make no sense and are left completely unexplained, they are only there for "shock and awe" factor.It's films like this that give the environmental movement a bad name.The only redeeming factor for this movie was some of the effects sequences, especially the freezing ice chasing after the heroes of the film. But notice I say "some", other effects really stank (like the CGI wolves).I won't even bother to mention the bad acting. The actors of Twister deserve Academy Awards next to the pathetic performances (by even such luminaries as Ian Holme) in this film.3 out of 10, and I'm being gracious.Barky</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"the usual"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is "the usual" to me,because it has "the usual" storyline that all disaster movies have. Like in Terminator 3,Arnie said "we must go to Mexico,it will sustain minimum damage from the nuclear blasts". And in this movie (The day after tomorrow), Dennis quaid said "we should head south to Mexico, it suffered minimum damage from the storm"...I see a similarity. I personally rated it a 6 because it was more good than it was bad,I'm just not saying it's my all-time favorite or nothing like that.The special effects where very good on the f-5 tornado's and especially on the satillite view of the hurricanes. My favorite part of this movie,was when I saw the statue of liberty frozen (you don't get to see that every day). If you have any comments on my opinions, e-mail me @, ha8ter2004@yahoo.com,thank you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never thought I would live to see it, but this movie is worse than both "Twister" and "Independence Day". Thank god for the Internet. I would *never* pay to see this rubbish in a movie theater.There is *no* logic to the story. In the end, it all boils down to one man rescuing his (love/family/son/cat/whatever). No science, and all fiction.Actually, I sort of enjoy watching these "doom" movies. The USA gets completely wiped out, and rightly so, because of the bad acting. Fortunately, the rest of the world gets of scot-free. Perhaps it's because they have better script-writers?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a Hollywood scripted movie, by the numbers. Oh my gosh! The world is ending! Now lets talk, walk around, discuss, kiss, hold hands, wander around some more, get easily diverted into silly pursuits and you're screaming at the movie screen "Go south you morons, go south!".And oh so politically correct....The Mexicans graciously let us into their country when we forgive their debts. Like, we have 4 bazillion tanks, F-16s and millions of Americans are fleeing for their lives, and most of them own guns and we're going to sit around and discuss debt repayments with the Mexicans???? Maybe a nice game of bocci balls while we wait to freeze to death, eh Senor Pablo? I know it's siesta time, but hey! It's -150 degrees here and could we hurry this along a bit?Dennis Quaid goes to rescue his moronic son, who, despite his really really high IQ, doesn't seem to watch the news, and when he does, he promptly forgets the fact that NEW YORK IS GOING UNDER!!!!! So, he wanders around, hold hands, thinks about kissing...no wonder more females liked this silly movie than males! So, Dennis goes to rescue said moron, so two OTHER moron friends of his decide to go North with him, for some unknown reason, into the a sure death, and one dies and one almost dies, but hey! They really like this guy, who's going to rescue his moron son who...well, you get the picture.Another movie where you root for the bad guy, the "heros" to die and when the mother decides to stay behind to take care of a very prettty and cute little boy dying of cancer (Jeezzz, what happened to the PC meter running on this movie? Couldn't they find a cute little black kid to be dying?), so instead of saving herself for her family and herself and her doctor skills, which will be desperately needed for millions in the time to come, she curls up with the oh so cute little boy in his bed and promises not to leave him, despite the fact that everyone else ssems to have been afflicted by rampant common sense in the hospital and already left.Of course, somehow by some miracle (or silly Hollywood fantasy writing) oh boy! There she is waiting for valiant hubby in the end.I wish they'd had all died and made the movie more about special effects. One of these days they'll make a movie of Lucifer's Hammer and destroy that excellent book by stupid politically correct writing aimed towards morons and women.Very disappointing.Mapanari</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some things ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always had issues with action films. I don't have many in my DVD collection and I can count the ones I genuinely love on ten fingers. And when I look at the action films I have enjoyed, it tends to be because I like the characters or the depth of the dialogue. The really clever thing about Jurassic Park, and why it still works even all these years after the shock of seeing dinosaurs has dissipated is because the moments between those victims work so well. And so it proves with The Day After Tomorrow. Magazine after magazine has focused on the special effects wizardry and the creation of the weather. These for me were the weakest moments.The real strength of the piece is the reaction of the people to the impending doom and their compensation of what transpires. Yes, it's fairly interesting to see the tornadoes hammer through LA, and for the blizzards and tidle waves to take hold of New York. But frankly, nothing seen here is any more astounding than Twister or Deep Impact (other than the fact that they mount on top of one another). My favourite scenes don't include the weather, except as the peripheral cause. Good example: in an unusual twist large sections of the first act of the film take place in a small hut in the highlands of Scotland as three Englishman are the first to notice the unusual readings which would lead to Earth's near destruction and their efforts to get the message out. Unusually for an American film, it doesn't seem forced -- the dialogue feels local -- and without the rest of the theatrics it could be some BBC Two Horizon drama.Similar moments happen on the other side of the pond as the effects of the storm take hold. Again, I'd take issue with the naysayers who've been poo-pooing the script. Granted there is a moment with wolves which puts the infamous 24 Cougar incident to shame, but again the real drama comes from the isolation of the characters and also the realisation of what's important to mankind and its civilization. Watch out for a major politician considering whether North America should be looked at as a giant triage unit and when a librarian makes a passionate plea about which sections of his need to be saved. Speaking of which -- if this thing is so lame brained, how come there's a fabulous moment when two minor characters debate the importance of whether Neizche's work should be burnt which is right on the nose?So its intelligent, educational, the direction is fascinating and the acting is superb producing a well rounded action drama. But, now that New York has been destroyed by aliens, freak weather conditions and Godzilla, which other Sim City disasters are Emmerich and Devlin going to film next? A remake of Earthquake?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Particularly poor `Blockbuster' effort.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>D: Roland Emerich. Dennis Quaid; Jake Gyllenhaul; Ian Holm. I wanted to like this film, I really did, but to be honest, it is just a sly, pessimistic disaster film with more CGI than sense. Scientist/Meteorologist Quaid makes a shocking discovery which leads him to believe that a new ice age dawns. Typical English professor Holm agrees with him, but no-one with any authority does. This ridiculous story begs many questions: If such a huge fluctuation in the climate were to take place, and all the evidence was there to back up the theory, wouldn't more scientists realise it? Why is the vice president left to make all the important decisions? What is director Roland Emerich's obsession with destroying New York City? If Quaid is a government scientist, why is he not allowed to use the facilities or talk to the people in charge? Why does the film have to deal with Quaid's wife as a doctor treating terminally ill children; a horribly manipulative afterthought to the story which, instead of bringing it down to earth, gives it a sickly feeling? Many of the questions have no answer except from this: The film is garbage. What really makes this film particularly unconvincing is that it completely relies on CGI technology which is simply not good enough. And also that is basically just a remake of Emerich's earlier `Godzilla' travesty minus the Lizard. However, on the plus side, Dennis Quaid isn't bad as the scientist and Jake Gyllenhaul shows talent as his son ? but Ian Holm's performance as the professor is a bigger disaster for his career than the film itself. He genuinely looks embarrassed to be appearing in this picture. So, in conclusion, this film is a real waste of time. Let's all hope that Emerich makes a better movie next time (considering he hasn't made a good one yet, don't get your hopes up) or else stops making them all together. This is two hours of your life you won't get back.</fullReview>

The effects are fantastic, and we like Dennis Quade and think he's pretty good in any film he appears. It didn't need a deep human plot (that would have detracted from the adventure story), so this aspect of the film was quite right, apart from theobligatory love stories, which were as Hollywood usual, irritating and pointless.I intend to buy the DVD - it is one of the few American films of recent years I have really enjoyed (NB I don't regard the Lord of the Rings films as American).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is this supposed to be a spoof because I sure as hell felt like I was watching one. All it needed was for Dr. Lucy Hall to produce a guitar and start singing gospel songs to her patients. Mind you, it did make a change for her and hubby to be actually married and not divorced/separated only to have an emotional reunion at the end. Special effects were good but nothing I haven't seen before, apart from that it was just a painting by numbers film with a plot I've seen regurgitated countless times before. If this is considered a blockbuster then we're in big trouble. I'm not going to give it any points because it doesn't deserve any for being sloppy and clichéd. Have a bit of respect for your audience for goodness sake and stop churning out drivel like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Special Effects, Bad Everything Else</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this movie knowing that the best part would be the visual effects, but I also expected a decent story. Well, I was right about the first part. The only thing that makes this film watchable are the visual effects. Everything else is below average.Thai main message of the film (that we don't treat nature as we should and nature will find a way to correct that) is left totally undeveloped and by the end of the film it seems more like an impossibility rather than something that could actually happen if we are not careful. The ecological, political and ethical messages of the film are somewhat naive and instead of adding to the film they detract from it. And the fact that the father and son story takes first place in the film is not good at all.The film tries to talk about many things at the same time and fails every time. But it is not successful as an action film either. While some scenes (like the flooding of NY City) are spectacular and create some tension, the rest of the film just has too many problems. For example, I could not feel the threat of the climate changes because even though they threatened the entire world, all we saw was the destruction of LA and NYC. And the end was just terrible. All this just passed away and everything will be just ok?I recommend it only for the excellent visual effects. I give it 6 out of 10 (again for the visual effects).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saturday the 7th of August 2004. I had an evening to kill and in which way you can do that any better as at the theatres with a good movie. First option was the remake of `Dawn of the dead'. Nevertheless the choice was ?The day after tomorrow'. Boy was I in for one of the most over-rated movies of the year 2004!The storyline I will skip right away. Not much story to be found anyway. One of the so many disappointments into this movie. But before I go any further with my destruction of the film, I wanna mention this. The effects are some times spectacular and mouth dropping astonishing. As for the panoramic views of some sceneries this movies deserves some credit. So I would say to the effects department, Guys you did a great job. But: The movie itself is one gag of strings, of linked clichés like a knitted sweater!!! The story tries to stand onto these clichés, but seriously disappears into thin air in many ways. As the acting, which is of a similar quality, tear the movie down `below zero' for a more quality searching audience. The only thing that succeeds sometimes in keeping the movie straight are the astonishing CGI effects. Breathtaking they are indeed. So if we take these out (CGI) what does rest of the movie? Well nothing more or less as a bubble of air! I think in my humble opinion because of the fact, I just mentioned in the sentences above. We have an over-rated movie that is just created in being a success thru the promotion that this movie had into the past. A Hype, A must see, THE movie of the year and a cool trailer of the most spectacular scenes (like the disappearances of the Statue of Liberty) and we have a seller. But once in the theatre and actually watching it, the chance is 98% you will leave the room with the Q? Is this it? Boy what a waste of time and money. Don't say I didn't warn you if you didn't see it YET!For me 4.5 outa 10 and this is thx to the effects people! Otherwise it would be disastrous score of 2.5 outa 10!Dario/</fullReview>

OK, so it's not abysmal or spectacularly bad, but it is rather disappointing. The only really good thing about the film was it's special effects which were (as in every single Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin film except Godzilla) brilliant. A few famous faces were good too (Ian Holm, Emmy Rossum, Sela Ward), but that wasn't enough. You had to wait a good hour (maybe less) until the action came and it was a little too overlong for it's own good.

It just happened. And really how can that many people survive in the end? it seems impossible especially when they were building it up as this huge tidal wave of a disaster. for me it's a shame because the idea is good, the actors are all good, but the execution... one thing that bothers me too is the mom, doesn't she care for her son? it seems she doesn't even care or worry about him. it's lame. after the movie, you'll think: what a waste of time.</fullReview>

As I was watching this film I noticed the plot went in to quick. Some of the scenes in this movie made me wanna laugh since it was so unrealistic. The scenes with the news reporter feet away from a tornado, the fact that there were several tornados at once, and that Hollywood sign scene was really fake and I never seen anything like it.

		<shortDescription>Tune into the Weather Channel for this years end of the world scenario</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in the 70's, Hollywood producers and directors were overcome by a highly contagious disease known as disaster-itis. Filmmakers seemed to take great delight in blowing up one airplane after another, burning 120 story buildings to the ground, leveling Los Angeles with earthquakes, turning ships upside down, and even going so far as to have the whole state of Texas attacked by Killer Bees. Irwin Allan was the biggest carrier of disaster-itis and unfortunately for him, the longer the disease went unchecked, the more his films sank into an abyss of mediocrity. (See: Allen's The Swarm, Beyond the Poseidon Adventure &amp; When Time Ran Out). Disaster-itis has never truly left Hollywood. It just lays dormant from year to year, returning sometimes annually, sometimes semi-annually to goad some big name director into giving us another CGI laden special effects extravaganza wreaking havoc on either the good old U.S.A. or the world as we know it. Director and Writer Roland Emmerich is a known carrier of the disaster-itis germ. In 1996 he suffered an outbreak and brought us Aliens doing in Mother Earth in Independence Day. Two scant years later disaster-itis reared it's ugly head again, this time mutating into a Japanese strain of the virus causing Emmerich to bring Godzilla over from Japan. To relieve the symptoms, Roland had Godzilla stomp and chomp his way through New York. Apparently it was enough to send the germ into remission for six long years until Emmerich again was overwhelmed by the disaster-itis germ as if it were a form of incurable herpes.The culprit Emmerich selected to help rid himself of the disease this time around is global warming. It seems we are nothing but a bunch of careless polluters riding around in our SUV's sending emissions out into the ozone layer. This in turn has caused the polar ice caps to slowly melt away into the oceans. Funny thing about fresh water and salt water is that they don't mix too well. This is not a good thing to happen and is clearly stated so several times by Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid), to Vice President Becker (Kenneth Welsh) and anyone else who happens to be within ear shot. Hall says that despite the Arctic meltdown, we have at the minimum a hundred good years left, maybe even a few thousand by which time you and I will be pushing up daisies and be none the wiser. Trouble occurs however because although Hall is a good scientist, he's not a very good fortune teller and underestimates this impending disaster by about a hundred to a thousand years. This means that from coast to coast, from the United States, to Great Britain, and on to Russia, all hell is going to break loose at any moment and in The Day After Tomorrow hell hath no fury like an environment scorned.Unless you truly have been living up in the Arctic, you know all this already what with the bombardment of television ads, newspaper ads, web site ads and everything else Fox and Emmerich have used to promote this film for the past six years?.well it hasn't been that long it just seems like it. If the film turns out to be spectacular all that advertising doesn't matter. If the film comes in as being average or less than okay, just as Emmerich found out with Godzilla, hype will get the fannies into the seats that first weekend, but word of mouth can make your film an even bigger disaster than anything you put on the screen. Does The Day After Tomorrow live up to the hype? We go to the expert from another over hyped Emmerich film for our answer.'Mr. Godzilla, does The Day After Tomorrow live up to the hype?' Godzilla grins and says, 'Nope.'The special effects that you have seen in the trailers, in television ads and in the ten minute sneak preview Fox ran before American Idols one evening are spectacular on the big screen with digital surround sound included to blow out your ear drums. There's something awe inspiring about seeing a bunch of twisters circulating around Los Angeles taking out the Hollywood sign, wiping out skyscrapers, crashing helicopters and making a huge mess. In Japan we have huge chunks of ice falling to the ground. In the skies we have super sized thunderstorms giving airline passengers one heck of a bumpy ride. Hurricanes run rampant, and Great Britain gets a very early White Christmas. To top it all off, New York is flooded by a gigantic tidal wave, which then freezes over causing snow to bury much of what's left of the skyline. It's all amazing stuff, but unfortunately there's not enough of it and everything else about the film is as bland as day old toast.As silly as some of the 70's disaster flicks were they could always be counted on for some entertaining characters occupying the film no matter how cheesy and inept the dialog may become. It didn't matter how inept (Airport 1975) or how good (Towering Inferno, Poseidon Adventure) those films were, they managed to overcome their weaknesses by making us care about the predicament of those involved. As predictable as they were, you could always count on a few moments of hair raising adventure or suspense. In The Day After Tomorrow, we never care about anything that happens to the characters and when the rampaging weather isn't on the screen the film falls into long stretches of tedious boredom.With disaster all around them, it's incredible how blasé everyone in this film seems to be. It's just not the Dick Cheney vice presidential look alike, but Quaid's Jack Hall seems to be taking everything in stride also. When he goes off to rescue his son who is in danger of becoming a human Popsicle in New York City, we sit and wait for excitement and some kind of suspense that never develops. Only twice in the whole trip does Hall face any kind of eminent danger and these situations are dispatched with quickly and predictably. Likewise, Hall's son Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) and his companions in New York, never strike us as being in any real danger. Although they have one scene where they are being chased by some escaped timber wolves, the rest of their scenes include a lot of talking, some preaching, and a lot of book burning. After all, they have a whole library at their disposal to keep warm with so why not torch a few copies of Harold Robbins and Jacqueline Susann? Unfortunately, burning books adds up to zero in the way of suspense unless your film is title Fahrenheit 451.Then there's Hall's ex-wife Lucy (Sela Ward) left behind to care for a cancer ridden young boy. We admire her for it, but once again there is no build up of suspense as Emmerich leaves little doubt as to what the outcome of that story or anything else will be. Even when President Blake (Perry King) waits until the last minute to depart the White House, we only hear of his fate, we don't witness it. Wasn't it much more interesting to see the President and The First Lady in Independence Day facing imminent danger? Also, when will the studios learn that when they show all the aces in your hand with trailers and ads before people even get to the theater, those first weekend patrons will be sure to let everyone know 'you saw all the good stuff in the previews.'So why whitewash everything? The problem with Emmerich and the studios that make a film like The Day After Tomorrow is they are so intent on assuring themselves of nothing worse than their precious PG-13 rating, that for all the disasters taking place, we see little of the actual human toll involved. If all you want to show us are buildings and cities being taken down when millions have lost their lives, do you really expect us to become emotionally involved with your story? As for the PG-13 rating, the studio must have begged for it as there's no reason this film shouldn't be any worse than a PG. It is never frightening, never suspenseful and most of the time a bore with a capital B.If Emmerich was trying to make a serious film about global warming, then perhaps they should have done away with all the special effects hype and sold the film on a more serious level. It's possible that's what he really had in mind but you can't sell a film on that basis when you're trying to put more fannies in the theater than that green ogre known as Shrek. The problem is, I have to view the film the way it was sold to me. It was sold as a special effects laden disaster film which just happens to use global warming as it's plot device. And when you make a disaster film that does nothing to sustain the goodwill accumulated by some great special effects, has no interesting characters, and zero suspense, I have no choice but to give you my grade which for The Day After Tomorrow is a C-.Oh yes, one more important thing before I go. Take it from an old Midwestern boy. Someone should tell those L.A. news stations that if for some odd reason a tornado does come floating down Hollywood Boulevard, it's really not a good idea to be playing tag with them while riding in a helicopter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Campy, but good summer fun.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>after just watching day after tomorrow, i must say it was a lot better then i expected, which was'nt much more then good special effects. Now, although acting campy to some extent, and the story "rushed" so that the action sequences could be the star, but overall a good film. Now to the gripes. First off, i dident like the story structure overall, all of a sudden out of nowear the weather starts to change, and super fast. I felt that some major event, such as a small astroid impact or a accidental or intentional huge nuclear event could have made it seem somewhat more believable, but at the beginning of the film, it just starts to happen. Of course, one man sees it coming, and of course he is rejected by everyone in power, you know the old jor el telling the council of krypton that there sun is going to explode (from superman) bit!Anyway, after some cool but campy heroic moments, the film slows down a bit, and a somewhat love story begins between the two young stars, but never really goes anywear. i mean, yea, you like the girl, you save her, then what? But then again, all our male hero dreams about saving the women we love never get past that point eather, right?I also dident like how some characters were disposable, like dennis quaids (sp?) friend who falls through the ice into a store. we just aren't given enough time to feel the impact of his actions or enough time with him to miss his loss. And as for the whole trek to new york through the storm, its a stretch, but i feel they handled it OK. Sure, id love to see them walk past a frozen baltimore or camp out on a frozen new jersy turn pike (me having traveled from long island to virginia many times, and i sure would like to see the end of the turn pike leading into new york in some state of damage) but, unfortunately, we aren't given these views.Overall, a good film with some campyness, but its a summer special effect eye candy film, so you have to expect that. Just turn off your brain and watch.*** 1/2 outa 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A great movie in plain words. I loved the natural disaster theme. My favourite part was when the tornadoes where destroying Los Angles. One of the funny parts during that, in a weird way was when to billboard smacked into the reporter. There were probably more American symbols in the movie then there were in The Patriot. The computer generated wolves were realistic but no substitutes for the real thing. Jake glyenhall was probably the best actor in the film and Denis Quaid in second. However, the ocean could not be desalinated enough by ice caps to do any major effects.Another thing that was hard to follow was what was the reason for the crazy weather happening so suddenly? It only minimally touched on that and didn't explain a thing. Overall an excellent, must-see movie.My rating: 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>eh.. worth the dollar theatre price.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** POSSIBLE SPOILERS***after all the rancor and trailers earlier this year, i figured i'd just wait until "the day after tomorrow" hit my area second-run theatre to go see it. being the skeptic of "global warming" that i am, i would never fork over full price to see something touting global warming as the sole cause of a geological cataclysm so powerful it would cause a total climate shift. unless of course it featured something remotely plausible; like a severe nuclear winter.one of the numerous criticisms/complaints about this production is the way in which it features steaming heaps of leftist propaganda so hokey, it could've been written by bono himself. true, the attitudes portrayed here are stereotypical per their characters' archetypes, and we must resign ourselves early in the story to these stereotypes. also true that several "controversial" scenes do exist; if i can describe one such scene without spoiling it excessively: at one point we see American evacuees (called "refugees" in the story) flooding into Mexico whilst Mexican officials and authorities blockade gates and refuse entrance. a number of fellow patrons shook their heads at this scene, and i found myself thinking, "typical". i daresay this was not the desired effect of the filmmakers, as they were clearly trying to get us to think, "but they're just trying to escape a bad situation!". this concept recurs more towards the end of the film, and the educated viewer is likely only to bristle at the attempt, and discard it from consideration as mindless propaganda. you see, i live in arizona, very near the Mexican border. we accept Mexican "refugees", who are "simply trying to escape a bad situation" on an hourly basis. so when i saw that scene, i didn't have one of those "now i'm in the other pair of shoes and it feels funny in the bad way" reactions. rather, i had the "of course. my country takes them and my country's government even considered giving amnesty to all of them. of course they should refuse us, as that's why their people came here in the first place."my point is that the film's message is completely lost in its (un?)intentionally offensive and dare i say, slanderous, assault on American leadership, law, and culture. of course, we hear terms arise such as "western civilization". the problem occurs in the entire northern hemisphere, yet there is little to no mention of europeans. whilst "western civilization" is uttered, we see absolutely no adverse phenomenon in -south- America. in the beginning of the film, we see a few seconds of a hail storm in japan, and then we leave japan and hear nothing of it ever again. the extent of the European depiction is limited to three scientists trapped in the united kingdom. nothing more. also omitted from the "global disaster" are china, the entire middle east, all of africa, micronesia, and oddly enough we see absolutely nothing in canada, supposedly hit the hardest by this curiously karmic cataclysm. with so many politics tossed about the dialogue so freely, and with so many major world players completely absent from the consequences of the storms, one cannot help but feel an unmitigated sense of antiamericanism.personally, i brushed it off as intestinal gas and enjoyed the scene where sam slams the door on the wild wolf. not since "conan the barbarian" have i seen a character so not willing to succumb to the innate cuteness of an uppity animal. bravo, sam.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I shouldn't like this movie. It has a premise based on something completely unscientific, it relies too much on cliche action sequences, and the story itself is not that strong. Yet I still couldn't help but like The Day After Tomorrow.I personally am not a huge fan of natural disaster flicks. As of right now the asteroid movie Deep Impact is my favourite of the genre, but The Day After Tomorrow is firmly in second. Like pretty much all of Roland Emmerich's movies, the number one reason to go see this movie is for the special effects. The first half of the movie is filled with fantastic scenes of destruction, such as massive tidal waves, blinding snow storms, and seeing all of North America and its major cities encased in ice. It is quite simply a smorgasbord of sweetness for the eyes, and it had me on the edge of my seat...until the second half hit.The second half of the movie is much slower than the first half, and focuses on climatologist Jack Hall's (played by Dennis Quaid) efforts to rescue his son Sam Hall (played by Jake Gyllenhaal), who's trapped in New York City. The acting is on the whole not bad, with Jake Gyllenhaal being the stand out in the movie. It's interesting to see how everybody in the movie acted when confronted with a life or death situation. But, personally I wanted to see more scenes of destruction in the second half, and I can't help but feel a little gypped when they pretty much stopped.Overall, The Day After Tomorrow is first and foremost a disaster pic, and if you come to movie looking for nothing beyond some great eye candy, you probably won't be disappointed. Just don't go expecting too much more than that though. I give this movie 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If environmentalists had their way, farmers around the world would be back in the Stone Age. I live in North Dakota and happen to have grown up on a farm. Environmentalists bitch about the exhaust created by our machinery all the time, saying it's killing the air, wah wah, etc. etc. Well I have news for them. Farm states are the cleanest frickin' states in the nation. I dare some hippy environmentalist from California to come out to ND and tell me the air is cleaner in any coastal state.North Dakota has thousands of farms with thousands of machines. We mine coal and natural gas. We drill for oil, we hunt animals and we catch fish. We also love our state and our country. I hate people, especially people from outside of America, that try to tell me what is right and wrong in this world when they themselves have never experienced anything further than 50 miles away from what they call home. I have been to 16 of the 50 great states. This includes the smog states of California and Florida who I have nothing against. In fact I thoroughly enjoy them in small doses. I will one day experience the brilliance of them all. I will put money down that many of you that are complaining about global warming issues live in a large city and have experienced nothing outside of it. You are completely ignorant to the fact that what "global warming" there is in the world, you're just as much responsible for it as the rest of us.Now for some good-old'-fashion ass chewing by the nice folks on IMDb.com..."Bleeding hearts lead to death, a strong heart keeps you alive."</fullReview>

No scientific explanation was given as to why it all happened so quickly...or indeed at all. OK so the planet warmed, the ice Shelf melted mixing fresh water with salt, disrupting Atlantic currents...then what? why this change so quickly? Then the theory rejoins with winds tunneling air from the Ionisphere..OK fair enough The current change to the wild weather was not explained properly.On the ship when finding medication.... good scene and the most gripping with the computer generated wolves....but where did the touches come from all of a sudden?Surely with such huge global weather events there would be some effect to the southern hemisphere too....during such extremities with the disaster well into effect...radio station and television reporters are staying in there studios?? while every other person is running and panicking???

The story is atrocious, so far-fetched and unbelievable, that I found it hard to enjoy the spectacular vision generated by computer technology. The ridiculous story line was so out of whack, that the audience when I attended the movie were laughing outright which clearly destroyed any chance of it being a successful film. There were so many errors in the geography of the film, plus completely unrealistic and nigh impossible rescue situations that leaves you wondering "why bother?" The ship floating down the street, missing buildings, was a real "hoot".

		<fullReview>*-Catch it on TV **-Worth a Rental ***-Buy it Used/On Sale ****-Buy it New/Top Dollar *****-Worthy of a Blind BuySeeing "The Day After Tomorrow" got me thinking about how important it is to keep our environment clean and to be cautious about the affects of global warming. To be completely honest with you, global warming was the last thing on my mind while watching the latest big budget disaster flick from Roland Emmerich. I was more focused on trying to figure out why so many heroes in movies are named Jack. I was a little too busy suspending my disbelief and trying to ignore cliché after cliché. Once I successfully ignored the terrible script and horrid predictability of the movie I found myself enjoying the eye candy.The movie's plot is pretty straight forward. Mother nature is p***ed at us, I guess for that hole in the ozone layer and decides to unleash all hell and start the next ice age. There are major weather disasters all over the world spanning from tornados to hail, tidal waves and freezing hurricanes. In the midst of all this disaster, a family is torn apart. The main story focuses on the relationship, or lack thereof, between paleoclimatologist Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) and his son Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal). Sam is a genius who is on some academic team, which he joined because he is in love with a girl who takes the team seriously. The team is in New York City for a competition and you can pretty much guess what happens after that. The acting was better than I expected. Granted, I wasn't expecting much. There are a few light hearted jokes planted here and there throughout the movie for comic relief. It works. I admit I was laughing whenever Jason, the young scientist protege of Jack, was hitting on Tamlyn Tomita's character. Jack's wife's storyline is insignificant and hard to care about. Lucy Hall was overall a pointless character and had no real purpose. However, if the plot line involving her had been dropped it would not have improved the story at all. The special effects are breathtaking, as expected. There are a few instances where they are a little much but they were few and far between.Overall the only reason to see "The Day After Tomorrow" is the special effects. Even though a few sequences are clearly CGI, they are still good enough to merit this movie ***. It will go down as a guilty pleasure of mine and I will more than likely add it to my DVD collection. But I won't be in a hurry to buy it and I will only watch it when I am bored and don't feel like thinking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable enough, but don't look between the cracks or you'll see the sellotape holding it all together.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a self-avowed fan of apocalyptic scenarios either in book or film, I couldn't help but enjoy this movie, even though I felt more than a little let down by it.If you're looking for effects, then this film has plenty. But if you fancy a decent human interest story to go along with the destruction then I fear you'll be disappointed. The human side of the story is rather basic. A love interest angle for Sam Hall (Gyllenhall) and the obligatory struggle to survive. A father's love for his son and some hokum about a kid with cancer. Bland stuff.Whilst the effects are worth the money, the plot really isn't. As I mentioned before, I still enjoyed the film, but it was sadly lacking any real depth or characterisation. Additionally, rather obvious plot developments (at least I think so) were ignored in favour of cheap thrill alternatives. For instance, in a life or death struggle for survival I think rather more people would throw off the yoke of civilization and use the situation to their advantage. I'm not talking looters here, either. But in a group such as portrayed in the movie, it might have been nice to see one person with his own ideas (however dark) emerge - a human vs. human conflict. Instead, the only threat our group faces (apart from the weather) is from a pack of wolves that, having escaped from a zoo, apparently turn immediately into a pack of ravening man-eaters. Ho hum.Another nonsense concerns the girl who cuts her foot and gets an infection as a result. Not once during the steady onset of blood poisoning does she examine the cut or question why she doesn't feel too good. Duh!And whilst I'm ranting, how many people would actually follow a traffic cop out into the frozen, icy outdoors, wearing nothing more protective than their everyday casual attire, on the basis of the fact that he was an official and told them they had to "head south". Absolute bollocks! No-one is that dumb. Even children aren't that trusting.Another annoyance was the insistence of the director that there wouldn't be a Hollywood "happy ending". I'm not sure what I expected after I read this comment, but I doubt it was the evacuation of half of America to relative safety. That doesn't sound too apocalyptic to me. Nor did I expect to see the NY survivors thronging the rooftops of skyscrapers in their hundreds waiting for rescue by squadrons of helicopters who clearly had nothing better to do than fly around abandoned cities. How these people survived, when our heroic group only just managed it, is not explained.There was a lot (and I mean mounds!) of juvenile writing that went into this script and a lot of final-scenes feel-good nonsense. Too much "man will prevail" rubbish from a director who promised us something better, then didn't deliver.There are some nice visuals and some good ideas for the use of them, but the story is rather lame and best ignored by the viewer. If you do that, then it'll entertain reasonably well. But if you start thinking about the plot.......ewww!I'll no doubt watch this again when it comes on TV but, having noticed the cracks, it's hard not to look into them and see the whole thing for what it really is - an excuse to use CGI a lot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When special effects turns out to be the big stars of a movie, then it's really in big trouble. And that's exactly what happened with The Day After Tomorrow. Bad acting + bad story + bad directing = movie disaster. I guess the producers thought it was an okay gamble since people will still flock to the theaters to see this one. I love disaster movies. But please, make it worth our while. Make sure the script and directing is good. As for the actors, it almost felt like they accepted this job just for the money. They weren't motivated to become the characters and that's really sad because we spend 2 hours looking at them, trying to make us feel for them. As for the story, everything felt forced. It felt like they didn't take it seriously. This was a great opportunity to make the people learn about the environment but they just messed it up. Everything was so unbelievable. I mean, they built it up so big and resolved it weakly. This movie is really just a waste of money and of time.</fullReview>

Nothing about the movie was all that plausible.Really in my opinion, this isn't much worse (or better) than Deep Impact, Armageddon, Asteroid, Twister, or any other disaster film, though I really didn't see this film taking itself as seriously as some of those did.Was it entertaining, yeah.

		<fullReview>The movie starts quite good with the bad weather effects developing, and we get to see some nice special effects. But as the movie progressed it becomes almost all about the involved characters, and I never really cared about them. Some of the stuff the characters go through is just plain silly. A couple of interesting scenes and some nice visuals spread out here and there were not enough to lift this movie above dull. *** SPOILERS *** The basic idea behind the disaster is not so far-fetched that I cannot accept it as a premise for the rest of the film. In a chaotic (as in chaos theory) system, small changes in certain parameters have the power to create infinitely large and unpredictable deviations in a previously stable system. In this movie the change is blamed on some salt water/fresh water ratio. I don't know whether or not this is science, but I accept it. It's a disaster movie, not a scientific documentary. That said, how the world copes with the changes, that's totally unbelievable. The sky is crowded with weather satellites, there are observation posts all over and what do I know. There's no way these changes would go as unnoticed as in this film. Totally unrealistic development. Some unrealistic science: The world is not flat, as seen on the scientist predictions on the storm development. The three distinct storm formations, all shown on top of the flat world map, would be much closer and look quite different if the map was properly wrapped around a circular globe.A lot of the story is supposed to go on where this super storm is raging, and except from the initial storms in the beginning it looks like any odd cold windy winter day here in Norway. The sea water froze way too fast. The cold from the outer atmosphere can't come rushing down at you like seen in the movie. Air is actually a quite good temperature insulator. So for cold to come down this quickly, it should be in the form of cold air coming rushing down. Rushing air is also known as wind, but there was no wind in this scene. (Still a cool scene though, no pun intended.) Why is it so important, except for the symbolism, to start burning books, when there are lots of wooden furniture around?I can accept the scientific premises, but not very much of what was built on top of it. And that, and the uninteresting characters, ruined this film for me. Btw: The left-wing propaganda was of course stupid. No need to elaborate, but I will say one thing. If you blow the economy, you can't afford fighting for the environment. A poor country is seldom good for the environment. A strong economy is the basis for fighting for a good environment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't understand what was wrong in this movie, most people thought this was a bad idea, but not me. It had great entertaining and was good as the other said before i watched it. Not so popular actors, but they did a hell good job. I liked all the scenes, and some of them was so exiting, some scenes i never seen in a movie existed here, so its not bad at all. This was excellent and I'm impressed. since this movie comparing to Deep Impact and Independence Day, I'm sure its getting nominated or hopefully getting an award. rating 6/6Some people think its also are based on a true story, that this will happen in the future. If it does, blame it on George Bush. He will probably shut the greenhouse effect/motive power that will cause the ice on this earth just as this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unlike many, I enjoyed this movie and was on the edge of my seat for some of the exciting moments, and there were plenty of them. I would rate the film quite highly as a standard disaster flick, I enjoyed it very much, but when it comes the message it's obviously trying to convey, it fails miserably.The reason for this failure is that the environmental-skeptics would not be won over by watching this. The science is inaccurate and the effects of global warming exaggerated to a level that is just not believable any more.The director was taken a very valid and real concern, and in trying to raise awareness of it, has inadvertently made a mockery of it.For a much better environmental message, but much more subtle, see 'Koyaanisqatsi'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For the first time in my life i actually considered leaving the movie half way through (after stifling my laugthing at the ridiculously bad cartoonish CGI wolves).I've sat through some garbage before and the thought of leaving had never occurred, but this...and for the first time watching a summer blockbuster i thought "how much money did this turd cost to make"In case you think this is from someone who hates Hollywood and the big budget movies they produce every year i just like to say i usually love these Big dumb Hollywood disaster movies(ID4, Armageddon volcano etc...), but this is just a lackluster, by the numbers, unimaginative, pointless advert for all that is wrong with "Hollywood"I just got the impression all involved couldn't be bothered to give anything resembling their best and again for the first time felt insulted by nonsense pouring out of the screen (the killer -250 degree frost that is stopped by a small fire and a wooden door, or the three o'clock in the morning decision to have tacky looking cgi wolves attack them for no apparent reason and the ultimate storm that is going to kill the entire northern hemisphere that dennis quaid can survive in a warm coat and goggles.If The Lord of the Rings Trilogy taught us anything its these movies don't have to be mind numbling stoopid. Masses of people will go and see a movie that doesn't treat its audience as if they had all being lobotomised,even the Harry Potter movies treat its audience (mostly ,lil kids) with infinitely more respect then the makers of this huge pile of nothing.Rant over</fullReview>

One of my favorite parts has to be that all of these Americans are illegally crossing the border into Mexico to be safe. I love that! That is so funny! The special effects for the New York scene were incredible. Some of the acting could be better. It definitely wasn't Dennis Quaid's greatest hour. A couple of parts of the movies just weren't believable. When the soldier tried to get out of the helicopter and froze within seconds- that was a bit too much for me. I am not a big student of weather though.Who knows what kind of things can happen with the weather?!I would give the movie three of five stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, Well. Another disaster movie. I, for one, liked Independence Day. The dialogue was a tad cheesy but the effects where good and I cared about the characters. The Day After Tomorrow however was different. The opening where Dennis valiantly leaps across the ice to retrieve...what was it again? Oh, yeah...ICE CORE SAMPLES is so over the top that I actually twitched and said out loud, "What the hell!??". Not a good start. Then we flip to the UN meeting about weather and the all to heard environmentalist Left about global warming and the utter doom the planet and the humans inhabiting it are going to face. Blah, blah, blah...yadda, yadda. Of course, all the claims come true...blah, blah. Then we delve into the lousey script. People in the theatre actually laughed out loud during some of the dialoge. Poor Sela Ward. She was the major victim in the script factor. After they come back for her and the sick kid she says, "Thank you so much for coming". I think not, "Get us the hell outta here!" is more like it! The acting was wooden and stale. Although I have to say, I didn't see it for the story I wanted to see it for the effects. The story just got in the way. Getting back to the plausibility of the story...oh, I forgot there is none. Even mainstream scientists are cringing. The movie was blatantly political, jabbing away at the government and their policies. As if they aren't doing anything to help. All in all, not a good movie. You want a good ride, see it. Want a good movie without your intelligence insulted , skip it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a stinker. Every cliché you can think of is dropped in with a thud. You know it's bad when everyone in the theater laughs out loud at the love scene.... Mark my words, in a year or two this will be playing at midnight (alternating with "Rocky Horror") and groupies will come clutching bibles, wearing cane-bottomed chairs and dodging wolves. I know this is reputed to be a film with a political message, but for the life of me I can't see that any agenda is well served by this mess. (SPOILER ALERT) Anyone who thinks the US would evacuate to Mexico and not lead the way with tanks has not been paying attention.While I hate myself for paying $8 to suffer through this film, I know that my self-loathing can be nothing next to the shame and humiliation that the actors must feel. Let's hope they got really big paychecks in order to pay for lots of therapy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was okay. Out of 5 stars, this is a 3. However, the entire basis of the movie was unrealistic. Okay, so maybe the ice caps are melting, but the time scale of the whole movie is really, really stupid. It would take thousands of years for the world to enter a new ice age, not the scale they give.The dialogue was corny and stereotypical, very predictable and uninteresting. The way they talk has almost no emotion, and the actress who plays Sam's mom doesn't do a lot and delivers her lines in a cheesy way.The acting was stiff and lame. The real talent came from veteran star Jake Gyllenhaal, the man who played his father, and the English professor in the Scottish weather control center. The rest of the acting was lame and boring.Overall, the plot line was somewhat predictable. What would have spiced the movie up is if they just killed the people who tried to survive. Or at least a few. It's like a Disney movie, slow motion winning. Of course they're going to survive, so what's the point of making a movie about it?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So Bad, I Almost Admired It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Day After Tomorrow is a implausible, paint-by-numbers disaster movie, so filled with clichés, so predictable and that approaches badness from so many angles that I admire it, to an extent. Roland Emmerich has thrown logic, plot and character out and gone for sheer popcorn entertainment, and although the film fails on many fronts, I cannot fault his efforts.This is the kind of a film that does not have a script, it has a checklist. It introduces and disposes of so many characters, that we really don't care about a single one. One is tempted to make a list of the overused clichés: - the workaholic scientist dad who has a theory that no-one will listen to - the loving ex-wife with a noble career - the whacky homeless guy with a dog (which really, I thought they would eat) - the estranged son who just wants to hang with dad, so bad that he enjoy being stranded at sea just outside of Iceland - the nerdy yet somehow vivacious love interest of the son, complete with the rivalry from the rich, handsome private school guy hitting on her - the oriental female scientist, who really believes the theory - the heartless right-wing politicians - the British soccer fans - and most shamelessly, the bald-headed brave little dying kid that everyone forgets about.The plot holes in this move come at you with such fury, that your mind really just shuts off. Too many to even mention. But really, even in a movie this bad, can we be expected to suspend our disbelief to the point where a man walks from Philadelphia to NYC, in -100 degree temperature, in a blinding blizzard, no food, electricity or fuel, in a day or so? And we haven't even started talking about the librarian who would rather die than burn a book, the CGI wolves attacking three heroes searching for medicine on a Russian freightliner, the space station, the Japanese street vendors getting pelted by hailstones the size of a meatloaf or attempt to rescue the Queen.Whoever would consider this film a warning to the mindless burners of fossil fuels and shameless bar-b-q-ers of steaks must really give their own heads a major league shake. If anything, The Day After Tomorrow is such a far fetched plot that is mocks the environmental movement. Take away the awesome special effects and you can use the script for a sketch on Saturday Night Live.Still the destruction of LA and NYC are well done and exciting and in spite of everything, I did find this movie a little endearing. Not that I will recommend it, but I can't dismiss it either. *1/2 our of ****.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Global disaster--now that's entertainment. Even if you haven't seen a disaster flick since the heyday of Irwin Allen, you know the plot of "The Day After Tomorrow"--global catastrophe brings cardboard-cutout people closer together and doth make the box office's heart grow fonder.Yes, things do, indeed, get destroyed real good in this movie, but does it truly take us "Beyond the Poseidon Adventure"? Will it create a "Swarm" of business at the box office, or will it go up like a "Towering Inferno," or plunge to the depths on a "Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea" (which was a disaster flick before it became a cheesy sci-fi TV series)? Will I keep working in titles of other Irwin Allen movies until "The Day Time End[s]"? (Well, "Ended," actually.)At least Irwin wouldn't have given us cartoon wolves--a guy in a rubber snow monster suit draped in seaweed, maybe, but not cartoon wolves. And why does the world have to end "The Day After Tomorrow"? "A Week from Wednesday" would work better for me.</fullReview>

I am not a narrow minded person who thinks we are the only type of civilizations in the universe. I also believe that anything could be possible. Whether this movie could even possibly be real, made no difference at all. It does show how we take life for granted. I believe it was a good movie and I do think that it could be possible for this kind of catastrophe to happen. I have enjoyed Dennis Quaids movies for years and he has done another fine job. I would like to see more sequels to this movie as well as other movies. For those critics on this movie..... Can you prove this could'nt happen the day after tomorrow?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that makes me long for the great disaster films of Irwin Allen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's sad enough when a grown woman goes to see a film with the fallback plan of having Jake Gyllenhaal as eye candy in case the movie sucks. It's even sadder when she soon realizes that A) He plays a high school student in said film, and B) That even the eye candy can't make up for the fact that the movie really does suck ? badly. That was the situation I found myself in after seeing `The Day After Tomorrow'.The only saving grace for this film (besides the aforementioned eye candy) was some pretty impressive special effects. Unfortunately, there was about another hour and a half of celluloid to account for, which was comprised of ridiculous plot points, horrendous dialogue, (somehow I don't think I was supposed to laugh out loud when the rich kid tells Gyllenhaal, `Tell her how you feel' seemingly out of the blue) and some really, really lame timber wolves. The resurfacing of the (completely ineffectual) wolves marks the end of any hope that this movie even deserves one and a half stars. Unfortunately, there's another half hour to go from there.Some needs to tell Roland Emmerich `Hang it up son'. Like `Independence Day', the special effects were good, but also like ID4, a nearly two hour film cannot revolve around about ten minutes of destruction sequences, and `The Day After Tomorrow' tries this, leaving me as cold as that frost monster that Jake &amp; Co. evaded by simply shutting a door. `The Day After Tomorrow' is not worth seeing unless you're into some hard-core boredom with a few cool digital effects. The only thing the film really left me with was regret ? regret that I had waited in line to see this film and regret that the Fox News reporter that was mowed down by the flying debris in Los Angeles wasn't Bill O'Reilly. I did learn something, however ? I learned that if another Ice Age occurs, apparently the only satellite channel that will work will be The Weather Channel, so I thank you, `The Day After Tomorrow', kind of? I guess.--Shelly</fullReview>

They said the temp was dropping 10 degrees per minute. Last I checked that means hitting absolute zero would take less than an hour. Then what? I guess I have this thing where I can accept techno-babble like "use a tachyon pulse from the deflector dish to seal the subspace rift" but I can't accept a chopper's fuel-lines freezing in mid-flight without warning.The dialogue was poor and the story a cliché.

		<shortDescription>Much better than I expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this movie because there were no tickets for Harry Potter. I didn't feel like watching it much because I thought it would be another Armageddon or Godzilla. Surprisingly enough I REALLY LIKED the film. It's within its genre of global catastrophe/survival and I did not expect the plot to go beyond usual lines of showing either the worst or the best sides of the characters in a critical situation. This one concentrated on showing the best sides skipping the feast in the time of plague elements. Anyway it surprised me.... it surprised me with the idea of people surviving in the Public Library (probably a cliché in a more pretentious film but it goes fine here) and with many more little details. The CGI effects awoke my worst night time fears and made me experience some real moments of empathy. This film is great to see in ? theater. The visual side basically enthralled me. I couldn't take my eyes off this deadly beauty. I was left with an impression of general harmony of this film's composition.The political line was a bit one-sided and black-and-white though I didn't care much. I am sure The Day After Tomorrow is full of scientific and continuity goofs but they don't matter. This movie is meant to thrill and entertain you while delivering some important messages, even if they are slightly straightforward. I am really happy I had a chance to see this movie.</fullReview>

Where VH suffers from constant action sequences with no time to rest, DAT and Troy suffer from deadspace and all too frequent slow parts that cause the audience to fidget in their seats and wish for much faster pacing.7/10</fullReview>

You might enjoy this one.If you are a person who sits down and enjoys realistic special effects, loves to see things get ripped apart by storms, or think about what's going on...you might enjoy it...BUT, if you are a person who hates storms, or never wants to enjoy a natural disaster movie and ext. ext. ext.....you may never be able to survive this one.I sat down ready to enjoy Twisters in L.A......an hailstorm in China....and a MAJOR flooding in Manhattan (followed by a snowstorm) and I then had my mouth wide open at the end not letting my eyes leave the screen.So go and see "The Day After Tomorrow" trust me...YOU"LL ENJOY IT!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Out OF 4 StarsThe Day After Tomorrow**United States, 2004 5/28/2004 PG-13 35 mmI thought that people in Hollywood knew how to make money. This movie proved that I was obviously wrong. I also thought they were smart, but this movie proved that their average I.Q. test score was below 50. These people have not noticed that lines like 'I love you dad.' 'I love you too son.' don't work anymore, because we have heard them over and over again in tough situations in previous films. That of course is not the end of it. The guys who made the trailer did something unforgivable. They showed almost all the special effects (except the sequence at the end) in the previews. So what are we left with-cliché lines and acting so awful it makes me want to see Gigli again. The plot is simple and to the point. Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) plays a climatologist who is worried about global warming. Problem is that it seems he is the only one worried about it. In New Delhi his theory about Global Warming leading to the end of the world is ignored, by most, especially the Vice-President of good old USA (Kenneth Welsh), who looks a lot like Dick Cheney himself. Anyways things actually start happening (baseball-sized hail in Tokyo, snow in India, etc.) Even with that fact the Vice-President of good old USA still says that an evacuation is a stupid idea. By now you might be thinking to yourself as I was, what the president is doing. Well, just like in the real government he asks Dick, I mean Becker, for advice. You can guess what the advice is already. When things start to get really ugly and the stuff in the previews starts showing up on the screen evacuation begins to the south. Yet Jack Hall's son Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) is stuck in New York with Laura (Emmy Rossum) and some other survivors. You can probably already guess the end but who cares. It doesn't matter. This movie has no redeeming value in it aside of losing a part off your life that you will never be able to get back. Not Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Average disaster film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll give this to director Roland Emmerich: he sure knows how to lay waste to major cities. The Day after Tomorrow is his third round of cinematic mass destruction, following on the heels of an alien invasion in Independence Day and a giant attacking lizard in Godzilla. Of the three, The Day after Tomorrow is probably the most accomplished, but that doesn't necessarily make it a great film, as it moves through most of the standard disaster film clichés without batting an eye, but yet still proves mildly entertaining.Based on the pseudo-science book The Coming Global Superstorm written by radio commentator Art Bell and novelist Whitley Streiber, The Day after Tomorrow opens on an Antarctic ice shelf, where paleoclimatologist Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) and his team are collecting ice core samples when the shelf decides to separate, leaving Hall with an ominous sense of dread. At a Global Warming conference in New Dehli (where it is snowing), Hall informs those gathered, including the rather unsupportive Vice-President of the United States (Kenneth Welsh), that sometime in the future, the very fabric of our warm climate will collapse and send the planet back into an ice age. Hall is generally ignored by the conference goers, until giant tornadoes begin tearing Los Angeles apart, torrential rains lead to massive flooding in New York City, and in Scotland helicopters, and their occupants, freeze instantly. Hall determines that his predictions where not only correct, but they occurred well ahead of his believed time-table, and advises the President of the US to evacuate the lower states, while the upper states can only sit out the storm for fear that if they leave their homes, they too will freeze to death. Meanwhile, Jack's son Sam (Jake Gyllenhall) and several classmates are trapped in the flooding, and then freezing, New York City and Jack sets out to try and save him from what seems certain doom.The Day after Tomorrow follows the rather standard disaster film formula of introducing dire portents of an upcoming tragedy, including a well-meaning scientist who tries to warn others but is viewed as a kook, followed by the beginning of the disaster, along with the sudden realization that what was warned is really happening, and after the bulk of the disaster has passed, then comes the aftermath as people must attempt to save themselves. There isn't a whole lot here to enliven the process beyond the standard, and as such there is little in the film that really takes you by surprise. As with most big disaster films, what really pushes the picture along is it's spectacular scenes of disaster, and in this department The Day after Tomorrow excels, featuring some rather impressive imagery of tornadoes, tidal waves and giant storms. Probably the strongest material is centered on New York when the city is flooded, which doesn't fail to disappoint in the spectacle department. However, amazing visual effects doesn't really take the place of an interesting plot, and the Day after Tomorrow doesn't have much to offer once the disaster starts dying down.Acting is generally capable, but no one really stands out. Dennis Quaid is decent as the obsessive scientist who tries to warn people of the danger, and then must make a personal journey into the unknown to try and save his son. Jake Gyllenhall is also adequate as Sam, and most of the rest of the cast get the job done, but there are no overwhelming performances. The human cast simply serves the plot.If it sounds like I am very on-the-fence about the Day after Tomorrow, you would be correct. It is a mildly entertaining popcorn film, but nothing I would whole-heartedly recommend. If you are interested in impressive scenes of cities being toppled by out of control weather, check it out. If you are looking for a little more character depth and emotion to go with your disaster, rent Titanic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The end of the world is approaching in director Roland Emmerich's latest big budget disaster movie. In this film, scientist Dennis Quaid's predictions of global warming spurring a new ice age are ignored until it happens and half of the U.S. is destroyed.. Emmerich again displays his nack for big budget destruction, with some impressive visual effects sequences showing Los Angeles and New York City being destroyed.. Unfortunately for the film and the audience, the "human element" which the story relies on doesn't work quite as well with indie film actor Jake Gyllenhall seemingly at a loss while trying vainly to play Quaid's son... trapped in the New York Library with his fetching would be girlfriend (Emmy Rossum, who gets to look pretty but not much else). Sela Ward shows up as Quaids wife, and gets to take care of a sick cancer patient in the most pointless and exploitive subplot in the film. Basicaly for an action movie, there isn't much action.. No one really does anything about the impending disaster, they mostly react when it occurs.. I got a bit bored between scenes of destruction... even having the president and vice-president be such comical parodies of our current administration didn't quite work for me, much as I enjoy a good anti-Bush joke as much as the next guy.. Anyways, as a cautionary tale.. OK.. the fx are good... too bad the story doesn't really work. GRADE: C-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It felt really cold watching this...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was a mismatch of expectations and the actual film. From the posters and trailers, let alone the title, we get the impression that this will be something really huge. It turned out just, well, huge. The special effects are stunning and do make you reflect on the very real possibility if something like this should happen in the future. Some flaws were obvious despite the effects like why wasn't the statue of Liberty toppled down when great waves came crushing down on it? Unless you can believe, for this story, a string of unlikely things happened. But really, such factors do take away the reality made up by the effects and prevents a smooth enjoyment of the film.In spite of the very simple plot and the fact that this is a disaster movie, they still could have worked for more character development which was significantly lacking on this one. Furthermore, there was not much tension that is expected in doomsday movies. The special effects speak for themselves alone and ain't enough of course. Still, watching this movie effectively made me feel really cold like I was there. There was not a solid climax, if you do not count the wolf chase as one. Ironically, the wolf scene was an effective thriller, but that was out of focus really.Definitely inferior to Armageddon and Deep Impact, but still recommended for the special effects treat and for forcing self-reflection on the power of nature and our place in the great scheme of things.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ah, back to those thrilling days of...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...the 1970s, when we saw such big-budget blockbuster disaster movies as "Earthquake" (in SENSURROUND!) and Irwin Allen's "The Poseidon Adventure" and "The Towering Inferno". I have to admit, I loved these movies as a kid, though "Poseidon" is likely the only one that even remotely holds up.Even so, when I saw the ads for "The Day After Tomorrow", I felt a long-forgotten chill of excitement run through me. The disaster movie is BACK, baby!This is not really a very good movie, but I liked it anyway, and give it a marginal recommendation. The script is cliched (right down to the "we have to do something before it's too late!" dialogue), parts of the story downright asinine (you just KNEW those wolves were going to show up at an inconvenient time), but the effects were incredible, and some of the story lines turned out to be fairly interesting. That I've always liked Dennis Quaid, and I'm happy to see him find work, only adds to my enjoyment.Normally, I'd say wait for video. However, some of the disaster sequences are utterly spectacular and truly demand big-screen viewing. In particular, the scene where the tidal wave first washes around the Statue of Liberty and into Manhattan is breathtaking.By the way, as silly as much of this is, there are a few grains of intelligence behind this story. I doubt the science is meant to be taken seriously at all, but the film does leave us with the message that if we continue to abuse the environment, it may turn on us in drastic and unexpected ways. And I liked the irony that Americans are forced to flee south to Mexico, suggesting that perhaps it's worth improving relations with the developing world because we never know when we'll need them...Call it 7/10, for spectacular special effects and some nostalgia.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe it was the beer we snuck into the movie theater, but honestly, I went in expecting a rotten film and found one instead that I really enjoyed. Anyone who expects a movie to be scientifically accurate is a moron. Science makes movies boring. Hence, you fake science in a movie to make science interesting. Aliens aren't creating a satellite relay formation around the planet, olive oil doesn't cure ALD, and the next ice age isn't going to happen tomorrow. Big surprise. Get over it.If you suspend your disbelief (and I shudder for people who don't), The Day After Tomorrow is a perfectly entertaining disaster movie. The special effects were cool looking without appearing in every single scene, and the acting was generally understated (with the exception of the hilariously Dick Cheney-like VP). I don't want to spoil the funny parts, but the political humor is well worth the time. (The President looked so much like Al Gore that between his character and the aforementioned VP, I couldn't quite tell which party was getting more lambasted.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Technicalities be damned - this movie had heart.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Day After Tomorrow is certainly the perfect example of fiction gone awry. It takes an implausible theory and puts it into practice, turning our relatively peaceful world, into an icy mass, nearly overnight. No catastrophic event, no comet crashing to the ground. It just happens. And it happens in a big way. A half dozen or more tornadoes in Los Angeles. Three super storms. Softball sized hail. Tidal waves and flooding of massive proportions. And the lifeless cold temperatures and transformation of everything into ice and death. And still meteorologists probably kept their jobs!So here's where the story goes wrong: even in the greatest of fiction there has to be some believability in the audience's mind. The entire climatology plot, the catalyst to everything else in the movie, was not very believable. Further, the hospital and mother side story wasn't needed. But despite all of this, I still enjoyed this movie.Why? Heart. You can't help but like a movie that has heart. The relationship between dad and son (played excellently by Quaid and Gyllenhaal respectively). The struggle to stay alive and to help one another. The Lewis and Clark spirit of adventure and endurance. These are the qualities that make the movie worth the watch. So much so that I almost forgot about the weather in the movie, and was able to focus rather on its inner story. All of the actors did a fine job rising to the occasion in this movie, and they, certainly above special effects or dramatic content, made the movie enjoyable.I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone looking for that feel-good quality in a flick. If you're one to get too hung up on technicalities, then this movie isn't likely for you. But if you're one who looks for the meat and heart in a movie, then I'm betting, despite the many disbeliefs, you'll find some of what you are looking for here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Boy, was I disappointed.When I saw the previews of men snowshoeing through a frozen wasteland, I thought it was going to be taking place after the second ice age. Instead, it was just another disaster movie taking place in the wake of it.The movie neglected all the interesting aspects of the coming ice age, instead focusing on a hokey, cliché father-trying-to-find-his-son plot.Then there's the fact that any time a natural disaster or potentially fatal weather approached, it could be easily outrun.So, if the movie were to be realistic, just keep in shape and you should be able to outrun any flash flood, blizzard, or volcanic eruption.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reading the IMDB Message Board with the comments and reactions of viewers is much more interesting than the film itself. I usually know what to expect when I go to a disaster movie, so I bought my popcorn and entered the theater to see the big effects, not some cinema masterpiece. I must say that I was still very disappointed. After reading all the press articles, and seeing the TV clips, there was no surprise for me in the subject. If you saw the trailers then you saw all the good effects - the rest is quite un-impressive relative to the money that must have been invested. When it is not un-impressive it is really bad - in a couple of instances, you saw actors running off and escaping a huge tidal wave, and the glacial age (yes!) - this was so un-believable. Acting is average minus, although Emmy Rossum and Jake Gyllenhaal have the potential to become big stars. The scientific premises - not of the movie - but of some of the effects like the extreme cooling are so unbelievable and defying the logic, that they look extreme even in Hollywood terms. There is some more truth in details of the script, in the human father-to-son relationship, or in some surprisingly funny ideas like having US refugees flying the Mexican border southbound in some kind of reverse historic irony, but then all falls back and is swollen in flat and bad dialog. The only good thing that will come out of this movie is the theme park ride which may already be in building some place. The grim warning about our future if we ignore ecology deserves a better movie. This one gets 4 out of 10 on my personal scale.</fullReview>

The CGI effects were dead on and the underlying stories were good fillers in between monster storms, tital waves, flying cars and crashing choppers. The best part about the whole thing was that there was no magic solution, this thing was uncontrollable and what takes place would seem to be about right in those circumstances.

		<shortDescription>better than independence day but shocking dialoge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>a mixture of independence day and deep impact. terrible dialoge but the guy from donnie darko was very good. maybe a little bit dated would have done better in the mid 90's. cgi wolves were unrealistic. English representations were unsurprisingly very annoying and unrealistic. quite exciting at points, but really if you like films with story lines about lots of different people then magnolia is for you. i got to admit i loved the part where the reporter got hit by that debris. he was starting to annoy me. the worst part was on the shopping centre roof. that awful line 'i just dropped in to do some shopping'. it's worse than bond. worth a look if you liked independence day but i recommend magnolia over this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most disaster films are lame, but have great action sequences of disaster, especially Independence day, which is probably my favorite. this would be an enjoyable disaster film, but it is not so. the reasons way are so many. one reason is because there was not enough destruction shown like in Independence day, the film was too predictable of what was going to happen, unlike Independence day, for me. The film was also too realistic with politicians, which we do not want to here about anymore with the upcoming 2004 election. Especially of having an actor as the vice-president who looked like Dick Chenny, showing a bad influence on the republicans, and plus of having the death of the president. i was interested though of how the next ice age was to form, but after the first hour of the flooding of new York, and the wind storms of L.A. I was bored. it was purty much after that a survival story. I think that Dennis Quaid should have died. I'm kind of tired of him. After the Alamo was released, i was less interested in seeing him act. plus, the film itself was lame, not making much sense. Great effects though! 4 out of 10 from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impressive special effects.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a waste of 2 and a bit hours and $11. The special effects were very impressive but the rest of the movie left a lot to be desired. The acting was appalling by the lead characters (no wonder Meg Ryan preferred Russell Crowe). The story line (not the ice age part) but the situation between Dennis Qaid, his wife and son so lame it was laughable. I must admit myself and others in the cinema (and there weren't that many for a movie that had only been out a week)had a good laugh mostly in parts that weren't meant to be funny. It was so predictable from beginning to end. I wonder how the rest of the world fared - I guess we will never know. At least the southern hemisphere seemed unaffected so I guess we will be safe here down under for a while yet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you go to see a big Hollywood blockbuster nowadays, you can at least rely on the special effects being good. In the case of The Day After Tomorrow they're a lot better than that, and some of the action on the big screen is truly jawdropping.As you can also expect with Hollywood blockbusters, the money's been invested in the effects and the script suffers it accordingly. A cast of nobodies [other than Quaid] seemed to do well enough with it, but the dialogue was a bit corny and was lacking craft.That's what you've come to expect though, and if you go to see a big name film that's been much hyped expecting anything else, you *are* as stupid as they think you are!I enjoyed it as some harmless fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good disaster flick, mediocre film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Incredibly clichéd and cheezy, but still a helluva lot of fun and immensely entertaining. Fits right into the mould of disaster/survival flicks, and does it ever excel at it. Major landmarks destroyed? Check. One family stuck in the middle of it all? Check. Budding romance facilitated by the disaster? Check. Sweeping implausibilities and gaping plot holes? Check. It's the type of movie where you can look right past its flaws, rather than be irritated by them, and just enjoy the ride. Still, it is a film, and thus must be judged as one.The basic premise is intriguing, but the screenplay falters. Instead of focusing on one band of survivors, the story jumps all over the place - presumably to show off the wide array of disasters occurring. The dialogue is quite bad at times, but at others is surprisingly innovative. The writing, overall, is not as bad as it could have been. There are quite a few flaws of logic - conveniently ignored to further the plot - and wild leaps of imagination, but it fits within the realm of the movie. The acting is decent - for a disaster flick - with no performances standing out as good or bad. The message of the movie is appropriately low-key until the President's speech at the end - hammering home the point rather bluntly. A bit more subtlety would have been appreciated. Still, it's a welcome change for this type of film.The movie's real strength is the visuals. The effects are amazing - save for some rather goofy wolves - as the full magnitude of Earth's power is unleashed. The tornado scene is the highlight of the film, as it is both original and superbly done. The tidal wave scene had a been there, done that feel to it - though it was also pulled off very well. In the last half, the snow scenes are done well and can be quite breathtaking at times. All in all, Oscar-worthy special effects.So, overall, this was a well done disaster flick but a mediocre film. As per usual for the genre, character development is uneven, plot holes are plentiful, and dialogue is silly. None of the flaws really stand out and disrupt the flow of the movie, though, which is carried by the thrills and effects. And, for this type of film, that works very well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice robust film (if you can forgive some of the facts)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After being let down by another CGI film this year (troy.. spent $175m on effects and $175 on script) I was happily surprise to see this film. OK the premise that the Atlantic conveyer stops. (its already slowed by 50% in the last 40 odd year) is a real one, and some of the changes that happen in the film are a little quick and over the top, that aside it develops the charters well. You start to feel for them by half way in to the film. The Script has some intelligent lines and you fell it could be real situations.Denis Quid plays a good lead role and a lot of scenes remind me of some of Harrison Fords better roles? (May be a role for Airforce One part 2).The CGI is good and due to all the snow, makes it quiet believable, (with the exception of the effects of freezing helicopters and skyscrapers) the CGI is close to real life.Though the facts are well over starched, you watch feeling that it is possible and get in to the film. I would recommend to go with an open mind, sit down and just enjoy a well put together film and forget any over the top storms. Finally, I hope it does make some people think about what we are doing to our planet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's better than "Independence Day", better than "Deep Impact", than "Armageddon", better than all the disaster movies. Great effects, great story, great everything! Whether you are or not into science-fiction movies, you should watch it, you'll get the movie's message. About the film, I liked the disaster scene in New York, but it should go on for a few more minutes, just to keep us all in suspense..., also, It would be a greater movie if there were a lot more disaster scenes around the world, what about Paris's Eiffel Tower freezing?, London under the water?, Toronto experimenting the Ice Age?, the movie should not be limited to the U.S. civilization, it would be scarier if there were worldwide disaster. Everything in this movie is great. YOU SHOULD WATCH IT WHILE IS ON THEATERS!, when you're in the theater you feel the rush and the desperation like if you were living the disasters. It's awesome!!! From 1 to 10, 10 is not enough for this movie, maybe a 20!</fullReview>

Our course "Dick Cheney" was in there as vice president Becker with some controversial scripting. As a scientist I hope that this movie at least raises awareness of some of environmental issues that the movie touches upon. I am not sure which way the public will perceive this movie. Is this an environmental friendly movie or not? Well it was worth the money and made a good topic of conversation afterwards. That's why I gave it an 8 of 10. What more do I need to say.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a gleefully terrible film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Global warming is bad. Now, having dispensed with my socially-dictated conscience as a film critic, I can move on to the review of "The Day After Tomorrow."Wow, this is such a gleefully terrible film. It's "the formula" applied to the end of the world, the arrival of Ice Age in the Northern Hemisphere (the Southern Hemisphere is spared). It's a disaster film, pure and simple, intertwining cheesy and cliched human stories with improbable destruction that separates the heroes from the cowards, that brings together fathers and sons, and so on and so forth.It also has Americans illegally crossing the border into Mexico to escape the catastrophic natural destruction. It has L.A. destroyed in a cheerful series of tornadoes that rip apart the "Hollywood" sign and the "Capitol Records" building. Millions of people die. It has the American president forgive Latin American debt so that the Mexican government allows American refugees to stay there. It features (this only gets better) the American President apologize to the world, on the WEATHER CHANNEL, for mistakes in his judgment. Loving it yet? Well, there's more. In one, particularly striking scene a survivor of the destruction of New York chats with a girl about why he doesn't want to contribute an old edition of the Guttenberg Bible to the fire that keeps the survivors warm. It's an article, an artifact, a testament to the achievements of the Western Civilization. He has to bring it back. Europe is destroyed, the Northern States and Canada are destroyed. The man talks about the twilight of the Western Civilization, but the Southern United States is just fine. Who knows what kind of (if any) civilization lurks below the Mason-Dixon Line?So yes, the film has spectacular moments. Does it bring awareness to the cause of so many serious environmentalists and the very real problem of global warming? I don't think so, though I do not doubt that many people who see this movie will encounter the problem for the first time in precisely this disaster-film form. Though, for people aware of the dangers of global warming, this is more like a mockery, but a light-hearted one. It's absolutely nonsensical, features scenes of great destruction, though not enough plot - in other words, it's yet another blockbuster picture. It's got a cast of great actors, whose performances aren't particularly great because there's no room for performances in this film. But there is room from running away at top-speed from vicious and viciously hungry CGI-generated wolves as the temperature drops 10F per second. And the characters do that remarkably well - so you can't help but like them.So the destruction of the Western Civilization (namely Europe, Canada, and the Northern United States) gets a ridiculous portrayal in a disaster film not above other disaster films (with the exception of "Armageddon" - Ben Affleck was a huge detriment to that film), nor below them. Right on par. With many hilarious, politically correct scenes that mock their own political correctness. "The Day After Tomorrow" is a film you see with no expectations - otherwise you're wasting your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Natures answer to Mankind's excesses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>****SPOILERS**** Even though the reviews of the movie "The Day after Tomorrow" are anything but earth-shaking the film is far better then the similar movies of world-wide destruction."The Day after Tomorrow" does not follow the usual End-of-the-World scenarios like Nuclear wars Meteor Showers and Alien Invasions. Its story is about the very real danger of the earth itself striking back at Mankind that has been abusing it. Striking back with such a destructive fury that it would put the most arrogant cocky and hubristic of us back in our place as scared terrified and humble human beings in us being petrified with fear of the powerful forces of Nature that we have no control of. A new Ice Age is dawning on the Earth starting with the melting of the great ice cover over the continent of Antarctica. After some two hundred years since the beginning of the industrial revolution the earth has finally had enough of being abused by mankind's greed and ignorance of it's environment. These abuses trigger a series of major earth changes that are of monstrous proportions. They hit the Human Race with such force that it dwarfs anything that man has ever imagined of written about in all the thousands of End-of-the-World books and narratives dating back to Biblical times.Antarctica is breaking up and some of the pieces of ice flowing up the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans are the size of the state of Rhode Island. These ice flows block the warm ocean currents like the Atlantic Gulf Stream which causes the ocean water temperatures to drop as much as 13 degrees in just a matter of days. As this is happening the air in the upper North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans is becoming lighter and with the melting of the ice absorbs the water vapor. This ends up forming rain clouds that pelt places on the earth ,like Southern Japan and India, with ice and snow storms. Gigantic snow hurricanes and typhoons begin forming in Northern Siberia England Greenland and Canada due to the low pressure and humidity from the melting ice. The middle areas of the earth, some 1,000 miles above the earths Equator, like California in cities like Los Angeles and their surrounding areas are hit by enormous cyclones because of the dramatic drop of barometric pressure. These cyclones link up and unite as they pick up strength becoming unimaginable forces of death and destruction. Picking up strength as they start to roll across the earth wiping cities and towns with hundreds of thousands of people off the map. In cities in the US North-East the meting ice forms hundreds of giant rain clouds that burst open into Biblical-like downpours that last for days on end. The rains together with the raising ocean water levels sweep into the lowlands and northern coastal cities like Boston and New York drowning tens of thousands of people. The bitter arctic winds that follow these northern monsoons freeze the flooded land covering it with a sheet of ice with a thickness of as much as three to five miles deep! What follows is super cold air from the northern areas that kill and quick-freeze anything that it comes in contact with. The special effects in the movie are State-of-the-Art realism and in many ways as real as what we read in the newspapers and see on the TV news. The lead character in the movie Dr.Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid), a leading expert of earth's meteorological changes, timely warnings to those leaders of the nations of earth to stop ill-treating the worlds environment in order to prevent ecological calamities like the one that just happened were ignored. Dr. Hall promised his son Sam, Jack Gyllehall, early in the film never to leave him alone. Later separated from him by 250 miles of frozen tundra and never-ending blizzards, he travels mostly on foot to New York City to rescue not only Sam but his friends and a number of stranded New Yorkers on the upper floor of the frozen and snow covered New York City Main Public Library. In the movie we see what we can do by not living in harmony with the forces of Nature that not only rule the earth but the entire Universe. There's a massive migration from the uninhabitable Northern Hemisphere to the south by millions of survivors of this major ecological disaster. Rebuilding their civilization as well as their lives the peoples of the Earth learn the values of living in peace not only with themselves but living in peace with their planet as well. The President of the United States Pres. Blake, Perry King, perished in a snow storm trying to leave,with his cabinet, the ice-locked city of Washington D.C. At the end of the movie the former Vice President and now President Becker speaks to the people of the United States and the world on TV and radio. Pres. Becker gratefully thanks the people of the southern, and mostly third world, nations for allowing the people of the frozen and snow covered north in their countries. Telling the worlds peoples that with the help of God the people of Earth will in the future have the foresight wisdom and courage to not let cataclysms ever happen again. Pres. Becker ends his speech saying that it was wrong for him not to do what he could have done in preventing the horrors that just happened. For that he's very very sorry and you can see that what he said came straight from his heart. But by then the damage was already done and nothing even Pres. Becker's heart felt apology can change that.</fullReview>

Yes, almost all of the special effects are good, but we saw almost all of them in the 10-minute preview that was shown on FOX. Anyway...the New York flood special effects are very well done.The story and dialog are all at 5th grade level and there are several characters/plot lines that are totally not needed and bring nothingto the experience. I went to this movie not expecting much. I figured I'd just enjoy some popcorn and watch things be destroyed. Even with that mindset, I left the movie feeling...nothing. And for a summer blockbuster, there couldn't have been more than 50 people in the theatre (Chicago). I have an awesome 60-inch big screen at home and I added DAT to my Netflix list in advance of seeing the movie, thinking that I would have to see the special effects again with a remote control in my hand.

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, but not as grand as it could have been...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**POSSIBLE SPOILERS** The Day After Tomorrow is an undeniably entertaining movie, with great special effects and a half-way decent story. However, this film should have been about the plight of all of mankind rather than the shared adventures of Jake Gyllenhall and his school friends; it could have been an epic science fiction story rather than a popcorn flick. Using global warming as the foundation for a movie about Dennis Quaid falling into a crevasse, a helicopter crash, a wolf attack, and a few storm sequences seems to trivialize the actual consequences of a large scale climate change. Global warming is an epic phenomenon and it should have been treated as such. For example, in the end, when the people are leaving New York, I would have liked to see the pack of wolves trot across a street (without snarling viciously or attacking anyone), thus signaling the return of wildlife to soon-to-be-deserted cities. With that said, I was still very entertained and enjoyed the movie's not-so-subtle criticism of George Bush and his cronies. The Day After Tomorrow is no classic, but it will certainly rule the box office for a few weeks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know, it was so hard to resist those tempting trailers and posters. I just had to see this movie. It's safe to say that I (and most people) knew what to expect when walking into the theater for this one. Roland Emmerich, the man who brought us "Independence Day" and "Godzilla" -- two movies I thoroughly enjoyed (yes, you heard right, I liked "Godzilla") -- returns to direct his first popcorn-flick in six years: "The Day After Tomorrow." Accelerated global warming causes unusual weather patterns, oceans overflow onto land, and before you know it, New York City is sealed in ice (I'm sure other cities are as well, but this movie mainly focuses on NYC) and a few survivors, including the son of the scientist who saw all of this coming, are stored in a library that just barely reaches above the surface of the ice. As pointed out to us in the mid-section of the film, the entire Nothern Hemisphere is basically trapped in an ice age. Hardly any survivors are expected, and anyone who lives in southern USA is urged to flee to Mexico -- illegally (I'll admit, it was kind of funny to watch people rushing the Mexican border, instead of vice versa). In the meantime, the father is rushing to reunite with his son in hopes of leading him to safety (you know how this ends...). There are many predictable plot-points and twists headed our way, and sure, not all of the information pans out too well, but this is strictly a fun popcorn flick. A two-hour escape. In the tradition of other like-minded movies such as "Armageddon" and "Twister," you can't overanalyze the material, or you won't enjoy it. Just like Emmerich's previous films, it is engrossing, an assault on the senses and creates a sense of awe with it's mindblowing special effects. Aside from the clumsy "frozen helicopter" bit, the effects are top-notch and completely breath-taking. The acting is good for the most part. The leads are sympathetic, even if there isn't much exposition behind them. And let us not forget our all too familiar President and Vice President characters. I know I got a chuckle out of that. Poor George W. He never saw the blizzard coming. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Day After Independence Day (Some Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Had Independence Day actually been a groundbreaking film, I wouldn't be so disappointed with this, seeing as it's basically the same film, made by basically the same people. It tries (too) hard to be exciting, but is just plain predictable in many places. The acting is okay (about average), but most of the dialogue falls flat. There is no real reason to like or dislike any of the main characters, as there is very little character development. Many of the scenes that were meant to awe us are just dorky and clumsy (e.g., when a ship grinds to a halt in the flooded streets just outside the New York Public Library). And the thing with the wolves was just stupid.5.5/10 - Average.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Independence Day Part II (*Vague spoilers*)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So - we saved the world from aliens only to wreck it ourselves (joke). My Independence day reference is actually about the sub-plot architecture, the main plot is basic and would be boring if not for the sub plots involving a central family - exactly what Emmerich did with will smith. Graphics are hard and fast with impressive 'world' graphics like glaciers &amp; an oil tanker in Manhattan. Some CGI lacks - it seems to be a current Hollywood ploy to draw 4 legged animals badly and then zoom in on them. The central and some of the outer characters have a depth and clear change that gives emotion to the film and absorbs the viewer as the plot absorbs its characters. The casting is quite similar to Independence day too - Donny Darko star Jake Gyllenhaal co-starring when he still feels un-proven as an actor to me (like elijah wood in deep impact (pre lotr) &amp; will smith in ID4 - first serious acting role since prince of bellair) and a nice cameo from Bilbo Baggins. Its incredibly interesting how emmerich portrays the characters obvious perception of the situation but lack of discussion - like talking about it will take away a surrealism.</fullReview>

However, I have to warn all those who have any knowledge whatsoever of weather, physics, and Eartn science in general, this movie has some scientific theory that could easily rival that of Star Trek. It would be ignorable, if only they didn't keep harping on it. By the end of the movie, I felt that my scientific brain had taken a beating for the ages. As for the plot, though it is existent, it is far from original in basis. Sure, it has unique elements, but it's the same old story of friends go through hardship, hardship brings them closer together, they admit their feelings for each other and share a long kiss, they go through more hardship, they get through it and live happily ever after. I really didn't come away with anything new, aside from a head ache, though the others in my party rather enjoyed it.One last thing I just remembered, the political satire of George and Dick actually does make this movie worth while.

		<shortDescription>Typical Hollywood Blockbuster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Day After Tomorrow.A typical Hollywood blockbuster, this film is extremely predictable (except the weather of course) for Hollywood, all of a sudden there is this great new massively marketed film being released and what happens. New York City is where it all takes place. A storm that effects the whole world is mainly in New York what a surprise. The film itself, well the story is boring and predictable, if the weather is so cold how can the fire possibly stay lit? also if they were in a library with lots of books to burn how about the people in the other buildings that survived, what did they burn? The days just seem to drift by, if they were there for so long how did they stay looking so healthy and mentally strong.There was barely any attention to the emotions of the characters and then at the end the President says thank you to the third world countries for letting them in, what rubbish, that things seemed to be back to normal so quickly with televisions still working etc.The special effects were sensational though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this film was very enjoyable. Primarily a piece of entertainment, it never-the-less laid emphasis on an important topic that is accessible in a format that will register with those for whom a dry scientific text is off-putting.The scientific basis of a number of aspects is sound as, unfortunately, are the portrayed attitudes of politicians. The film has great special effects and good acting. My family and I found it highly entertaining, quite tense in places and very realistic, very thought provoking. We liked the way our American cousins presented we Brits in a positive light which is unusual in the average blockbuster.In terms of effect and scope this film easily matches 'Independence Day' and presents a serious environmental message. Very much worthwhile seeing.</fullReview>

There are many advertisements of The Day After Tomorrow that show the Eiffel Tower under snow, the Sydney opera being washed by the ocean and Big Ben buried under the snow. I really expected to see how that happened. But what can you expect from Americans they do movies only about America and that's all.You can see L.A. get destroyed by tornadoes , New Your City citizens get washed away by the flooded Atlantic Ocean but no, they won't show Europe because it's not important. Who cares about anything else than America. I'm just really disappointed ! I hope that someone can explain all that.P.S. I'm sorry for any kind of mistakes that I might have made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's the end of the world as we know it...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>[Warning : some possible spoilers ahead]There's something inherently cheesy about a disaster flick. Whether it's the illustrious "Towering Inferno" or the rather ignominious "The Core" the mere fact that the entire film is necessarily full of gloom and doom (excepting, perhaps, the ending - depending upon one's point of view) invariably means that the macho posturing and cliché heavy lines come out of the woodwork.In that respect TDAT is no exception, but then we've come to expect these things from a good old fashioned disaster movie. Really, that's what TDAT is - old fashioned. Though clearly rather more up to date in the effects department, TDAT simply drips with cliché after cliché.The movie begins with Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid channeling Harrison Ford) giving dire warnings to an assembled group of politicians. It seems the world is headed for an ice age in the next hundred years or so, which leads a stereotypical American Vice President to proclaim the economy is far more important.This is about as subtle as the movie gets, but with a disaster flick where the entire northern hemisphere freezes over, subtlety is neither needed nor in fact wanted.It turns out that Jack's predictions are distinctly incorrect, and the world has a matter of days before the weather becomes something not even the British would want to talk about. This is where the movie presents its best - the waves and tornadoes are the epitome of current computer generated effects and, for the most part, look fantastic on screen. The exception is a bizarre (and entirely unnecessary) scene with some CGI wolves. This scene is clearly intended to build some tension in the downhill slope of the second half of the movie, but fails for a number of reasons, not least of which is the completely artificial way the wolves move and act.Once the major destructive set pieces are over, the movie descends into a slower pace with Jack trekking miles from Washington to find his son Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal in a laid back performance) who is holed up in a library in New York along with some of his school mates, including the alluring Laura (Emmy Rossum). There is a "romantic subplot" of the barest depth between the two, but it has no emotional resonance and is there simply because the genre demands it.In fact, that sums up much of TDAT once the calamity has truly struck. Everything else that follows is there simply because it must be, according to the Disaster Screenwriting Rulebook.The acting is mostly by the numbers, though Quaid seems to be putting as much macho into his performance as he possibly can. He manages to seem unsettlingly Harrison Ford like during his pontifications to the politicians, but makes a decent enough scientist-cum-father-figure.Gyllenhaal puts in a lackluster and somewhat tired-looking effort, rendering Sam less than worthy of our sympathy, and hardly worthy of getting the girl (Rossum) - which of course he does in the end.Sela Ward, and the token cancer patient she ministers, exist solely to allow a single scene of heroism from emergency services personnel, and as such she is completely wasted. As is Rossum who is really only there to look cute. This is, after all, a movie about the boys, not the girls.The science is of course ludicrous and almost entirely fictional. At one point the main characters are forced to outrun a snap-frost that will kill them instantly. Not only do they somehow manage this feat (how exactly does one outrun something like that?), but they each do it while pulling an injured comrade to safety at the same time. This frost, over a hundred degrees below zero, is then apparently fended off by a fire so small you couldn't toast marshmallows on it.But really you should expect ridiculous scenes like that. Again, they all come from the Disaster Screenwriting Rulebook.More unsettling is the distinct lack of emotional response by any of the main characters to what is, after all, the end of the world. None of them cries or screams or otherwise wonders about the fact that (presumably) billions of people are dying off-screen. One short line from Laura about the life that no longer exists falls flat because we sense no real loss in her. Neither she nor Sam's other student friends seem all that worried that their parents and other friends are also (presumably) little more than frozen corpses in the snow.In short, The Day After Tomorrow has the effects, it has the disaster, and the grand set pieces. But it is missing heart, despite the cliché of the repentant father seeking to make up with his son for all those times in the past that he wasn't there. For a movie about the collapse of civilization it's also missing tension. It guarantees spectacle and little else, but it does that spectacle well enough that we can, perhaps, forgive most of the less egregious of its faults.In the immortal words of REM, "it's the end of the world as we know it, and I feel fine".6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The special effects were just wonderful. I realize that this is just a movie, but it is a very thought-provoking one. Global warming is a threat to all life on Earth, not just human. The scientists really don't know what will happen, how fast or how hard. Not many have really studied the effects that the ocean will have on the climate, or how much of an effect the ocean currents may CAUSE. While I realize that the northeast was featured, the ripple effect of the current would have been felt all over the country as well as the hemisphere. It was nice to see Mother Nature get in a punch in instead of always being beaten down. Wonderful job, wonderful effects, wonderful movie.

		<fullReview>This movie offers some sheer excitement but seems to suffer from a cheesy plot and the usual disaster movie clichés, such as all of the main cast surviving and having an asshole of a leader who questions the professionals authorities. This movie does offer some fine acting by it's leading cast (especially Quaid). It also has some of the most realistic special effects I have ever seen. Dennis Quaid gives a better performance than he did in "The Alamo". Some of the things that happened in this movie were pretty unrealistic (aside from the tornadoes, hail, etc.). The plot seems to be too simple and everything's happens so quickly. Unlike "Independence Day", this movie bounces around from Tokyo to LA, until it finally rests on the peril in New York. The thing I like about Roland is his attention to detail and his strong use of government agencies. In this case, it's the NOAA. All in all, this makes to be a pretty interesting film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>TDAT- I gotta give it a cold shoulder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review contains some spoilers.Well I gave The Day After Tomorrow 4 stars: one for Jake Gyllenhaal (why, oh why couldn't they have prolonged the scene where he was stripping out of those cold, wet clothes???) and three for the special effects. Watching LA get ripped up was... well, just cool. And it was nice to see the streets of NYC get a good wash. As for the plot, though... Yeesh. Clichés up the yin-yang. The general format of the movie, the dad/son schtick, the ignored scientist with one obscure supporter pitted against the disbelieving plebians, the teenage geniuses (whole teams of them, no less- how many of those are there in the US anyway? I thought the education system down there was in shambles!), the token homeless guy (with a dog), the self-sacrificing sidekick, the heroics performed by someone unaware of the looming death and getting plucked from its clutches by the love interest, etc, etc, ad nauseum.But some of it got laid on extra thick. The vice-president was eerily reminiscent of the political leadership that's actually in place in the States right now-- a Republican idiot more concerned with looking out for the interests of his big business campaign supporters than the environment (or the lives of the electorate to whom he's *supposed* to be accountable, for that matter). Personally I found his transformation at the end dubious at best. I *loved* the American swarm of immigrants into Mexico and the closing of the border, it was just delicious. Imagine what it'll do for the wages in Mexico! For years they've been slaving away like chumps producing goods for the US that they couldn't afford themselves. Then there was the guy in the library clutching at his old Bible, insisting that if they were facing "the end of Western civilization" and he could only save one piece of it, his reverence for the written word compelled him to save... the Bible. Buddy... check any hotel nightstand on your way out of town; there are way smaller copies that would be easier to carry and not as delicate. Besides, considering all the villainy that people over the centuries have carried out, claiming religious doctrine as their endorsement, I think in a whole library you could find a better piece of literature. Maybe the Boyscouts Handbook? Anyway, was there anything in that Bible about an ice age, among all the "accurate predictions?" If not, you gotta stop clinging to it. No deity saved your butt. Fire did. Boyscout Handbook tells you how to make fire. Drop the Bible, take the Boyscout Handbook. On a lighter note, while it was nice that Canada was at least mentioned in this movie (thanks for nothing, Independance Day), they didn't indicate whether there could have been survivors. I say it's a moot point. OF COURSE there were Canadian survivors! While New Yorkers were waking up the the worst weather in 10,000 years, Canadians looked out their windows, and our first thought: "great, eh, more snow. Good thing I didn't put my shovel in the shed yet." Our second thought? "Looks like the hockey season's gonna run long, eh?" We probably just dug out, drank some beer, and noticed there was a really big new rink south of the border waiting to be skated on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warning: May contain spoilers...and I'm not a good review writer.."The Day After Tomorrow" is the type of movie that you can only enjoy to the fullest at the movie theater. The big screen, the sound effects, the surrounding darkness, it all enhances the feel of the movie. Makes the movie better or worse. In my case, it made it so much better. I was sitting in one of the worst seats you can imagine, but I enjoyed this film. I wasn't expecting to like it as much as I did. (Maybe my wack seat made the movie so great? I was ALL the way in the front and a bit to the right.)Here's the deal: Some guy (Dennis Quaid) 'predicts' that in about 40 or so years, effects of global warming will make the world's climate go nuts. What happens? His prediction comes true, like the next day. So then, it's a matter of survival for the people in the movie, like his son (Jake Gyllenhaal)and friends who are in New York city.. Yeah, the plot's a bit on the clichéd and ridiculous side, but the way it's carried out...I can't even describe it. It was pure excitement. And for some reason left me paranoid when I left the theater and it was drizzling a bit outside.For real, yo, the effects were CRAZY!

		<shortDescription>so many strings left hanging</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This summer blockbuster was full of extravagant effects as expected however the total absence of proper storytelling and lack of realism severely hurt the movie. So many characters were introduced, yet the audience is left wondering about the majority of them. Aside from Dennis Quaid and his son, the other characters and their bland personalities appeared pasted into the film so as to fulfill a multi-racial cast. As a matter of fact, I found more meaning behind the lovable homeless guy than to the other main characters! What was the point of the child with cancer, the president, and the wolves for crying out loud? Not to mention that man in the weather station located in England with a child...wait, he had a child? Seems like they threw in the fact that he was a father in the editing room. *spoiler* As for the lack of practicality, who decides to walk to New York from Philly in the worst storm ever for over 10000 years?? The answer is Dennis Quaid. Who thinks they can survive in the mother of all storms? Dennis Quaid + a -200 degree Celcius proof tent. What really bothered me was the fact that it was incredibly cold outside but Quaid and his companion had exposed skin but were somehow unaffected by the cold. Perhaps they have never been up north before. As for the story, what happens to all the characters that we meet? The three guys have some scotch we just assume they die? How about that Japanese guy who graced the screen for 5 minutes before being pegged by ice cubes? How about the Asian woman that had a fling with Jason? How about the parents of the other kids? how about the suave boarding school student's little brother? i don't even remembered if they saved him! those selfish selfish punks. I guess they rather be sharing body heat.That being said, I did enjoy some of the numerous jokes inserted into the movie. *spoiler* my personal favourite was when Quaid stole a page right out of John Cena's book from the WWE as he masterfully delivered a standing fireman's through a chimney chute. Now that's HARDCORE. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The summer blockbuster isn't what it used to be!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I used to look forward to the summer blockbuster season. The movies that come out at this time are usually big, loud, and fun. Now they are just big and loud. I always go into a Roland Emmerich flick not expecting too much, he puts together a big spectacular show, but as far as a memorable story, he falls short. This film is being sold as a movie with an environmental message, global warming is basically going to plunge the world into a new ice age. I have nothing against a movie trying to inform, but it is when a movie insults my intelligence is when I tune out. Dennis Quaid stars as a scientist that warns that the earth is dangerously close to a global climate change, he does this at a summit where he chides the VP of the United States(who looks very much like Dick Cheney!), of course this guy does not want to hear about this, he's an evil Republican!!!LOL. As far as the FX, though I agree that they a competently done, are not as groundbreaking as one might think. At one point, Los Angeles is virtually destroyed by a bunch of tornadoes. The effects here are on a larger scale, do not look as convincing as the tornadoes in the movie Twister. The other aspect of the movie are as average and predictable as you could get, Dennis Quaid traverses the northeast to get to his son that is in New York where the city is frozen. His son is played by a very bland Jake Gyllenhaal. I've always regarded him as a low-rent Tobey MacGuire. Though the movie is never boring, it moves slowly, it's not as compelling as it should be. I'm not going to complain about all the scientific BS that is inaccurate because it would be a mute point. The incredible thing is that with a movie that has the "message " that it this one claims to have, its funny that you would have a scene of some astronauts in a space station looking down at the earth after the destruction and saying how clear the air looks, not a mention of the MILLIONS of people that perished,or even their own families!!!! What a half hearted , cheap attempt to pass this clunker off as a environmental statement!!! Grade:C-</fullReview>

One question, why does there always have to be a love story? Just once I'd like to see a movie without a horndog teen stuck in the middle of a "blockbuster."I've seen better acting, and I've seen worse, but the acting definitely wasn't the problem with this movie.I gave this movie a 7 out of 10 because the effects carried the movie, but once the effects passed and the eye of the storm came, this movie dropped from a 9 (yes a 9, the effects hid the subpar writing).</fullReview>

Not many have really studied the effects that the ocean will have on the climate, or how much of an effect the ocean currents may CAUSE. While I realize that the northeast was featured, the ripple effect of the current would have been felt all over the country as well as the hemisphere. It was nice to see Mother Nature get in a punch in instead of always being beaten down. Wonderful job, wonderful effects, wonderful movie. Please keep up the good work and keep these kinds of movies coming.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mildly Enjoyable Comic Book Farce</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, a mildly enjoyable comic book farce. Enjoyable if unbelievable special effects punctuated a movie with less scientific accuracy than Spiderman. Apparently the 'scientific advisors' failed high school physics. The movie is a comic book farce. The scary thing is that some people are actually taking it seriously. Enjoy the effects, but please don't buy into the propaganda. And no , minus 150 degree air from the troposphere is not going to swoop down in a storm and flash freeze everybody. Why when there enough serious issues to be confronted do people with a radical environmental agenda have to seize on such a ridiculous premise in an attempt to scare the uniformed and ill-educated. Good Grief....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emmerich's big disaster flick strikes big</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie offers some sheer excitement but seems to suffer from a cheesy plot and the usual disaster movie clichés, such as all of the main cast surviving and having an asshole of a leader who questions the professionals authorities. This movie does offer some fine acting by it's leading cast (especially Quaid). It also has some of the most realistic special effects I have ever seen. Dennis Quaid gives a better performance than he did in "The Alamo". Some of the things that happened in this movie were pretty unrealistic (aside from the tornadoes, hail, etc.). The plot seems to be too simple and everything's happens so quickly. Unlike "Independence Day", this movie bounces around from Tokyo to LA, until it finally rests on the peril in New York. The thing I like about Roland is his attention to detail and his strong use of government agencies. In this case, it's the NOAA. All in all, this makes to be a pretty interesting film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This review contains some spoilers.Well I gave The Day After Tomorrow 4 stars: one for Jake Gyllenhaal (why, oh why couldn't they have prolonged the scene where he was stripping out of those cold, wet clothes???) and three for the special effects. Watching LA get ripped up was... well, just cool. And it was nice to see the streets of NYC get a good wash. As for the plot, though... Yeesh. Clichés up the yin-yang. The general format of the movie, the dad/son schtick, the ignored scientist with one obscure supporter pitted against the disbelieving plebians, the teenage geniuses (whole teams of them, no less- how many of those are there in the US anyway? I thought the education system down there was in shambles!), the token homeless guy (with a dog), the self-sacrificing sidekick, the heroics performed by someone unaware of the looming death and getting plucked from its clutches by the love interest, etc, etc, ad nauseum.But some of it got laid on extra thick. The vice-president was eerily reminiscent of the political leadership that's actually in place in the States right now-- a Republican idiot more concerned with looking out for the interests of his big business campaign supporters than the environment (or the lives of the electorate to whom he's *supposed* to be accountable, for that matter). Personally I found his transformation at the end dubious at best. I *loved* the American swarm of immigrants into Mexico and the closing of the border, it was just delicious. Imagine what it'll do for the wages in Mexico! For years they've been slaving away like chumps producing goods for the US that they couldn't afford themselves. Then there was the guy in the library clutching at his old Bible, insisting that if they were facing "the end of Western civilization" and he could only save one piece of it, his reverence for the written word compelled him to save... the Bible. Buddy... check any hotel nightstand on your way out of town; there are way smaller copies that would be easier to carry and not as delicate. Besides, considering all the villainy that people over the centuries have carried out, claiming religious doctrine as their endorsement, I think in a whole library you could find a better piece of literature. Maybe the Boyscouts Handbook? Anyway, was there anything in that Bible about an ice age, among all the "accurate predictions?" If not, you gotta stop clinging to it. No deity saved your butt. Fire did. Boyscout Handbook tells you how to make fire. Drop the Bible, take the Boyscout Handbook. On a lighter note, while it was nice that Canada was at least mentioned in this movie (thanks for nothing, Independance Day), they didn't indicate whether there could have been survivors. I say it's a moot point. OF COURSE there were Canadian survivors! While New Yorkers were waking up the the worst weather in 10,000 years, Canadians looked out their windows, and our first thought: "great, eh, more snow. Good thing I didn't put my shovel in the shed yet." Our second thought? "Looks like the hockey season's gonna run long, eh?" We probably just dug out, drank some beer, and noticed there was a really big new rink south of the border waiting to be skated on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warning: May contain spoilers...and I'm not a good review writer.."The Day After Tomorrow" is the type of movie that you can only enjoy to the fullest at the movie theater. The big screen, the sound effects, the surrounding darkness, it all enhances the feel of the movie. Makes the movie better or worse. In my case, it made it so much better. I was sitting in one of the worst seats you can imagine, but I enjoyed this film. I wasn't expecting to like it as much as I did. (Maybe my wack seat made the movie so great? I was ALL the way in the front and a bit to the right.)Here's the deal: Some guy (Dennis Quaid) 'predicts' that in about 40 or so years, effects of global warming will make the world's climate go nuts. What happens? His prediction comes true, like the next day. So then, it's a matter of survival for the people in the movie, like his son (Jake Gyllenhaal)and friends who are in New York city.. Yeah, the plot's a bit on the clichéd and ridiculous side, but the way it's carried out...I can't even describe it. It was pure excitement. And for some reason left me paranoid when I left the theater and it was drizzling a bit outside.For real, yo, the effects were CRAZY! It was so mind-blowing...I'm not even sure what's considered a spoiler...but, just in case, don't read this if you want to be surprised...The friggin wolf-chase! This was so good! It was like a highlight for me, just because it was so weird! It was funny but weird. The SPECIAL EFFECTS! Los Angeles being terrorized by a tornado was totally amazing to watch. So many aspects of this movie were so genius. Like the unexpected typical romance stuff. I wasn't expecting such corniness. But with Jake Gyllenhaal in it, I should have known...But it wasn't even major corniness. There were a lot of funny scenes in this movie. Just go watch this movie.

		<fullReview>This summer blockbuster was full of extravagant effects as expected however the total absence of proper storytelling and lack of realism severely hurt the movie. So many characters were introduced, yet the audience is left wondering about the majority of them. Aside from Dennis Quaid and his son, the other characters and their bland personalities appeared pasted into the film so as to fulfill a multi-racial cast. As a matter of fact, I found more meaning behind the lovable homeless guy than to the other main characters! What was the point of the child with cancer, the president, and the wolves for crying out loud? Not to mention that man in the weather station located in England with a child...wait, he had a child? Seems like they threw in the fact that he was a father in the editing room. *spoiler* As for the lack of practicality, who decides to walk to New York from Philly in the worst storm ever for over 10000 years?? The answer is Dennis Quaid. Who thinks they can survive in the mother of all storms? Dennis Quaid + a -200 degree Celcius proof tent. What really bothered me was the fact that it was incredibly cold outside but Quaid and his companion had exposed skin but were somehow unaffected by the cold. Perhaps they have never been up north before. As for the story, what happens to all the characters that we meet? The three guys have some scotch we just assume they die? How about that Japanese guy who graced the screen for 5 minutes before being pegged by ice cubes? How about the Asian woman that had a fling with Jason? How about the parents of the other kids? how about the suave boarding school student's little brother? i don't even remembered if they saved him! those selfish selfish punks. I guess they rather be sharing body heat.That being said, I did enjoy some of the numerous jokes inserted into the movie. *spoiler* my personal favourite was when Quaid stole a page right out of John Cena's book from the WWE as he masterfully delivered a standing fireman's through a chimney chute. Now that's HARDCORE. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The summer blockbuster isn't what it used to be!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I used to look forward to the summer blockbuster season. The movies that come out at this time are usually big, loud, and fun. Now they are just big and loud. I always go into a Roland Emmerich flick not expecting too much, he puts together a big spectacular show, but as far as a memorable story, he falls short. This film is being sold as a movie with an environmental message, global warming is basically going to plunge the world into a new ice age. I have nothing against a movie trying to inform, but it is when a movie insults my intelligence is when I tune out. Dennis Quaid stars as a scientist that warns that the earth is dangerously close to a global climate change, he does this at a summit where he chides the VP of the United States(who looks very much like Dick Cheney!), of course this guy does not want to hear about this, he's an evil Republican!!!LOL. As far as the FX, though I agree that they a competently done, are not as groundbreaking as one might think. At one point, Los Angeles is virtually destroyed by a bunch of tornadoes. The effects here are on a larger scale, do not look as convincing as the tornadoes in the movie Twister. The other aspect of the movie are as average and predictable as you could get, Dennis Quaid traverses the northeast to get to his son that is in New York where the city is frozen. His son is played by a very bland Jake Gyllenhaal. I've always regarded him as a low-rent Tobey MacGuire. Though the movie is never boring, it moves slowly, it's not as compelling as it should be. I'm not going to complain about all the scientific BS that is inaccurate because it would be a mute point. The incredible thing is that with a movie that has the "message " that it this one claims to have, its funny that you would have a scene of some astronauts in a space station looking down at the earth after the destruction and saying how clear the air looks, not a mention of the MILLIONS of people that perished,or even their own families!!!! What a half hearted , cheap attempt to pass this clunker off as a environmental statement!!! Grade:C-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hey...this movie has CGI too!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ah, summer. When a young man's fancies lightly turn to BLOCKBUSTERS. Which brings us to The Day After Tomorrow. Following gamely in the hallowed footsteps of such time honored natural disaster flicks as The Perfect Storm, Twister, Earthquake, Volcano, Volcano II (a.k.a. Dante's Peak), Driving Miss Daisy, and maybe a thousand others, this movie proves that science is a bunch of hooey. And that you really don't need to have a great personal vision in making film. It just impedes popcorn intake.This film makes the viewer all to aware that the Earth is an evil menace which should be stamped out as soon as possible. This has nothing to do with the subject matter, but the film itself. Entertaining, yes. It does deliver the sort of thrilling adventure that it promises in the trailer, while at the same time managing to wind up being a public service announcement on the dangers of your can of hairspray. This film does have you rooting, if in confusion, for the main characters. Laced with rather well timed gags and jokes, mingled with jokes that hit you like anvils and make you feel about as happy (Mexico closing the boarders...CLANG), it allows you to like the characters without really caring.The non-ugly Quaid (Jack Hall) works with the flat script as best he can, delivering lines but pretty much just winds up saying "we're in trouble," "I've got to find my son," and "Oh my God." His son (and America's next Tobey Maguire) Jake Gyllenhall, is one of those run-of-the-mill genius, shy, yet capable of dealing with the end of the world in total stride characters.Against my better judgment, I bought it, and most of the other characters too. The problem is how these characters work in the plot, which is almost the template for the summer blockbuster (hell, Independence Day boy made it)The wolves, for example. We saw it a mile away, in fact we saw it before we got in the theater. The fact that every character seemed to be utterly unaware of the biblical cataclysm which had suddenly rolled over the world. The fact that Jack Hall's meeting on environmental issues takes place right before the disaster he prophesied takes place. The arrogant politicians poo-pooing the entire thing. The film's demi-heroine wading back into the flood for a purse because of PASSPORTS - which is good, because you never know when Immigration will start hounding at you after the apocalypse. A gentle reminder: if there's a hundred foot wall of water, complete with refuse from the Hudson and East River spilling towards you at a hundred miles an hour and you realize you've left something behind...let it go, sweetie.Anyone notice that a leitmotif of Roland Emmerich's films is that he hates New York and L.A.? He can't leave them alone. First it's aliens, then bad weather. Word of advice: don't let him in either city, he'll probably start smashing things with a hammer.In any event, amidst all the noise and special effects, there is one dignified moment with Ian Holm and his cohorts in Scotland. However, any sympathy for them is shattered when the movie decides to absolutely forget that they ever existed. What about Adrian Lester's kid? They could've said something about him. And the President of the U.S., whose death is greeted with mild apathy most of the time. Loose ends galore. And please don't try and put a timeline on this film. Just assume that whenever there's a cut between scenes, time passes.Still, the film teaches an important lesson that exists in all of Emmerich's films: when something bad happens, even if it's a nuclear blast from an alien ship or typhoons or -150 degree ice, the best way to save yourself from it is find a door of some sort, go through it, and shut it at the last second. And also stop warming the globe. Don't look at me, I take the subway.Bring a girlfriend to see this, but if you do, make sure she's loud and is capable of doing a play-by-play of the film, and make sure you're sitting next to me. In addition, trust and obey your neighborhood scientists. Worship them, pay homage to them at the university of your choice. Amen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocre Entertainment or Left-Wing Propaganda?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film had potential, but it was botched from the start.One would have to be an idiot not to expect a loud global warming message, but it was laid on so thick and in such a trite mode that it was very distracting. There's no need to try to increase awareness on that issue. Unless you live under a rock you already know about global warming; the movie adds nothing new to the debate.Global warming was only the main of many political attractions; I could have played liberal agenda bingo with this film! The only item that wasn't squeezed in was gay rights-- or maybe I missed that scene. This is annoying no matter your political flavor.I've heard that the film makers admit to stretching the bounds of credible science for the sake of the story, but c'mon! The opening scene tramples probability and common sense so brutally it's almost impossible to take anything afterwards seriously. The only films such stupidity fits are comic book adaptations.Did they cast the President as an Al Gore look-alike on purpose?Is Quaid getting desperate for work or did he accept a guest starring role to help promote awareness of issues, as if that were needed?I'd comment on the story if there were one. It was a patchwork around effects scenes and propaganda bites. Similar to The Core, only more obvious.The only reason I rated this a generous 5 is the visual effects, and even then I had to isolate them from surrounding scenes and laws of physics to enjoy them. One exception, the wolf models were lame. The effects were, in general, interesting.As a propaganda vehicle Day After Tomorrow is very well done, but as entertainment it plain stinks. I don't appreciate having laid down my dwindling entertainment dollars to watch Dennis Quaid's over-simplified political views. The only message I came away with is 'take my money elsewhere next time', and I hope other movie-goers will do likewise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My family saw this movie the night it opened at our local theatre. The next day I was trying to remember what movie we had seen...and that sadly tells it all. Dennis Quaid is too good to be in a movie like this, another version (with better computer usage) of the old disaster movies of the seventies. We walked out of the theatre feeling as if we had been at an environmental rally and saw a propoganda movie on global warming. I do believe in global warming caused by fossil emissions, I just don't want to see it done by Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cool!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The things I really liked were the special effects, I really loved the scene of the cleaner going up the hall and opening the door to see the city destroyed and then the camera panning back to show all the destruction.The bit where the older guy fell through the snow and was hanging and the other guy was on that clear piece of ice which started cracking was very tense, the wolves I thought were so realistic (I'm probably the only one who did) but I was very impressed. The woman staying behind with the young cancer patient I found really touching. The bit where they were running and the ice was freezing everything was very cool. At the start the waves crashing throughout NYC was so well done, I remember someone kind of toppling head over heels over a car which looked cool. The birds in the sky in that scene at the start was totally eerie, I really loved that the homeless guy and his dog survived, the homeless guy giving the doggy sausage when he had hardly any food for himself was totally sweet and lovely. I liked that Jake (who looked totally cute even in the face of certain death) got the girl in the end, and I quite liked the guy wanting to save that book and the reasons he gave for it. I especially liked how you didn't have to sit through 45 minutes of character development before the action started which generally happens with disaster flicks, it had my attention right from the start and kept it the whole way throughout the film.I give it two very enthusiastic thumbs up! 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>May be a spoiler, but it's a stretch!As I watched this mediocre movie, I kept thinking that I had seen it many times before. I had. The exact story line has been used in, for example, Towering Inferno, Poseidon Advanture, Airport and many more. The story line is 1) something bad happens, 2) some people need to get from point A to point B, 3) bad incidents keep happening to annoy them, and 4) they finally get there (the potential spoiler). Forget the junk science...no, DON'T forget that the story was "suggested by" a book by Art Bell and Whitney Strieber, those two alien abduction/government conspiracy/UFO/etc zealots.On a completely unrelated topic, the CG (digital) effects were great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a well-balanced rational review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I saw this movie tonight I looked at the reviews on this site and was shocked to see negative after negative review. Usually there is a good mix, but I must have skimmed through 20 negative ones before I came across some positive ones, and no offense, but they sounded less intelligent (oscar-worthy, now your are pushing it). So I went into this movie expecting it's only value to be the special effects. Normally I do not put too much faith in reviews and tonight I was again reminded why. I saw this movie with my family and my in-laws and we all enjoyed the movie for what it was intended to be. ENTERTAINMENT! You cannot reasonably go into a movie like this and start picking apart what is realistic or not. Come on! It is a dramatic disaster flick about worst-case scenario type situations. You have to give it some creative license or forget it. I'm glad that it is not realistic, because then let's face it, we'd all be moving to Mexico (see the movie). So I did not pay too much attention to people attacking the realism, because I don't expect that from these types of movies. The other critique I saw repeatedly was about the bad acting. There I definitely disagree. Everyone acted just fine for the content, this isn't Shakespeare people! The other critique was how it was anti-Bush administration. Sure, you could read into that with the Cheney-look-alike VP, but so what. I'm (tired of it) but rather used to liberal Hollywood taking shots at Bush. I'm smart enough to realize that Hollywood and those that are part of it are on this earth to entertain me, not share political wisdom with me. It is unfortunate that so many people get influenced by what actors, etc. think, but I, thankfully, am immune. Anyway, I digress. If you like entertaining, exciting, fun movies and do not care about reality, then you will likely enjoy this as well. The special effects are of course spectacular and even though snipets have been seen in other movies, it is fun to see a little of it all in one movie. There is some good humor, and mushy family ("I'm coming for you son") stuff as well if you like that. So don't let the nerds ruin it for you, unless you yourself are hung up on what is plausible or not. Just enjoy yourselves! Remember, the point of movies! Enjoyment, not always enlightenment- though they do talk about the environment and political responsibility, although in an obnoxious sort of way at times. 8/10 for what it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hokey, but entertainingly enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Surely no one's walking into Roland Emmerich's "The Day After Tomorrow" expecting to see a neorealist masterpiece or some profoundly moving epic about the human condition.The man loves to blow things up on screen and that's exactly what he does in "The Day After Tomorrow." Of Emmerich's last four pictures, I enjoyed the "Day" films - "Independence Day" and this one. The other two - "The Patriot" and "Godzilla" were crap."The Day After Tomorrow" has some terrific visual effects - the destruction of the Capitol Records building in Los Angeles, the tidal wave in New York City, the west coast twisters.Of course, the story is conventional. You have the customary protagonist who needs to rescue his family, the cute animal, the love interest, the people who ignore common sense and set out on their own because they know better and, of course, the self-sacrificing supporting character.The dialogue is hokey at times, the plot a bit like Swiss cheese and the performances nothing out of the ordinary. Though, British actor Ian Holm manages to bring a semblance of depth to his small role, proving yet again how good he is at his craft.Question the film's science, if you must. The filmmakers don't try to mask the identity of who the vice-president and president are based on. Though, the most preposterous thing in the film is that our veep would actually show up at an environmental conference."The Day After Tomorrow" has all the requisite ingredients for a summer blockbuster. And it delivers. Thankfully, without an overbearingly loud or obnoxious musical score. Are there unprovoked chuckles? Yes. Predictable scenarios? You betcha. But is it fun and entertaining? Absolutely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Return of the Disaster Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This should have been christened "the disaster movie after so many years" for its brave attempt at rekindling the fiery storm that gave birth to so many of its ilk back in the second half of the Nineties. Remember Dante's Peak, Volcano, Twister and The Perfect Storm? Well, maybe not. Perhaps your recollection is hindered by echoes of Deep Impact and Armaggedon. But definitely consider making room for The Day After Tomorrow, which, incidentally, has nothing to do with the 1983 Cold War epic, in case you were wondering. Nope, this one goes on the assumption that every imaginable climactic calamity could somehow transpire concurrently with its devilish counterparts, engulfing mother earth in an almost instantaneous natural debacle of biblical proportions. Of course, it's all humanity's fault for being so reckless with our misuse of the planet's resources, and for shopping at The Gap. Fortunately, this flick keeps its political agenda-making to a minimum, since Emmerich was probably more occupied with paying proper homage to classics like Meteor (1979) than ameliorating the green party circuit. And props were nicely given, thank you, as TDAT follows Meteor's example by touching on the same locations more or less, namely Tokyo, Los Angeles, and New york (where most of the action goes down). Despite having a budget to rival that of many small nations, the movie doesn't quite feel huge as expected. Its effects get the job done effortlessly, but do not represent the phenomenal leap forward many were anticipating. Most of what we get to see has already been rendered to some extent in the past. However, TDAT stands out from the mushy, kitch-driven posse by being, well, not as mushily kitch-driven. Sure, there's some patriotic pandering, but not enough to make one squirm uncomfortably in their stadium seats. And the leading cast all do their respective roles believably enough, with Dennis Quaid as climatologist Jack Hall, whose warnings of an impending global breakdown in weather patterns falls on deaf political ears until it's all too late. When hail bigger than your average Whopper descends on Tokyo, and flash tornadoes "dismantle" Los Angeles (to quote the hilarious press material we saw online prior to the film's release), everybody more or less gets the picture. What follows looks a lot like Emmerich's superb Godzilla remake, yet has little of its charm and sardonic humor. We get the same healthy dose of widespread, PG-13 havoc, where you're supposed to know scores of people are meeting a grisly collective demise, but hardly ever get to see them buying it in any vivid sense of the expression. As long as one understands what they're getting into, this amounts to no problem at all. Back to the story, Hall must hike it to New York to find his son (Jake Gyllenhaall, from October Sky and Donnie Darko), a laid-back kid infatuated with pretty classmate Laura (Emmy Rossum), and stranded in the NYC public library with a group of courageous, shake 'n' bake survivalists. If this hints at how it would take a new ice age to make people pick up a book, we certainly didn't get it. Beyond the main thread of select, inventive individuals toughing it out we witness a scant few other plot lines. Ian Holm pops in to do Hall's temporary mentor, and Riptide's excellent Perry Kind returns to the big screen momentarily as President Baker, whose chopper promptly falls to the colossal storm in a nod to Indpendence Day. Most disarmingly, Sela Ward does Miss Hall, a pale character the movie could have done equally well were it bereft of her Left Behind Good Samaritan cliché. What's so cool about The Day After Tomorrow is that nobody expects the audience to really take it seriously, but at the same time it's far from preposterous. All in all, Emmerich and crew's competence shows through in most departments, a walk in the park for them in light of so much experience handling these monumental end-of-the-world projects. While some in the screening we attended muttered "where's the comet in all of this?", rest assured TDAT poses no risk of boredom or frustration. Certainly at times it trespasses, like when coverage of a blizzard in Scotland blatantly uses footage shot in Minnesota, or with the brave New York nouveau-librarians scrounging for supplies on a Russian ship that somehow made its way to their doorstep along flooded Manhattan streets, but overall the film remains a solid, entertaining product. As a bonafide examination of current ecological topics, The Day After Tomorrow leaves much to be desired. As prelude to what seems to be building toward a summer science fiction renaissance, it earns the cover price with great dignity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this movie not looking an Academy Award movie, but a movie that would be fun to watch without having to justify its rationality. For the most part this movie met my expectations. The special effects were great, the acting OK, and the script was OK too. I think the movie had a few too many story lines (sela ward's character probably doesn't need to be in this movie) and a couple of unnecessary scenes (most notably the wolves scene). This made the movie seem longer than necessary.I don't think the movie's exaggeration of these cataclysmic scientific events were too extreme, but I'm no paleoclimatoligist neither. I just thought the movie began and ended reasonably well (which Troy did not do when it re-wrote the historical ending).

I mean, in the theater that I was in, everyone was screaming at the screen, once the danger started. What a ride.And I loved how the movie moved from an overview of the situation, or a wide story, into a a more personal story.That was as it should be as well.

I went into this movie expecting a movie driven on special effects and was not disappointed. The flooding and weather effects look real and are very well done, even some of the action sequences around the effects are intriguing. The only problem is the improbably story lines detract from the whole picture. Its hard for me to believe for example that Randy Quaid's associates have nothing better to do than to follow him on an insane journey during dawn of the next ice age. Quaid's journey is so improbable and meaningless that it distracts you from the rest of the story. In short its the movie is about a 6.5 out of 10...good summer fun but the story needs some punching up.</fullReview>

I'm a pretty empathetic person and when I see people in times of great disaster or need--I feel for them, in a sense. And I found myself feeling for these characters.That is, until all the special effects ended and the last hour of the movie began--it all went downhill from there. You don't really realize it, but the first half of the movie is not very dialogue intensive--there's far more visual going on than there is being spoken about. But the second half, they talk and talk and talk--and it's all rubbish. It really sounds like a high schooler wrote some of this dialogue--it was horrid. But then--then, somehow, the movie made an attempt to be a comedy--and does a fair job of it. But then it goes back to it's old, typical ways...and I lost interest again. I was itching to leave; my friends and I were laughing out loud at some of the lines being spoken--and we were not alone.Overall, it's worth seeing for the visual aspects. But you tell me that when they try to tie in the "zoo plot" later on in the movie that the movie hasn't reached a low you didn't see coming. Putting aside all the dialogue and sophomoric plot--I give it a SIX out of TEN. Wait until it comes out on video.</fullReview>

Major hurricanes cover the top portion of the Earth - somehow increasing the energy level of the global storm systems4. Temperatures drop 10 degrees a second, cold enough to flash freeze humans, floors, walls - even a cloth flag flapping in the wind, but those wolves were probably just fine5. In all this freezing, the ocean level seems to rise - usually associated with warming, not freezing since the water rise is associated with melting ice and living organisms in the oceanPlot #5 - 1. Doctor saves cancer stricken child(this plots begins, then is resolved somewhere in the first part of the movie, with faceless firemen saving both the doctor and child)No conflict or tension here.Still, you have to turn off the mind to watch these kinds of movies, but somewhere along the line these plots seem to leave out the excitement and fun. Without interesting plots or interesting plot resolutions, you are left scratching your head and wondering - which leads movie buffs to analyzing, questioning where the movie went wrong.</fullReview>

I was excited when the credits started rolling and I could leave the theater. I know it is just a movie, but a movie should be based on some sort of truth. It was peppered with "JUNK" science. As an example, if the ice age ten thousand years ago came about so quickly that it froze a Mastodon with food still in it's mouth, why is this new "ice age" based solely on global warming? Answer from the movie, that big business, the internal combustion engine, and Republicans are BAD. And for the plot, it fell sort on keeping my interest. This was a 30 minute plot stretched out into a long, LONG movie. It did have some good special effects, but it wasn't worth seeing the other hour and a half.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Above average blockbuster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film sits firmly in the "blockbuster" category. As such you can more or less guarantee a stupid plot, dodgy script, loads of cgi and stereo-typical characters. The Day after Tomorrow certainly doesn't break the mould on these terms, but it is above average for the following reasons. The subject matter here is actually quite interesting and whilst the causes of the life changing events are never any more than brushed over, at least they are aired. The ending is as upbeat as it could be, but you know everyone is in for a tough life after this. It's not likely we'll get a sequel to this.Global warming is about to make the biggest storm(s - 3) of our time. Paradoxically this shuts down the gulf stream and eventually plunges earth into a sudden ice age. The film follows the path of the storm and watches a few poor mortals trying to survive. The characters all play a secondary role to the effects, but the actors make the most of their roles.WARNING: PLOT(?) SPOILERS It's quite interesting to see just how thoughtless the plot can be. After New York is flooded a large ship is seen navigating the skyscrapers before surprisingly running aground - Quite why is never explained. The reason is finally revealed much later - it's to make for an exciting scene later in the movie. PLOT SPOILERS OVERLet's be honest we go to see films like this for thrills and spills. The Day after tomorrow certainly delivers and is better than most of it's counterparts. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forgettable Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Rating: **1/2 out of ****. Out of all the movies coming out this month, this one looked the most promising. Van Helsing looked simply awful, Troy looked visually fantastic but the reviews weren't very promising, Shrek 2 didn't look terrible but I am not really compelled to see it either(the first Shrek never needed a sequel), and the comedies (Breakin all the Rules, Raising Helen) looked like crap. The Day After Tomorrow looked like it would be the most entertaining of them all. If you've seen the preview, you know what to expect. Now see it on the big screen where it is an awesome sight. It's a huge big budget, disaster film that is typical for summer. For the most part, it entertains(at least when the cities are being destroyed). The special effects in the film are highly impressive. The scenes of L.A. being destroyed by twisters and the flooding of New York City are exciting and look believable. Could you ask for anything more? Well yeah you could.I am very surprised that director, Roland Emmerich (who brought us the very entertaining Independence Day) didn't do more. When this movie was being advertised I saw London frozen over and Sydney about to be flooded. Why weren't these in the film? I mean Emmerich showed the destruction of three cities in Independence Day. Why only two here? The reason more cities should have been destroyed is because outside of the disaster sequences and some of the other action sequences, The Day After Tomorrow gives us some really clichéd and uninteresting drama. The doctor staying behind with the cancer patient(that's really corny and should have been cut). The film also shows us one of the most irritating and moronic Vice President I have ever seen in a film(Why does Emmerich always have to have a politician in his disaster films?). There's also some really lame stuff here. The whole sequence with the wolves attacking on a Russian ship was just plain dumb and it wouldn't have hurt the film if it was cut. In fact, The Day After Tomorrow could have been shorter. Even at a reasonable length(124 minutes), it goes on for too long. Also, they need another closing shot because that last one of earth, though having a point, just comes off rather corny. The Day After Tomorrow accomplishes what it sets out to do: entertain. Emmerich is a competent enough filmmaker to generate excitement, even though he can't create write worth a damn. There isn't much of a story here and the characters are mostly types(although some of the actors such as Jake Gyllenhaal and Emmy Rossum make their characters likable). Good disaster films need characters for us to care about (to a certain extent, Independence Day accomplished this), The Day After Tomorrow comes up short. Nevertheless, I had a pretty good time while watching the film. It's not something that will remain in your memory long, but it's fun while it lasts.</fullReview>

It was produced as such, it was marketed as such, and it should be viewed as such. Story? Characterization? Who cares! The movie had nice special effects and little information to process. So, to all of you, movie snobs (God knows I am one once in a while) -- relax, and don't seek depth and meaning where it is not supposed to be.

My problem with this film is that it tried so hard to 'smile' in the face of adversity at the finale, showing the value of re-union, hope and courage against the odds. Please. There is a paradox. In attempting to simulate realism by the cart-load, it loses the plot (in more than one sense). Why can't we have Dennis Quaid finding his son and fellow companions frozen to death at the close of the film? Why not gut the underbelly of the situation by showing real loss? Millions of people froze, drowned, or were killed by the freakish weather conditions in the film, so why not these? We don't need to our hands to be held any longer in mainstream Hollywood cinema; we're grown-ups now, you know. Believe it or not.Please, no more Waterworld's.

		<fullReview>I'll admit; I saw this for Jake Gyllenhaal. He's a wonderful actor (and quite attractive; I'll admit. But don't blame me; I'm fifteen.) And I've learned my lesson. I laughed at parts that REALLY weren't supposed to be funny, the script was just plain bad, and save for the main performances (Dennis Quaid, Jake Gyllenhaal, Ian Holm, Emmy Rossum) it was very poorly acted.Plus, the plot wasn't even realistic. I'm sorry, but I seriously wouldn't recommend this to anyone. Unless they enjoy bad scripts and bad acting accompanied by TOTALLY AWESOME SPECIAL EFFECTS, MAN.

Any chance I get to see L.A. or New York City wiped out requires my attendance. If we had dispensed with the script and the left-leaning agenda, it would have be just as enjoyable to see the special effects in a "Look Ma at what I can do with CGI!" vein.Like a salmonella-laced gourmet meal, The Day After Tomorrow was pleasant to look at, but might a couple of days to get the taste out of my system.</fullReview>

In attempting to simulate realism by the cart-load, it loses the plot (in more than one sense). Why can't we have Dennis Quaid finding his son and fellow companions frozen to death at the close of the film? Why not gut the underbelly of the situation by showing real loss? Millions of people froze, drowned, or were killed by the freakish weather conditions in the film, so why not these? We don't need to our hands to be held any longer in mainstream Hollywood cinema; we're grown-ups now, you know. Believe it or not.Please, no more Waterworld's. We've had enough, haven't we?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll admit; I saw this for Jake Gyllenhaal. He's a wonderful actor (and quite attractive; I'll admit. But don't blame me; I'm fifteen.) And I've learned my lesson. I laughed at parts that REALLY weren't supposed to be funny, the script was just plain bad, and save for the main performances (Dennis Quaid, Jake Gyllenhaal, Ian Holm, Emmy Rossum) it was very poorly acted.Plus, the plot wasn't even realistic. I'm sorry, but I seriously wouldn't recommend this to anyone. Unless they enjoy bad scripts and bad acting accompanied by TOTALLY AWESOME SPECIAL EFFECTS, MAN. Because that's what happened, the special effects rocked, the movie sucked. Really, really hate to say it, but pass.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>&lt;contains spoilers, though it's spoilt enough already&gt;I know. It's a blockbuster, so i should have turned my brain off before i went in to the cinema. And i know that the whole point of the film is to persuade fat rednecks who drive big cars that the environment is a Big Issue. I was being generous. I let it go that it was snowing even though it was supposed to be minus 150 degrees. I was even prepared to let the scene where the fuel in the helicopters freezes go. After all, maybe they were running special "secret military supercool engines". But the scene where the main characters OUTRUN THE COLD was a step too far. Kill me. Kill me now.Everyone's a fricking hero, not enough people die, and even you could work out that the science is balls. Not to mention the acting and the dialogue. If you're a fat and drive a big car - watch the film. Otherwise steer clear.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I heard this movie sucked, so I had low expectations. That helped.I went for the CGI and I got what I hoped for. A good laughable popcorn flick. The CGI was awesome! Better than most I've seen (not all dark, not fake looking).The Quaid story really sucked. Be prepared.The whole story is told with an optimistic, happy, we-love-life and we-love-our-fellow-man attitude that was just boring, unrealistic, and stupid. There were no riots, no wars, and no blood. No one ever even cried. Considering that probably millions of people die in the story, it was told with such optimism that you just couldn't take it seriously.My friend and I whispered to each other and laughed throughout -- you should plan to do the same.The story is of the made-for-cable caliber (like the USA network, maybe), but the big-screen is worthy of the CGI. Aim for a matinee if you can.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps the day after tomorrow, I'll get the bad taste out of my mouth from watching The Day After Tomorrow. I kept trying to remind myself that it was just a film and was working for that "suspension of disbelief" that I enjoy when watching a good movie. But I wasn't watching a good movie and I never could get over the leftist-liberal-eco-whacko agendo so poorly written into the script. Was it a script or some political etchings from the latest Barbra Streisand Save the Gay Whales demonstration? Acting was mediocre and direction seemed irrelevant (if I saw one more shot of "lets film the poor victim as the [insert amazing disaster here] approaches and destroys them" one more time I was going to scream). Cinematic clichés ripped from other films (let's stare up at the Statue of Liberty a la Planet of the Apes) or let's sacrifice ourself for the good of the team (The Poseidon Adventure).It was, however, visually entertaining. Any chance I get to see L.A. or New York City wiped out requires my attendance. If we had dispensed with the script and the left-leaning agenda, it would have be just as enjoyable to see the special effects in a "Look Ma at what I can do with CGI!" vein.Like a salmonella-laced gourmet meal, The Day After Tomorrow was pleasant to look at, but might a couple of days to get the taste out of my system.</fullReview>

Wolves, bald-headed-cancer-kid, etc... good for a chuckle between cool scenes of Mother Nature gone mad. Yes there is some preachy enviro-propaganda but it is so over the top I don't see how anyone would take it seriously. Fer Pete's sake- it's just a movie... buy some popcorn and enjoy the ride.

		<fullReview>Great special effects, sketchy characterisations, flimsy plot-lines, a frequently diabolical script, and yet some neat acting performances make for a mixed bag. Not the best disaster movie, but certainly not the worst either. Jake Gyllenhal was engaging, as were Ian Holm and Arjay Smith. Dennis Quaid was not as impressive. I felt the film needed the Quaid character to be more dynamic, more truly terrified, transmitting that sense of urgency - the film never really developed this for me, aside from the scenes at the British testing site when the buoys were seen to be behaving peculiarly - this was slightly eery, suspenseful. Overall, however, the film builds sufficiently well to hold interest, but sags badly two-thirds in. The US refugee crisis at the Mexican border drew a lot of laughs at the theatre I was watching! The political points though were heavy-handed; a shame in view of the importance of these issues. There was an unnecessary plot-line involving Quaid's wife and a sick child, included it seemed only to add mawkish sentimentality - it actually added nothing to the narrative.</fullReview>

The plot is very derivative and you struggle to find anything you have not seen better in many other movies. Narrow escapes you know must happen, nasty politicians and even the hero's estranged doctor wife who is - a child cancer specialist! This move has absolutely no dramatic tension and the cardboard cutouts they use for characters have been recycled from the worst of "made for TV" dramas. I suppose the photography and technical details are professionally done, but what a waste of talent. And congratulations to Mexico for allowing all of USA to live in a 5 star refugee camp on their land. Drivel with a capital D.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I stepped into the cinema hall to view this film, I knew that I was stepping into another highly marketed Hollywood cliché on "natural scare tactics". Hollywood tends to enjoy racking in money by scaring their audience about the future. Films such as Day Afetr Tomorrow have been made before focusing on future fears such as "Independence Day", and at the end we see that the human kind is a winner, just so that we leave the cinema hall with comfortable feeling of surviving the mental trauma created by the film. Finally, most of us leave cinema hall saying "wow", "amazing", "fantastic only on a big screen", etc. The only part I believe is that it is nice on a big screen, and money well spent to create excitement and fear in people. As far as the story goes - there is none! Characterisation is lame and does not hold any weight. Graphics and special effects are only OK. Dialogues / script is boring. Acting talent - not required (especially here). Length of the film - it could have been shortened - 1. We have bad weather coming soon (20 minutes), 2. People in NYC made aware of the bad weather (10 minutes), 3. People dying in the bad weather (10 minutes), 4. A hero is born and wants to save the world (10 minutes), 4. Hero is struggling (5 minutes), 5. Finally, hero saves the world, and everyone is happy (10 minutes). Hey, that's only 65 minutes (shortest big budget Hollywood film).My final conclusion: Please stay home and watch the local weather news and save some money for a day out on the beach and catch the waves.Score: 4 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You probably saw the trailers for this movie and thought yeah that looks good. Well all the good bits are in those trailers and there's little else in the movie itself worth seeing. A second-rate cheesy plot meanders on way too long propped up by the weather effects you saw in the trailer. The clichés come thick and fast. I knew the movie was going to suck when the 3 English weather scientists started saying how they had 'enough tea and biscuits to sink a battleship' --- because that's what English people say, particularly in the mind of the guy behind this movie who (let me remind you) sent the US president up after the bad guys in Independance Day to "kick some ass". Yeah. I was honestly expecting him to have a bunch of black guys chomping on water melons at some point or some crazy Japanese tourists feverishly taking too many photographs... it's what I'd expect from the director of this movie. Anyway, like independence day this is also fall of brainless ideas and weak dialogue too. Don't bother with it if you don't wanna be disappointed. That said, if you're stupid, easily distracted and don't like to think for more than 3 seconds at a time you'll love it.</fullReview>

Honestly.Roger Ebert normally pans about every nonsensical, mindless dribble ever made yet gave this movie 3 out of 4 stars. Was I surprised? Not really. The man knows his stuff and realizes that this movie isn't meant to be about a solid plot, but a big-budget special-effects driven summer blockbuster popcorn movie. Period. As for me, I was quite pleased with the movie, really. Was the plot ridiculous? Oh absolutely! Ed Wood could probably have come up with some better dialog and scene structures in some instances, but I'll tell ya, the special effects were dazzling. And, let's face it, that's really what we're here for, paying our hard-earned money to see Mother Nature stick it to the people once and for all. And, well, she delivers.

In fact, my friends at NASA tells me there is no science here so it's just a work of fiction, meant to capture your attention, for those of you who know no science, an attempt to jump on the Al Gore bandwagon. You remember Al Gore, the man who told us he in invented the internet.This is a political season. The concepts put before you simply have no basis in science. The producers had a political agenda and it shows like a pretty girl in a celophane nightgown. The real truth is that periodic warming and cooling of the atmosphere has been going on for 4.5 billion years, and that predates Al Gore and the Internet.

The plot is very derivative and you struggle to find anything you have not seen better in many other movies. Narrow escapes you know must happen, nasty politicians and even the hero's estranged doctor wife who is - a child cancer specialist! This move has absolutely no dramatic tension and the cardboard cutouts they use for characters have been recycled from the worst of "made for TV" dramas. I suppose the photography and technical details are professionally done, but what a waste of talent. And congratulations to Mexico for allowing all of USA to live in a 5 star refugee camp on their land. Drivel with a capital D.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I stepped into the cinema hall to view this film, I knew that I was stepping into another highly marketed Hollywood cliché on "natural scare tactics". Hollywood tends to enjoy racking in money by scaring their audience about the future. Films such as Day Afetr Tomorrow have been made before focusing on future fears such as "Independence Day", and at the end we see that the human kind is a winner, just so that we leave the cinema hall with comfortable feeling of surviving the mental trauma created by the film. Finally, most of us leave cinema hall saying "wow", "amazing", "fantastic only on a big screen", etc. The only part I believe is that it is nice on a big screen, and money well spent to create excitement and fear in people. As far as the story goes - there is none! Characterisation is lame and does not hold any weight. Graphics and special effects are only OK. Dialogues / script is boring. Acting talent - not required (especially here). Length of the film - it could have been shortened - 1. We have bad weather coming soon (20 minutes), 2. People in NYC made aware of the bad weather (10 minutes), 3. People dying in the bad weather (10 minutes), 4. A hero is born and wants to save the world (10 minutes), 4. Hero is struggling (5 minutes), 5. Finally, hero saves the world, and everyone is happy (10 minutes). Hey, that's only 65 minutes (shortest big budget Hollywood film).My final conclusion: Please stay home and watch the local weather news and save some money for a day out on the beach and catch the waves.Score: 4 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You probably saw the trailers for this movie and thought yeah that looks good. Well all the good bits are in those trailers and there's little else in the movie itself worth seeing. A second-rate cheesy plot meanders on way too long propped up by the weather effects you saw in the trailer. The clichés come thick and fast. I knew the movie was going to suck when the 3 English weather scientists started saying how they had 'enough tea and biscuits to sink a battleship' --- because that's what English people say, particularly in the mind of the guy behind this movie who (let me remind you) sent the US president up after the bad guys in Independance Day to "kick some ass". Yeah. I was honestly expecting him to have a bunch of black guys chomping on water melons at some point or some crazy Japanese tourists feverishly taking too many photographs... it's what I'd expect from the director of this movie. Anyway, like independence day this is also fall of brainless ideas and weak dialogue too. Don't bother with it if you don't wanna be disappointed. That said, if you're stupid, easily distracted and don't like to think for more than 3 seconds at a time you'll love it.</fullReview>

Unfortunately the special effects occur only in the first hour of the film. My suggestion is to see the first hour and leave. That way you can spare yourself the worst plot line ever created in a film. Did you know that when the temp is -100 degrees you don't even need to wear gloves? According to the movie the actors have no problem accomplishing this. You would also think that due to the cold weather you would be able to see the breath of the actors. Yet the sets were obviously to warm or the company blew all its funds on the 50 tornado's to add this small detail in. The character development is non existent, so basically you don't care weather anyone survives the storm or not. This movie was a blown out of proportion joke not worth the hype.

Then the film shows that the US president forbids the debt Mexico has with the US to solve this situation.First of all, we mexicans are people with values. We wouldn't let our neighbors die in that circumstances and do nothing about it. But as always, "American" directors and "American" people what to believe that everyone outside their borders are evil. But let me tell you, we "Mexicans" don't go to the other side of the world to kill, invade and torture people.Well, after saying what i had to say. Here's the good side of the movie. It is a direct message to "Americans" (US people) and all of the world about how dangerous is to harm our mother nature.

		<shortDescription>One of the worst movies I have seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was so horrible that it went from bad to good, like an Ed Wood film, back to bad again. The plot, the one that barely existed, was so poor that there was no care given to insure the movie had some basic logical or realistic qualities whatsoever. I will give the movie maker credit for making the previews look interesting. The content of the previews was the only interesting part of the movie. They should have released the film as a collection of natural disaster special effects and left it at that. The acting was passable but the plot, script and direction was so lacking that academy award performances by the whole cast could not make up for it. One thing that really struck me as being particularly disgraceful was the big time 'green house effect' preaching throughout the movie. Although I do not claim to know a lot about global warming or the green house effect it is a very bad practice to use a major motion picture to shove a particular point of view on the subject down our throats. I heard several people in the movie audience making "whatever" and "Oh God, give me a break" comments whenever the characters made one of their heavy handed global warning comments. Even the case the people behind this travesty tried to make about the dangers of global dependence on fossil fuels and global warming failed as they contradicted themselves several times when the star of the movie, Dennis Quaid, states that the fallout from global warming would be in 100 to 1000 years and then it happens days after he says it. His character also tried to make a link between the advent of another "ice age" 10,000 years since the last one as "our fault due to our polluting the environment but does not explain how an "ice age happened 10,000 years ago when mankind was not polluting the environment at all. In conclusion, this movie is a stupid, non logical, boring piece of political propagandist garbage</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie itself was pretty good, but the theory is ridiculous. I believe in global warming, but the movie suggested that the north polar ice cap was melting. If it did that, the ocean levels would neither rise, nor fall. If you don't believe, try this: take a glass of water and put ice in it. Let the ice melt. The water level won't rise or fall. Another thing, why was it just the northern hemisphere. In many cases, the southern hemisphere is colder than the northern hemisphere. The science in the movie is so utterly ridiculous, I don't know why they even bothered to try. If you're going to make a scientific movie, then at least get the science right!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great entertainment movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here it is, another blockbuster about disasters. This one is about the climate mutations and the beginning of a new ice age. Like some other catastrophe-movies, this film has some basic characteristics and ideas from all the others in this genre. That means we have an hero who promises to his sun that he is going to rescue him, we have some thrilling action sequences and all that... Actually, the movie doesn't focus on the catastrophe - in spite of that, it focus in personal lives of the main characters, which is usual in this type of films. Anyway, there's something particularly amazing I liked in this movie and that make me feel it is better that the majority of the movies from this genre - it have some of the most spetacular special effects I've seen in a movie. The images are simply wonderful, and in this aspect in "The day after tomorrow" is really good and very well done. I wasn't expecting to much from this movie and then I have to say I was a little surprised. If you like this kind of movies (or not), you sure won't be disappointed with this one. It's not an excellent film, but is a great entertainment piece. I rate this movie 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

I see they tried to build characters here, but it didn't work. The whole father son thing was ridiculous.Also - you would think they would have more destruction in the film, show more action scenes.

		<shortDescription>Comical parody of the current administration..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I appreciated the noticeable parodies of the Bush administration, particularly the vice president, and the fictitious presidency in the movie. Our first glimpse of the American government was of the cold, insensitive vice president questioning the value of evidence of the potential environmental dangers, and focusing solely on the overwhelming pricetag this research heeded. How funny was it that the VICE PRESIDENT (who looks like a slim Cheney) actually apologized to the devastated US of A over taking advantage of the natural resources of the earth and acting irresponsibly in considering the future of the environment? As pleasant and ideal as this may seem, we as the American public shouldn't be so foolish to believe (or even hope) that this current administration would ever cut back in the development and exploitation of the earth's natural resources in the name of industry, let alone offer an honest and straightforward apology. I saw the touching speech of the VP (at the time the pres) in this movie as a joke from the movie producers saying, 'yeah right, like you would ever in a million years apologize for the environmental mistakes your policies have created' directly to george and dick. The catastrophic, climatic disasters of this movie are not by any stretch of the imagination the most unrealistic feature of this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't go into "Day After Tomorrow" expecting much, and sadly that prophecy was fulfilled. Independence Day it's not. The effects were as great as expected, but you basically get to see everything worth seeing when you watch the trailer or commercial. There is really no plot to speak of, and what small semblance of plot exists is thinly woven. Climate shift is an interesting concept, but not necessarily made believable by this movie. The acting is so-so, and there are actually a few humorous lines that made the movie worth seeing. All in all, it was worth it just to get out of the house for a while, and it wasn't all bad - it just wasn't all good, either. Basically, I suggest seeing this one as a matinee or wait until video...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>and beat the ever living crap of myself for even considering watching this movie. I was skeptical to see this movie knowing how bad Independence Day and especially Godzilla were, but as a lover of science, I was interested to know the technical details of the script. There were none. This movie is the most implausible movie since Godzilla where the French actually volunteer to clean up after themselves. Even tree huggers would have to admit this will never happen. That aside the good visuals and special effects are completely overshadowed by the lack of a plot or real story. At the end of the movie half of the theatre was asleep. At one point during the film I had to start punching myself in the face, because it was less painful than watching this piece of garbage. Another stinker from Emmerich, who wrote the script as well. Although I doubt this film had a script. The side plots were even more boring. Guy falls in love with girl. Dad rescues estranged son. Someone sticks up for sick boy. Old haired white men don't listen to anyone. I could go on and on. One big, long, boring, piece of crap. I will still be feeling nauseous the day after tomorrow from this movie. Avoid at all cost.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst movies EVER</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew this movie would be bad, unfortunately it was worse than expected. The plot is paper thin: OK, after 150 years of mass fossil fuel consumption, global warming shifts the flow of the gulf stream. This creates a drastic change in the weather patterns and in a matter of days three gigantic hurricane-like snow storms engulf the entire northern hemisphere. Dennis Quaid and Ian Holm play scientists who see the immediate threat that the storms pose and are unable to bring it to the attention of an apathetic White House. About twenty minutes into the film, the storm has begun and the drama that unfolds. These severe storms rip through the world, tearing LA apart with monster tornadoes, burying the Brittish Isles in snow and ice, and flooding New York before turning the 5 boroughs into the world's largest ice cube tray. Amidst all of this chaos, the governments of the world (namely the US) sit on their hands and watch the major urban centers of the world be ripped apart by these horrific storms. Meanwhile, Dennis Quaid's son in the picture, Sam (played by Jake Gyllenhaal of Donnie Darko fame), is trapped in NYC after traveling from DC to compete in a team academic competition, which Sam joined to get to know Laura (played by Mystic River's Emmy Rossum).If you have an attention span of less than two minutes, you have a 50/50 shot of enjoying this movie. There are too many story lines competing for screen time in this movie. None of the characters have any depth, and the plot is thinner than rice paper. The only reason to see this movie is for technical reasons, and even in this respect, the movie is not noteworthy. The CGI isn't anything spectacular, and there weren't even any cute little scientific tidbits which you are generally able to take away from these types of movies which suggests to me that there was more time spent photocopying the script than there was actual research. In the end this movie is nothing more than a thinly-veiled politically oriented movie that take weak shots at the current American government, and even weaker shots at trying to act. Acting: D- Directing: F Visual Effects: C+ Script: F-Average: 0.75 out of 4Seriously, this film made Van Helsing seem Oscar worthy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a classic &amp; Definitely not a great movie!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie could've been great but as usual Roland Emmerich's movies are as always very overrated, his directing is always in neutral, i don't think he knows what he actually wants to make. Most of his movie's get boring during the middle for some period of time e.g. "Independence Day", "Godzilla" (which is totally crap), "Stargate" (i think its his best movie), "Universal Soldier" (which also is a pretty good movie), "The Patriot" (good movie but to slow in the middle). So yea his movies are always out to be Oscar winning movies, but as usual their very overrated. "The Day after Tomorrow" had a good start, the whole concept of the movie was good about global warming &amp; the special effects were all good, but what you see in the trailer is about all you need to see to understand the movie, the rest is just to make it into a feature length film, about a father trying to get to his son. Just because he made a promise to his son. I don't think many people would love this movie. I didn't think that "Independence Day" was even better than this movie, even though i didn't like it that much. I'd give this movie about a 5 / 10, for being a very average movie, which didn't deserve all this advertising.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leave the Script, take the Tidal Waves</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many movies have passed in front of my eyes, and I am well versed in horrible scripts and laughably absurd plotlines, but I can assure you, my fellow viewers, that even for a eye-candy-filled pulse-pounder, this movie has a ridiculous script. Leave the characters behind and the movie stands as a testament to the magic of special effects seemlessly integrated into real-time action. All the same, the movie suffers from cardboard cut-out characters, wooden acting and insanely banal lines, not to mention the suffocating clichés. Come to see the waves, the tornadoes, the destruction and the preposterous weather events, but not the horrid acting. The plot is sound, as disaster movies go, but lets forget the snooty treatment of south American countries and the demand for a strong suspense for disbelief, not just for the weather but for the illogical reaction of our government. Get the DVD, avoid the theater unless you like snickering audiences and high-school drama class scripts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>there were two specials effects i liked. the capitol records building being torn apart in LA and the water flooding into NY city. that was it. and i saw that in the trailer. well okay Sela Ward and that old guy from the first Lord of the Rings movie who sent the kids off on their quest and wanted the ring too -- that guy. so those two were good and i'd hire them again. so two actors and two special effects were good if that's worth ten bucks to you then go see it.there are way too many subplots with characters you don't care about getting killed that made the audience i was with, well ... they laughed. i think we were supposed to care but we ... well, laughed. the directing was all over the place the cinematography was that silly moving stuff for the entire film. is this a skateboarding video ... even the scenes where they're giving speeches in the board rooms? no. we want to see the room, the setup of the scene, then we want to see the main guy -- unfortunately Dennis Quaid got stuck with the being the main guy in this movie -- then we want to see shots of other people saying stuff and the necessarily reactions we need to understand. not swooping helicopter shots in the freaking boardroom unless it's leading up to somehting interesting. it never does. not even when frost /chases/ the kids into a room in the NY city library. frost? chasing? library? whose idea was that? fire that guy. you couldve at least panned past a No Running sign while they were running and a Quiet Please sign while they were screaming so we could laugh. at least let us laugh. and then timberwolves show up? wolves?? please. fire that guy too. the visual effects guy, the one who i'm guessing was in charge of the capitol records clip and the NY city clip should get another job. those were cool and well done. i'm guessing that's why they picked those shots for the trailer. the editor. the editor of this film is at fault for the weird pacing that never really led up to anything ... except plodding speeches about, spinning animated weather stuff and global warming. yawn. but maybe he was forced to do his job over the weekend in the back of a van or something. i wanna say the editing sucked but i'm willing to give him a break assuming the weekend in a van thing. save your money and spend it on ... something else. ice cream. a ticket to a cool art show. request a song and give a nice tip to the piano bar guy. give a dollar to a disadvantaged soul or ten disadvantaged souls. see some local music somewhere in your town. sit in the dark and crunch peppermint lifesavers because they make that cool blue light when they crunch. do anything but see this movie. it's just dumb and not dumb in a good way like Dumb and Dumber. dumb in just a dumb way. dumb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch it for the CGI, and nothing more.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know what to think about Emmerich, I'm aware of all the negative press he gets and some I think isn't really deserved. I haven't seen Stargate in a decade and can't accurately comment on it, I like ID4 for what it was, Godzilla was wasted potential and I have yet to see the Patriot. The biggest fall that Emmerich had is that his films are VERY impressive from a CGI and action scene standpoint, but suffer horribly in character and plot development. In fact, ID4 turned out so good in my eyes because it had plenty of good CGI and action to make up for the terrible plot. Godzilla failed because all the good stuff was at the beginning while the character and plot carried the last three-quarters of the flick. Now, after so many years out of the Hollywood limelight, Emmerich returns sans-Dean Devlin for another stab at the multi-million dollar summer project. This time, he decides to tread on even more dangerous waters with a global warming flick that is sure to agitate many a scientist. Surprisingly though, the film manages to keep the crap to a minimum.Day After Tomorrow is a global warming themed-flick that doesn't shy from bringing that issue to the front. There are countless scenes where characters will rant and rave over thermal currents, ice storms and whatnot and how "we weren't quick enough". Personally, I never believed in global warming, but I did try to keep personal feelings away from judging this film. On the other hand, there was plenty of attempts to turn a real-life debate into multi-gazillion dollar CGI-fest, (which were quite nice, might I add). Marvel at Los Angeles getting torn apart by tornadoes or New York getting hit by a massive flood. Watch the world freeze over and storms pound at the survivors. In fact, you'll have so much fun watching this that it more than makes up for the terrible character and plot development. Yes, a patented Emmerich trademark returns in full-force with more forced "crisis's" involving love and/or family interjected into odd moments. Watch a man walk across a sixth of the nation to locate his son or a love triangle that completely keels over and dies by the half-way point. Sadly, this is the entire last half of the film with poor CGI wolves being the only real action scene worth mentioning during that half. The underutilization of characters is a big problem, as there were literally dozens of characters added at various points that received little or no development and when they would die or "contribute" you felt no emotion.But for what it is, I was glad to see a couple good CGI scenes right away but I do wish they were more spaced out so I didn't have to pace through poor dialogue and underdeveloped or underutilized characters.6.0/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical disaster movie but with a conscience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a typical disaster movie very big on special effects but it does have one thing many movies like the Towering Inferno, Titanic, Armageddon, etc. did not have. It definitely has a conscience about environmental concerns. It does not really seem to offer any solutions about how we could stop the environmental damage that leads to the various disasters that wreck havoc in various cities in the US. The special effects are well worth the price of a ticket and probably would be worth multiple viewings. The acting is about average but there is really not a whole lot actors can do in a typical disaster movie but run and scream from various calamities.It does look like whoever decided which cities to demolish and how has some pent up problems especially with DC and the entertainment industry. These wild child antics are one of the most amusing portions of the movie in the way certain landmarks are dealt with in this disaster movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A simple formula: Pay less for the script and talent = pay more for the effects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was utterly blown away by the special effects in The Day After Tomorrow. I was astonished at how natural and fluid the CGI was in this film. It actually made it difficult to determine what was real and what was created. That being said, this movie is abysmal. The plot is second rate, the subplots were ridiculous, and although the theory behind the fiction was interesting, the execution was laughable. Don't get me started on the acting?The Day After Tomorrow is yet another in a long string of Man Vs. the awesome-power-of-some-incredibly-large-force-that-we-can't-control-or-predict. It is brought to you by Writer, Director, Producer Roland Emmerich (Godzilla, Independence Day, Stargate) who started it all back in 1996 with Independence Day. Back then, we were going to get decimated by aliens. Since then, mankind has faced destruction by two meteors, a perfect storm, more aliens, a virus or two, a large green Monster named Godzilla, abnormally large and voracious insects, two Volcanic eruptions, and the Earth herself. This is a tired plot that should be shelved for more imaginative ones.The plot synopsis is simple: We are consumer pigs that destroyed the Earth without thought to consequence, and now the beast will strike back against us. This time, it does it in the form of a global climate shift that takes place over 24 hours, rather than the scientifically held belief of a few centuries. This climate shift swells the seas with melting polar ice caps, followed by a -200 degree Fahrenheit storm that instantly freezes everything it catches, except for a small group of highschoolers, and a two dudes in a Wendy's.Were there characters in this film? I almost forgot. Jack Hall, played by Dennis Quaid (Cold Creek Manor, Traffic, Frequency), is one of those guys who finds refuge in a Wendy's, while his son, Sam Hall, played by Jake Gyllenhaal (The Good Girl, Bubble Boy, Donnie Darko), is one of the high school students trapped in the New York Central Library. I'm sure there were other stars in this film, but it doesn't matter. You won't remember them anyway. They are just faces that didn't get frozen.What you will remember, however, are the special effects. They are miraculous, at minimum. It is almost impossible to determine where the true filming occurred and where the CGI begins. They will be the industry yardstick by which all future films will be measured.If you have any desire at all to see this film, do not miss it on the big screen. The sound and visual effects will shake you alive. Don't expect to be shaken by the acting talents or plot devices, and try not to laugh at the pathetic dialogue. If you are a nit-picker, stick with ST:NG, you will be bored silly with this script. For the rest of us, enjoy the Special effects.This film deserves a zero, but because the special effects are so incredible, it is getting a 3. That is in no way an indication that this is a good film, but only an indication that they did one hell of a job putting it all together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comical parody of the current administration..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I appreciated the noticeable parodies of the Bush administration, particularly the vice president, and the fictitious presidency in the movie. Our first glimpse of the American government was of the cold, insensitive vice president questioning the value of evidence of the potential environmental dangers, and focusing solely on the overwhelming pricetag this research heeded. How funny was it that the VICE PRESIDENT (who looks like a slim Cheney) actually apologized to the devastated US of A over taking advantage of the natural resources of the earth and acting irresponsibly in considering the future of the environment? As pleasant and ideal as this may seem, we as the American public shouldn't be so foolish to believe (or even hope) that this current administration would ever cut back in the development and exploitation of the earth's natural resources in the name of industry, let alone offer an honest and straightforward apology. I saw the touching speech of the VP (at the time the pres) in this movie as a joke from the movie producers saying, 'yeah right, like you would ever in a million years apologize for the environmental mistakes your policies have created' directly to george and dick. The catastrophic, climatic disasters of this movie are not by any stretch of the imagination the most unrealistic feature of this movie.</fullReview>

The acting is about average but there is really not a whole lot actors can do in a typical disaster movie but run and scream from various calamities.It does look like whoever decided which cities to demolish and how has some pent up problems especially with DC and the entertainment industry. These wild child antics are one of the most amusing portions of the movie in the way certain landmarks are dealt with in this disaster movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A simple formula: Pay less for the script and talent = pay more for the effects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was utterly blown away by the special effects in The Day After Tomorrow. I was astonished at how natural and fluid the CGI was in this film. It actually made it difficult to determine what was real and what was created. That being said, this movie is abysmal. The plot is second rate, the subplots were ridiculous, and although the theory behind the fiction was interesting, the execution was laughable. Don't get me started on the acting?The Day After Tomorrow is yet another in a long string of Man Vs. the awesome-power-of-some-incredibly-large-force-that-we-can't-control-or-predict. It is brought to you by Writer, Director, Producer Roland Emmerich (Godzilla, Independence Day, Stargate) who started it all back in 1996 with Independence Day. Back then, we were going to get decimated by aliens. Since then, mankind has faced destruction by two meteors, a perfect storm, more aliens, a virus or two, a large green Monster named Godzilla, abnormally large and voracious insects, two Volcanic eruptions, and the Earth herself. This is a tired plot that should be shelved for more imaginative ones.The plot synopsis is simple: We are consumer pigs that destroyed the Earth without thought to consequence, and now the beast will strike back against us. This time, it does it in the form of a global climate shift that takes place over 24 hours, rather than the scientifically held belief of a few centuries. This climate shift swells the seas with melting polar ice caps, followed by a -200 degree Fahrenheit storm that instantly freezes everything it catches, except for a small group of highschoolers, and a two dudes in a Wendy's.Were there characters in this film? I almost forgot. Jack Hall, played by Dennis Quaid (Cold Creek Manor, Traffic, Frequency), is one of those guys who finds refuge in a Wendy's, while his son, Sam Hall, played by Jake Gyllenhaal (The Good Girl, Bubble Boy, Donnie Darko), is one of the high school students trapped in the New York Central Library. I'm sure there were other stars in this film, but it doesn't matter. You won't remember them anyway. They are just faces that didn't get frozen.What you will remember, however, are the special effects. They are miraculous, at minimum. It is almost impossible to determine where the true filming occurred and where the CGI begins. They will be the industry yardstick by which all future films will be measured.If you have any desire at all to see this film, do not miss it on the big screen. The sound and visual effects will shake you alive. Don't expect to be shaken by the acting talents or plot devices, and try not to laugh at the pathetic dialogue. If you are a nit-picker, stick with ST:NG, you will be bored silly with this script. For the rest of us, enjoy the Special effects.This film deserves a zero, but because the special effects are so incredible, it is getting a 3. That is in no way an indication that this is a good film, but only an indication that they did one hell of a job putting it all together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comical parody of the current administration..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I appreciated the noticeable parodies of the Bush administration, particularly the vice president, and the fictitious presidency in the movie. Our first glimpse of the American government was of the cold, insensitive vice president questioning the value of evidence of the potential environmental dangers, and focusing solely on the overwhelming pricetag this research heeded. How funny was it that the VICE PRESIDENT (who looks like a slim Cheney) actually apologized to the devastated US of A over taking advantage of the natural resources of the earth and acting irresponsibly in considering the future of the environment? As pleasant and ideal as this may seem, we as the American public shouldn't be so foolish to believe (or even hope) that this current administration would ever cut back in the development and exploitation of the earth's natural resources in the name of industry, let alone offer an honest and straightforward apology. I saw the touching speech of the VP (at the time the pres) in this movie as a joke from the movie producers saying, 'yeah right, like you would ever in a million years apologize for the environmental mistakes your policies have created' directly to george and dick. The catastrophic, climatic disasters of this movie are not by any stretch of the imagination the most unrealistic feature of this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't go into "Day After Tomorrow" expecting much, and sadly that prophecy was fulfilled. Independence Day it's not. The effects were as great as expected, but you basically get to see everything worth seeing when you watch the trailer or commercial. There is really no plot to speak of, and what small semblance of plot exists is thinly woven. Climate shift is an interesting concept, but not necessarily made believable by this movie. The acting is so-so, and there are actually a few humorous lines that made the movie worth seeing. All in all, it was worth it just to get out of the house for a while, and it wasn't all bad - it just wasn't all good, either. Basically, I suggest seeing this one as a matinee or wait until video...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>and beat the ever living crap of myself for even considering watching this movie. I was skeptical to see this movie knowing how bad Independence Day and especially Godzilla were, but as a lover of science, I was interested to know the technical details of the script. There were none. This movie is the most implausible movie since Godzilla where the French actually volunteer to clean up after themselves. Even tree huggers would have to admit this will never happen. That aside the good visuals and special effects are completely overshadowed by the lack of a plot or real story. At the end of the movie half of the theatre was asleep. At one point during the film I had to start punching myself in the face, because it was less painful than watching this piece of garbage. Another stinker from Emmerich, who wrote the script as well. Although I doubt this film had a script. The side plots were even more boring. Guy falls in love with girl. Dad rescues estranged son. Someone sticks up for sick boy. Old haired white men don't listen to anyone. I could go on and on. One big, long, boring, piece of crap. I will still be feeling nauseous the day after tomorrow from this movie. Avoid at all cost.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst movies EVER</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew this movie would be bad, unfortunately it was worse than expected. The plot is paper thin: OK, after 150 years of mass fossil fuel consumption, global warming shifts the flow of the gulf stream. This creates a drastic change in the weather patterns and in a matter of days three gigantic hurricane-like snow storms engulf the entire northern hemisphere. Dennis Quaid and Ian Holm play scientists who see the immediate threat that the storms pose and are unable to bring it to the attention of an apathetic White House. About twenty minutes into the film, the storm has begun and the drama that unfolds. These severe storms rip through the world, tearing LA apart with monster tornadoes, burying the Brittish Isles in snow and ice, and flooding New York before turning the 5 boroughs into the world's largest ice cube tray. Amidst all of this chaos, the governments of the world (namely the US) sit on their hands and watch the major urban centers of the world be ripped apart by these horrific storms. Meanwhile, Dennis Quaid's son in the picture, Sam (played by Jake Gyllenhaal of Donnie Darko fame), is trapped in NYC after traveling from DC to compete in a team academic competition, which Sam joined to get to know Laura (played by Mystic River's Emmy Rossum).If you have an attention span of less than two minutes, you have a 50/50 shot of enjoying this movie. There are too many story lines competing for screen time in this movie. None of the characters have any depth, and the plot is thinner than rice paper. The only reason to see this movie is for technical reasons, and even in this respect, the movie is not noteworthy. The CGI isn't anything spectacular, and there weren't even any cute little scientific tidbits which you are generally able to take away from these types of movies which suggests to me that there was more time spent photocopying the script than there was actual research. In the end this movie is nothing more than a thinly-veiled politically oriented movie that take weak shots at the current American government, and even weaker shots at trying to act. Acting: D- Directing: F Visual Effects: C+ Script: F-Average: 0.75 out of 4Seriously, this film made Van Helsing seem Oscar worthy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a classic &amp; Definitely not a great movie!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie could've been great but as usual Roland Emmerich's movies are as always very overrated, his directing is always in neutral, i don't think he knows what he actually wants to make. Most of his movie's get boring during the middle for some period of time e.g. "Independence Day", "Godzilla" (which is totally crap), "Stargate" (i think its his best movie), "Universal Soldier" (which also is a pretty good movie), "The Patriot" (good movie but to slow in the middle). So yea his movies are always out to be Oscar winning movies, but as usual their very overrated. "The Day after Tomorrow" had a good start, the whole concept of the movie was good about global warming &amp; the special effects were all good, but what you see in the trailer is about all you need to see to understand the movie, the rest is just to make it into a feature length film, about a father trying to get to his son. Just because he made a promise to his son. I don't think many people would love this movie. I didn't think that "Independence Day" was even better than this movie, even though i didn't like it that much. I'd give this movie about a 5 / 10, for being a very average movie, which didn't deserve all this advertising.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leave the Script, take the Tidal Waves</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many movies have passed in front of my eyes, and I am well versed in horrible scripts and laughably absurd plotlines, but I can assure you, my fellow viewers, that even for a eye-candy-filled pulse-pounder, this movie has a ridiculous script. Leave the characters behind and the movie stands as a testament to the magic of special effects seemlessly integrated into real-time action. All the same, the movie suffers from cardboard cut-out characters, wooden acting and insanely banal lines, not to mention the suffocating clichés. Come to see the waves, the tornadoes, the destruction and the preposterous weather events, but not the horrid acting. The plot is sound, as disaster movies go, but lets forget the snooty treatment of south American countries and the demand for a strong suspense for disbelief, not just for the weather but for the illogical reaction of our government. Get the DVD, avoid the theater unless you like snickering audiences and high-school drama class scripts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>there were two specials effects i liked. the capitol records building being torn apart in LA and the water flooding into NY city. that was it. and i saw that in the trailer. well okay Sela Ward and that old guy from the first Lord of the Rings movie who sent the kids off on their quest and wanted the ring too -- that guy. so those two were good and i'd hire them again. so two actors and two special effects were good if that's worth ten bucks to you then go see it.there are way too many subplots with characters you don't care about getting killed that made the audience i was with, well ... they laughed. i think we were supposed to care but we ... well, laughed. the directing was all over the place the cinematography was that silly moving stuff for the entire film. is this a skateboarding video ... even the scenes where they're giving speeches in the board rooms? no. we want to see the room, the setup of the scene, then we want to see the main guy -- unfortunately Dennis Quaid got stuck with the being the main guy in this movie -- then we want to see shots of other people saying stuff and the necessarily reactions we need to understand. not swooping helicopter shots in the freaking boardroom unless it's leading up to somehting interesting. it never does. not even when frost /chases/ the kids into a room in the NY city library. frost? chasing? library? whose idea was that? fire that guy. you couldve at least panned past a No Running sign while they were running and a Quiet Please sign while they were screaming so we could laugh. at least let us laugh. and then timberwolves show up? wolves?? please. fire that guy too. the visual effects guy, the one who i'm guessing was in charge of the capitol records clip and the NY city clip should get another job. those were cool and well done. i'm guessing that's why they picked those shots for the trailer. the editor. the editor of this film is at fault for the weird pacing that never really led up to anything ... except plodding speeches about, spinning animated weather stuff and global warming. yawn. but maybe he was forced to do his job over the weekend in the back of a van or something. i wanna say the editing sucked but i'm willing to give him a break assuming the weekend in a van thing. save your money and spend it on ... something else. ice cream. a ticket to a cool art show. request a song and give a nice tip to the piano bar guy. give a dollar to a disadvantaged soul or ten disadvantaged souls. see some local music somewhere in your town. sit in the dark and crunch peppermint lifesavers because they make that cool blue light when they crunch. do anything but see this movie. it's just dumb and not dumb in a good way like Dumb and Dumber. dumb in just a dumb way. dumb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch it for the CGI, and nothing more.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know what to think about Emmerich, I'm aware of all the negative press he gets and some I think isn't really deserved. I haven't seen Stargate in a decade and can't accurately comment on it, I like ID4 for what it was, Godzilla was wasted potential and I have yet to see the Patriot. The biggest fall that Emmerich had is that his films are VERY impressive from a CGI and action scene standpoint, but suffer horribly in character and plot development. In fact, ID4 turned out so good in my eyes because it had plenty of good CGI and action to make up for the terrible plot. Godzilla failed because all the good stuff was at the beginning while the character and plot carried the last three-quarters of the flick. Now, after so many years out of the Hollywood limelight, Emmerich returns sans-Dean Devlin for another stab at the multi-million dollar summer project. This time, he decides to tread on even more dangerous waters with a global warming flick that is sure to agitate many a scientist. Surprisingly though, the film manages to keep the crap to a minimum.Day After Tomorrow is a global warming themed-flick that doesn't shy from bringing that issue to the front. There are countless scenes where characters will rant and rave over thermal currents, ice storms and whatnot and how "we weren't quick enough". Personally, I never believed in global warming, but I did try to keep personal feelings away from judging this film. On the other hand, there was plenty of attempts to turn a real-life debate into multi-gazillion dollar CGI-fest, (which were quite nice, might I add). Marvel at Los Angeles getting torn apart by tornadoes or New York getting hit by a massive flood. Watch the world freeze over and storms pound at the survivors. In fact, you'll have so much fun watching this that it more than makes up for the terrible character and plot development. Yes, a patented Emmerich trademark returns in full-force with more forced "crisis's" involving love and/or family interjected into odd moments. Watch a man walk across a sixth of the nation to locate his son or a love triangle that completely keels over and dies by the half-way point. Sadly, this is the entire last half of the film with poor CGI wolves being the only real action scene worth mentioning during that half. The underutilization of characters is a big problem, as there were literally dozens of characters added at various points that received little or no development and when they would die or "contribute" you felt no emotion.But for what it is, I was glad to see a couple good CGI scenes right away but I do wish they were more spaced out so I didn't have to pace through poor dialogue and underdeveloped or underutilized characters.6.0/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>there were two specials effects i liked. the capitol records building being torn apart in LA and the water flooding into NY city. that was it. and i saw that in the trailer. well okay Sela Ward and that old guy from the first Lord of the Rings movie who sent the kids off on their quest and wanted the ring too -- that guy. so those two were good and i'd hire them again. so two actors and two special effects were good if that's worth ten bucks to you then go see it.there are way too many subplots with characters you don't care about getting killed that made the audience i was with, well ... they laughed. i think we were supposed to care but we ... well, laughed. the directing was all over the place the cinematography was that silly moving stuff for the entire film. is this a skateboarding video ... even the scenes where they're giving speeches in the board rooms? no. we want to see the room, the setup of the scene, then we want to see the main guy -- unfortunately Dennis Quaid got stuck with the being the main guy in this movie -- then we want to see shots of other people saying stuff and the necessarily reactions we need to understand. not swooping helicopter shots in the freaking boardroom unless it's leading up to somehting interesting. it never does. not even when frost /chases/ the kids into a room in the NY city library. frost? chasing? library? whose idea was that? fire that guy. you couldve at least panned past a No Running sign while they were running and a Quiet Please sign while they were screaming so we could laugh. at least let us laugh. and then timberwolves show up? wolves?? please. fire that guy too. the visual effects guy, the one who i'm guessing was in charge of the capitol records clip and the NY city clip should get another job. those were cool and well done. i'm guessing that's why they picked those shots for the trailer. the editor. the editor of this film is at fault for the weird pacing that never really led up to anything ... except plodding speeches about, spinning animated weather stuff and global warming. yawn. but maybe he was forced to do his job over the weekend in the back of a van or something. i wanna say the editing sucked but i'm willing to give him a break assuming the weekend in a van thing. save your money and spend it on ... something else. ice cream. a ticket to a cool art show. request a song and give a nice tip to the piano bar guy. give a dollar to a disadvantaged soul or ten disadvantaged souls. see some local music somewhere in your town. sit in the dark and crunch peppermint lifesavers because they make that cool blue light when they crunch. do anything but see this movie. it's just dumb and not dumb in a good way like Dumb and Dumber. dumb in just a dumb way. dumb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch it for the CGI, and nothing more.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know what to think about Emmerich, I'm aware of all the negative press he gets and some I think isn't really deserved. I haven't seen Stargate in a decade and can't accurately comment on it, I like ID4 for what it was, Godzilla was wasted potential and I have yet to see the Patriot. The biggest fall that Emmerich had is that his films are VERY impressive from a CGI and action scene standpoint, but suffer horribly in character and plot development. In fact, ID4 turned out so good in my eyes because it had plenty of good CGI and action to make up for the terrible plot. Godzilla failed because all the good stuff was at the beginning while the character and plot carried the last three-quarters of the flick. Now, after so many years out of the Hollywood limelight, Emmerich returns sans-Dean Devlin for another stab at the multi-million dollar summer project. This time, he decides to tread on even more dangerous waters with a global warming flick that is sure to agitate many a scientist. Surprisingly though, the film manages to keep the crap to a minimum.Day After Tomorrow is a global warming themed-flick that doesn't shy from bringing that issue to the front. There are countless scenes where characters will rant and rave over thermal currents, ice storms and whatnot and how "we weren't quick enough". Personally, I never believed in global warming, but I did try to keep personal feelings away from judging this film. On the other hand, there was plenty of attempts to turn a real-life debate into multi-gazillion dollar CGI-fest, (which were quite nice, might I add). Marvel at Los Angeles getting torn apart by tornadoes or New York getting hit by a massive flood. Watch the world freeze over and storms pound at the survivors. In fact, you'll have so much fun watching this that it more than makes up for the terrible character and plot development. Yes, a patented Emmerich trademark returns in full-force with more forced "crisis's" involving love and/or family interjected into odd moments. Watch a man walk across a sixth of the nation to locate his son or a love triangle that completely keels over and dies by the half-way point. Sadly, this is the entire last half of the film with poor CGI wolves being the only real action scene worth mentioning during that half. The underutilization of characters is a big problem, as there were literally dozens of characters added at various points that received little or no development and when they would die or "contribute" you felt no emotion.But for what it is, I was glad to see a couple good CGI scenes right away but I do wish they were more spaced out so I didn't have to pace through poor dialogue and underdeveloped or underutilized characters.6.0/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical disaster movie but with a conscience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a typical disaster movie very big on special effects but it does have one thing many movies like the Towering Inferno, Titanic, Armageddon, etc. did not have. It definitely has a conscience about environmental concerns. It does not really seem to offer any solutions about how we could stop the environmental damage that leads to the various disasters that wreck havoc in various cities in the US. The special effects are well worth the price of a ticket and probably would be worth multiple viewings. The acting is about average but there is really not a whole lot actors can do in a typical disaster movie but run and scream from various calamities.It does look like whoever decided which cities to demolish and how has some pent up problems especially with DC and the entertainment industry. These wild child antics are one of the most amusing portions of the movie in the way certain landmarks are dealt with in this disaster movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A simple formula: Pay less for the script and talent = pay more for the effects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was utterly blown away by the special effects in The Day After Tomorrow. I was astonished at how natural and fluid the CGI was in this film. It actually made it difficult to determine what was real and what was created. That being said, this movie is abysmal. The plot is second rate, the subplots were ridiculous, and although the theory behind the fiction was interesting, the execution was laughable. Don't get me started on the acting?The Day After Tomorrow is yet another in a long string of Man Vs. the awesome-power-of-some-incredibly-large-force-that-we-can't-control-or-predict. It is brought to you by Writer, Director, Producer Roland Emmerich (Godzilla, Independence Day, Stargate) who started it all back in 1996 with Independence Day. Back then, we were going to get decimated by aliens. Since then, mankind has faced destruction by two meteors, a perfect storm, more aliens, a virus or two, a large green Monster named Godzilla, abnormally large and voracious insects, two Volcanic eruptions, and the Earth herself. This is a tired plot that should be shelved for more imaginative ones.The plot synopsis is simple: We are consumer pigs that destroyed the Earth without thought to consequence, and now the beast will strike back against us. This time, it does it in the form of a global climate shift that takes place over 24 hours, rather than the scientifically held belief of a few centuries. This climate shift swells the seas with melting polar ice caps, followed by a -200 degree Fahrenheit storm that instantly freezes everything it catches, except for a small group of highschoolers, and a two dudes in a Wendy's.Were there characters in this film? I almost forgot. Jack Hall, played by Dennis Quaid (Cold Creek Manor, Traffic, Frequency), is one of those guys who finds refuge in a Wendy's, while his son, Sam Hall, played by Jake Gyllenhaal (The Good Girl, Bubble Boy, Donnie Darko), is one of the high school students trapped in the New York Central Library. I'm sure there were other stars in this film, but it doesn't matter. You won't remember them anyway. They are just faces that didn't get frozen.What you will remember, however, are the special effects. They are miraculous, at minimum. It is almost impossible to determine where the true filming occurred and where the CGI begins. They will be the industry yardstick by which all future films will be measured.If you have any desire at all to see this film, do not miss it on the big screen. The sound and visual effects will shake you alive. Don't expect to be shaken by the acting talents or plot devices, and try not to laugh at the pathetic dialogue. If you are a nit-picker, stick with ST:NG, you will be bored silly with this script. For the rest of us, enjoy the Special effects.This film deserves a zero, but because the special effects are so incredible, it is getting a 3. That is in no way an indication that this is a good film, but only an indication that they did one hell of a job putting it all together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comical parody of the current administration..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I appreciated the noticeable parodies of the Bush administration, particularly the vice president, and the fictitious presidency in the movie. Our first glimpse of the American government was of the cold, insensitive vice president questioning the value of evidence of the potential environmental dangers, and focusing solely on the overwhelming pricetag this research heeded. How funny was it that the VICE PRESIDENT (who looks like a slim Cheney) actually apologized to the devastated US of A over taking advantage of the natural resources of the earth and acting irresponsibly in considering the future of the environment? As pleasant and ideal as this may seem, we as the American public shouldn't be so foolish to believe (or even hope) that this current administration would ever cut back in the development and exploitation of the earth's natural resources in the name of industry, let alone offer an honest and straightforward apology. I saw the touching speech of the VP (at the time the pres) in this movie as a joke from the movie producers saying, 'yeah right, like you would ever in a million years apologize for the environmental mistakes your policies have created' directly to george and dick. The catastrophic, climatic disasters of this movie are not by any stretch of the imagination the most unrealistic feature of this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't go into "Day After Tomorrow" expecting much, and sadly that prophecy was fulfilled. Independence Day it's not. The effects were as great as expected, but you basically get to see everything worth seeing when you watch the trailer or commercial. There is really no plot to speak of, and what small semblance of plot exists is thinly woven. Climate shift is an interesting concept, but not necessarily made believable by this movie. The acting is so-so, and there are actually a few humorous lines that made the movie worth seeing. All in all, it was worth it just to get out of the house for a while, and it wasn't all bad - it just wasn't all good, either. Basically, I suggest seeing this one as a matinee or wait until video...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>and beat the ever living crap of myself for even considering watching this movie. I was skeptical to see this movie knowing how bad Independence Day and especially Godzilla were, but as a lover of science, I was interested to know the technical details of the script. There were none. This movie is the most implausible movie since Godzilla where the French actually volunteer to clean up after themselves. Even tree huggers would have to admit this will never happen. That aside the good visuals and special effects are completely overshadowed by the lack of a plot or real story. At the end of the movie half of the theatre was asleep. At one point during the film I had to start punching myself in the face, because it was less painful than watching this piece of garbage. Another stinker from Emmerich, who wrote the script as well. Although I doubt this film had a script. The side plots were even more boring. Guy falls in love with girl. Dad rescues estranged son. Someone sticks up for sick boy. Old haired white men don't listen to anyone. I could go on and on. One big, long, boring, piece of crap. I will still be feeling nauseous the day after tomorrow from this movie. Avoid at all cost.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst movies EVER</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew this movie would be bad, unfortunately it was worse than expected. The plot is paper thin: OK, after 150 years of mass fossil fuel consumption, global warming shifts the flow of the gulf stream. This creates a drastic change in the weather patterns and in a matter of days three gigantic hurricane-like snow storms engulf the entire northern hemisphere. Dennis Quaid and Ian Holm play scientists who see the immediate threat that the storms pose and are unable to bring it to the attention of an apathetic White House. About twenty minutes into the film, the storm has begun and the drama that unfolds. These severe storms rip through the world, tearing LA apart with monster tornadoes, burying the Brittish Isles in snow and ice, and flooding New York before turning the 5 boroughs into the world's largest ice cube tray. Amidst all of this chaos, the governments of the world (namely the US) sit on their hands and watch the major urban centers of the world be ripped apart by these horrific storms. Meanwhile, Dennis Quaid's son in the picture, Sam (played by Jake Gyllenhaal of Donnie Darko fame), is trapped in NYC after traveling from DC to compete in a team academic competition, which Sam joined to get to know Laura (played by Mystic River's Emmy Rossum).If you have an attention span of less than two minutes, you have a 50/50 shot of enjoying this movie. There are too many story lines competing for screen time in this movie. None of the characters have any depth, and the plot is thinner than rice paper. The only reason to see this movie is for technical reasons, and even in this respect, the movie is not noteworthy. The CGI isn't anything spectacular, and there weren't even any cute little scientific tidbits which you are generally able to take away from these types of movies which suggests to me that there was more time spent photocopying the script than there was actual research. In the end this movie is nothing more than a thinly-veiled politically oriented movie that take weak shots at the current American government, and even weaker shots at trying to act. Acting: D- Directing: F Visual Effects: C+ Script: F-Average: 0.75 out of 4Seriously, this film made Van Helsing seem Oscar worthy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie could've been great but as usual Roland Emmerich's movies are as always very overrated, his directing is always in neutral, i don't think he knows what he actually wants to make. Most of his movie's get boring during the middle for some period of time e.g. "Independence Day", "Godzilla" (which is totally crap), "Stargate" (i think its his best movie), "Universal Soldier" (which also is a pretty good movie), "The Patriot" (good movie but to slow in the middle). So yea his movies are always out to be Oscar winning movies, but as usual their very overrated. "The Day after Tomorrow" had a good start, the whole concept of the movie was good about global warming &amp; the special effects were all good, but what you see in the trailer is about all you need to see to understand the movie, the rest is just to make it into a feature length film, about a father trying to get to his son. Just because he made a promise to his son. I don't think many people would love this movie. I didn't think that "Independence Day" was even better than this movie, even though i didn't like it that much. I'd give this movie about a 5 / 10, for being a very average movie, which didn't deserve all this advertising.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>there were two specials effects i liked. the capitol records building being torn apart in LA and the water flooding into NY city. that was it. and i saw that in the trailer. well okay Sela Ward and that old guy from the first Lord of the Rings movie who sent the kids off on their quest and wanted the ring too -- that guy. so those two were good and i'd hire them again. so two actors and two special effects were good if that's worth ten bucks to you then go see it.there are way too many subplots with characters you don't care about getting killed that made the audience i was with, well ... they laughed. i think we were supposed to care but we ... well, laughed. the directing was all over the place the cinematography was that silly moving stuff for the entire film. is this a skateboarding video ... even the scenes where they're giving speeches in the board rooms? no. we want to see the room, the setup of the scene, then we want to see the main guy -- unfortunately Dennis Quaid got stuck with the being the main guy in this movie -- then we want to see shots of other people saying stuff and the necessarily reactions we need to understand. not swooping helicopter shots in the freaking boardroom unless it's leading up to somehting interesting. it never does. not even when frost /chases/ the kids into a room in the NY city library. frost? chasing? library? whose idea was that? fire that guy. you couldve at least panned past a No Running sign while they were running and a Quiet Please sign while they were screaming so we could laugh. at least let us laugh. and then timberwolves show up? wolves?? please. fire that guy too. the visual effects guy, the one who i'm guessing was in charge of the capitol records clip and the NY city clip should get another job. those were cool and well done. i'm guessing that's why they picked those shots for the trailer. the editor. the editor of this film is at fault for the weird pacing that never really led up to anything ... except plodding speeches about, spinning animated weather stuff and global warming. yawn. but maybe he was forced to do his job over the weekend in the back of a van or something. i wanna say the editing sucked but i'm willing to give him a break assuming the weekend in a van thing. save your money and spend it on ... something else. ice cream. a ticket to a cool art show. request a song and give a nice tip to the piano bar guy. give a dollar to a disadvantaged soul or ten disadvantaged souls. see some local music somewhere in your town. sit in the dark and crunch peppermint lifesavers because they make that cool blue light when they crunch. do anything but see this movie. it's just dumb and not dumb in a good way like Dumb and Dumber. dumb in just a dumb way. dumb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch it for the CGI, and nothing more.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know what to think about Emmerich, I'm aware of all the negative press he gets and some I think isn't really deserved. I haven't seen Stargate in a decade and can't accurately comment on it, I like ID4 for what it was, Godzilla was wasted potential and I have yet to see the Patriot. The biggest fall that Emmerich had is that his films are VERY impressive from a CGI and action scene standpoint, but suffer horribly in character and plot development. In fact, ID4 turned out so good in my eyes because it had plenty of good CGI and action to make up for the terrible plot. Godzilla failed because all the good stuff was at the beginning while the character and plot carried the last three-quarters of the flick. Now, after so many years out of the Hollywood limelight, Emmerich returns sans-Dean Devlin for another stab at the multi-million dollar summer project. This time, he decides to tread on even more dangerous waters with a global warming flick that is sure to agitate many a scientist. Surprisingly though, the film manages to keep the crap to a minimum.Day After Tomorrow is a global warming themed-flick that doesn't shy from bringing that issue to the front. There are countless scenes where characters will rant and rave over thermal currents, ice storms and whatnot and how "we weren't quick enough". Personally, I never believed in global warming, but I did try to keep personal feelings away from judging this film. On the other hand, there was plenty of attempts to turn a real-life debate into multi-gazillion dollar CGI-fest, (which were quite nice, might I add). Marvel at Los Angeles getting torn apart by tornadoes or New York getting hit by a massive flood. Watch the world freeze over and storms pound at the survivors. In fact, you'll have so much fun watching this that it more than makes up for the terrible character and plot development. Yes, a patented Emmerich trademark returns in full-force with more forced "crisis's" involving love and/or family interjected into odd moments. Watch a man walk across a sixth of the nation to locate his son or a love triangle that completely keels over and dies by the half-way point. Sadly, this is the entire last half of the film with poor CGI wolves being the only real action scene worth mentioning during that half. The underutilization of characters is a big problem, as there were literally dozens of characters added at various points that received little or no development and when they would die or "contribute" you felt no emotion.But for what it is, I was glad to see a couple good CGI scenes right away but I do wish they were more spaced out so I didn't have to pace through poor dialogue and underdeveloped or underutilized characters.6.0/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Independence Day Goes Climactic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The road to celluloid Hell is always paved with good intentions, and The Day After Tomorrow is living proof that this road exists. Mr.Emmerich took a well-intentioned futuristic look from Messrs. Bell and Strieber, tried to squeeze the events which could potentially happen in anywhere from 100 years or more (probably more) and turn them into a thrilling story but instead turned it into something rather aimless and inconsistent. Watching big cities get tormented and trashed seems to have turned into a national pastime (I cite ID4, Deep Impact, ad infinito and nauseum), and I think that Mr. Emmerich believes that he is giving us a well-intentioned look at the "Big Picture", but it gets rather sketchy and loses focus. When I went to see the movie this afternoon, I saw something that I have seen only MAYBE once before. There were people getting up and leaving some time before the end of the movie. There were MANY goofs, such as Mr. Gyllenhaal's use of the payphone: 1. NO central switching office would be operable with the water that was flooding into Manhattan at that time, and 2. With the way the water was flooding in, NO electronic device such as a payphone would be operable fully submerged in water the way that one was depicted. Another equally improbable premise is the way the cast was going around with no gloves on. If the surrounding metal objects were as frozen as the movie made them to be, there would have been LOTS of injuries due to flesh cold-welded to metal. Another inconsistency was the gas burners in the fast food joint that Mr. Quaid and his assistant fell into. If the temperature fell so quickly that gasoline would freeze, then how was his character able to use natural gas? I do realize that Mr. Emmerich meant this as only a fantasy and has allegedly represented it as such, but shouldn't there be a line drawn between good fantasy and total BS?There were two things I did enjoy about the movie, however. I did enjoy the SFX VERY much, very realistic in quite a few ways. And I did enjoy the uplifting tone of the movie that we can ALL pull together and face adversity and near-certain death with dignity and nobility if we choose. Otherwise, lots of high-tech sizzle but no steak.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not going to slate the movie for its scientific merit, or anything like that. Im simply going to state the fact, that i found the last hour of this movie to be rather dull. The first hour and 15 mins (where all the decent special effects were) was the best. The scene where tornadoes rip LA to pieces was both frightening and convincing. The tsunami decimating Manhatten was pretty cool too. However, after all this, the movie lacked any real substance. I fear TDAT tried to be too many different kinds of movie at once. It's trying to be scientific, and make you think, an action movie, and an emotional heart rending movie. Sadly, it did not make me think, and it did not stir any emotions inside me. The casting was superb (Jake Gyllenhaal was seriously underused, but totally hot..). All in all, this movie is worth seeing for the top notch special effects (**SPOILER** - this lacked however during the chase onboard the boat with the timber wolves.. this really wasnt necessary, and you could so badly tell they werent real).

If you actually watch the movie you can see that the tornadoes/tidal waves were done with care, and that's what Emmerich does.The Day After Tomorrow doesn't promise much. It promises great effects and overall a good time. That's what I got for the most part. Of course the story and many moments are cliche (A man cuts his rope when he falls because it's better that the rest of his group goes on without him) and the story did go offbeat at one point to a dumb situation (To save Laura from dying instead of what's going on in the world). The second rate acting is to be expected too. But for a movie that's pretty much style over substance, it works very well.

So all the water that flooded New York then freezes, giving a chance for our characters to do the predictable, and search for medicine so save their friend. Of course stuff happens and they make it back just in time before the city freezes in 5 seconds. And some how the wooden door saves them, even though the building is made of marble or stone.

I couldn't tell if the director was winking or not, but a lot of the "courageous" moments were eliciting a lot of reaction.Whatever its "artistic flaws", it was really fun.

		<fullReview>This movie does wonders to reaffirm one's faith in the stupidity of humankind. I'm not referring to the movie's "message" about how politicians are ignoring the dangers of upsetting the delicate balance of our global climate. I'm talking about the stupidity of every character in the movie, including the "smart" ones. And the stupidity of the people who'll tell you how great the movie is.Even if you accept the rather improbable notion that a phenomenon that only a few people on the planet understand is capable of producing the effects described in the film in a matter of days, it's still full of stuff that's impossible to swallow... unless you figure that everyone involved is an idiot. (spoilers ahead!) Even an LA tourist would have the sense to go for cover when a tornado is bearing down on them. The government of Mexico wouldn't even think about closing their border to a wave of refugees sent by the government of their militarily-superior neighbor to the north. The President of the US wouldn't be the last one to evacuate DC; as a matter of national security he'd be among the first. And so on.I recommend renting the DVD, fast-forwarding through all the parts with human actors, and admiring the disaster scenes. The rest of the movie is a disaster as well, but not as entertaining to look at as the HOLLYWOOD sign being ripped apart or the Statue of Liberty going wading.</fullReview>

I expected to see Gene Hackman and Shelly Winters climb out of the ship that parks in front of the New York Library.

Except for the special effects, there is virtually nothing positive I can say about this film. The dialogue is almost unbearably cheesy, the characters are stale and boring, and the story is laughably thin. The underlying theme of environmentalism is so poorly incorporated into the script that it almost seems like an overwrought afterthought.Normally, I would have been disappointed that such a promising premise should be so overlaid with predictability and similarities to other disaster films. In this case, I was simply angry.</fullReview>

Dennis Quaid once again was a nice touch in the role of the father; and the casting for Pres. and VP will not surprise anyone. I wouldn't dare bash the director if I were anyone who believed in film, but the script writer has got to rethink where he's getting his money.

		<fullReview>This was an okay movie. The CGI effects gets the audience to think of the global warming effect as if it ever happened in present time of an incoming storm that'll return the Earth to a new Ice Age. The one storm that changed the face of the Earth 10,000 years is about to happen again.Climatologist Jack Hall, played by Dennis Quaid, warns the government of the possible storm and the impending doom it'll cause across the globe. While his son Sam, played by Jake Gyllenhall, is in New York, the government heeds his words as the actual disastrous events begin take place.It first begins with the 5-pound hail raining over Japan causing hysteria.In Los Angeles, devastating cyclonic tornadoes decimate Los Angeles causing to wipe the Hollywood sign off the mountainside and rip apart the Empire Records building.Other forces of natural disasters are being reported across the world.Shifts from the Arctic causes fresh water and salt water to mix together that causes the Atlantic Ocean to raise and flood into the streets of Manhattan Island. Sam Hall "Gyllenhall" and friends avoid the menacing wall of water as they run off and into the library for safety.But the worst is yet to come as the eye of the storm freezes the entire upper-half of the United States. Including Washington, DC. The President's motorcade is lost in the storm as they evacuate.As Sam Hall sets off to rescue his son in New York and bring him home safely, its a battle of survival as he endures the freezing chill himself as he goes to save Sam and more survivors.There is humor without a doubt good and hits it at the proper moments in the film. The acting is tolerably great by the performances of Quaid and Gyllenhall. Director Emmerich who gave us Stargate, Godzilla and Independence Day makes the audience "ooh" and "aah".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a card carrying Sierra Club member. If not for the stupid war and the slinking economy Bush's environmental policy would be #1 on my list for why I'd not (and didn't in 2000) vote for him.But this movie stinks of agenda: the dolt Vice President in the film might as well be Dick Cheney: the super storms only occur in the Northern Hemisphere (i.e. the realm of Western Civilization); the glaciers reach down to the 30th degree latitude (the ice reaches down to northern Texas and Florida, and all of Italy) which cannot happen but serves a political argument. Which is really what this film is, a political argument.Emmerich is trying to say that mankind cannot continue on our course of unabated consumption and abuse of the environment we live in; which is true, nature does balance itself with impunity. But how he illustrates it isn't the truth and a total exaggeration. The tornados chewing up L.A.? I guess giant tornados destroying skyscrapers is more memorable than cornfields in Nebraska. Rabid animals? Yes, we get the point Emmerich - nature is kicking butt and taking names. It was the speech at the end about the 3rd World that Emmerich was laying it on the thickest though.A movie like this doesn't help the environmental movement. It twists science, blows things completely out of proportion. It doesn't reach out to the people it needs to reach out to. Environmental aficionados will see this movie and feel somewhat pleased, but everyone else will see it as bordering on the realm of absurdity or silliness and leave the theater feeling entertained (but none the more aware of the problems facing humanity at present) or angry.I give this movie a 6 out of 10 for ambition, special effects (atypical Emmerich destruction fest) and the father/son subplot.</fullReview>

The shock effect is uncompromising and straight forward.So it is more like a surprisingly new type of horror story than a conventional disaster flick. The spicy, alienating atmosphere is maintained until the closing chapter, which is nicely serene and tranquil, since we also know that the brutal climate change is stabilized and has reached a new long-lasting balance. The small personal subplots are of course obligatory stuff to give the whole a human face so that we can relate to the characters and care (not that much really) about them.</fullReview>

Then New York gets whacked and the film goes downhill into I-really-couldn't-care-less territory. To me it seems like Mr.Emmerich is very good at depicting chaos and destruction of cities but seems to lack a lot of skill when it comes to involving real live, talking humans into the story.

But id definitely go see this movie again.BTW on a side note work for the U.S. Geological Society and what you see in the movie would never happen in real life.(POSSIBLE SPOILER) There isn't enough fresh water to melt the WHOLE glacier like it shows. Even if there was somehow(never gonna happen) it wouldn't be that bad with cars flying everywhere and tornado's like that.Global warming isn't going to happen anyways.

The bias towards the left side of politics was seen in every shot, every scene, every other line of dialog, thus making it very funny for me the modern-conservative. Dennis Quaid once again was a nice touch in the role of the father; and the casting for Pres. and VP will not surprise anyone. I wouldn't dare bash the director if I were anyone who believed in film, but the script writer has got to rethink where he's getting his money. If you've got 7 bucks to spare and don't have a very impressionable mind to believe the giant load their feeding you then I'd take the chance and watch a good disaster flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was an okay movie. The CGI effects gets the audience to think of the global warming effect as if it ever happened in present time of an incoming storm that'll return the Earth to a new Ice Age. The one storm that changed the face of the Earth 10,000 years is about to happen again.Climatologist Jack Hall, played by Dennis Quaid, warns the government of the possible storm and the impending doom it'll cause across the globe. While his son Sam, played by Jake Gyllenhall, is in New York, the government heeds his words as the actual disastrous events begin take place.It first begins with the 5-pound hail raining over Japan causing hysteria.In Los Angeles, devastating cyclonic tornadoes decimate Los Angeles causing to wipe the Hollywood sign off the mountainside and rip apart the Empire Records building.Other forces of natural disasters are being reported across the world.Shifts from the Arctic causes fresh water and salt water to mix together that causes the Atlantic Ocean to raise and flood into the streets of Manhattan Island. Sam Hall "Gyllenhall" and friends avoid the menacing wall of water as they run off and into the library for safety.But the worst is yet to come as the eye of the storm freezes the entire upper-half of the United States. Including Washington, DC. The President's motorcade is lost in the storm as they evacuate.As Sam Hall sets off to rescue his son in New York and bring him home safely, its a battle of survival as he endures the freezing chill himself as he goes to save Sam and more survivors.There is humor without a doubt good and hits it at the proper moments in the film. The acting is tolerably great by the performances of Quaid and Gyllenhall. Director Emmerich who gave us Stargate, Godzilla and Independence Day makes the audience "ooh" and "aah".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie does a great job in making nature really look scary. The shock effect is uncompromising and straight forward.So it is more like a surprisingly new type of horror story than a conventional disaster flick. The spicy, alienating atmosphere is maintained until the closing chapter, which is nicely serene and tranquil, since we also know that the brutal climate change is stabilized and has reached a new long-lasting balance. The small personal subplots are of course obligatory stuff to give the whole a human face so that we can relate to the characters and care (not that much really) about them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yet again, another blockbuster that has stolen two hours of my life that I can never get back. I can't believe that with all that money to make a movie, they waste it on a plot like this. Sure there are some decent special effects. Actually not really. Only the one shot of the waves going through Manhattan were cool. The story was so ridiculous. Even if I overlook the fact that the guy walks from Phillie to NY City in a snowstorm, thats right, he walks. Even if I over look that, and a hundred other far fetched events, I can't get over the fact that they had hungry wolves as part of the challenges. Clearly someone with a a tragic case of A.D.D wrote this thing. I can just see them saying, " we have an Ice age,there is a really big snowstorm, the world is going to end, wait just a minute here, we need wolves". Can someone please make a movie for the sole purpose of entertainment and not how much money it's going to make at the box office. Balls.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie was phenomenal. I went to an early afternoon showing today and the theater was half-full. Everyone seemed to have a good time. The special effects were sensational from beginning to end. There was never a dull moment. In fact, that was one of the flaws. It didn't slow down at all so the audience could catch their breath and catch up on the plot intake. Although some of the lines are cheesy, this is an astounding way to kick off the Summer movie season. This is Finding Nemo with weather and a democratic viewpoint. 8/10(This is a direct hit on the government of today as well. You have to be blind to not notice the direct references of Bush and Cheney.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tale of two halves.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once again Roland Emmerich has made a film of two halves just like ID4 and God(awful)zilla. In this film the first half of the movie is great - lots of effects and drama - real edge-of-your-seat stuff and the movie is well paced. Then New York gets whacked and the film goes downhill into I-really-couldn't-care-less territory. To me it seems like Mr.Emmerich is very good at depicting chaos and destruction of cities but seems to lack a lot of skill when it comes to involving real live, talking humans into the story. I'm sure this film will make buckets of cash and I'm sure Mr.Emmerich will make another disaster(ous) movie again, but at least that wont be for a couple of years...phew!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a professional screenwriter/Script Consultant/Author. I have been awaiting the release of "THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW" for months, and it was well worth the wait. This film had it all. The theater was filled to capacity and not once did anyone get out of their seat until the end of the film. Well Done!!!!! A real ride. From the opening scene to the last. There were a few very liberal points that appeared in the plot, but in the end, it was just a great film. Having written and sold screenplays myself, I realize what it takes to get any film made. Watching this film put you in the plot...it was so well written. I have an extensive film collection in our home, and I fully intend to add this film to that collection.</fullReview>

Though certain liberties were taken with the original story the movie over all was very true to the book by Art Bell and Whitley Streiber. The science in the movie is real and should make us all think a little bit. At the same time it does not preach to anyone (except maybe the current administration in D.C.). I waited for 7 months to see this picture, and I was not disappointed at all with this movie. It is a good movie for the entire family as there is no overt violence and little if any foul language.

		<fullReview>I'm a card carrying Sierra Club member. If not for the stupid war and the slinking economy Bush's environmental policy would be #1 on my list for why I'd not (and didn't in 2000) vote for him.But this movie stinks of agenda: the dolt Vice President in the film might as well be Dick Cheney: the super storms only occur in the Northern Hemisphere (i.e. the realm of Western Civilization); the glaciers reach down to the 30th degree latitude (the ice reaches down to northern Texas and Florida, and all of Italy) which cannot happen but serves a political argument. Which is really what this film is, a political argument.Emmerich is trying to say that mankind cannot continue on our course of unabated consumption and abuse of the environment we live in; which is true, nature does balance itself with impunity. But how he illustrates it isn't the truth and a total exaggeration. The tornados chewing up L.A.? I guess giant tornados destroying skyscrapers is more memorable than cornfields in Nebraska. Rabid animals? Yes, we get the point Emmerich - nature is kicking butt and taking names. It was the speech at the end about the 3rd World that Emmerich was laying it on the thickest though.A movie like this doesn't help the environmental movement. It twists science, blows things completely out of proportion. It doesn't reach out to the people it needs to reach out to. Environmental aficionados will see this movie and feel somewhat pleased, but everyone else will see it as bordering on the realm of absurdity or silliness and leave the theater feeling entertained (but none the more aware of the problems facing humanity at present) or angry.I give this movie a 6 out of 10 for ambition, special effects (atypical Emmerich destruction fest) and the father/son subplot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Talk about hype for a movie, I had been excited to see this for months! I had been researching this topic at my University for a project we had to do.While it is true that the information about the Atlantic Conveyor halting 10,000 years ago has been known since the late 1980s, it is only now when we are beginning to witness the effects of Global Warming that people are beginning to take notice. Unfortunately, not enough people seem to care about the factual implications of this very possible event. Although The Day After Tomorrow is VERY dramatized and some of the time lines (ehemm 6 weeks!!) are WAY off, it is an eye catcher of a film and may make people become aware of what has been happening. The producers of the film (if you look at the website you can see this) had created it not just to make profit but to bring this awareness to the public.My only problem is, for those people not interested enough to investigate themselves, it looks just like Independence Day and not something to be taken seriously. Well, frankly, it should be taken seriously. It is important enough for the Pentagon to release a document to Bush telling him he needs to take action. In the document, the authors indicate that Bush should be putting this over the terrorism threat. Personally, if we are possibly facing a global ice age sometime in the next century (which is what the theory predicts) I believe we should be funding alternative energies far more than we are currently. The Day After Tomorrow is not to be taken literally, nor is it to be taken lightly. You're interested, now look up the facts yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, concerning the money they spent on making the picture - I can see where it is. Exciting huge waves and tornadoes, absolutely unbelievable (I don't mean it doesn't look credible, I mean I couldn't imagine it) view of NY under snow, etc. For me it's really scaring because looks much more real then, for instance, meeting a vampire or living dead or something like that. Scientists say this movie is pretty truthful and everything can happen (of course not so fast). If you don't believe, listen weather forecast or watch news about the weather all around the world.Concerning the characters. I was greatly surprised that (SPOILERS!!!) none of the main characters died and all (well... almost all) of them came out of this scrape safe and sound and in love. I'm not saying that makes me sad, but nevertheless I was ready for... you know... for floods of tears on the screen.And I was a little puzzled when nobody of the guys (I mean Sam and his classmate and their new friend) understood what was happening with the girl (what was her name???). So much attention had been paid to their intellect that I wondered why they couldn't find out what's wrong with her. Maybe they hadn't studied anatomy or something like that?All in all, I was impressed by the movie in general, but didn't like some things in the plot. 7 out of 10 and I think Jake Gyllenhaal is lovely. :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Synopsis-Spoiler?) Climatologist Dr. Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) is drilling ice cores in Antarctica when a piece of the Antarctic Ice Shelf the size of Rhode Island breaks off. Jack presents his research to a conference on global warming. Jack found that ten thousand years ago, a global warming changed the earth's climate into the Ice Age. Jack said at the conference, ?that it could happen again in maybe 100 to 1,000 years from now if we don't stop polluting the atmosphere.' At the conference, Jack meets Professor Terry Rapson (Ian Holm) of Scotland, who is keeping track of the world's ocean currents. Terry tells Jack that the melting of the polar ice caps has poured fresh water into the oceans and diluted the salt level, which has caused the temperature of the ocean currents to drop 13 degrees. The world's climate system changes for the worst. Tokyo is hit by softball size hail; it begins to snow in New Delhi; and Los Angeles is destroyed by a group of tornadoes that hit all at the same time. Jack sees the President and gives him the bad news that his estimate of years is now down to days, before we enter a new Ice Age. Jack advises the President to evacuate everybody in the southern states to Mexico, because it is too late to evacuate the people in the northern states. Jack gets a phone call from his son Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal), who has taken up refuge in the Manhattan Public Library. Jack tells him to stay inside and ride out the coming storm, because if you go outside, you will die. Jack heads for New York City to save his son. The special effects are great. You can almost feel that you are there, when the tidal wave hits New York City. One of the very funny scenes is at the just-closed Mexican border, where Americans begin to cut the fence and cross the river into Mexico. The storyline is so fantastic that I hope people won't think this could actually happen. (Twentieth Century Fox, Run time 2:04, Rated PG-13) (7/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Chilling Mess.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the new film `The Day After Tomorrow' a bitter chill will envelope the audience as they realize that they have just spent money to watch one of the worst films in history. This is the reaction that many unsuspecting theatergoers are going to have this Memorial Day weekend as they watch the latest disaster film from Writer/Director/Producer Roland Emerich. Emerich who along with Dean Devlin created such box office phenoms as `Stargate' and' Independence Day' before coming back to earth with the colossal dud `Godzilla'. has crafted a film so utterly devoid of entertainment value it is as barren as the post storm urban landscapes portrayed in the film. The so called story centers around a dramatic change in the earths weather system brought on by global warming due to industrialism run amuck. Workaholic scientist Jack Hall (Dennis Quiad) has been predicting that catastrophic weather changes are coming but his pleas fall on deaf ears especially those of the Vice President who is more concerned with economic advancement than on climate stability. Jack is estranged from his son Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal), as his father seems to have plenty of time to speak to people the world over but has had little time for him and his mother Lucy (Sela Ward), which has lead to a divorce. Sam is heading to New York for a conference and soon becomes trapped in the public library when severe flooding and blizzard conditions arrive. Jack decides that he will brave the elements and trek to New York to rescue his son fueled by guilt over not being there for his son in the past. While it is a nice sentiment, the journey is filled with so many gigantic pauses in credibility and logic that it strains any sort of credibility. My favorite was the weather that is so cold that it can freeze gas lines in a rescue helicopter, but yet does not affect the gas lines at a local fast food location that is buried in snow and caked in a wall of ice. There were also the nice moments of people grasping and holding frozen items in sub zero climates without gloved hands when it was obvious that frostbite aside, they would have stuck to the item in question, especially when this fact was established in an earlier scene. I also liked the pack of escaped zoo wolves that somehow managed to survive the temperatures that flash froze everyone exposed to them and now stalk an abandoned ship as Sam and his friends desperately search for supplies. The scenes of Tornados ravaging Los Angeles and severe flooding and snow in New York are visually impressive, but the characters are so bland that you do not care at all if they live or die. Gyllenhaal is so bland all he does is mug with a blank devoid look and seems incapable of registering any emotion or enthusiasm for his part. Quaid is not much better as it seems like he is delivering his lines in his sleep. You can not blame him as the lines are so bad, that the audience was laughing at them during the scenes of crisis that were supposed to have the audience on the edge. This film is so bad that people were leaving their seats during some of the so-called dramatic sequences some not to return at all. Who can blame them, as I have seen more tension and drama at a knitting demonstration then in the two-hour mess that was this movie. It is a shame as the message of the film is a good one but it is lost amongst the bland characters and painful dialogue. Here is hoping that the day following this films brings better movies, `Spider-Man 2' where are you when we need you most?2 stars out of 5 Gareth Von Kallenbach</fullReview>

The elements that are supposed to do the most breath-taking feelings off the audience is in both movies big, round, up in the sky, works drastically quickly (not really as relevent here as in ID), it's global, calculated just before it's occurance... the converges are numerous. The story is quite lame when it's not focused on the climate changes - basically everyone dies out in the cold, yet the Hero climate researcher ventures on top of hundreds of feet with snow to walk by foot to New York from inland??? COME ON! To say it overall... there is nothing in "Day after tomorrow" that we haven't seen before in one way or another. I can't say it's a bad movie, but... well, more like a cash-in cow movie made by standards. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know maybe this film has it's strong political views but when people come here to read reviews most of them who don't have a chip on their shoulder could care less. Just a note on politics, it's not the democrats or republicans fault, it's because people are more concerned with beating the other one in the ground that they can't work together. Our country is literally in a political civil war and that is why we have problems. Play the blame game all you want, but I have met too many republicans and democrats alike who will hate someone and any ideas they have strictly based on the fact that they are a member of the other party. Alot of people who are very serious about politics (as intelligent as they may be) are some of the most immature people I have seen. It seems to me that the main goal of politics is to destroy the other party rather than work for a better future. Everyone wants to whine and complain about this and that, when the truth is that the democrats and republics both have very smart and capable people, that if they really worked together could get a lot done but instead would rather spend their time talking trash.

		<shortDescription>Until hell freezes over!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Until hell freezes over! Well, some people say New York City is hell, so it's fitting that Roland Emmerich's (`Godzilla,' `Independence Day') `Day After Tomorrow' features the freezing of NYC, and the whole northern hemisphere for that matter, as a result of global warming.This summer's disaster movie begins with an absurd premise about an instantaneous warming that leads to freezing in our lifetime and ends with the not absurd warnings about our planetary abuse of resources and the reliance we will eventually have on those third world nations we so subtly patronize. The satirical brush stroke is broad (The obtuse vice president very much resembles Cheney), and the denouement is the longest in the history of cinema (After the tsunami featured in the trailer, what else for an hour could you do to hold attention?). Climatologist Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid), who warned everyone about the impending disaster, trudges from D.C to New York to be with his stranded son, Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal). It takes him just a bit longer than it would on the Baltimore-Washington Expressway in the non-ice age, so what's the big deal? Nothing! The movie was over already. The subplots like Jack's humanitarian ex-wife doctor (Sela Ward) with a terminal child are tangential and ridiculous against the backdrop of people burning rare manuscripts in the NYC Metro Library just to stay alive. Jack's heroics are pretty funny given he is the only one with the computer program to figure out this climate mess, and he is hiking to NY to see his kid. Don't get me wrong; I loved the opening helicopter shots of Antarctica, the CGI of frozen New York, and the overall warming warning. But when Emmerich inexplicably introduces rogue wolves and drops off the intriguing Ian Holm as a prescient professor in favor of Quaid snow shoeing to NYC, then I'm just disappointed in what could have been. `Poseidon Adventure' is the director's favorite disaster film; there is something universal and memorable there that is not present in `Day After Tomorrow.' If you watch `Meteor,' `Sudden Impact,' or `The Core,' you'll also find the disaster formula disappointingly presented.Yet, I enjoyed the 2 hours. Go figure! It's summertime!</fullReview>

The premise is ridiculous, and made even more ridiculous by ridiculous coincidences and ridiculously cliched situations. Ridiculous!Avoid this movie like the Plague. It had no redeeming features, except the end credits which came not a minute too soon. I'm astonished that I sat through it. Don't even try to yourself.</fullReview>

God knows you don't go to these films for plot, script or performances (there's JUST enough of those to get by. JUST). If they can build enough suspense/tension between the "money shots" then it works.So if you go to it for what it is, and expect nothing more, then you'll be well satisfied.

		<shortDescription>Surprise, surprise!!!(No, really!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forget 'Troy', forget 'Van Helsing' - the main attraction this month is surely 'The Day After Tomorrow'. Low bow to R. Emmerich!With a huge budget, a bunch of great special effects and a mind blowing story this film did turn my expectations around from the very beginning. The main thing first appealing to anyone, who's going to see this movie - the CGIs. The question is - can the special effects be so blinding that the movie makes lots of cash? Van Helsing didn't do it, Troy also didn't succeed for a lot of reasons. What makes this one different? The answer is simple - it makes sense. Surprisingly. Lately Hollywood's attempts to create an intelligent blockbuster have brought nothing apart from lots of money spent on it and never coming back. Well, maybe 'Independence Day', but hey - that one is also Emmerich's baby! Sure, the guy did not do a good job with 'Godzilla' or 'The Patriot', but what makes me happy is - he actually learned from his mistakes and found his balance. The buzz around the movie is huge, but what positively surprises is the fact that this buzz has a reason. And this reason is so good that I can only highly recommend to everyone to go out and see the movie. The 2 hour long film makes you feel like a part of it, like you're there with the citizens of NYC, it's a ride through a good constructed virtual reality. With one bitter fact, that separates this one from any other Emmerich's films or any other movies based on the idea of mankind being in great danger. This can actually happen in the nearest future. And we're the one, who are responsible for it. Maybe this won't happen as fast as it does in the movie, but there is no doubt that it will. Dennis Quaid (Jack Hall) has positively surprised me, making a good come back. The Hollywood underdog - Jake Gyllenhaal finally breaks his rule of not making blockbusters and appears to be a great cast for the role of Sam Hall. Despite all the negative actions in the film it does not lack humor, which is superb. There even is a smooth taste of politics in the movie, which is important in times like these, which is relative both on screen and off. And it doesn't bother. The length of 'Independence Day' with its sometimes bothering talking of 3 hours is cut this time to just two, which move with the speed of the twisters in LA.This is the best movie I've seen so far this year. Go see it. Think about it...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mid-90s throwback, great action (but you'll have watched that in the trailers) and after that a set of slightly 2D human reactions and messages regarding the environment- Great effects, only a so-so film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watched this on UK Preview today, a decent half of it's in the trailer but luckily there's some stuff left to watch afterwards. The money's on the screen along with what little script the actors have to work with.A disaster movie takes us back to the mid-90s though, it's better than Daylight, Deep Impact, Armageddon (easily), though its characters can be accused of lacking dimension like those in Twister. Volcano doesn't even register on the radar, but Dante's Peak had better acting and just the one disaster in a localized area to deal with.Pretty much the best shot in the movie is when the very first proper US disaster scenes finish. The film's very sanitized, there's little death on camera (no time to show it, never mind the certificate) and there's no easy way out for America as shown by the other characters Dennis Quaid is in contact with. There's a minimum of sentiment throughout the film, any other messages are more subtle (like the cute blasted dog has to live). It also seems movies involving NY getting wiped out are now permissible again post-September 11. Showing so few deaths on camera restricted the sentimentality to the lead adult characters and even then, it was muted. As so many characters were UNselfish though, you could have accused the film of being slightly unrealistic but the human reactions to a disaster are understandably random.What you'll either find either more suspenseful or just boring is the human struggle after the great CGI destruction, and then you get some gallows humour and irony and the rest of it's about one quest. Again, the money's on the screen. That's about it though. It was good enough for an empty blockbuster, not as dead-brained as Van Helsing but not as funny either, and a different style of action to Troy. In short, The Day After Tomorrow's a bit of a throwback and a DVD Chapter-stop/Widescreen TV show-off flick. It does have an excellent, simple soundtrack score though.Whilst I enjoyed it, if you have a widescreen TV you could rent it and enjoy it just as much if you've been unfortunate enough to see the trailer(s) where you were stupidly shown far too many of the money shots. It's not crap- just overexposed by its distributor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One HUGE roller-coaster ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having just seen this film (having come out of the cinema), it does take a while to sink in that what you've seen was in fact one HUGE earth shattering disaster movie incorporating every single worldwide catastrophe possible and not just selected scenes from films such as 'Twister', 'Armageddon' and 'Deep Impact' etc etc.All this can feel like one continuous roller-coaster ride whilst watching this film, as one disaster occurs after another and usually on a much larger scale, and this is extremely exhausting to watch. However, if you're looking for an action-packed film that keeps you riveted to the edge of your seat, then this is the one for you, and whilst action flies at you from all directions it cleverly conveys a strong message at the same time.Unlike previous disaster movies, such as 'Independence Day' and 'Godzilla', the events in this movie do portray a realistic (albeit some unbelievable events and close-calls) and shuddering perception of our future world as it continues to be destroyed. Unlike previous disaster movies, such as 'Twister' and 'Earthquake', these events could affect each and every one of us and this makes it even more chilling to watch.The special effects in this movie are amazing; (Spoiler alert) from a tanker steaming through Manhattan to multiple tornadoes wiping out Downtown Hollywood. The characters too are acted well, with brief comic interludes to break up the tension between scenes. I call this the 'aaah' factor as it's nice to see the characters having a 'rest' from the possibility (and contemplation) of death, every once in a while!Being a fan of movies of this genre, I would recommend that everyone should go see this movie; whether you love this type of film, are interested in the effects of global warming on the environment or just want to see what all the fuss is about, this film should be at the top of your must-see list. It is then up to you to decide whether this film appeals to you, but at least you can say that you've seen - 'The Day After Tomorrow.'</fullReview>

Half of the mankind will die by this accident, so why do we watch this with sentences like "What do you want to do with an polar kit in New York ?" - "I will go there".Afterall it's a nice simulation with a long drawn-out family story about rescue within a new ice age.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Day after Tomorrow?I'll start by saying that I was pleasantly surprised. Being an American disaster movie this was always going to be in danger of being a cliché ridden piece of USA propaganda, but it wasn't. Many users are saying its left wing dribble but I wouldn't say that either. Granted the American Idea of left wing might differ from that of Australia's (where I'm from) but I found the story and the dialogue to be reasonable and believable.Some may accuse Jake Gyllenhaal of a stiff performance, but I think it's refreshing to see someone portrait a teenager/young adult the way he did. Instead of some mumbling bag of hormones Jake delivers a character with some depth who that gives thought to things. (Yes, young people do care about more than just drinking and throwing loud parties) I believe his performance was helped by the script. If something didn't need saying, nothing was said. This is a long overdue change from some of the crap lines Hollywood has been churning out. Dennis Quaid gives a faultless and believable performance. I've always been a fan of his and the producer's faith in him is not misplaced.The special effects in this movie made me sit back and think 'This is awesome.' It takes a lot for me to be impressed with effects as we're flooded with them. (excuse the pun) Combine some great CGI and a refreshing down to earth script, and you have a quality production titled 'The Day After Tomorrow.' Overall you could do a lot worse with your time and money, it made me stop and think for a second about what really is important and that itself makes this film a success.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I bet Emmerich and chums thought they had hit the jackpot when they decided to make a film on global warming: the first to do so to my knowledge. And, it is the idea or the notion of these terrible events actually occurring, in our own life times that keep you glued to the screen in this interesting, special effects driven thriller.It really is a tale of two films; the first and the second half. The first half builds up the tension with the use of news reports, political conferences and some amazing special effects (the tornadoes in L.A). It feels like Independence Day, Emmerichs other blockbuster in the way that it cranks up the tension to such a degree that it can only leave you disappointed with the climax. I'm not saying however that the second half, Jack Hall (Quaid) going off to rescue his son (Gyllenhaal), is a load of rubbish but after the engrossing and possibly overlong introduction its a bit of a let down.The recuse mission is to short. There are not enough thrills and spills to make it exciting enough; Jack finds his son to easily and the relationship between Sam (Gyllenhaal) and Laura (Rossum) is not developed enough to be believable.In conclusion we have solid performances all round with no-one particularly excelling in their roles (Rossum is charmingly sweet none the less) and a strong background story (aided by amazing CGI work) coupled with weak human drama. Emmerich's given use another slice of popcorn cinema but like Independence Day its a film of two halves.Bernard L Black gives it: 7/10 for a strong and compelling first and second act supported by jaw dropping CGI storms and tornadoes. The third act just didn't have enough action and the emotional payoff the first two deserved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I saw The Day after Tomorrow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And was it BAD! --- SpoilersThis flick is the one I'd nominate to get the Mystery Science Theater 3000 treatment. The only thing good about it was its politics. It is against Big Oil, The Bush White House (though most of the vitriol is aimed at Cheney), US immigration policy and US treatment of "3rd World" countries.The special effects are cool, but you've seen most of the really good ones in the preview. The "family" at the center of the flick is Dennis Quaid being earnest and unbelievable as a paleo-climatologist who has abandoned his wife and son in pursuit of his career. Sela Ward is his long-suffering wife who is a nurse in a large hospital. This woman cries so often I stopped caring and started laughing. Jake Gyllenhaal (of Donnie Darko fame) is too long in the tooth to play a high school boy suffering through his first crush and the end of the world.Moments of Really Bad Cinema present: The Day after Tomorrow: Fahrenheit Minus 9/11!Listen for the sounds of clanging testicles as Quaid and his two male friends declare: "I'm going out into this world-ending snow storm because I've got more testosterone than brains." "Wait Jack! I too have more testosterone than brains, I'm coming with you." "Listen you to knuckleheads, I too have gallons of testosterone but I'm the only one who can find my ass with both hands and a road map, so I'm coming too!" This "road map" (actually an "advanced GPS" that looked like a gameboy), which is used for dramatic effect in the last few minutes seems unable to tell them when they're ON TOP of a glass roofed structure (Which one of them falls through, of course). You've got "Don't worry about me, I'll just sit here alone, in the dark, with this dying child because I am just so dang nice!" You also have a band of folks who are safe, until they get it through their soon to be frozen skulls that they know better than the leading scientist on the case. Their frozen bodies litter the way for Dad as he tries getting into the oft-destroyed NYC. Poor Ian Holm seems to be there only as a Noble Victim of this grand special effect, I mean storm. By the end of this flick, I felt sorry for just about everybody involved. Then I remembered they probably read the script and thought: ChaCHING! Payday$.If you're into special effects with a ham-fisted script and dopey performances, than this is your movie. If you'd rather have a thought-provoking end-o-the-world flick, check out Donnie Darko: The Director's Cut.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen the movie yet. However, I have read some of the reviews. Plainly this is a movie meant to entertain, yet the conservatives in the audience take this to be a slight against the Bush administration. Thought conservatives weren't sensitive!Any thinking person (conservatives need not apply) would recognize that the issue of global warming is an investigative issue, one worthy of serious consideration. Sure, the movie exaggerates the issue tremendously, but the issue remains relevant, if not for us then for our progeny.Conservatives, relax.

		<fullReview>The Day After Tomorrow is what you'd expect from this director, big expensive shots, big expensive CG and lots of characters. It's not as bad as ID4 due to the fact that there are no "heroes saving the world", just people not dying. It's very preachy and can at times make you wince (did I mention the down-and-out black NY street bum teaching the silver-spoon-in-mouthed white rich kid how to insulate himself with paper?).The CG is almost flawless and I think that's what people really see these movies for, 2 hours of boom, crash, snap, crackle and pop.We need a break from depressing films like 21 Grams and House of Sand and Fog every now and again and it's good to see a movie without $30M USD per movie A-List actors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was one of the most terrifying movies I have ever had the pleasure to view. Stupid people will disagree with my view, but they fail to realize that this could very well happen, and we would be truly helpless. It was based on a book called "The Coming Global Superstorm", and I must say that my interest in such matters has been piqued, so I am on a hunt for this tome. Watching the disasters begin to unfold is nervewracking, especially when one considers how quickly it occurs. This was an excellent movie, though I enjoyed the first half more than the second. However, it maintains a high standard throughout. Also notable was the fact that it centred around one family and how it affected them, as opposed to the world as a whole. Highly recommended: 4/5</fullReview>

TDAT isn't a fun film, it's a quiet serious film, sometimes an action movie, well directed (Emmerich is much better than Michael Bay for demolishing) and,finally, a film about the human being. Of course, there are many more and much better films about human reactions in front of incredible and terrible events, but this one is very exciting. You'll not get disappointed if you go and see this movie expecting spectacular scenes (theeye of the storm is just A-MA-ZING!!), you'll not be disappointed if you wait for some reflexion about our society. Finally, it's a cleverer film than we can expect it, it deserves a good mark. 7/10 while ID4 deserved a 4/10 and Godzilla 3/10.</fullReview>

The science that Day After Tomorrow is based upon is about as good as Silence of the Lamb's movie psychiatry BUT there is truth hidden behind the special effects that will change our lives.There will not be a city-destroying wave wiping out New York -- BUT ocean-front cities WILL have severe floods more often during storms.We won't all starve when our farms are permanently snowed in -- BUT we WILL have trouble reliably growing food as our farmlands become hotter and drier.We are ALREADY seeing more mosquitoes and fewer butterflies because of the warming that has already started.The Atlantic really does have a current that keeps the weather stable. It can change fast for geology -- about as long as our lifespan. Americans are so powerful that each of us can make a difference without even touching politics, or Kyoto. Simple things you and I can do can save us gas money ($2.23/gallon!) and slow the coming of the reality behind The Day After Tomorrow. Search the web, or visit the movie's website to see how simple it is to do our little bit to help. I just hope the effects are worth my $8.50 ticket.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Day After Tomorrow explores the possibility of the world's weather going absolutely mad due to global warming. Cataclysmic events from tornadoes in Los Angeles to New York City freezing over. All of these events and a lot more in the hands of Independence Day and The Patriot director Roland Emmerich. Dennis Quaid is Jack Hall, a climatologist who predicts dire consequences as a result of global warming leads the cast. At first only a few people believe him but as events he predicted slowly become reality many rue that they ignored his calls for action. Also starring Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie Darko, Moonlight Mile) as Hall's son Sam who is trapped in New York after an academic competition, Sela Ward (Once and Again) as Hall's wife Lucy and Ian Holm (Lord of the Rings) as fellow climatologist Terry Rapson. Well there has been a lot of news about this movie in the last few weeks leading up to it's opening. You know all this talk of politics, the Third World, the Kyoto Protocol, and other related issues. The whole Left Wing movie issue. Well I'm going to make it clear right here, that I would try my best to limit commenting on such issues, especially on whether or not any of this can actually happen.The primary thing that really attracted me to this film was the special effects as shown in the trailers. That great shot of a frozen New York was absolutely breathtaking. I got to say the effects were really great! What can you really expect they did spent millions of dollars just to make events as realistic as possible? Most of the effects in the scenes were well done and the level of detail in them was great.I however found the plot line rather lacking in substance. It was quite shallow to be honest. Placed in there so that they can put in a human element in all this destruction. In movies such as this, the director would try to let you feel pity for the characters in the story. In this aspect I felt the movie failed and that perhaps it could have been done better. There were the occasional humorous moments but it felt a little out of place. The ending also was quite a letdown rather anticlimactic in fact. It just felt lacking and that things happened way too fast. Perhaps another 20-25 minutes should have been added.In terms of the performances by the actors, I felt that they never really had the opportunity to show the level of their acting. In a way the effects eclipsed all of the characters. No doubt the effects of this film were really great and perhaps is the main strength of the film. I just had hoped that the storyline would have been better crafted so that instead of the effects taking center stage than it would be mankind's bravery, determination generosity and that would.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's big, epic CGI disaster stuff. A good old fashioned popcorn movie. It will probably get you talking about global warming and all, and some capitalists will happily rubbish the movie and continue to think that pollution has no consequences at all. It's Hollywood, and a movie covering hundreds or even thousands of years would be dull, so let's change the world in 7 days instead.Being Australian, I object to the characterisation that I come from a 3rd world country, and the film panders to the laughably egocentric view that if the USA fails, then civilization has been destroyed. But then we're all used to that!Best wave ever!! And whilst the CGI is the star, the acting is good enough for you to care what happens to the characters. There is a good recognisable support cast that keeps you guessing about which ones will meet a gruesome end. I was hoping to see propeller guy in this one (the CG stunt hero from such films as Titanic and Return of the King - best fall guy ever!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ouch ..! worse &amp; better than we thought it'd be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As You would expect a spectacular movie that You can afterwards just call "cheezy and cheep" you can really be surprised, cause this movie is neat and serious - and amazing in both ways (positive-negative). You can simply throw out your old skills of disaster -movies, it is not any more a bruncha black &amp; white guys that warn everybody, and later save a lot of people and in the end save the world .. It's not anymore the old routine that in the beginning you see a miserable death (like in Volcano) as a DEMO, and later they dance on the edge of the blade i.e. run on thin ice, but in the end nice and happy people can burst their champagne out of the bottle at the headquarter .. No, it's not that .. Also, it's not that kinda "scenario", in which you see big movie - that would prevent you from ever taking it seriously that the movie was about.. This movie is made in a very clear cut way, there's no blur about Kyoto, or the Gulf Stream, or the melting Ice, and the canoe situation about our climate, that now it's bouncing but once (pretty soon) it can flop over and that cold be fatal. There's no smudge in the view of how a possible ice-age would hit - I mean thru centuries, years, months - or just days .. all in all it gives you a pretty clear view on what is possible to happen - due to being absent from Kyoto. This scientific sharpness gave the right for Roland Emmerich and Jeffrey Nachmanoff to deal with this subject and this sharpness also makes the movie's way really high up to the greatest films like Terminator 1-2. and Titanic.There could have been very cheesy scenes and very blurry messages and very cheap dramas but it turned out just as the total opposite. It is an amazing movie - with a very serious content. I mean the movie NET was also serious, and the Insider also. But this one is just - I mean it opens a total new culture right now ..The only thing that is ever smooth &amp; cheezy in this movie is that in this plot the White House is the last to find out about what's happening and US has to ask favor from (former) 3rd world countries .. I mean what if White House finds out (as they already did) about this threat? Will they go to Kyoto and cut down exhaust fumes? Or just find some new home like the American Indians'. I mean just or unjust we are speaking of the military superpower that can take down whole countries if they want. So, I mean, if someone finds it cheezy that US finds out last about Ice age in this movie should consider buying ticket for other genre - like war :(Armageddon or Independence Day or Volcano and the Core are very weak but could be called "nice" or funny movies, but the Day After Tomorrow is a great cutting edge film. It is just much better than you possibly would have expected. But that thing that happens in it is just way worse.</fullReview>

It's not supposed to be political at all. That's like saying every futuristic movie based off the premise that earth is being destroyed because we didn't recycle or take care of it or conserve is left-wing. It's just an excuse for some cool stuff to happen. Furthermore, it's an excellent movie to go to if you plan to see Jake Gyllenhaal and James Quaid, who offer some eye candy for old and young women alike. This should promise to be as fun to watch as Independence Day. We don't see movies like Day after Tomorrow because they deserve Oscars, have phenomenal acting, or mindblowing plots. And it certainly isn't an extension of the so-called liberal media invading movie theaters. It's just an enjoyable action flick. So forget about Michael Moore, kick back, munch on some popcorn, and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A by-the-book Hollywood blockbuster, but what a book it is!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems any new slight development in technology is an excuse to bash out another special effects extravaganza. Of course, this depends on your perspective. Don't we go to the cinema to be entertained? If the answer is yes, then only seriously jaded movie-goers will get nothing out of this film. It's a by-the-book Hollywood blockbuster, but what a book it is!Human's neglect of their environment has led to excessive greenhouse gas emissions and consequently an increase in global temperatures which in turn has caused a huge mass of ice to break off an antarctic ice shelf. Curiously, this huge addition of fresh water into the salt-water oceans causes a 'salinity crisis'. This, combined with something to do with the warming of the North Atlantic current, is the basis for the following superstorm, the likes of which hasn't occurred for 10,000 years. Did I say it will also cause a new ice age?I'm loathe to describe more of the plot for fear of ruining the remaining shred of unpredictability. Roland Emmerich (Stargate, Independence Day, Godzilla, The Patriot) has always been attracted to matters on a global scale, and it doesn't get much bigger than this. There are actors somewhere in this film but their performances are thoroughly predictable and unremarkable - though Dennis Quaid is likable but Jake Gyllenhaal is still Donnie Darko to me. Anyway, as in most of Emmerich's films, the actors play a back seat to the incredible visual effects. They are simply stunning. The concept of a huge tidal wave sweeping through downtown Manhatten (as seen in the trailer) was quite surreal to me, and seeing it realized on screen was just amazing. The SFX bar has been raised slightly yet again.There are several needless subplots to add complexity and perhaps longevity to the story, and the action blockbuster 'formula' is all too apparent, although there were a couple of surprises, however unrealistic. Weather enthusiasts should take extra care not to read too much into the details. However, there are some valid points raised in the film despite the fact that they are used primarily to set up the action. Like Independence Day and Godzilla, most of the joy comes from the thrill of anticipation and watching the impending disaster unfold. In simple terms, the first half is better than the second.I love a good brainbender, but I must also admit to a passion for just this sort of brainless eye candy! What you see in the trailer is pretty much what you get from the film. Expect rocket science and you'll be bored. Expect another typical exciting huge Emmerich effects flick and you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>--SPOILERS AHEAD: YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED-- Steady on everyone! If people are going to complain because their part of the world wasn't in the film then where does this end? I don't recall George Lucas being berated because no Jawas were in The Empire Strikes Back. What purpose would it have served to feature endless landmarks from around the globe? It wouldn't have made this piece of nonsense any better, so get a grip. Having said that, some of the film does take place near where I live so maybe I am biased. It's refreshing to hear Scotland used in a movie context without Mike Myers hamming it up....Anyway as we all know, the rest of the world don't solve problems when trouble faces the Earth, Americans do. But, in fairness to the film makers, they don't solve this particular problem, they just deal with it. In fact, it's the other countries in the world who help out in the end. But I stray from my point.So, the film is a bit rubbish. Big deal. Amazingly they manage to kill off the Royal Family with not much comment on it. It was quite subtle which, for a film like this, was pretty astounding. Apart from that, if you've seen the trailer then that's about the whole film right there. People have been praising the FX but do not be fooled. Independence Day and Deep Impact/Armageddon have not really been bettered by this film, merely matched. A lot of it is too CG, the wolves for instance. They were so fake that I wondered why they bothered at all.Although the script wasn't engaging, at least there were no gung ho speeches and jingoistic sentiments. Compared with Van Helsing, it was flippin' Shakespeare. The acting was fairly tedious with only Ian Holm really convincing, again though, compared to the recent Jackman FX-fest, it was Oscar-worthy.My one big gripe about the film is the ship that sails perfectly down 5th Avenue. It was unmanned and conveniently ground to a halt outside the library. How did it get there without some pretty special steering. Anyone familiar with NYC will know it could not have come up form the harbour area as 5th stops in lower Manhattan. Try to tell me the wave washed it in? It was barely damaged! It's almost as ridiculous as a computer virus from Earth infecting an alien spaceship....almost.Still, I went thinking it was going to be awful and was surprised. It's bad but not that bad, don't get too excited by it. Get someone to take you and then laugh at them for paying.Lastly, why did they call it THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW? The film takes place over a series of days, the storms hits at various different points and times. So for some people the day in question was pretty normal. Nobody agrees to meet on that day, no reference is made to it either. They should have called it, "The Storm That Wouldn't Quit" or "Weather Day" or "Donnie Darko 2: This Time it's Meteorological" or......</fullReview>

I actually read the book based on this film, and considered it to be a nice roller coaster ride, and little more, though it did cause me to think a little bit. That being said, here are a few salient points that need to be considered:Regardless of your belief/disbelief in the theory of global warming, there are other reasons to look for alternative fuels:1) There are finite reserves of oil in the world. Eventually, it's gonna run out.2) Most of the OPEC nations treat their people worse than many of us treat stray animals, and their people don't like us.3) By being dependent on oil, we face the problem and risk of being too dependent on a few other nations, and what happens if they shut off the oil?Look in your history books. It was called the OPEC embargo, and it caused both rampant inflation and massive job losses.4) Burning fossil fuels aren't exactly going to make the air more breathable. If you don't believe me, go to LA on a bad smog day.If the environmental lobby would focus on these points instead of esoteric scientific data that the average person neither knows about nor could understand, they'd be a lot more successful. But regardless of all of this, it's a movie. It's entertainment. If you like it, fine. If you don't, fine. Everyone has different tastes in everything, and that's one of the things that keep are society interesting. Just don't give me your inane, boring prattle about how this supports or contradicts your world view, because that's really not at all what this movie is about. As for me, I'll grab the gallon bucket of popcorn and a nice, large soda, sit back, and enjoy the show, and advise those of you interested in seeing the movie to do the same.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, if somewhat empty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw this yesterday at a media screening over here. It was almost as notable for the laughter breaking out at completely inappropriate times as for the action on screen.The idea of the world being embraced in a new ice age due to global warming is an interesting one, a pity then it seems that global disasters only ever happen in the USA. Add a pinch of mawkish feel-good characters and setups (the sick kid in hospital, the self sacrificing doctor) and a dash of over the top movie physics, and the result is a typical Hollywood blockbuster with little bearing on reality.Not to say it wasn't thoroughly enjoyable mind you, just that if you go in expecting anything other than a heavy hand teaching that climate change = bad, you are sorely mistaken.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Emmerich movie I've seen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed Independence Day and Godzilla - the only Emmerich movies I have seen. This one was even better.We have seen the trailers I don't know how many times and I was afraid that there would be nothing more to see in the actual film. I was wrong. There is a lot more.The suspense builds up nicely, the special effects are great and what you see is truly spectacular.In movies like this it often happens that the effects become the main thing and that the characters aren't developed. This was not the case with this movie. We get to know main characters and we care about them.Another positive point about Day After Tomorrow: it has no violence, no sex and no foul language and is still very enjoyable.I have a feeling this is going to be a big box office hit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of this year's best comedies!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** WARNING - This review may spoil your enjoyment of the film...***...although I doubt it!I remember laughing through most of Independence Day, so didn't hold out much hope for this latest Emmerich blockbuster... I'm glad I don't have high hopes.The sentiments of this movie are entirely laudable, which is probably why actors such as Ian Holm and Dennis Quaid signed up. Essentially, the world is consuming too many fossil fuels, so creating a major climactic shift, endangering the future of the planet.Tremendous special effects ensue, as you would expect - however, it's a pity that they didn't allocate a bit of the CGI budget to a good script-writer. I'm sure that most Americans were whooping at the end, but for anyone else, this film is just pure comedy. At the screening I went to, most of the audience were in hysterics at the cliche-dripping lines that many of the characters have to deliver.In addition, the film is full of pointless one-dimensional characters, such as the cranky, reactionary Vice President, the sick kid in need of help, the nerdy student, stock-looking hero's wife (who is actually a doctor to give her some depth)... the list is endless.To add insult to injury, this climactic shift only seemed to be happening to America, however hard they tried to make us believe that England and Scotland, Europe and Japan were also being affected. Cue images of affected 'landmarks' such as Statue Of Liberty, Chrysler Building, Hollywood...Thank god, they didn't get Dennis Quaid to try and send the Shuttle up to solve the problem, although I bet Emmerich considered the idea, given that a satellite always happens to be over the right part of Earth to deliver images to Houston - strange that.Undoubtedly this will rack up huge box-office receipts, but even for a Hollywood blockbuster this has a cheese quotient bigger than the Cheddar Gorge.Feel free to go and line Roland Emmerich's pockets further, but don't say you weren't warned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Roland Emmerich, the Master of Desaster is back. After dead soldiers, Egyt-Aliens, merciless invasions of the third kind and giant-green-monsters, this time the whole northern hemisphere is to be destroyed ... and no one will stop it.Is the scenario of another iceage truly fictional? The danger is more real than one might think, even if we still got hundreds of years and the climatic chances wouldn't be that drastical, this may happen one day.Even the movie has its small little hidden messages, it is still what it should be: damn good entertainment. The forces of nature threatens you, the struggle of survival thrills you, the drama on the streets warms your heart and a few moments still brings you to laugh (for example (small spoiler!) the mexican close their border due to the americans flee into the south). Oh, and don't forget the small little lovestory.The cast is this time not as famous, but still does a great job. Dennis Quaid in the lead, Jake Gyllenhaal proves that he can do more than just talking to giant rabbits, with the allays great Ian Holm and the sweet newcomer Emmy Rossum.This time Emmerich focused just on a small bunch of people, which was definetly a wise doing. Because of that the story seems not as much constructed as in ID4.The effects look breathtaking, you have charackters you feel for and even the movie is quite dark, there is a glimpse of light at the end. To cut a long story short: if you liked Stargate and ID4 you won't be dissapointed. This cool movie will sweep you away...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>POLITICALLY LEFT WING B-GRADE SCRIPT</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** Review Contain Spoilers (and a Personal Opinion) ***There are some awesome and realistic special effects in the first half of this movie. The second half is much slower. It's as though the studio had suddenly ran out of cash for further SFX enhancement. The story and the characters were rigidly constructed. Jake Gyllenhaal lacks charisma in a pivotal role.Sadly, this movie is nothing more than a common Hollywoodized "moral to the story" film that should rank no higher than a B-Grade TV feature. Instead of making a politically preachy film, it could have been better played as simply an entertaining action feature.The political message this script preaches:* USA is to be blamed because it did not adhere to the Kyoto Protocol over Greenhouse Gas Emissions. Global warming somehow brings an instant Ice Age. Climate disaster cometh. Yeah, take off your thinking caps for the duration.* Third World Countries will save Western Nations by allowing a flood of Westerners to emigrate to their territories when an Ice Age cometh. Yeah, right.The End. The world survives and we have learnt half a politically green lesson from Mr Emmerich.I'm all for a safer and better environment but Mr Emmerich offered no economic solutions other than encourage mindless sociopaths who are hell-bent on creating riots and violence against police officers on duty. He should find a solution we can all work with.I'm not American but I find majority of left-wing messages embarrassing for any audiences to have to put up with constantly.Should you see this movie? I suppose it has great special effects. Just turn off your mind for a couple of hours. 5/10 (ratings lifted due to SFX).</fullReview>

If you like Emmerich's style you will love it, if you hate Emmerich, you will not find anything new. Tornados and Waves, and Special Effects in general are top notch. It's really fun to watch. Scenes, where Americans want to travel to Mexico, and they close the borders, are very ironic!!! The movie has not so much Pathos, as ID4 had. Heroism is there but nicely done by Dennis Quaid. Ingredients are the same as in every Emmerich-Action-Movie. I rate the movie 5 out of 6 (8 out of 10 in IMDB).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Day After Tomorrow is a visually impressive film and if you forgive the somewhat hokey plot is extremely entertaining. To really enjoy the film you do have to suspend belief as there are a number of highly unrealistic scenes. This film isn't about accurately portraying global warming themes, it's a disaster movie and it's about pure entertainment and on that basis this film scores highly. There are a number of memorable scenes which gives this a high re-watch value. The destruction scenes in particular are hugely impressive.Dennis Quaid makes a charismatic lead and there is good support from a strong cast including a nice cameo from Ian Holm. In my opinion this is one of the best disaster films ever made and nothing less than entertaining from start to finish.</fullReview>

Amazing visual effects cannot begin to save this ridiculous movie from the heavy-handed, transparent political messages, ridiculous, scientifically impossible weather events, the lack of concern for the laws of physics, the "America sucks and is getting what it deserves" mentality, or the smarmy, over-emotional, sappy, melodramatic acting.

		<fullReview>This movie shows to go you just what can happen if you use too much fossil fuel. The ice core showed them that millions of years age the dinosaurs used way too much fossil fuel and now they are fossils. Anyway global warming causes global cooling, at least according to the movie. So save up your old unwanted tax law books so you can use them in the fire place to keep warm. And while you are at it you may want to stay out of New York. The movie is worth watching but I would not give it much credence as far as science goes. That was all I wanted to say but it was not enough so I will go on. If you ever need antibiotics a good place to find them are on a near by Russian ship. One thing that you have to remember about Russian ships is to look out for the dogs. Those Russians have some pretty mean and hungry dogs. Who knew they would take them aboard ships. I do know in Russia dogs ride the trains so apparently they ride ships too. Maybe they just come aboard the ship when nobody is looking. If you need show shoes you can make them out of chair backs with cane in them. You pick them up at the library. Now if you are crossing a building with your heavy sled don't cross one with a glass roof. I would question the wisdom of getting on a glass roof at all. It is best to just say off of them.

		<fullReview>I loved this movie until the end when the newly promoted VP concludes that the natural disaster was somehow caused by depleted natural resources. This is a tremendous leap of logic (definitely not science) that is unsubstantiated even within the fictional movie - or anywhere else. Clearly this was someone's political agenda, which serves to discredit the VP character, makes the U.S. appear even more foolish (than for just ignoring the real science), and detracts from the fact that such a disaster is truly possible regardless of any environmental efforts that any national population may implement. It's a just a shame that a perfectly good movie was so obviously stretched to further someone's political agenda. Otherwise, it's a great movie - definitely worth seeing! Quaid and Gyllenhaal are terrific!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Day After Tomorrow: review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Day After Tomorrow (2004), directed by Roland Emmerich, featuring Dennis Quaid and Jake Gyllenhaal.What did you think ? You thought we could keep taking advantage of the earth without suffering the consequences ? The human being is currently considered as the biggest predator on earth but now the earth is waking up and it's ready to unleash its power against us. We're now on the cusp of significant climate changes... This is what the paleoclimatologist Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) is trying to convince the country of. Indeed, on an expedition in Antarctica, while he and his colleagues were extracting some icecaps out of the ice, the shelf broke off. The ice is melting and the see level is rising faster and faster every day, the climate is dangerously changing and the security of the northern hemisphere is at stake. It is time to react and advise the world of his findings but the Vice President and the diplomats of the United States won't take it seriously. However, Professor Terry Rapson believes in him and informs him of disruptions in the North Atlantic current. Countdown just got started, across the world violent weather is causing many catastrophes: hurricanes, storms, hailstones (big like baseballs), deluges and floods are making more and more disasters. This movie is specially concentrated on Jack's son, Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) who's stuck in Manhattan where the weather is getting violent. People die in the streets because of the cold. As the storm is increasingly getting worse, a huge wave hits Manhattan. Sam and his friends are waiting for relief in the New York library, burning books to try to keep warm despite the freezing weather. Whereas the government is trying to evacuate the people who can still be saved, Jack Hall decides to rescue his son in Manhattan... Jack knows that they've just entered in a new ice age, but the love for his son is stronger than any storm. Will they survive ? I really appreciated this movie, especially the special effects, which are amazingly realistic! When I watched the movie at the movie theater, I really felt like I was in the movie and I even put my jacket on because I felt cold. I really advise you to watch this movie because it makes you think of what would happen in many years if we keep destroying our planet. More over it's a well- balanced mix of action, science-fiction, romance and suspense. So, I hope I convinced you and I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who'd like to watch a movie that will make you go through stress, amazement and suspense...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scientifically accurate it may not be, but it would take a certain kind of Scrooge to dismiss it simply on those terms. The first half delivers some awesome set-pieces of city-wide destruction. Tornadoes, floods, a new ice age, it delivers whole-heartedly on the visual front.After the FX set-pieces have finished, the film winds down into a frankly less interesting, and clichéd survival drama, with Dennis Quaid and friends snow-shoeing their way to New York to rescue Dennis' son, Jake Gyllenhaal.Uneven, but good entertainment for a slow evening.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very good Film!.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film surprised me i thought it was very entertaining and Action packed and the Acting from Dennis Quaid and Jake Gyllenhaal was great!. the rest of the cast did fine but in my opinion Dennis and Jake were the best two Actors out of the lot. The film is about a Paleoclimatologist named Jack Hall played be Dennis,and in Antarctica him and his team find out that a huge ice sheet has sheared off. At first Jack hall and his team didn't realise the danger they were in but latter on in the film Jack hall discovers there will be a massive climate shift that will effect the world population. This film felt very real in my opinion and i never found it boring because so many things were happening. This film was so exciting and intense that it kept me on the edge of my seat!. this is definitely a very good looking film and i thought the special effects were really good!. I felt like all the water and the tornadoes were real! that's how good the effects were!. this is definitely a very fast paced involving film that never seems to have a dull moment and the director Roland Emmerich did a great job directing this film!. what i also liked about this film were the characters i thought all of the characters were very likable except for one or two,and i also thought there was some good character development of allot of the people and i really like that in a film because it makes the people seem more real and believable not just cardboard cut-out people. I thought Dennis Quaid did a great job playing the role of the father he seemed quite believable as a dad in the film and i really liked his character and i thought he was very brave because he risked his own life to save his son and his friends,and that alone makes him very likable to start with,which is pretty much how he was from the beginning of the movie,so i had no problem with his character at all,i thought he was a great Paleoclimatologist and he was very smart! and he had Guts!. he was definitely one of the coolest characters in the whole movie. This film has a few problems which is why i gave it a 9 instead of a 10 but those problems didn't bother me much and the special effects and Dark atmosphere the film has more than made up for it which is why i gave this film a high score,it deserves it. throughout the film the viewers get the feeling of dread and forbidding and i love that in a movie! because it makes the movie more intense and it makes you feel like your in the movie.I also cared about all of the characters and wanted them to live. i thought this film was very dark and atmospheric and sometimes quite suspenseful and the suspense builds up very well until it reaches the climax to the disaster that occurs with the storm and tidal waves,and you feel sorry for the people when the waves come and flood the city. this film was very visually stunning as well as intense and the music that's played during the Disaster scenes is very good,it gave the film a creepy vibe and feeling of dread which works very well,so i can safely say this film is very good! and its nothing short of Amazing. the film just works well and does everything right in my opinion and is one of my favourite Disaster films!.</fullReview>

On the surface, this movie is a ridiculous, shallow, predictable, intelligence-insulting, time-wasting pile of crap. However, I believe there is a deeper meaning in his series of stinkers. Roland Emmerich is warning of the degeneration of our societies by the success of his movies. His movies symbolize the politicians we have chosen. While the citizens of our great democracies lie complacent, the politicians are looting the wealth from underneath us (like his movies have looted us of our valuable time and money).Roland Emmerich is telling us to wake up and destroy the status quo! I only hope that he continues his campaign of enlightenment, so we can enjoy a better future.</fullReview>

Okay, so it isn't exactly particularly realistic, but it's a movie not real life so it doesn't have to be realistic. You couldn't call Avatar or Lord Of The Rings realistic either. Dennis Quaid is superb in the role of Jack Hall and Jake Gyllenhaal makes a pretty decent Sam. The special effects are excellent and really blend together, so while the science may not make sense on screen it looks brilliant. There are definitely better movies out there - but for a disaster movie it's absolutely fantastic. If you like disaster movies it's definitely worth a watch - but if you just want to pick apart every movie you see for not being realistic then this is not for you.</fullReview>

The scenario is ludicrous, that is, that a freeze-up overnight can never happen spontaneous, caused by such a thing like 'global heating' or to much CO2 through combustion of fossil fuels.A more likely scenario is that the overnight freeze-up can be the result of a climate war, where a foreign continent is aiming their HAARP or other alike technology at North America. If such warfare technology exists, we should of course all be prepared for the worst. This movie does a great thing in preparing its audience for such attacks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, there are gaps, holes and lack of force in the supporting actors. I think the problem with this movie is trying to link trivial human stories with a mayor and large scale world catastrophe. But even so, for me this is not a "just for fun movie"; I saw many European movies with worst production, poor photography and with very bad and confusing endings than this movie. This is not a documentary so expect serious technical data is a mistake; it is just a movie of 123 minutes....To me there is a reflection inside this, we all are experiencing on daily basis changes in our local weather and also in the world climate as many scientists could say. Nobody knows exactly what is happening out there, if it is just a large scale cycle or just a season of adjustment. But there is enough information to rethink our life style and to change this imposed system of life, to make an effort to low the issue of hibernation gases...To me it is a good enough movie to see and to try to think at the bottom-line theme.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After 8 years since Independence Day came out, Roland Emmerich directs this stunning action-disaster movie, The Day After Tomorrow. It stars Dennis Quaid, Jake Gyllenhaal, Emmy Rossum, etc. Quaid played Jack Hall, the climatologist in the arctic who discovers ice core samples on the Larsen Ice Shelf. They do believe the Northern Hemisphere is making its way to a new ice age. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Sam Hall, and Emmy Rossum plays Laura Chapman, his best friend, A few days later, the storm has just began to rise, with tornadoes in Los Angeles and a tidal wave hits New York City, and they all need to survive. After a few days later, the city begins to freeze, and everyone's in panic, so its him and the gang trying to restore the temperature in time before it's too late.I like Roland Emmerich's movies, like Independence Day, Godzilla, The Day After Tomorrow, The Patriot, etc. the one I never saw was 10,000 BC, but I'm not interested into those movies, but the one I've been really waiting for is the film 2012!!!! Now that's going to be the ultimate disaster movie!!! The special effects in this were great, amazing work on the disaster elements, and I was so impressed that they did good with this.This movie is another must see, you will not be disappointed.

The next second they manage to get inside the library and get up the stairs before the water hit the building. How is that possible? That doesn't make sense. But the effects of the movie are just too good. It was exciting and fun. I did enjoy the ride. Plus, plus. OK it just that good. Compare to 2012, it is better. I have to fill out ten lines, so I like the girl. She is pretty. The wolves looks scary. The tornado, so good! So nice. Hope 2012 can be better.The movie is just so good. After watch the movie, I feel bad about what human did. Just like in the movie "Matrix." It tells us that us human, are just like virus. We eat and use all the resource and energy we can find. Once we done with one planet, we move to another planet. We are the bad guys! That's the reason why the machine want to control us and stop us from over populate the planet.

		<fullReview>Like i said stunning effects, mind blowing in that case. And surely the terrifying truth of what is to come. Going to see this movie i was not expecting much. I watched it the first time a couple of years back but didn't enjoy it that much. But previously i gave it another chance and realised what i have missed with my very own eyes. My first impression of the movie was just simply quite boring, i thought it would be more of a documentary type than a movie with a well written script and cool effects. I was far wrong, it's more both of them combined, an amazing movie definitely. But still get's many facts in about what could happen if what we do carries on.The day after tomorrow will stun everyone in there minds and eyes. Again the visuals of the special effects were tremendous, everything to the water and some what ice age! Looked real and live. The movie how ever was not really focused on the plot "A climatologist tries to figure out a way to save the world from abrupt global warming. He must get to his young son in New York, which is being taken over by a new ice age" Yes an ice age does occur at one point, but climate change and "Global warming" is expressed in all it's forms and shows the viewers the threat of mother nature. Expect to see the most threatening weather condition and un imaginable truth of what the earth can offer. The acting was flawless Jake Gyllenhaal (Sam Hall) was brilliant and made everything look that much more real, the rest of the cast were good too. The script was witty and clever, very decent. Roland Emmerich (director) knew exactly what he was doing and certainly hit's the mark, most of the scenes really work and are well put together. He also write the script, very impressive from a slightly little league movie director. Well done to him.Overall the movie is just plain fun and cool to watch, some cool effects along with entertaining drama and impressive idea of mixing a real global threat with a movie, i think the aim of the movie is too reach out to people and have them realise what could possibly happen to either this or more likely the next generation. A true underrated film, a fun and a edge of your seat exciting adventure film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe I was in the mood to suspend my disbelief but I actually enjoyed this spectacle. And a spectacle is what it is.I don't really understand the indignant reviewers who claim it is full of scientific inaccuracies and plot holes. It's an entertainment. It takes liberties. It comes with the territory.I agree, the human interest aspect could've been less hokey but no way is the script as corny and schmaltz-laden as the truly terrible Independence Day.I expected the worst and was pleasantly surprised. An enjoyable enough Saturday evening's entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many other reviewers have pointed out the obvious flaws of this movie (the lack of character development, and story line) but I think if you just sit back and watch this movie for what it is you will be surprised. I have come to like this movie very much, and worthy of watching more than once. The scenery throughout much of the movie is beautiful, and the acting is well done by the actors with what they were giving. The main characters are all likable, and there is nothing overly objectionable to this movie. It's a simply made movie, with very good special effects. I would even go and say it may be a decent family movie for the older children (13 and up). So I would say definitely give this movie a chance and maybe a 2nd look too. I found that I enjoyed it far more the 2nd and 3rd time around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Giving Global Warming the Cold Shoulder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Global Warming is accelerated to incredible levels, propelling the planet Earth into another Ica Age. Most frequently, the cameras find climatologist Dennis Quaid (as Jack Hall) and estranged son Jake Gyllenhaal (as Sam Hall). Both men are strong, and smart. Mr. Quaid is one of the few who knows the seriousness of the matter. Mr. Gyllenhaal is smarter than his calculus teacher; he does appear like he's been "kept back" a few years in high school, but this is probably because teachers are jealous of Gyllenhaal's intelligence. Quaid has not won any "Father of the Year" awards; but, he really loves his son. Can Quaid save Gyllenhaal from the Global Warming monster? Indulgent cliché-ridden idiocy! Some money was obviously spent on "The Day After Tomorrow", which means there are exciting, well-produced scenes. Roland Emmerich is an obviously very skillful filmmaker; but, his story premises favor mindless blockbusters over enduring classics. The story renders its serious subject unintentionally (?) nonsensical; although, it is, admittedly, only a movie. Emmy Rossum (as Laura Chapman) and Sela Ward (as Lucy Hall) are the lovely love interests. Capable Ian Holm (as Terry Rapson) doesn't have much to do. Everyone watches FOX "News" channels. No wonder!***** The Day After Tomorrow (2004) Roland Emmerich ~ Dennis Quaid, Jake Gyllenhaal, Emmy Rossum</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From Several Days Later.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The millennium has seen something of a resurgence in those disaster movies that were so popular during the 1970's. And there's a logical case; special-effects have advanced in leaps and bounds during the last 30 years, whilst CGI has added a new dimension to their scale. With the possible exception of 'Towering Inferno', earlier disasters simply couldn't be addressed in a sufficiently epic way and at the same time appear believable. Check out 'Earthquake' and you get the picture.But are the new breed actually better movies? Roland Emerich's 'The Day After Tomorrow' is about as good as the modern genre gets. There's a nice beginning with wide sweeps of polar ice viewed from a low-flying plane. The credits roll to an equally beguiling orchestral piece as seemingly endless vistas of frozen wilderness sweep past at a speed that is choreographed to the musical tempo. It's a promising start, at least.We home-in on a group of scientists who have the astonishing misfortune to straddle the very point where this particular ice-sheet cracks. It's extremely tense, and for the most part, completely unbelievable. Quite why the ice cracks, separates a few metres, and then just stops, is left unexplained. It should have just glissaded down to the sea - shouldn't it? The team is led by Dennis Quaid. He's an unfortunate and rather unlikeable choice as a starring role, like a block of wood with a frown.Next, we are plunged into the usual 'knowledgeable expert not taken seriously by authorities' scenario that has typified every disaster movie I can remember. Politicians should go the the cinema more often.After that, the special-effects go into overdrive. Which is just as well because the story, the acting and the script hobble along like a group of heroes in an icy wind. There is a stupendous tornado sequence. A tidal surge engulfs Manhattan with one of the most astonishingly-well realised pieces of CGI ever presented. Brief as it is, this is without doubt the high-point of the movie. Superlatives are certainly tested. Then comes the chill. And once again it is done to perfection. Small details like multiple windows shattering in sky-scrapers and flags turning solid at their staffs are nicely observed.There are also a few little surprises, like an abandoned Russian freighter that drifts into the downtown floods.And that's about it. That's pretty well all one remembers: a series of colossal special-effects tableaux. The story, the actors, their acting, the script, they are so diminutive and mediocre as to be completely overwhelmed by this CGI juggernaut. Jake Gylenhall plays tacit leader to a group of prissy, preppy, privileged teenage brats. Of all people, they most deserve a grisly death. Pity Micheal Myers isn't in town. And, of course, he plays the role of hero to his particular bit of totty, for which he is suitably rewarded with a slice of sex. Some things never change for males no matter how emancipated their females become. The disposable man: that relentlessly anti-male sexism in our society; it just goes on and on (check-out the by-gender casualty lists of allied forces in Iraq, or the industrial accident fatalities in civilian employment, like - say - the building industry).Likable Ian Holm plays the token foreign-bloke-with-brains. He's British (ah - that 'special relationship' again. Even in such domestic adversity Hollywood hasn't forgotten us. Thanks, Roland). We know Holm's British because his staff watch that curious ancient ritual called soccer. And they do it without swearing, which is something I've never heard before. When he's not being a rebellious android trying to choke Sigourney Weaver with a rolled-up magazine, Holm brings a warm human empathy to any role he plays. But typically, his is the only character I feel moved to care for; the rest are welcome to the freezer, with my compliments. Various other B-listers make the most of their wretched lines before flood or frostbite overtakes them. An uncredited Japanese bloke gets brained by a melon-sized hailstone whilst talking to his wife on the mobile phone, and that's the Orient represented.It's well worth watching to see those very special effects in their entirety and in sequence. If you choose to watch it more than once for the same reason, you'll need to be ready with the 'mute' and 'fast-forward' controls on the handset.Five of my seven stars are awarded on behalf of those people we don't see in the backroom. Those we do see collect the other two. Better than the 1970's? Well, if only the acting, and script had kept pace with the special-effects! But they haven't. If anything, with an ever-greater dependence upon backroom boys to come up with the goods, those much more needful things of story and script have, instead, been neglected. Really big movie stars like Paul Newman and Tom Cruise had (and have) a considerable input to a movie quite beyond their acting. Maybe that's why this flick doesn't have any. And maybe that's why it should have had.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's the end of the world but not as we know it...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contemporary "disaster" flick, making up in bombast and special effects what this type of movie almost customarily loses by way of coherent plotting, thin characterisation and hackneyed dialogue. We get all sorts of clichéd situations flung at us here, from "buddy buddy", to "teen romance", "family dysfunction" - and that's just involving Jake Gyllenhaal alone! The movie would like to think it's a "The Searchers" for the "noughties", as "I told you I was right, Mr President" maverick scientist Dennis Quaid sets out on an epic journey to New York to rescue his disenchanted son, played with doe-eyed solipsism by a typecast Jake Gyllenhaal. Jake and his two college chums, one his would-be girlfriend, of course get caught in the epicentre of the perfect storm, which, much to my chagrin has already by that time taken out my native Scotland and now threatens to engulf NYC. Somehow by a combination of ingenuity, bravery and of course that particular type of Hollywood luck which seems to bless the lead players in all films of this type Dennis somehow makes it to Jake and his crew for that special bonding moment you know has been due from the first moments of the film. There are really no acting kudos here, everyone speaks their clichéd dialogue reasonably enough (I was able to successfully play "predict the next line" on many occasions throughout) so that the film stands or falls on its SFX. On the whole these are fine although any involving a downward shot onto a dangling individual over an abyss (which happens at least twice) are poorly finished although the large scale depictions of NYC flooded by a tsunami and the shots of earth from space are convincing. The film tries but fails to credibly connect with and elevate itself to the ranks of previous sci-fi classics in terms of use of symbolic imagery, most blatantly, the incorporation of the Statue of Liberty from "Planet of The Apes". A film like this is okay if you disengage your brain at the pop-corn stand, but I long for an intelligent disaster movie with credible characters speaking naturally and behaving normally. Some humour would have been of use too. Three "wozzat for?" moments to make you scratch your head bemusedly - the ridiculous chase scene involving escaped wolves, the insertion of Culture Club's "Do You Really Wanna Hurt Me" into the soundtrack and surely the longest set of technical credits ever racked up by a single movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As far as cheap disaster film is suppose this is a fairly good one.The problem is,this isn't a cheap film,it is a big expensive blockbuster that has a message about global warming at its heart and taking all things into account,falls short of expectation.The characters and plot seem almost inconsequential as nature takes its course and buries New York under ice and snow in a blizzard of digital effects that on this occasion actually look quite good.The story centres around climatologist Dennis Quaid trekking across the vastness of the US to save to his son who have been trapped in New York by the elements.Its all a bit painful,the dialogue doesn't help either,even experienced actors like Ian Holm cant give the thing much weight but a least the SFX look good and are the lasting impression of what is a heartless and mostly tedious experience.Roland Emerich films always seem to flatter to deceive,this film promises much but delivers little.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do not, for the love of god, see this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie insulted my intelligence both as a movie connoisseur and as a scientist. Although it's pretty undeniable that some form of climate change influenced by humanity is occurring, probably for the worse, this movie takes that idea and essentially rapes it through sensationalism and then further destroys any hope of redemption through terrible acting and casting.The movie centers around the idea that human activities are influencing the onset of a new Ice Age, which is arriving far more rapidly than they initially thought and inducing massive hurricane blizzards across the northern hemisphere. The main character's son gets trapped in the blizzard and he has to go and rescue him, blah blah blah, politics politics politics, *SNORE*.No, in all honesty, it's impossible to write a fair review for this movie because it is that god-awful. The plot is stupid and sub-par at best. Jake Gyllenhaal has shown he has some ability to act in some other movies, so I will spare him for the time being, but the girl who was cast alongside him as his love interest (in the middle of a life-threatening blizzard, no less) was possibly the single worst actress I've ever seen on the big screen. Dennis Quaid's acting was probably the worst I've seen of any of his movies.Emmerich has done some good movies, but I don't know what the hell possessed him to do this. Don't even bother renting this or hell, even pirating it.</fullReview>

First of all, some would not be aware of the many things you consider in every movie. Like the dedicated parents, the stupid politicians, the all knowing scientist. The next thing is the message. Its about global warming, thats for shore but i don't think this movie is made to warn rater just to entertain, while other may think about global warming. The next thing are the special effects. They're good, they're really good and its worth seeing them but as they are the most important thing in this 'catastrophe' movie, they're not in the middle of attention. The acting is the ordinary one and please, i did it, but you don't do it - don't go read the 'goofs' section, there are a lot of goofs in the movie that will kinda spoil the reality of the situations. All in one, the movie is pure entertainment fiction full of new thing and things you see all the time, its not made to warn people of the impact of global warming. Watch it for the thrill, not the message.</fullReview>

Lots of boring fill up scenes without any sense or connection to make the plot thicker.I cant understand why this movie is even made as a _movie_, it would have been much better without any 'movie scenes' between CGI scenes and just full 'destroy whole world' CGI visualization without plot... Maybe they wanted to do that in first place, and added something to fill up the space and so it could be called as a movie.. At least it feels so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film that I enjoy the more times I watch it. Few things are better than a film that deals with the chance of the world ending, and this one delivers lots of sobering moments as Europe, Asia and most of America get thrown into a sudden ice-age. The effects are fantastic and realistic and the plot holds up, mostly. There is a bit too much of the schmaltzy stuff and it is very American, but once you've swallowed all that it's a great film and perfect to watch on a cold winter's Day as I did. The acting holds up and the director keeps a firm hand on what are quite a few plot lines. Some of the latter could have been dropped, especially the daft and sentimental scenes trying to save the cancer patient, but I suppose the human element is always necessary in such films even if the excess of sugar isn't quite to English tastes. Bottom line...so good I bought the DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Day After Tomorrow may be a stern (and rather fanciful) portrait of global warning - most of it conveniently plotted so it plays out over a few days. And it may be grim, even rather hopeless. But this movie works as pure spectacle, with one extravagant set piece following the next. A supercell of funnel clouds over Los Angeles, New York under siege by rain, flood, and ice, and the rest of the planet expecting much worse. This was done by the same team that brought you Independence Day and the U.S. version of Godzilla. To varying extents, I liked all three. But DAT renders its effects with almost painterly beauty, almost guaranteed to inspire a kind of awe. Unexpected (and effective) comic relief makes for a better human element, as far as that goes. it's grand escapist fare, though its grim ecological message can make you worry about what you're escaping to.</fullReview>

But, he is really wanting to unleash the furies of nature upon his disloyal son Jake, who cheated on a test and thus brought disrepute to his entire family. Jake flees to the wilderness with his princess Possum, and together they weather Quaid's dark fury, as a tidal wave first engulfs the entire city, and then the Ice Lord Quaid freezes it, trapping the young prince and his bride within the ancient stone library. Eventually Quaid is forced to come looking for his traitorous son, and there on the ice...well, I won't spoil it, but rest assured, Peter survives! And i particularly enjoyed that ending...wow!

		<fullReview>Were to begin on this one? Well, as I have stated previously elsewhere, I feel that this is the third movie in an unintentional trilogy featuring, and in this order; "Armageddon", "The Core", and "The Day After Tomorrow".It is your typical disaster/survival movie, where man is screwed no matter what and his main job is to survive...So much in fact that the whole movie could be played and summed up in little over a half hour. However, that would not make an entertaining evening so you have to throw in subplots consisting of random CGI wolves, and an injury that is bad enough to make a squishy sound when it happens, but not bad enough where it is even acknowledged until the plot slows down enough where it suddenly becomes life threatening.Hence enter the random CGI Wolves...The film is basically a sensationalist view of Global Warming Propaganda. I half expected to see Al Gore surfing on the tidal waves that were about to sink New York screaming "here's your Inconvenient Truth!".If you are careful you might even see a cheapshot taken at some Saudi Arabian officials when Dennis Quaid is giving his speech...Every little cliché' that is out there in typical disaster/survival movies is here. From estranged spouses finding their love again, to cancer boy, to man pulling together to save the day, to the hero driving a hybrid car, to his son making it as a man, this movie has it all. And before I forget, it even has the typical "hero cop" extra who needs to take charge, and not listen to anyone cause he's the hero cop and winds up getting everyone he is leading killed....And since when does Mexico have a border patrol to keep all those wiley Americans out of their country?As my wife says; "Suspend all Logic and Disbelief!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has got to be one of the stupidest films I've seen in a while. This movie is like a dream come true for Al Gore because it would prove his global warming bull was right. Basically if you watch this film leave your brain turned off otherwise you won't believe one iota of this film.OK it starts out in Antarctica. Suddenly a piece the size of Rhode Island breaks off. It is global warming. Well the VP and world leaders don't believe it. (The VP is a blatant stab at the Bush admin by making him look like Dick Cheney) Well the Earth goes into massive weather problems like Tornadoes in LA, massive massive hail in Tokyo and eventually the northern hemisphere freezing (all inside of a week or so) Preposterous. Also it is possible to walk from Philly to NYC in arctic conditions in a day or two? Yeah right.Also there is a bizarre sub plot that goes nowhere. Sam's mom/Quaid's wife is a nurse. There is a sick boy. The plot with the kid makes no sense nor does it really have much of an end. The kid has cancer. He is looking at a book. He can't read the book, but he looks at the pictures and remembers the story. Later she reads to the kid. Then the ambulances forget them during the evacuation. She stays with the kid. Then a rescue team arrives. Then she sees him again at the end.OK but why is this in there? Were we supposed to learn the parents died and she now takes the kid in as her own? Were the parents to be reunited? What? There was going to be a second one involving the Japanese man and a NYC stockbroker, but it was cut. The Japanese man on the phone was re-dubbed to Japanese and made into a conversation with his wife. This sticks out due to his facial reactions being kinda wrong for the scene.This movie is far fetched, has a needless subplot that goes nowhere, and bad CGI (mainly the shot of the wolves. The were obvious CGI) Only thing this movie is good for is making fun of on MST3K. Or in its new form Rifftrax.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well to start off i have to say that this is a movie that shows whats in our future. I only say this because although most of the events in this film are a LITTLE exaggerated (meaning the -150 degree eye) just about everything else is almost possible. The whole concept of the The THC(Theromo Halie Current) or North Atlantic current slowing down and stopping is a real fact and is happening today but not at a seriously fast rate. And as for the awesome giant super storms i would have to say that if the THC were to shut down the great differences in the new buildup of heat in the tropics and the heat-less north would cause storms all along the northern hemisphere to spring up out of no ware and at a alarming rate. With these storms would come weather anomalies and extreme weather such as tornado's in places they usually arn't and major floods. While scientists are working on these issues right now they simply cannot say that this is not going to happen mainly because it is something that cannot be predicted with hardly any accuracy. So all in all this dark plot line for the future of earths temperature is most likely true and WILL happen one day in our far future.Forgetting the Plot line lets move onto the movie itself and the Several categoriesDirection: the thing i love the most about this movie is the way the director set up the plot, following a family and their survival through the a storm that brings the world into a new ice age. New york and LA were great ideas to include as well as the Antartica scene to start the movie off. Having 8 people trapped in a library and a dad coming to rescue his son was a tremendous and rather horrific way to portray the intensity of the events.Acting: The Was in my opinion just as good as disaster films can get, not to dull and bored,but also not to panicy to the point were they are frantic. The Cast was excellent Jake and Emmy made a great couple to watch, Dennis and smith were rather funny in certain aspects and Ian Holm was great. Trust me this movie does not have bad acting if you want bad acting go watch "Randsome of Red Chief" or "Post Impact". My most favorable moment in acting of this movie was when Emmy stands on the library staircase looking down at the flooded room where Jake's character just disappeared, The expression on her face was horrifically awesome in a way that showed you she was scared.Special effects: Put simply the CGI was freaking the coolest iv'e ever seen in a movie. the flood was great, the tornado's looked completely real and the wolves were not bad.In the end i found that this is one of the best films ever made and with full respect i gave it its due credit a 10. Also for you stupid people out there who thinks this movie sucks, just look past the script(which was still rather decent) and seemingly unbelievable plot line and enjoy the movie.And for you losers who think you can write up a better script or plot line try emailing it to me and i'll tell you what i think.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Aren't natural disaster flicks supposed to be exciting? Network TV has come up with better stories than this on their "Disaster Movie of the Week" installments. This movie moves at a pace that would put a snail to sleep.The premise of the climate entering a brief "Ice Age" has been worked before, and better. This flick just doesn't do much with the idea, giving weak and random interpretations of how it might occur. Nothing transpires in logical order, and inconsistencies regarding the climate's changes are everywhere. Technology seems to have been disabled, then it's not. Storms are supposedly happening around the world, then they're suddenly confined to certain areas. CGI special effects are sporadically realistic, but utilized poorly.But the biggest problem with this film is its preoccupation with one ignorant family. The dad is a scientist who warns people (oh so brilliantly) to stay indoors and keep warm during the crisis. Then he wanders outside into the arctic tundra northeast to find his son someplace in New York City. His kid with the glazed expression: that's Jake Gyllenhall, who apparently thinks he's still on the set of "Donnie Darko." Very little else happens, although the movie throws in some doomed extras, several plot contrivances, and some dumb wolves that wandered on to the set during filming one day. Watch this for a good laugh only.</fullReview>

Some Characterizations are hopefully opened only to get hopelessly lost. I wish I could get back my slot in the "5 VHS for 5 days for 5 pesos" rental pack offer. But well, even when I didn't like the film at all, I have to admit it has quite a graphical imposingness. Don't waste your time if you're not into that :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uneven But Entertaining Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If this was supposed to deliver a warning, it failed. If it was intended to entertain, it hit its mark.Stunning visuals, compelling story, and gritty performances mark this Emerich tale from beginning to end. Graphically speaking, this film is amazing. The visuals are completely awesome; wholly realistic. The story line runs smoothly as possible, with gaping scientific holes reminiscent of Gore's alarmist presentation in An Inconvenient Truth. This is in no way what WILL happen. The story embraces the most unintelligent of popular tripe and capitalizes on the fears of the ignorant. But in an entertaining way. If you are intelligent enough to ignore the environmental posturing to enjoy the fictitious story presented, this can be a great way to spend a couple of hours.It rates a 7.8/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood does the Environmental Awareness Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When global warming triggers the onset of a new Ice Age in Roland Emmerich's "The Day After Tomorrow "(2004, 124 min., U.S.), tornadoes flatten Los Angeles, a tidal wave engulfs New York City and the entire Northern Hemisphere begins to freeze solid. Starring Dennis Quaid, Jake Gyllenhaal, Ian Holm and Emmy Rossum.This film truly is a typical Hollywood version of an environmental film. Using nature as the protagonist and the several familiar subplots of boy gets girl, Dysfunctional family comes together to save parts of the world. Workaholic dad steps up to the plate and against extremely adverse conditions manage to rescue his son and his friends. Who in the first place should never have left the posh apartment? However, in Hollywood reality those characters always lack common sense. Sitting the audience, I want to scream at the stupid characters "No don't go" but they always do. The science exaggerated to heighten the drama and music and sound seamlessly float in and out of your awareness.The views of the storm from the space station really give you the sense of the magnitude of the storm. The Computer Generated Images (CGI) and visual effects combine to create a terrific impression of the scale of destruction. Specifically the tidal wave that hits Manhattan, the masses of people fleeing over the Rio Grande south to Mexico all make impressive effects and create to the drama and intensity of the film.Professor David Ingram mentioned the political underlying narrative that establishes similarities to the Bush administration's position on global warming. He mentioned that the film was released in 2004 coincidentally was an election year. His other insight into the film was a liberal discourse, an American Jeremiah appealing to reason and appealing to emotion. There were a few moments I found myself not lost and captivated by the story, graphics and the action. In all I give this film a grade of B+. (That is a strong B++ leaning toward an A-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best for Special Effects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where would filmmakers be without artistic license? New York is virtually under water yet everything's working-the electricity,computer screens,telephones.And everybody is being ordered to move South as if its just the next town! They get to Mexico believe it or not and suddenly there's the equivalent of a town in a Refugee Centre!How have they got there-there's no transport and for most people no money either it would have been lost with everything else Not only that but people are shown on skis or walking on the ice. But if logic and reality had been applied the film would have been quite boring. We saw what happened in New Orleans or the Tsunami or even Branscombe Beach-people go looting that's the reality.And its also a reality that there would be mass outbreaks of fighting and I don't mean with wolves. This in fact was a more realistic moment to introduce a pack of wolves as they would be well at home in this environment. But 8 out of 10-its a thoroughly entertaining film with wonderful special effects When the film's over it takes at least 10 minutes for the credits to roll up-an indication that a mighty lot of work was done just to make a disaster movie to entertain the masses.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had heard from my friends that this movie was good. However, they all loved "War of the Worlds" (2005), which I hated. Therefore, I was a little dubious about seeing this film. Nevertheless I purchased it from a second hand store and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised! I found this film very good, much more convincing and realistic than the other "disaster" films I have seen. The special effects, on the whole, were excellent, apart from a few lapses in the form of slightly unrealistic CGI animals. The acting was good and realistic and most importantly, the story was good. All in all, I thought it was an excellent and underrated movie, well worth watching.</fullReview>

But he cannot convince the Vice President that things must change.As a sudden and catastrophic climate event unfolds -- life on earth changes in an instant. And the fun begins!Quaid is perfect cast in the hero role. And he is well supported by an able cast.

		<fullReview>Jack Hall, Climatologist, has made a shocking discovery: The world as we know it is ending, and a new ice age is about to begin. Hall must now save his son, trapped in New York, before he dies from the freezing temperatures.This movie was a well made movie in my opinion. Unlike the man above, I found the movie to be a quite enjoyable thrill ride. Some segments, I must admit, were a bit fanciful. (A wall of water enveloping New York City? Please!) But other than this, the movie has stayed true to the phenomena called a "Super Storm" confirmed by British scientists in late 2000.If you enjoy movies that involves hectic scenes of heroism and death, then this movie is one to see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm no expert, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed the movie (especially the effects and filmography), but I think it places the "blame" for global warming in the wrong place. It's a little naive of the human race to think that we could be responsible for the destruction of the world. The large-scale climactic changes on the earth's surface are considered by many experts to be cyclical (sorry for not including references, but you can do your own research if my post arouses your curiosity)... The earth experiences warm times and cold times --- as there was an ice age ten-thousand years ago, there could possibly be one soon... just as there may have been one thousands of years before that. I honestly don't think that we humans could have a whole lot to do with its onset.It is indeed important and necessary to preserve the earth's resources and veer away from the use of fossil fuels, but not for the reasons that the movie proposes. Rather, it's because we've come to rely on them too heavily --- and they're gonna run out. The solution oughtta begin with a two-pronged approach: 1. R&amp;D for alternative and replenishable fuel sources. 2. Drill the preserve in Alaska. (That's likely to ruffle some feathers, but all the Alaskans I've ever met think it's a great idea. It would leave a very small environmental footprint - contrary to what most green-folk would try to convince you - and besides, caribou and elk cows use the warmth and shelter of oil pipelines to give birth... And the most important thing for many Americans: it may have a significant depressive effect on the rising oil prices.)Hope this post has been thought provoking and enlightening... and if a second ice age ever does come upon us, I hope it looks as cool as the movie portrayed it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where's Ron Darling?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a Mets fan, and if people know, Ron Darling pitched for the '86 championship Mets. I was looking up stuff on him, and i learned he was in this movie. I know it was him because he played in other movies as himself; a pitcher for the Mets. I've watched this movie over 10x and I've never once seen Ron Darling. They claim he's a Hawaian News Anchor. I checked the deleted scenes as well. I was just wondering if anyone has seen him and knows the scene he's in. I figured he had to be in a fairly noticeable spot to put him on the credits. If anyone knows where he is in this movie, I would really like to know, because I don't believe he is. The one part where he could be in, his face is completely blurred out in the background, and that seems ridiculous for someone who is clearly famous. Thanks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Direction: I'd say the Roland Emmerich ("the people's director") style has left people gaping for air. The scenes are flatly - perplexing. In every bit of film you will find the hard work and the artistic ( sculptor and painter) background of Emmerich.So.. I'd say he did a good job -9/10Story:Inspite of the dead theme of the movie ( Global warming - dead cold theme of a movie) Emmerich and Nachmanoff gave a dramatic drift by introducing emotion ( Jason Evans: What's going to happen to us? Jack Hall: What do you mean? Jason Evans: I mean "us"? Civilization? Everyone? Jack Hall: Mankind survived the last ice age. We're certainly capable of surviving this one. The only question is, will we be able to learn from our mistakes? ) and Family tensions ( Sam putting his trust in his always-late-and-irritating dad and Jack leaving everything to enter the abyss of snow to save his son) Political aspects - which are always present in Emmerich films ( president dies,Americans take refuge in Mexico , Hospitality of the third world , Vice-president's extremely political out-look etc...). In this movie too like all Emmerich films the Shakespere principle of subplots for realism is used. Good story -7/10 Acting:Jake Gyllenhall was a good actor and ha deservedly won the best international actor award. Dennis Quaid acted well too. Good acting -8/10 Music:Herald Kloser's music was excellent and it is still stuck in my head Music - 8/10 Casting:April Webster did a good job selecting actors - 6/10Technical aspects:The film was technically brilliant. Everything looks, sounds and feels real. -10/10My rating:The above points give the movie 7.894/10</fullReview>

It's a pretty neat movie I think, balanced in all the aspects of good visual effects, some character development, neat script &amp; editing. But maybe because it's too well spread out in all these areas that it doesn't seemed to shine in any particular area except for the visual effects, maybe? Still I did enjoy the movie...it's a great family movie to watch, little nudity, few profanities &amp; plenty of good issues for you to think about.

		<shortDescription>The Best Roland Emmerich Film Yet!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is quite amazing. The visuals, the acting, and the story are all just top notch. It is hard to imagine what would happen if this were to really happen. Luckily for us though it is not believed to happen for a while yet.Anyways, back to the movie. The Day After Tomorrow is about a climatologist named Jack Hall who discovers that Earth's climate is changing rapidly. Within a few weeks, The Northern Hemisphere could be facing the prospect of a new ice age. He must get to his son in New York City which has already felt the effects of the "super storm" and he may not survive. With the government not believing his theories and his son's life on the line, Jack must convince the government and save his son's life before the super storm kills him too.The movie's story is just terrifying. Just to think, if this was really happening to us, what would become of humanity and nature? Would humans be able to repopulate Earth and would everything go back to normal? What would become of all the animals on the Earth? There are many questions as to what would become of us if this were to really happen. The question is: Could this really happen? Just goes to show you what would happen if humans keep polluting the air and use up valuable natural resources.10/10</fullReview>

As for the actors they were convincing and Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) and Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) they actually look like there father and son. over all i give this a 9 because it is so good the only reason I didn't give it a 10 is because I didn't get to know what happens to the world. I wish there was a sequel even if its hard to make a sequel that is as good i wish there was oh and keep the same actors especially Jake Gyllenhaal, It doesn't even have to be a sequel just something about the world like what else could happen.

		<shortDescription>Great, realistic and one of the best movies of 2004</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had high expectations 2 years ago when the trailers of the movies which were a lot and looked really promising and scary. I have always considered Emmerich as an average director who is given high budget projects and he directs them in not a bad way, but people can't see what he is good at and that's why he remains an average director. Kinda Michael Bay probably. High budget, amazing special effects, entertaining, kinda optimistic and so on. This is the reason movies like Independence Day and Godzilla are rated low and are examples of bad movies although I like both of them a lot.Now about The Day After Tomorrow - I consider it as Emmerich's best movie. It's nicely directed, it's realistic and authentic which makes it scary it some ways and a little distant from the other light summer blockbusters and 2004 had many, many summer blockbusters.The special effects were incredible which is not that much of a surprise since many people talk about how The Day After Tomorrow depends on these action/destruction special effects scene. Nah, I don't think so, but I love special effects and this time they are special and make the movie realistic. I don't remember which guy from the crew said that, but it sounded very true:"If we hadn't hurry finish the movie, we would have been making a documentary". The end of the world topic is nicely stressed although we finally have some personal views for the nightmare.The soundtrack is great and I loved some themes, especially the one from the documentary of the movie. It's a sad theme about how many people die due to the the beginning of another glacial age.The acting is OK for such a movie. The story is not that personal, but considering that in Independence Day, the president was one of the characters, it is personal indeed. A father and son drama and characters not related with our main characters who personally I cared for, like the sick kid and the female doctor.Overall The Day After Tomorrow is a great movie and although 2004 wasn't that much of a great movie year, it was something I would watch again, something that entertained me, something that amazed me at that period and it used to be a very favorite movie of mine 20 months ago, but I watched many, many classics since then and I changed my opinion. It was a good period and I will always remember some of my very first favorite movies even if they are not included in my top 10 of all time anymore. Just a good memory. And I wish Emmerich luck with his new project which promises to be something the fans would like to see and if they like it, they will start having respect for Emmerich which is going to be a progress in his career although his career has never been and it will never be something special.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very few of these has come out for a while. A solid, good, disaster flick. Good use of CGI(Unlike Armageddon. Ugh.) and a good story, even if it's a bit unrealistic(Unlike Deep Impact. Ugh again). I usually laugh a bit at normal disaster flicks like Perfect Storm and the likes. This movie had me entertained but not laughing at it.Jake Gyllenhaal shows about 5% of his capacity(watch Jarhead and Donnie Darko) but it's OK. Acting is pretty general in this movie, no real stinkers or real stars. Again, no big deal. It's a disaster movie.The plot: Ice Age is abound and Dennis Quaid has to save his son from a frozen New York. There's even a nice Karl Rove-ish vice president in there not caring. Me like.The effects are, as I've said, very good. It's chilling to see a giant wave hit NY, especially after the recent disasters... Anyway, it's hard to elaborate on this movie. Just see it with an open mind and don't be nit-picky and you'll enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh well, it's the MARKET stupid and the market IS stupid and films like ideas are commodities and HAVE to be sold and have nice endings where the girl gets the boy and a few superfluous side-kicks get "kilt". Meanwhile...reality continues apace...the permafrost is melting and carbon based fuels are being burnt like there's no tomorrow while tough grass is starting to sprout in Antarctica.This films stars your old Cecil B. DeMille favourites "special" "effects" and a few humans, a Border Collie and some fake wolves who, at best, are affecting a "made for TV" drama. The premise is true enough. If global warming gets to the tipping point vis a vis ocean currents, we're in for it AND, it looks like matters are going that way, courtesy of a system consigned to "invisible hands". But the nonchalance of most, including most of our fearless leaders, is matched by the "Hollywoodized" treatment of this very serious subject in "The Day After Tomorrow".Don't worry babies. Lots of the human race will survive to continue to drive their Humvees. You've seen the worst. Ah, the vicarious, the virtual life.

		<fullReview>You should go see "The Day After Tomorrow" because it is full of intensity and because of its realistic scenes. However if you were someone who doesn't believe in the world ending I wouldn't go so this.I watched this movie on November 22 of 2005 at home by myself. It was 2 hrs. and 4 minutes with a PG-13 rating and was directed by Roland Emmerich. I have also watched this in previous times with my family. It was definitely different watching it the second time because you already know the whole story but since it is such a wonderful movie with breathe taking visual effects you still focus in on it. My family also thought it was a great movie. This movie received great reviews. Roger Ebert of Chicago Sun-times thought that the movie was silly but at the same time was very intrigued with the special effects. That is one of the strengths that I also found fascinating in the movie and how real they made each scene seem. They also had great actors and actresses that made the movie full of feelings. You can really tell that the actors were feeling the scenes. They all gave a wonderful performance and they all came together for a marvelous performance.It's full of excitement and keeps you wanting more at the end. They had it made so realistic that it makes you think what if it happened on this time frame that you are living in now. The story is developed from researchers in the middle of a huge glacier trying to gather information and with the start of the tragedies. The catastrophes happen right after the other but you never know what it's going to be next; whether it'll be a huge earth wake or just everyone dying and the world ending. This movie was very scary in its own way because it showed what would happen in the feature and how anything can happen in an instant. If you were someone who was even afraid of dying would probably pee your pants if you watched this movie. I think people with phobias of that sort would not sleep for days having nightmares of the situations in the movie.They had great special affects using CGI. Their scenes looked so real you wouldn't think it was done on a computer. All the weather conditions looked like it took time and was developed greatly. I thought that the scenes of Los Angeles and New York were the best. This movie was filled with great images which made it look so realistic.I didn't know that so much was involved in our world. How we actually have real researchers out there trying to keep up with matter like this that would affect our world. This movie showed that once there is a problem then it must be announced to leaders around the world. This movie makes you think what if this happened tomorrow.Never take your life for granted because anything can happen tomorrow. Always be prepared and be smart about situations. Watch this movie because it sure will make you think about what revolves around you. I recommend this movie to be watched it is worth your money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You have got to be kidding me.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Will there ever again be a big budget film that maintains some semblance of originality? This pathetic display of a film is detestable, and the people who decided to create, market, and actually charge money for this film should be bludgeoned.Think about it. When you produce a film with this many digital effects and such grand scenery, you must have seen something to it that made it worth the while. Well, obviously, actor agents didn't think so. I don't know who was considered for the parts, but when the best casting you can do is a washed up Dennis Quaid and a kid with an infectious smile in Jake Gyllenhaal (And by "infectious", I mean something that you would take lots of drugs to alleviate as soon as possible) it should throw up a red flag.So that's it! Those are your Big Names. As a producer, I might think, 'wait a minute. I am producing this huge Hollywood hit, and all of these agents said no and we had to take our 10th or 11th picks in many cases, and brought in new faces in others. Maybe this isn't as great as I thought.' Granted, I know little about the movie making process in respect to this aspect, but can they not pull the plug on a film when it's clearly going to suck? Or are people that shallow to actually consider this film worth their time and money? If you're going to do an end of the world movie, make it about the end of the world.From horrible foreshadowing about a girl who scraped her leg needing penicillin, to escaped wolves (which don't naturally attack human beings anyway. A little research actually shows that there are few, if any, documented wolf attacks on humans anyhow) which are poorly animated, this movie offers little more than an overcoming of insurmountable odds to bring a family back together and two bring two young people together in love.The scale of the reuniting story was far inferior to the aspect of the 'overnight' arrival of the next ice age. If you're going to have a plot based on such a grand catastrophe, show us more of the effect it has on world-life as a whole. Don't just show us one exceptional climatologist and his son and their story. If the temperature dropped to sub-zero temperatures tomorrow and such a catastrophe actually occurred, the history books that would be read by survivors would discuss much more than what happened to Dennis Quaid and Jake Gyllenhaal. They would discuss the effect it had on every society in the world. While you can't make a two-hour movie that explains every bit in detail, at least follow a couple of different story lines. Independence Day did it fairly successfully. Hell, ID's spoof Mars Attacks! even did a better job of this. If you're going to emulate someone else's work, at least take the time to recreate the aspects that made the story good. Make it appealing to respective intelligence, instead of just to the visual and auditory senses.My initial reaction of the film being unoriginal is basically that I saw this movie as a combination of all of the recent natural/major disaster films we have all been privy to. From the bringing together of estranged family members that Jeff Goldblum's Character and his wife accomplish in Independence Day, to the hero status accomplished by a person who, by normal standards, holds a seemingly nominal position such as a tornado chaser, or for sake of my argument, and climatologist, or even a seismologist or an astronomer, this movie took pages right out of the handbook for creating movies about catastrophes. I am not saying that these people do not hold important jobs, but as a world community, we hope that it's our governments and armies having to prevent worldly disasters as opposed to people who have to help avoid full world destruction.Luckily, I never had high expectations for this movie, which is why I have not seen it until now. I was waiting for something else to start on TV because I woke up a little early, and this was on a cable movie channel, so I gave it a look. As with all movies, good and bad, I will usually sit through anything so I can legitimately praise or bash it accordingly. All things being equal, however, my time would have been much better spent if my system had not gotten me up two hours before I had planned. In other words, I should have stayed in bed.</fullReview>

Those movies (ID4, Godzilla, Stargate) have a very huge sense of megalomaniac film maker than a human and intimate movie maker. Roland Emmerich is not Steven Spielberg. He is the next Irvin Allen (The towering inferno, The Poseidon Adventure) he likes disaster movies with predictable plots, but the power of his movies are (now) in it's characters and in the visual effects, now used with the dramatic purpose of show the worlds destruction.Many critics hated the movie (check out the critic of the Rolling Stone magazine)and it is understandable. You must like the following movies: -Twister. -The perfect storm. -Volcano. -Dante'speak. -Apolo 13. very very much to like The day after tomorrow. If you don't like (almost) one of them, then is not your movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A visual treat... nothing else.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movies like "The Day After Tomorrow" always have certain goals to fulfill. There are few films that set goals in every strata of cinema and fulfill them. Films like "Day after Tomorrow" do not set goals in all strata, the primary objective of them is to provide the cinema-goers the maximum visual treat. All others are just to hold up a story to make it into a film. So this film is filled with unscientific plot, childish story lines, cheap clichés and laughable script. I wouldn't be surprised if it had worse acting performances. They were lucky to get decent actors like Quaid, Gylenhaal or Rossum.What I mean to say is, watching this film in a big screen theatre with good sound is indeed a treat. There are a number of scenes where the audience applauded heartily. Once again, one can't help praising the marvel of modern computerized special effects after this film. That was the film's primary objective and it passed that exam with distinction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sure, "The Day After Tomorrow" is entertaining enough to watch but as a movie it isn't really a good one. The characters are flat and hollow and the story lacks substance and a well build up ending. Also they manage once more to put in some cliché disaster movie moments and over-dramatized and unlikely moments.I'm sure director Roland Emmerich also tried to make a political statement with this movie but he fails terribly with all of his attempts in this movie. In the movie the American government seems more concerned with their budget than the global environment and express this arrogantly openly in public. Well not even in real life the American government is THAT arrogant as portrayed in this movie. All those scene's were Emmerich tries to make a political statement are rather laughable and unlikely than anything else really.Yes, sure the movie has some nice and cool looking special effects with lots of stuff getting crushed, demolished and blown away ala Emmerich's other movie, "Independence Day" but thats about the only good and positive thing that can be said about this movie. The story itself is quite ridicules and unlikely and doesn't feel realistic enough because everything is over-dramatized so much, just like in disaster movies from the '70's was always the case. The movie is filled with some pointless action (the wolves attack) and pointless characters (the English always tea-drinking Ian Holm character and friends for instance)Having a story-line focusing on a group of young student children is always risky, since most of the time they are always portrayed by annoying and bad actors. This however is not the case in this movie. Jake Gyllenhaal and Emmy Rossum are splendid actors and they manage to portray some likable characters.This movie is fairly watchable as entertainment but it still is not a movie that I would recommend to everyone.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

I often thought that a 12 year-old had written the screenplay.Fortunately, I watched the movie for free on TV while on vacation in NYC so I didn't waste any money on this idiot-fest.It is a mystery to me how movies this poorly written ever get made in the first place.One of the things I was planning to do when I retire is to take a screen writing class and mostly for the fun of it write an original screenplay and semi-seriously try and market it. After watching "The Day After Tomorrow", I feel very encouraged at the possibility that I might actually be successful!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Apocalypse Lite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A truly horrific experience. "The Day After Tomorrow" heralds from the pop-culture school of action-adventure, where the world is threatened again and again by a splashy screen saver.Things start out, as these films do, with a guilty father. This particular father is guilty because he doesn't spend a lot of time with his son. Don't hang too much on this though, because the movie doesn't. You can substitute basically any reason for a father to feel guilty in any Hollywood picture released in the past 15 years without consequence.It turns out that the guilty father is a scientist. Not just any scientist, but a brilliant scientist. So brilliant he's one of the only people on the planet to predict an approaching global super storm. But no one will believe him, especially--are you ready for this--a vice president who happens to look *exactly* like Dick Cheney. Not-Dick-Cheney says it would be too costly to fight global warming. This is what is called "dramatic irony," when the audience know something the character's don't. In this case, we know that production company spent hundreds of millions of dollars on CGI effects, but not-Dick-Cheney is in the dark.Meanwhile the guilt-causing-son travels to New York for no reason other than the directors intend to destroy it. Several obligatory characters are introduced here, including the going-to-be-girlfriend-shortly-after-major-cataclysmic-event.This is about when the screen saver turns on. Los Angeles and Tokyo are destroyed. The process of Hollywood elimination leaves only New York, which receives its comeuppance in the form of a stealth tidal wave.Leaving the science behind how a 40+ foot tidal wave invades New York and camps there for 11 days aside, let us consider that the New York metropolitan area has more people per square mile than any city in the U.S, or close to it. As a result you might expect people to leave behind bodies when the city fills with forty feet of water. But nature has a surprise for us: this is the world's first acidic tidal wave, dissolving every dead body it comes in contact with. It is followed shortly after by acidic snow.So everything gets cold--real cold, but, like vampires, it can't come in unless you invite it. Somewhere in here as well we have the lamest attempt to add drama in a major motion picture for 2004, when some CGI wolves show up to much the guilt-causing son. There's also some bit about the guilty father trudging through the snow to reach his son in New York. His motivation: he's guilty and he "has to do this." Eventually it all ends. Guilty dad shows up not five minutes before rescue helicopters do, making his entire journey less than pointless. I guess it was about "proving yourself." We're assured that everything is okay because even though 2 billion people are dead, the guilty-father and his family made it through, the son got himself a girlfriend, and there are no more screen savers in the budget.In all of this, I left out the smarmy subplots about a kid with cancer and an ultra corny series, probably paid for by the White House, in which the president is the last person to evacuate the danger zone. It's funny stuff, and a good shot in the arm for anyone who believes the "liberal Hollywood" mantra last seen screeching from Ann Coulter's lips.In total, this movie is terrible. Even for a disaster film. Watch it for the screen savers, avoid if you're looking for a credible plot, realistic dialog, or inspired acting.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie could have been a great "what-if"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film I could really get into because I live in Winnipeg, Manitoba, lately the home of extreme weather. We just recently had freak thunderstorms and days of rain resulting in heavy, prairie engulfing flooding. As my basement flooded and I couldn't stop it, and my backyard became a lake, I wondered what would happen if the rain didn't stop. Winnipeg lies in the grip of deadly cold for weeks at a time, but somehow, this rain disturbed me. So, as soon as the rain subsided, I went to rent a video and the movie jumped out at me.What was right? The graphics were great, especially in the first hour. The ideas were sound, at the beginning. I was excited ? I thought I had it on a more or less realistic "what-if" that I could almost identify with! But no. It degenerated so fast it was ridiculous. Let's start with the obvious. When it gets really cold and icy, cold enough to freeze 4 feet or so of salinated ocean water, you are not going to be touching metal with your bare hands. But, that's what our friend Sam Hall did. Over and over again. And again. Jumping down the stairs as his hand glides effortlessly over the steel banner. Grabbing at metal runs, ledges, and so forth, and holding on and releasing with no trouble.Let me describe a very very common event here in winter. I bet more than half the population of the US would be familiar from a very young age with this kind of story. Years ago, I placed my little boy in a metal shopping cart to go grocery shopping. It was about -20° outside (farenheit or Celsius, really doesn't matter when it is that cold) and there was a slight breeze. Not a bad winter eve. He was of course completely swaddled, except for his tongue. He just discovered that he needed to lick everything, and as I locked the car, I caught him in the corner of my eye dropping his head down to the metal cart. I knew what he was going to do, and screamed, but it was too late. We know what happens. He is now completely stuck.I was panicked. I headed for the store quickly, all the time spitting on his tongue to warm it up while screaming for someone to bring warm water. Once we got in the store and got warm water, his tongue released. So what's the lesson here? First of all, all the better stores only use plastic carts now, and second, why the heck would the film research team not ensure they knew enough about cold weather to be a little more realistic? All they had to do was phone anyone over 2 north of the imaginary line they drew in the film.The second obvious thing ? no breath vapour. So I guess it wasn't really all that cold. And the snow really looked like that artificial plastic snow. They need to improve those flakes. If the flakes were really that big, they would be more moist and it would be warmer outside and the flakes would clump together. If it is that cold, the flakes are very tiny and hard and glimmer like diamonds and are powdery. Also, it doesn't snow when it gets that cold. And yes, the penicillin would have been frozen.And the deep freeze chasing our Sam like something out of a Stephen King novel. Is this a horror flick or a catastrophe movie? And the door, yes the door would keep out this cold. Let me tell you something. Once, on Christmas eve, my furnace stopped working. It was cold out, about -30° with a really high wind chill. It was bad. Within an hour, my house cooled down to needing jackets. You felt it right away. If we had to go all night without a furnace, the results would not have been too good. So no, a door does not keep out -30° cold, much less the deep cold in the movie. It just breaks the wind. And by the way, the car needs to be plugged in to start in the morning at those temperatures using a block warmer which keeps the oil from freezing.As for gas lines freezing, that is true. Once, in Minnesota in the dead of winter, my car's gas line froze while driving on the interstate. This is common, and there are additives especially for this kind of occurrence.On to the plot. Why the wolves. What in the heck did they add? They were very poorly rendered ? animals and people are difficult to render and easy to spot as CGI because of irregular weight distribution leading to odd movements. The wolves were laughable and stupid, and provided no addition to the plot line whatsoever? So what if they escaped? And then they bit the rich kid's leg, but then what? And why? And the whole septic shock thing with the girl so they would have a sequence on the boat. Really.This movie could have been a great "what-if". But it failed and that is simply too bad. I could have seen it playing in schools to teach the effects of global warming. Required viewing for everyone. But the plot and technical failures simply ruined it.I give it a 7 for special effects and the first hour or so, but it really is more on the level of a 5 if not for the good intentions behind this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>big budget comedy movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>it's rare to see a comedy w/ so many special effects. what...this wasn't supposed to be a comedy? could have fooled me, i broke out laughing dozens of times. i know plot is irrelevant in end-of-the-world movies, but that doesn't mean they shouldn't try. for example, the scene where the french family is trapped in the cab. the traffic cop just stands there, as chaos erupts around him, and actually says, "i don't understand french". hell, neither do i, but i'm thinking that the woman may want out of that flooded cab. and god forbid their precious passports are left behind! nope, must risk life and limb to save pieces of paper that can be collected again from any government office. and why the hell were the wolves in there? couldn't the director spring a little more cash for actual wolves of wolf hybrids like Disney did in "white fang"? and how did they survive the flood? what, did they take an elevator to the top floor or something? i love the bush/cheney likeness. notice that the prez in the movie is coming back from a fishing trip and the VP has to tell him LA was destroyed. and that the prez turns to the VP several times to ask for advice. the VP is making all the decisions, and in the end, is the one to make the important one. a not so subtle bashing of the current administration. and everything is just so convenient. how convenient that in japan, after the first chunk of hail falls, there's a nice 30 sec pause for everyone to look around perplex before the actual storm comes. how convenient that a solitary ship finds itself right in front of the library. so convenient that they found a fast food joint, complete w/ burgers and soda, to hole up in. very convenient that out of all the survivors the wolves could find, they find how young hero (also convenient that, in spite of the radical changes around them, thew wolves are still ravenous). all of this made for a very funny movie. and gotta love that last scene. half the earth is frozen, millions upon millions are dead, but dammit, look how clear that sky is!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Day After Tomorrow, Excellent FX, poor finish, poor storyline</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Day Afetr Tmorrow, set to be an absolute blockbuster... Unfortunately that is not the case. I can not doubt or deny the fact that the movie contains some awesome effects, that really are cutting-edge stuff, but I am afraid to say a movie is more than just a few computerised sequences. The plot of this movie is very poor indeed, but what I deem worst of all is the finish. It seems as though only four or five people are left alive, but as the camera pans around New York, we are shocked in seeing hundreds, upon hundreds of people standing at the very top of sky scrapers. Then we see scenes of London, and other great cities of the world and it appears as though everyone is dead. That is particularly strange when you imagine SAS members and other high military members all dead, and simple New Yorkers manage to survive by standing on top of a Sky Scraper. I didn't know whether to laugh at this hilarity, or to cry because of just how poor it truly is. This is one of the films that I certainly would prohibit from entering my DVD collection. I did see it in the cinemas, and was tempted to walk out half way through, and I certainly would have had I not ordered that extra large portion of popcorn, that extra large Coke, and those nachos.BEWARE, by buying this movie you agree to waste your money!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That is, in speaking terms of modern DISASTER MOVIES. Fans of high-brow-cinema are bound to be disappointed, but they also should know better than to stay away from GENRE movies. Such as this, low grade action, slashers and porn. So here we have your basic disaster movie. The plot is the same as always: an everyman scientist knows that a volcano/earthquake/tsunami(whatever) is about to strike an inhabited area or that a nearby dam/bridge is about to collapse. He tries to warn people and get them to evacuate, but no-one believes him. However, he himself can't leave because his ex-wife/love interest/kid is in jeopardy. The disaster strikes, killing 90% of the people. The rest of the movie we follow a nuclear group, led by the scientist and usually accompanied by a smart dog, fighting to get out of the situation. We also see at least one good soul sacrificing his life for the common good *snif*.Basically, all you need to know in movies like this are the following: - Did the casting do a good job and can the actors get something out of their cardboard characters. Here: YES - Are the effects any good? Here: YES - Boring patronizing or good-natured roller-coaster-ride. Here: LATTER - Is the situation believable. Here: NO. But it does have a point. Environmental message, but not rubbed on your face. Unless you want to take it that way...As a bonus - No damn dogs on sight! - Tongue in cheek- humor. Might be unintentional, but I like it anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could this film have been any worse? I shudder at the thought.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must say I haven't watched this movie from the beginning, meaning I lost most of the action and special effects. But to be brutally honest, I couldn't care less about special effects. With all the technology we have, special effects like those are the absolute least I could expect from a movie like this. And the things I should expect from a decent movie are all absent here. Just look at the "Goofs" section and at other comments here to see the insane amount of plot holes and blatant inaccuracies, not to mention idiotic, braindead plot devices: e.g., a ship ending up right in front of the library Sam and his fellows are in, which MUST HAVE SOME MEDICINE that should save his love interest, who has an infection - such infection obviously diagnosed by some lady who just happened to read about it on a Medicine book! Geez, one doesn't need to look too closely into the movie to notice flaws like that.But what really adds insult to the injury here is... What does this movie stand for? A laughably unsubtle critique against the Bush administration? An action-packed CGI-infested blockbuster? Melodrama? See, the entire second half of the movie is spent on telling the adventures of Sam and his friends, while his father comes to save him. I didn't care at all about any of the characters (how well developed they were!), and instead, I was just wondering what was happening to... well, the rest of the world. I didn't see anything that really mattered: instead, I was seeing stupid, insipid melodrama and teenagers (acted by rather old actors, no less) being attacked by wolves. The movie wasn't even funny due to the amount of blatant inaccuracies in the movie. Science has been deeply insulted.And in the very end, we're treated to a Cheney-lookalike Vice President saying good things Third World countries (as a Brazilian, I wasn't flattered AT ALL, mind you), while the Statue Of Liberty stood tall and proud amidst all the snow in New York. A bad movie trying to deliver a message across, with all the wit and intelligence of a clear and transparent hailstone - the likes of which you only see in Emmerich movies. Someone out there definitely needs to make a movie to alert the world about the danger of braindead disaster films.</fullReview>

Although the current disregard that humans seem to have for the environment certainly isn't helping the situation, the movie gives the impression that an ice age of this nature is inevitable and even though the filmmakers have said that they have sped up the timescale of the events, it will only be a matter of time before it happens and there's nothing we humans can do to stop it.As is typical of a Roland Emerich movie, the effects are spectacular, sometimes at the cost of the characters but in this movie certainly that doesn't matter so much as it is a showcase for these effects.The movie itself is well worth watching and is an enjoyable if somewhat ominous way to spend a few hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too much Hollywood in the second half, but still something to see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I always like to go and see Roland Emmerich films, that's real popcorn cinema to me. Since I liked the preview too, I was surely going to see it. This film shows how the northern hemisphere gets thrown into a new ice age, thanks to global warming, that will melt most of the north pole's ice, which in turn will make the gulf stream stop. Chaotic weather, with tornadoes by the dozen, huge storms and temperature dropping by a hundred degrees in the centre of the three continent-wide storms destroy our civilization. The southern half of the US of A have to run for shelter in Mexico (where it's just snowing, nothing else), and the northern states just have to sit it out. Same in Europe and in Asia, which gets barely mentioned (apart from a few seconds in Scotland). That's the first half of the film. I really liked that a lot! Great effects, and it all sounds not so wrong. There was plenty of stunning scenes, and a good tempo. The second half of the film then simply became like so many other catastrophe films. The one scientist who was warning of what will happen, is in Washington DC, and his sun is stuck in New York, sitting the winter storm out in the central library. Daddy has to go and rescue him. Certainly he will make it. As usual with Emmerich (good for his wallet), the end was a bit too much Hollywood, too happy end, but okay. I just wish it would have been him finding his son and that group and them setting out (still on snow-shoes) to go to Mexico or wherever. End scene them disappearing into the snowy landscape. Full Stop. But no, certainly the good US army had to fly in with their good helicopters to save the good people, and hundreds if not thousands of other good people that suddenly appeared on the rooftops of the skyscrapers of NYC. Where did they survive? No one knows. Why did they not set out to go to the south, like the majority of the library group? No one knows. Did they have the same knowledge as the remaining group in the library, being warned by the ONE scientist who understood what's happening about leaving? Definitely not. I give the first part 9 and the second part 5 out of 10 = 7 overall points!</fullReview>

He says that there will be natural disasters everywhere and that the northern hemisphere will freeze over.A good very movie . Good special effects. Though the part where the "tsunami" floods new york and the boat goes sailing through the city is quite stupid and unrealistic, and also the part where the numerous tornadoes trash the city of Los Angeles and news reporters are stood just a couple of meters away reporting on it. How dumb is that! Also how could you walk from Philadephia to New York in minus degree temperatures in less than 10mins, without being frozen! And the wolves trying to eat the people is stupid. When the top half of America floods the people from the bottom half have to be evacuated to Mexico. Hundreds and thousands and millions of people are entering Mexico illegally. Jack has to get to New York to save his son Sam and his friends who refuged in a public library.A good movie. Worth owning. Exciting and awesome.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A climatologist (Dennis Quaid) predicts a massive climate change. After it occurs, he must race to New York to save his son (Jake Gyllenhaal), trapped after the disaster occurs.I believe disaster movies are on a different level than most other films. Like the horror genre, they are almost always chided for being stupid and non-realistic. That they may be, and for the most part this is no exception, but take it for what they are (vastly entertaining action films) and they are pretty good. Again, this is no exception. The action is fast-paced and comes at the screen with a breathtaking frequency; the highlights being the destruction of Los Angeles and the approaching quick freeze scenes. The performances are quite good for a disaster movie, mostly those of Quaid and Gyllenhaal. My only two complaints with the movie: the character of the President (Perry King) is underwritten and hardly on screen?he could have been left out completely; the insta-freeze of Manhattan comes quickly, but not quick enough for the very tired and weary characters to outrun it. That's a bit too much suspension of disbelief to ask for.</fullReview>

Although this movie was fictional, it is my belief that the results of global warming today, could lead to the disasters portrayed in the film. The special effects made the movie incredibly real and in my belief, helped provide the American people with a general awareness of the importance of our world and the environment. I would recommend this film to everyone from the ages thirteen and up. It is my belief that everyone should learn to appreciate the importance of keeping our world a safe place and become aware.</fullReview>

But, I have watched it well over 15 times, sometimes just watching the first hour. The two primary extreme environmental scenes have wonderful CGI. I can just go to those scenes on the DVD and watch them by themselves. I can even forgive them destroying the Hollywood sign (again!). For my eyes, the trite and the tepid in this movie are 100% forgiven by the special effects. Maybe having seen tornadoes on the ground increases my enjoyment of them on this screen. The title ice is also so nice, though it doesn't come across as well on the small screen. On the DVD you should watch the deleted scenes since none of them should have been delete and the alternate scenes actually used are not as good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From The Makers Of Indepence Day Comes Another Great Hit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2004's "Day After Tomorrow" was the second great hit by director Roland Emmerich. His "Godzilla" (1998) was never considered to be good, though it does have its moments, at least for me. But definitely "Day After Tomorrow" is the next best thing since Independence Day. This time the great threat to earth and humanity is earth's erratic weather. Weather experts and geologists discover that the earth is experiencing the same kind of distorted climate in the days of the Ice Age. The ocean begins to fill up, even drowning the land, and snow begins to consume land as well. The affected regions- Los Angeles, which gets its first ever tornado, and usually warm India and Japan get hail. The film stars Dennis Quaid as the heroic Jack Hall. Jack Gyllenhaal portrays his son Sam Hall. Sela Ward plays the mother and wife to Jack. Sam goes off to New York City to participate in an Academic Decathalon, not because of the contest but to get close to the beautiful Laura Chapman, with whom he is smitten by. She's played by Emmy Rossum, who is now better known as Christine Daee from "The Phantom Of The Opera", which was evidently her next film after this one. I was quite surprised. As a dramatic actress, she's OK and has potential for the future. As a singer, she also has equal potential for success. We don't hear her singing in this film.The cinematography is a visual masterpiece, the visual effects are top-notch. Much of it harks back to Independence Day, especially in the team efforts to survive the disaster. A brave group struggles to live in the library of NYC and it is quite suspenseful. At one point, I did feel that they would die. Naturally, humanity survives, life finds a way. This is not just another big disaster film, even if it does have those elements. It is very intense drama and I found the characters easy to sympathize with, especially in the younger characters. Highly recommended movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It just tries too hard...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I got the DVD of "The Day After Tomorrow" for Christmas, and I finally decided to sit down and watch it last night. I had pretty high expectations going in to it. I like 'end-of-the-world' films, so I had high hopes for this one, but man was I disappointed. Let me start by saying that the acting is extremely wooden. I like Dennis Quaid, but he seems really emotionless and bland in this movie. Jake Gyllenhaal is the same. The only positive I saw from the stars in this one was Emmy Rossum. At least it seemed that she tried to overcome the uninspired script and wooden acting from her co-stars. This movie tries way to hard to be something it's not. Roland Emmerich definitely wore out his welcome with this one. I mean, it tries to be "Twister" when Los Angeles is being destroyed by mega-tornadoes. It tries to be "Armageddon" when massive balls of hail strike Tokyo. It tries to be "Deep Impact" when the Statue of Liberty is destroyed, not to mention instead of running from a massive tidal wave, the characters are running from an invisible wave of unbelievably cold air. Also, Emmerich seems to steal from himself and try to make this seem too much like "Independence Day". It also seems to try to be too much like "Farenheit 9/11" in a sense that some people argued that this was another anti-Republican, pro-Envrionment spat, 'George Bush/Dick Cheney is ruining the environment and it must stop now' thing. In the end though, "The Day After Tomorrow" just does not stand out among the relatively recent crowd of end-of-the-world movies that we've seen in Hollywood. Overall, the movie does have it's entertaining points. Other things just don't make sense at all, and you'll realize it immediately (see: Wolves). The sole-entertainment value of the movie saves it for me from giving it a worse grade. 3 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet another Hollywood disaster film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie begins by showing the growing awareness of global warming and the urgency of responding to the effects it is causing, as scientists working in the Arctic Circle witness a massive piece of ice 'the size of Rhode Island' break away from the polar cap. This latest report is presented to The Whitehouse and recent changes in weather compared to those which led to the first ice-age millions of years ago. The scientists' attempt to gain support for action to be taken in an effort to reverse this damage done to the Earth's atmosphere falls well short of that which is required as they have predicted 'ice-age' like conditions occurring in the next hundreds or thousands of years. The risk is not seen as an immediate threat, however the president proposes a plan of action to the people of North America so that their grandchildrens' children will have a better chance of survival. Events speed up as around the world extreme weather conditions are reported and the main character, the scientist who provided the initial estimate, is forced to admit that he was wrong and it now appears that the next ice-age is upon them. The movie attempts to turn into a disaster film at this point, but the overdone effects and computer imagery fail to produce a realistic portrayal of tsunamis and tornadoes. Probably the only scenes which I could honestly believe possible were the ones where Japan was bombarded with softball sized hailstones. While the main idea behind this movie was great and definitely very topical, the script has been written to a Hollywood formula and crisis points occur purely to add a complication to the story rather than as a believable situation where the characters overcome obstacles. The dialogue was predictable and I did not think much effort had gone into the various motivational speeches and emotional exchanges ? in fact, at several key vocal points where the audience should have felt pain, shock or admiration, I found myself laughing at how ridiculous and forced the words sounded. Several of the main characters were poorly cast and I had difficulty in taking the actors/actresses seriously in their roles. Their overdone acting would have been more appropriate in a soap opera than in a tragic film aiming to demonstrate how ordinary people react in a crisis. I was disappointed with the ending as nothing was resolved. The people of this world had not acted in any way to bring about the sudden change back in weather and I still cannot understand why the climate's conditions eased in this instance when they had previously destroyed the planet. The director has created a politically correct length of film with the very direct lesson that we need to take 'caring for the environment' more seriously, however if he had marketed it as the 'general public documentary' which it is, my guess is that no-one would have gone to see it. Watch 'The Day After Tomorrow' if you are after 'light' entertainment based closely around the formula of movies such as Independence Day and Godzilla, but I would not recommend it to those viewers who desire a clever, well-made film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a movie driven along by cgi special effects for the most part. There's lots of weather related disasters and a bunch of people running around screaming, but really, what can you do? Everybody talks about the weather, as they say, but nobody really does anything about it. There's a father trying to find his son in the frozen tundra that is now New York City and you have to ask "but why?" So they can die together? There's a little hopeful message about banding together in third world countries, which is karma, I suppose, playing out for the superpowers, but it really is not a message movie, just something fun to look at. Oh yeah, there's a sick little boy in the hospital, too, but he belongs in a different movie. Count how many times people say "Are you alright?" That was fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just saw this for the first time, and it's been only a couple of weeks since the Sumatra tsunami. When the big wave hits the Big Apple, that really was gripping. The rest of the film was chilling enough, with zesty special effects.What the hell, did the ice age just kind of peter out at the end? One minute it was freezing folks solid and the next it was just sunny and brisk... si I'm calling the ending "lame".Still, I give the overall film an 8 of 10. Planetary warming is happening and this film is good for the world's psyche. I have heard that the Great Barrier Reef, off the coast of Australia, is in jeopardy of becoming dead of life in less that 20 years, due to rising water temperatures. Another coral paradise off Belize will also be wiped out. Al Gore was on the right track with the Kyoto Treaty, and it's a heinous mistake for the U.S. to snub our responsibilities to the planet.I work in a library, so you can figure I had to like this film just to see the books on Tax Law being fed to the flames.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How could something that cost $125 million to make be this cheesy? It's unreasonable to demand a thought-provoking plot from what is essentially a special-effects movie. Still, if you're going to dispense with plausibility, intelligent dialog, and characters of any depth; then it seems reasonable to expect the effects to be stunning. This movie simply takes bits and pieces that have been seen before in other places (_Deep Impact_, _Twister_, and Discovery Channel documentaries, to name a few) and stitches them together into a cautionary tale that would be more aptly called "The Environment for Dummies". The characters, whose vellum thinness is inadequately offset with bathetic earnestness between screaming set pieces, are so cookie-cutter that the actors could all have phoned in their parts and let the computer graphics department draw them in. (Then again, with this budget, are we sure they didn't?) As far as the "action" goes, about thirty minutes into the movie, it became completely unnecessary to watch the rest. Not a single gasp of surprise or clutch of pearls awaited.As far as the principals: it would be easy to lambaste them, but why bother? Laurence Olivier couldn't have turned in a creditable performance with this unfortunate script and a director who obviously ought to stick with commercials for cold and allergy medication or adaptations of Jack London novels (reference scenes in New York City). It must be terribly hard to act one's best in a vehicle with a complete lack of subtlety, nuance, or development.It must be said, though, that the film does offer two huge consolations: that when the going gets tough, strangers will band together to survive in supremely adverse circumstances; and that when the planet's environment eventually turns against us, Hollywood will be one of the first things to go.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Day After Tomorrow (2004) Dir:- Roland EmmerichContains Mild Spoilers.Plot:- The Story concerns Climatologist Professor Adrian Hall (Played by Dennis Quaid) who tries to save the World from Global devastation from the Effects of global warming, but instead of rising temperatures - he forcasts Falling temperatures but shouldn't make any difference for about a century or more, But suddenly the Weather changes dramatically Worldwide with hailstones the size of footballs in Asia to devestating Tornados in Los Angeles, Prof. Hall realises the Ice age is coming to the Northern Hemisphere and Coming soon.On top of this catastrophe his son Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) and friends are in Mortal danger as they attend a contest in New York City as a Devestating Tidal Wave hits the coast and leaves most of the City Under water (seems slightly in poor taste after recent devestating Tsunami in Asia) before the Ice And Snow sets in...The Acting:- The Acting in this 2004 summer Blcokbuster is actually really good (Much better than Van Helsing) even though we go through all the Disaster movie clichés seen in movies as far back as the Early 1970's Dennis Quaid gives a very convincing under-stated performance as the Prof. Talented and Sexy Young actor Jake Gyllenhaal gives a really good performance - as do many others including Sela Ward as Hall's Wife.The Special FX:- I've sat through some ghastly efforts in recent years from 2002's Disappointing Bond Movie 'Die Another Day' to Lara Croft to 2004's other Summer Release 'Van Helsing' but the FX here is very good and believable.My Verdict:- All in all a very good disaster movie a much better film than 'Van Helsing'- Good Acting,Believable Story and Impressive FXRting **** out of ***** or 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Ride!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much has been made of the scientific impossibility of the very premise of this movie: climate change happens incrementally, not suddenly as it's portrayed here. Point made, I suppose, but those who make this criticism forget the basic point involved in making a movie: you want to entertain the viewers. While this may be scientifically inaccurate, it's an amazing ride. (And, for those concerned with the inaccuracy of sudden climate change, it's worth noting that the scientists portrayed in this movie also conceded that this shouldn't be happening this fast. That was part of the mystery to it all.) From start to finish, this film has everything a good movie needs: action, real suspense, good if not spectacular performances and absolutely amazing special effects. I thought the movie weakened a bit in the second half, as the focus shifted away from the mystery involved in the climate change and took on a fairly predictable rescue format. It also came across as a bit preachy at times; with barely disguised shots at governments about the failure to really take action on global warming. (Did I also detect a shot at the Bush administration? Perry King and Kenneth Welsh as the President and Vice President respectively bore something of a physical resemblance - I thought - to Bush/Cheney, and in this movie it was rather clear that the Vice President was calling the shots.) The movie could have been cut a bit in the last 45 minutes or so. In particular, the wolf scene on the ship struck me as unnecessary and somewhat tedious.Still, this was an entertaining movie that kept going all the way through, even if it was slowing down just a bit by the end. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Talk about clichéd and predictable. TDAT is simply a rehash of 70's disaster flicks with modern effects. I gave it a 5 on the IMDb scale. OK time waster, but don't expend even a trace of energy thinking about it, or you'll realize that you just threw away hard earned money. My biggest complaint was the number of story lines thrown in that were either filler, or never concluded. The Sela Ward character, and her storyline were the most obvious. The simple fact that she was the mother should have been enough, but then she was given the filler part with the terminally ill child. (wouldn't you at least attempt to move the child if it were the last resort instead of stupidly staying behind, knowing that it meant sure death?) Maybe it's me, but laying down in the face of adversity makes for crappy storytelling. There were many other examples of this simpleton stuff, but that was worse. Wait, maybe it was the end. Dad and assistant make it to NYC just as the storm breaks. Jeez, If he had just waited the 7 days, he could have taken the helicopter up! The real star was of course the FX division. They were impressive. Unfortunately, films built around FX generally lose out in the character and story area.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical Disaster Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**** SPOILERS!!!!!!! ******* The Day After Tomorrow, while amusing especially watching it in theaters, is a typical disaster movie. After watching TDAT, I am now convinced that all disaster movies will follow these rules. 1)There will be a scientist who no one believes, 2) a politician or rich person who won't believe him or her until it's too late, 3) and innocent kids who either just want to have fun or are misunderstood until the disaster happens. I can't think of a single disaster movie dealing with nature that doesn't some of these stereotypical characters.However, The Day After Tomorrow is still worth watching just because it's fun. Not very realistic, but then again this comes from the man who created Independence Day so what can you expect but some computer images of major cities being destroyed? However, there were really only several areas of the movie which I thought were stupid and only added to the unlikeness of what was being showed. I have to say that the last half of the movie is where it started going down hill and where it also turned into a near Hallmark family movie. If the ending had been a little better then perhaps I would have given it a better rating.The idea of Quaid driving, then WALKING up to New York from Washington in what he himself calls, in not so many words, an unheard of disaster is just too hard to believe. Though he has been to the Arctic before, does that mean that he and his two friends are going to drive then walk the distance to New York and survive while hundreds of thousands can't? I saw this as the point where the movie became less then a disaster movie, and more of a father son story.The next issue that annoyed me was the wolves and the attempt to get medicine from the freighter. It seems that Emmerich needed something to fill time with so he came up with this. I find it hard to understand why Enrich would run out of ideas now, if that is what happened. It's just seemed to be too silly compared to the rest of the movie.The last issue that came up was the "cheerful" words of the new president, the man who believe Quiad was simply a crack before he of course was proved to be right. I am sorry, but if this actually happened the whole world would starve. The Third World cannot support itself AND refugees from the West at once. The West would surely "die" if this were to happen.Despite these two minuses, I still enjoyed The Day After Tomorrow. It's not realistic however it is a fun movie to watch if you like seeing the end of the world. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Day After Tomorrow - It's big, it's loud, it's expensive, it's interesting... but is it truly any good? When I first saw the promo's of this film, I instantly loved it, claiming it would be not only a summer blockbuster but a possible instant classic as well. Although Emmerich made some crappy films over the years (Godzilla comes to mind), he's still a director with a good eye for incredible action scenes. Independence Day and even the cheap Moon 44 are proof of that. Plus, in The Day After Tomorrow, he had a chance of working with young talents (Jake Gyllenhaal truly is a good actor), as well as perhaps the best actor around (Ian Holm). Although it's too bad the latter doesn't really appear on screen as much as I wanted.So, expectations were high. But, although The Day After Tomorrow doesn't fail on all accounts, I must say I was a tad disappointed in the outcome. In the beginning of the movie, it takes too many too well known steps (politicians not believing the scientists, etc.), and too soon you're feeling like: alright, get on with it.When it does get on (the weather horror, that is), it all looks amazing, but the movie then is seriously damaged by some family/love stories that just won't work. Gyllenhaal and Rossum don't have any chemistry going on and when Quaid is coming out to get his son things just are getting silly.One last thought about the ending: I can understand how many people dislike it, but it's somehow a bold statement by Emmerich to make it end like that, so I'm not gonna bash him for that.In short: phenomenal effects, interesting ideas, but the movie is a bit spoiled by relationships which just won't work. 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Imperfect but entertaining disaster flick from the director of Independence Day. The story centers around a handful of characters, namely government climatologist Quaid whose theory about the melting of the polar ice caps in a thousand years time happens to be occurring in just forty-eight hours. Now the race is on as the world's remaining survivors must band together in order to escape the coming of a new ice age. The script strains credibility, as expected from most films in this genre, but there are plenty of suspenseful moments, destructive action scenes, and dazzling special effects to hold your interest. Not likely to win any writing or acting awards, but on a no-brainer level it's certainly lots of fun. ***</fullReview>

There was no juxtaposition between the characters and the ensuing apocalypse, meaning that the quest of the climatologist to find his son felt forced and emotionally lacking.In short, a film laden with (pretty good, it has to be said) special effects doesn't cover up for a dreadful screenplay with the emotional depth of an Eminem song.

		<shortDescription>A good disaster movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched the movie on PPV and while I loved the special effects it wasn't the greatest movie I've ever seen. The huge wave hitting New York City was cool but there were a bit too many clichés for my liking. For instance when Emmy is wading in the water there is a cut scene of her cutting her leg on a taxi, I knew that would be a plot devise later on, and it was. Also wasn't it convenient for that oil tanker to run aground right in front of the Library, perfect for them to get the needed medicine and be confronted by the wolves. I also did not buy the fact that the entire earth's weather could change literally overnight. I will admit that my finger was on the FF button of my DVR for a good portion of the movie. By the way, did you know that Jake Gyllenhaal was considered as a replacement for Toby Maguire in Spiderman 2? Apparently Maguire had injured himself and they thought he would be able to do the film. I think Jake would have been a good choice, he kind of looks like Toby. Anyway, I would give this movie a 7 out of 10, good but not great.Renee</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How he does it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>GOOD POINTS: The reference to the current political dynamic duo on top of the Government was briefly enjoyable, and the Mexico issue was a direct hard throw to the nature of treatment and relationship between U.S. and Latin America.THE REST: How is that this director gets money to keep doing movies? Isn't clear enough he is doing some of the worst movies from the end of the 20th century and early, newly born 21st? or it's probably the 4 years without directing one that erased our memory? or it's just that studios are confident enough that we are stupid enough to keep wasting our money going to see such a bone? I was refusing to rent this movie but at the end I said what the heck, let's give a chance.... and Oh Lord, do I regret! Mr. Emmerich &amp; company seem to insist in convince us of something that can happen, seriously, based on "scientific" basis, and they actually fool quite a lot of people doing it so: there is NO scientific true behind his plot, despite everybody's straight faces all the time. What he pictures here CAN NOT happen in a matter of one month or less, EVER, not even when the Sun start dying. If the core of the plot is cheezy but the facts after that were believable I'd give him a break, but please: the heroic girl going back to rescue a stranded passport? a huge oil vessel cruising on 5th av. &amp; 42 st, a couple of minutes after Manhattan has been flooded (some few feet of water by the way)? The heroic guy attached to the telephone despite there's no more to say waiting to be top off by freezing water? A family of awesomely bad rendered wolves surviving some hundred feet of water, on the loose and on the prowl to attack precisely into the oil vessel? A three man hike expedition from Philadelphia to New York under Himalaya conditions, with purpose of...? what? partial family reunion? and completed in what, 1 night?? When the noise of a huge cruising oil vessel was rumbling over the city, I thought Godzilla was making his entrance all over again! It was like watching that again! I felt a strong lack of basis and credibility, the bottom line of the story it's awfully handled to get the disaster and absurd facts that they want to show no matter how, when or why. If you are going to make a film based on a fantastic story, science fiction or a fable ("I, Robot", "A.I.", "Star Wars", etc, etc.) you can go and do whatever you feel like doing, but manipulate scientific reality to make us believe this can happen and then picture absurd situations on top of that, is not part of what I consider art or even entertainment. The music is too cheezy, almost sounds like the same piece of "tutti virtuoso" with all the orchestra instruments playing loud at the same time EVERY TIME a supposed-exciting scene breaks in. Special effects? The same as in Godzilla 6 years ago, way overcome by a lot of recent magnificent achievements (the Spidermans, the Matrixes, etc.) At least at the end is plausible we didn't see Godzilla stepping over anything in Manhattan or Mel Gibson carrying the U.S. flag all over the place or the U.S. President giving the definite knock out to annihilate a awesomely huge fleet of millions of evil extraterrestrial aliens. I hope I can stand and not watch Mr. Emmerich movies ever again, specially the one coming "One Nation"... we can imagine where it is going to go.3 out of 10 for one funny political reference and the social content of the U.S.-Latin America reverse of fortune.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent special effects but in all candor I'm a little tired of pseudo-science being passed off as real. But as I said, good special effects and fun for that but one's credibility MUST be suspended. Acting seems fair to good. The shots of New York flooding were really cool. I do see a risk of some people taking all this seriously and desiring that we do something about it before it really happens. I think that lots more harm than good could well come of this. A point the Vice President early in the movie makes is that the fiscal consequences of taking this stance might well be worse than the physical consequences of not taking it. So if one doesn't take it too seriously, it's a fun movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And the Oscar for worst science in a Hollywood blockbuster goes to . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just watched this movie on DVD, and was awestruck - not at the CGI, but at the sheer badness of the science in this by-the-numbers disaster flick. The North Atlantic Current jumping 13 degrees in temperature in a matter of hours? Supercells sucking supercold air from the upper troposphere directly to the earth's surface without any warming? Instantaneous freezing (yes, I've heard about the Siberian mammoth, but the explanation was crap 10 years ago and even worse crap now)? Ice sheets forming over the Northern Hemisphere in a matter of days? As an earth scientist, I resent having global warming and climatic change being made the subject of an Irwin Allen-style schlockbuster. Movies like this simply make the entire topic risible.A few points -1) What about the poor Canadians? We don't hear a word about their fate - maybe they're dancing with glee over having the entire country turned into a gigantic NHL rink.2) I can't imagine the Chinese, Iranians, etc would be too happy about having hordes of Russians moving south into their turf. Maybe our intrepid new President can show them the way to peace and brotherhood, just like he does in Mexico. 3) The wolf attack struck me as incredibly offensive for a movie as environmentally pretentious as this one - those wolves would have been snuggled up tight in the nearest shelter, and the odds of them attacking humans would have been zero.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have watched this film a few times now and the more I watch it the more I enjoy it. Roland Emmerich has a talent for making movies that are great fun and pure enjoyment to watch. I admit the plot has a few weak points but it really grips you all the way through.The special effects however are nothing short of stunning, and the best this is they look so real, the opening scenes of the ice flow looked perfect. I thought they where real till I watched the DVD special features. Too often movies with heavy CGI use look fake (see Star Wars ep 1 and 2), but this film is totally convincing, the CGI is flawless, (see the flooding of NYC and the opening titles for proof).Best Character, Sam Hall, good actor and has at least the best lines,Jaw Dropping moment, the Tsunami hitting New YorkCheesy moment, the end speech (he soon changed his tune)Over all rating 9 , aside from thin plot, this film has everything to entertain you. Watch it and enjoy it.Global warming is a problem and this film highlights that, we all need to try a little harder to make care of the planet we all live on. Maybe the US could look a little harder at this one.Tara</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...were the special effects. The rest was plain, unadulterated ka-ka. Transparent characters. Idiotic plotting. Predictable who-lives and who-dies assignments. Faulty science. Not that I'm a stickler for pristine science, in general - movies invite suspension of belief all the time. But in this case, I think the faulty science mixed in with everything else that's wrong with this movie actually did a severe DIS-service to the very cause they were trying to promote - waking up to what we're doing to the environment and "fixing" it before it's too late.But again I say - the special effects were AWESOME!

		<fullReview>The Day After Tomorrow is an enjoyable film with great special effects and a decent cast. I even enjoy the touches of irony like the scene where American refugees are denied entry into Mexico at the US/Mexico border. However, past that, the liberal environmentalist agenda behind this film is less than subtle. What's even more disturbing is the science behind the whole premise of the show. I find the whole scenario presented extremely implausible. The ending also leaves much of the issues unresolved. Is Mexico now part of the United States or vice versa? Maybe the moral of the story is:"Be good to the third world countries, because one day, we might wind up as their unintended permanent guests as a result of us not signing the Kyoto Accord!...Amen!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Chill Got Me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In short, this film is about a national emergency, like many other Roland Emmerich films. What makes this one different is that it entertains the concept of the world going through another ice age - the day after tomorrow.While many critics and professionals concerned with national emergencies and meteorology denounced the possibly of this film ever being reality, it still makes for an interesting story. Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) is a climatologist, who, along with help of Terry Rapson (Ian Holm) discovers that the climate is changing at a rapid rate due to the shifting currents in the Atlantic Ocean. As the thermometer begins its plummet, Jack races to try and rescue his teenage son (Jake Glyllenhaal-a.k.a.: Donnie Darko) and a group of friends to safety. I do have to say that one scene with a bunch of CG (computer-generated) wolves is pretty lame, although intended to be suspenseful. Dennis and Jake play a good father/son team and all the other acting is well done. I was especially enthralled with Emmy Rossum. She reminds me of a young Mia Sara.I see her acting career going a long way! Sela Ward adds a few heartfelt moments (why isn't she in more movies?). What was most entertaining/laughable was as I was watching this film, myself and a bunch of friends started to feel cold. By the end of the movie, we all felt freezing! You may want to have a blanket on standby for this one! 7/10</fullReview>

Now I know that people who liked this movie will defend it, and that's fine. If you liked this movie that's fine, your own personal taste is not something I could ever fault you on. Why I hated it however, is that it was boring, silly beyond belief, with characters who I felt absolutely nothing for. The logic holes in this movie are so gaping a woolly mammoth could get through, and I can't believe that I didn't see a real live one come back to life or something. Many parts of this movie were just so unbelievable that any shred of credibility it offered about the coming of the second ice age completely evaporated. Cliché after cliché made me want to wretch. All in all a terrible waste of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Without doubt one of the finest catastrophe movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>spoilers. THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW is very brutal and very frightening in ways. Movies having the subject catastrophe captured its own genre because it often had it totally own mood and excitement.THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW focuses a lot on the matter of ice age. Jack Gyllenhall and Dennis Quaid plays the two main characters and from the movie's beginning it truly is a surprisingly good ride. Although it's got its typical aspects, it really keeps the drama so fine with its amazing special effects. The entertainment factor is top-notch all the way, from the "something's wrong" in the beginning, "let's pray" just before it starts off, "shit!" when it does and "I love you" in the end, the movie is certainly much better than the usual catastrophe movie. Armageddon, SUDDEN IMPACT and those movies are all fun to watch when the main event happens, but that's really they've got to offer. THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW gives us fine characters, charming love between people and a really typical, but strong brotherhood.As New York City is layed under by a huge wave of water, it all freezes and turns to ice cold snow. The few people trying to find medicine for a girl and some food, gets to meet some angry and furious wolves. Although these are animated (why? Sometimes that is) they're really some of the movies best sequences. Being hunted by on wolves in a weird looking hospital is really dramatic. And everything goes pretty good in this movie (although you can't say that), the people we follow survives and it's a sort of happy ending, although it really isn't in the same time. Zooming away from the Earth we see that all of USA, parts of Mid-America, Europe and Asia is totally covered in snow white landscapes and the sky is totally clear. The birth of a new ice age, although it's choosy and warm in the South.The White House is off course represented by a typical American president, his helpers and a lot of pure emotions. Although I didn't find this movie scary, it was a jolly good entertaining and satisfying movie in its scale. Delivering extreme tornados, insane freezes, huge waves, love and The Statue Of Liberty covered in snow. STARS: 4-3/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far-fetched Sci-Fi movie that entertains with good special effects and sound track.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good movie to watch for the entertainment if one doesn't take it too seriously. I didn't like Dennis Quaid's 'sad-sack' character here, but the others were all good. And for some, it may make you think about what damage we Earthlings really are doing to our environment. LEVEL ONE: The movie is beautifully filmed. The special effects are as realistic as they can be for such a fictional premise. The snow, the cracking of the ice shelf in Antarctica, the tidal waves crashing into NYC. The surround sound track, reproduced realistically in a good home theater system, adds greatly to the mood of the movie.LEVEL TWO: This is Sci-Fi fantasy, what would happen if global warming disrupted the Atlantic flow which keeps the northern hemisphere warm? Could this result in hurricane-like storms over land which would suck down very cold air, with resultant unusually heavy snow and freeze-killing of anything left outside?LEVEL THREE: Some may read into this movie a political message about how we are dooming our future generations by failing to control pollution, especially that which leads to global warming. However, I don't, not to any greater extent than any Sci-Fi movie does. To me, it was chosen simply as a premise for a good story.SPOILERS FOLLOW, QUIT READING. The human element story was the father, weather scientist, not spending enough time with his high school son. Son goes with other students from DC to NYC for a knowledge contest, get trapped there in the NYC library as the frosty storm moves over NYC. Manages to get dad on the phone who tells him to stay there, do not go outside, do anything to keep warm. Dad, experienced in Antarctica, vows to get his son, even if it means hiking to NYC. Which he has to do after they find the road blocked. One of his three-man team dies after falling into the snow-covered glass dome of an indoor mall. Students end up burning books in the library to keep from freezing. Girl with a cut leg gets infected, they have to brace the cold and three wolves to get penicillin for her aboard a ship that had run aground in the street outside after the tidal wave. President dies in plane crash, Vice takes over, orders evacuation of lower USA to Mexico, gives up on northern states. Much of the human story gets very 'hokey', and to me takes away from the drama of the Sci-Fi part, but overall an enjoyable movie for the Sci-Fi entertainment value.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good special effects.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw this on a long-haul flight a couple of weeks back and it was a toss-up between watching it or reading the in-flight magazines. The movie won but only just. The basis of the film is that global warming disrupts the ocean currents and plunges the earth into an ice age. This happens so suddenly that people are stranded and planes crash etc. etc. The rest of the film is about groups of survivors trying to make it back to civilization.Although there were a few good bits, notably the special effects, the film as a whole was fairly tiresome. For a start, the main disaster happens far too early with very little suspense or build-up. Then we're back to the standard formula of assorted groups of people trying to get to wherever they are supposed to be going. The characters are largely unbelievable and the script is totally inane. And how is it when someone has been traveling for days they still look like they're dressed up for a night on the town?The science in this film is really appalling. Nothing wrong with the basic idea of global warming but it's full of physics-defying events that left me groaning with despair. Guess I shouldn't be too surprised by this but this is a film with a real ecological message so to get the facts so wrong won't do the cause any good at all.Well if you treat this as a piece of fun and something to see on a rainy afternoon its OK.</fullReview>

And that is where the irritant is for me. No one else in the movie seems to be concerned with friends and families except this family. The scientist sidekicks don't seem to be concerned in any way with their own families. I never heard them mention them. And yet they decide they will follow Mr. Scientist into what is guaranteed to be a hellish journey to get HIS kid. Does no one in this movie have family and friends? It may seem like a small point but it bothered me enough that I couldn't enjoy the movie at all.Enjoy the special effects but don't expect much more. And if you have to have a Movie with "The Day after" in the title,stick to just those three words.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Old-fashioned disaster flick about nature run wild is not as good as the similar DEEP IMPACT, but still is mighty entertaining. The world enters a new Ice Age in this expensive-looking, CGI-laden flick. The writer-director, German-born Roland Emmerich, borrows heavily from such disaster classics as THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE and THE TOWERING INFERNO and even his own GODZILLA and INDEPENDENCE DAY. He allows time between epic scenes of disaster for some corny human interest stuff as a scientist, essayed by the stolid Dennis Quaid, braves the increasingly hostile elements to find his estranged student son (Jake Gyllenhall, who turns in the film's best performance). Several tense scenes, a PG-13 approach to death, and some eye-popping moments of destruction make this worth a look. If you suspend your sense of disbelief and play along, at times you might just feel like you are in the middle of the action. By the way, I am watching Dennis Quaid in FREQUENCY as I write this. He increasingly strikes me as the poor man's Kurt Russell. They probably bring him in when they can't get Russell. I agree with those who feel Quaid hit his peak in INNER SPACE, and that was 20 years ago. Sorry, Dennis.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dazzling dud. (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Day After Tomorrow' does have a significant message: be kind to mother nature, but it sacrificed the importance of showing this by instead focusing on big-budget special effects and your typical, end-of-the-world family reconnecting plot (that of Jack and Sam). The movie doesn't do enough to show causation (maybe in the beginning, introducing people around the world engage in what seem like daily activities...but those that obviously harm the environment because they're done dangerously and excessively). It also seemed to lighten up by making the final effects of the storm only mild. Sure, you can ice skate on the northern hemisphere, but it'll be fine in a few days. And look, everyone who got to Mexico is alright now. It's not a pretty picture, but they should've really shown the severity of what could really happen.Dennis Quaid stars as Jack, a climatologist, a fellow who's traveled around the world with his crew obviously studying changes in the climate. While at a press conference, he urges world leaders to take long-term action to reduce the activities that adding to global warming. The polar ice caps are melting and mixing too much fresh water into the North Atlantic current, which is what shifts warmer weather out across the globe. When it can't, obviously, things are going to freeze and mother nature is going to raise some hell. Of course, the only country who seems reluctant to do anything, arguing for economy's sake, is the American vice president, who won't take the time to brief the President on Jack's report and explain to the people the emergency they face and the policies that need to be in place to avoid it, or at least minimize the possible damage. Of course, the right wing politicians in this country were upset about that. Why not? They're still calling global warming a myth. And it's no surprise, what with politician's connections to oil and gas companies. Is it a wonder America is behind everyone else on environmental issues? No.Then, they have that stupid family element in the story which overtakes everything else. It obscures the importance of the movie with this dumb human interest story. Jack's son Sam is headed to New York on some sort of Academic decathelon fieldtrip. He gets trapped there when the storms erupt sooner than Jack and everyone else ever predicted. The storms come fast and they come hard. We see Los Angeles ripped apart by five or six massive tornados. Scotland turns into a giant block of ice almost immediately. And in Japan, blocks of ice the size of tether balls rain down on the city. Most of the story takes place in New York where Sam is. We see little of the effects, other than those mentioned above, which occur around the rest of the world (that's the problem with this stupid human interest element and why it turns it into every other end-of-the-world movie). New York gets flooded, then it snows, and then it freezes. The whole world seems to disappear while Sam and the few survivors wait things out on the top floor of the New York public library. And Jack is determined to get to his son via the Postman's code. Nor rain nor sleet nor snow--Jack's gonna get to Sam. And of course, he defies all laws of physics to do it. The movie should've made the message much clearer, showing all aspects of it as cause and effect. Show the things people do every day that are causing destruction. Make people second guess what it is they're doing and how necessary it is to change these simple things (recycle or die). If they're going to have a human interest story, it shouldn't have taken the priority over everything else. Watching the Jack and Sam saga for nearly three hours is actually kind of boring, much less aggravating. And as such, it fell to the formula.</fullReview>

After we seen the movie, everyone in the theater was talking about how the crazy weather was already happening and that there really were huge chunks of ice that broke off from glaciers and how we should do more to stop these disasters from happening. The movie makes you think about this really happening. I guess that's why a lot of people did not care for it. They don't want to think of things like this they only want action and special effects in movies like the comic book hero flicks. That's why things like this will probably happen sooner rather then later. People are only concerned for themselves.

		<fullReview>SPOILERS HEREINYes,Roland Emmerich is criticizing the American Government among others in THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW,his first good disaster movie after the blockbuster INDEPENDENCE DAY.But his mood has changed in this period,while he was making a highly patriotic film with INDEPENDENCE DAY(but highly enjoyable)THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW is quite the opposite.Emmerich uses in some way the same story line as of INDEPENDENCE DAY.That means:first the threat,then the discovery by scientists,then the attack of the threat and then the heroism of "Normal" people.The movie has got two typical shots at the opening and at the end.The opening credits give a great helicopter ride over the icy Northpole after which an American flag enters the image.The movie ends with a shot of a frozen,but still standing Statue of Liberty and then a shot of a half frozen Planet Earth.So,both the opening and the end have got a shot of a true American symbol and a shot of the beauty of Mother Nature.The movie itself is very enjoyable(although not as fun as INDEPENDENCE DAY,I like Aliens more as an enemy)and the effects are great.The fact that the story makes no sense is not important,people who complain about that should not go to these kind of movies.Of course the acting is bad(except for Ian Holm),but again,that's not the issue here.It's all about the special effects and the messages in the movie.First the effects:The flooding of New York is the greatest scene of the movie,finally someone who's got the guts to create a disaster scene in The Big Apple.It has always struck me that the general obsession of fear and patriotism was more important to other Americans than to New Yorkers,they went on with their lives.They had to. The tornadoes is also very cool,but tends to become something like "Been there,Done That",I mean we have Jan de Bont's TWISTER already.The destruction of the Hollywood sign was very funny though. The freezing of the building in New York is less spectacular but also impressive,as are the big shots of the city and the Planet as a whole.Emmerich uses the familiar tactic of close ups of faces in awe,after which the camera gets high to show us what the actors see.The messages in the movie are very clear.Emmerich tells us that we are going in the wrong direction.The fact that the American government as well as some other super powers are ignoring the Kyoto treaty is criticized,as is the complete humiliation and oblivion of the Third World and of course the USA-Mexico conflict considering immigration.I've seen documentaries about this border problem and it's really heartbreaking when you see Mexican families torn apart and only separated by a big fence(Ken Loach addresses this problem in his film BREAD AND ROSES).But all in all,it's all about the effects and they are great.Cause Emmerich can claim what he want,but in the making of this movie several trees from the rain forest and other natural sources were attacked to make this project possible. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd like to start by saying that i'm not a natural hater .... I just don't like cheesy movies . This movie is " Independance Day " without aliens and Will Smith.It seems to me that budget wasn't an issue , but should have been spent more equally ......... How can you put as much details in CGI ( for all climatic catastrophes ) without thinking that in a tent , at 10 degrees F you have to keep your hat on and that when you breath , steam comes out of your mouth and nose ........ And freezes immediately . Final shot : Why isn't there atmosphere around earth .......Is there still air on earth !?!?Bad movie !....... with a few amazing visual effects .But everybody doesn't seem to know that a good movie needs more than " cheesy American hero families " and CGI . What's next ? .... The day after , the day after tomorrow ...more bad weather !I think the best title would've been :" Extreme weather survival .... The American Way "</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Day After TomorrowProfessor Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) is a paleoclimatologist, who tries to warn everyone that the world is going through drastic changes effected by global warming. While trying to convince the Vice President of the United States, along with others, Jack must also rescue his son, Sam (Jake Gyllenhall), who is trapped in New York.Sam is traveling to New York City to participate in a scholastic competition, along with Laura (Emmy Rossum) and Brian (Arjay Smith). Sam has feeling for Laura, but keeps these feeling to himself. Sam seems to get close to Laura, when New York City is showered with a giant title wave, which then is frozen, due to the global warming.This is not the only natural disaster which happens. Tornadoes rip through LA, giant hail hits Tokyo and other cities which reside in the northern hemisphere. As there happen, many people don't not know what to do. So when the big freeze begins to happen, many of these people are killed because of the freezing temperatures.Will Jack get to Sam, and save him, and the other survivors along with him?My opinion...This movie is packed with heaps of breathe-taking special effects of the natural disasters. When they happened, my eyes were glued to the screen. The acting by the main characters, plus the supporting cast, were excellent.They really showed their devotion to the movie, even though they had to battle 70 mile windfans in several scenes and freezing water (though when working in the water, it was warm - found out on a making of special). If you love your disaster movies, you will have a blast with this disaster packed 2hr extravaganzer.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*** minor spoiler *** I loved every minute of this special effects laden disaster movie. I'm not a big fan of either Independance Day OR Godzilla, but all is forgiven because The Day After Tomorrow is a great film. Obviously the actors take second stage to the SFX but Dennis Quaid et al do a fine job. The Day After Tomorrow is probably the best disaster movie since The Posedion adventure, it has a good story and characters you actually care about. The highlight of the film for me was when New York ( where else ) gets hit by a tidal wave, or was it when the unsuspecting TV reporter gets to close to the tornadoes or when the RAF pilots in Scotland get more than a little chilly, hard to say The Day After Tomorrow is packed with great moments, I'm looking forward to the DVD. ***8/10***</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Day After Tomorrow is a fast paced disaster genre movie that grips your attention.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If one has the intellectual capacity to suspend disbelief and enjoy science fiction, which may have some plausibility, the movie Day After Tomorrow is a gripping, action packed film. I recognize that the events have to be speeded and compacted to accommodate the pacing of a movie, so I have no quarrel with that aspect of the movie's construct. Some degree of banality creeps in with the disaster movie template of human interest scenarios(i.e. divided families, lovable dogs and drifters, teenage love, etc.). Best memorable adult line was the one about wasting "ten-year-old scotch." I had read Whitley Streiber's sci-fi book on such a climate phenomenon a couple of years ago and thought it an interesting and exciting idea. When I heard of this movie, I had a flashback to Streiber's book. I noticed near the end of the credits Streiber was noted as "suggesting" part of the general idea for the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>superior disaster flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(some minor spoilers...)A surprisingly effective mainstream disaster film in the mould of some well-loved classics (Poseidon Adventure, Towering Inferno, etc) which doesn't stray far from the tried and tested formula but does nevertheless manage to feel inventive and modern...A good disaster film humanizes a tragedy by focusing on a small but disparate group of characters who are imperilled, and to whom we are required to form some sort of emotional attachment. When the disaster is on a relatively small scale (people trapped in burning tower, or upturned boat) this is easy enough, but as Emmerich seems to specialise in global destruction, it can be a more difficult formula to pull off. Independence Day struggled to present the viewer with anything very much to care about, with a motley assortment of two dimensional characters who never really had a chance to rise above the ridiculous plot and relentless action.TDAT is definitely more adult in its approach. It has a "message" and if the science has been 'tweaked' a little to suit a two hour film, then so be it. (Let's face it, watching a film which realistically depicts the scale of climate change would not be high on anyone's list of fun nights out.) I think he does a good job of dramatising the issues in a manner which does not seriously undermine the film's green credentials.This is helped by using the great Ian Holm to lend gravitas to some of the sciency stuff. It's a shame that Adrian Lester, one of the UK's finest actors, wasn't given a meatier role, but it's still refreshing to see a depiction of working climatologists which doesn't stereotype them as nerdy scientists with no inner life. It's also a film which at least pays lip service to there being life outside the US, with a number of scenes in Europe, and the aforementioned British actors talking about Manchester United in their Scottish hidey-hole.Which brings us back to the imperilled characters who inhabit the core of the film. For every scene in which nature wreaks havoc on a sizeable chunk of the earth (and credit due here for some truly outstanding special effects), there should be an emotional counterpoint. Dennis Quaid gives a very solid, charismatic performance as the father who mounts a polar-style expedition along the Eastern coast to reach his son. It's an interesting comparison with the Jeff Goldblum role from ID4 (also playing the "scientist who wasn't listened to and whose focus now is to save his family") and really points up the more fully fleshed out character in this film, and also the better performance. The scenes with Jake Gyllenhaal trapped in the library are also watchable, sprinkled with enough clever moments amongst the "as if?!" clichés to keep one's interest. The amusing debate over which books to burn between the bespectacled liberal and the female student ("Nietzsche?! Not Nietzsche!") was just the sort of quirky scene which elevated the film above predictable schlock.Some of the minor characters didn't do it for me - the hobo, who I guess was some sort of cypher for the less materialistic lifestyle we should be aspiring to (the simple life of the non-consumer ultimately rewarded with survival) and the dying boy patient (a little unnecessary when a whole hemisphere was about to be obliterated) both would have been more at home in Independence Day. The arrogance and ignorance of the vice president seemed very plausible, and his conversion-by-fire (or ice in this case) to accept the damage being done to the planet made for a dramatic large-scale conclusion to accompany the reconciliation of Quaid and son.The odd scene here and there veered into cheesy action flick territory. There was, as someone else has pointed out here, really no need for the "Jurassic Park with wolves" scene. And the "chased along street by lethal icy wind" scene into which it segued struck me as being risible. Quick! Close the door, before the nasty weather kills you... But none of this detracted from the enjoyment.Perhaps the most impressive achievement of TDAT is this it really did leave me with some memorable images - the ship stranded in the snow halfway up fifth avenue (or wherever it was), the icicles hanging down from the statue of liberty, the wall of water approaching manhattan, even some of the views of earth from space. In summary (no pun intended), better than expected and therefore pretty good.</fullReview>

You have a guy who figures out what no one on the planet can (Goldbloom in ID, Quaid here). Those in power don't listen until it's too late.In the President role they should have had Bill Pullman reprise his ID role.In the midst of this disaster you have a teen romance between Bubble Boy and the cute girl from Mystic River.The effects are really good in places. Really fakey in others. Especially those stupid wolves, who I'm sure were suggested by some idiot executive to give the characters more peril than just the weather.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid, entertaining disaster movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Day After Tomorrow is a workmanlike disaster movie that takes its premise seriously but not so much so that it fails as the light entertainment it is meant to be. DAT doesn't so much avoid the cliches of the genre as uses them intelligently. Director Roland Emmerich captures the good, old fashioned fun of cinematic catastrophe while avoiding the melodramatics that mar movies like The Towering Inferno and The Poseidon Adventure. The movie opens with a large chunk of the Antarctic ice cap falling into the ocean. Scientist Jack Hall witnesses the event and, with the help of a computer model designed to study ancient weather patterns, predicts that global warming is going to cause a new ice age. In fact it soon becomes clear that the climate reversals that Hall thought would take a century or more are occurring at a vastly accelerated rate. Within days the Northern Hemisphere is beset by biblical disasters and glaciers begin galloping southward. It is at this point Hall heads off for frozen New York to save his estranged son. Critics have sneered at this, citing ersatz family drama as a disaster movie cliche. The critics would have been right if situations like these were used for campy histrionics. Instead DAT makes a smart choice. Rather than have the cast emote frantically the movie leaves the theatrics to the CGI technicians. As a result the quiet tragedies the characters face stand out in relief against the cacophony of disaster that surrounds them. Dennis Quaid shines as Hall, the heroic scientist and absentee father. His intensity and utter seriousness keep the role from being consumed by its own cliches. Ian Holm is his usual memorable self as a doomed Scottish meteorologist and Kenneth Welsh gives his wrong headed US Vice President more depth than called for. Jake Gyllenhaal and Emmy Rossum are fine as the endangered son and his love interest. Together they avoid what could have been sappy pitfalls and managed to inject a little humor into their predicament. DAT fulfills its apocalyptic premise by giving you all manner of spectacular destruction. Tornados, blizzards and tidal waves rip across the screen with all the wild abandon one could wish for. Is it all convincingly real? Nope. Not at all. In DAT they have to ravish the whole Northern Hemisphere on essentially the same budget that powered just one hurricane in Twister. Exacting realism just isn't in the cards. So, instead of quality, the movie goes for imaginative quantity. You are treated to the sight of three twisters tearing the heart out of Los Angeles, a wall of water cleansing the dirty streets of New York, a tanker floating down Broadway and the Statue of Liberty waist deep in a snow drift. The Day After Tomorrow has become a lighting rod for undeserved criticism, most of it lambasting it for having the audacity to be a disaster movie. This is something like cursing the sky for being blue. So be warned, if you don't like disaster flicks DAT won't change your mind. You might even think twice about spending eight dollars to see it. But it is worth matinee prices to experience the spectacle on a wide screen. If it sounds like I'm damning this movie with faint praise I'm really not. DAD is an enjoyable movie that does its job well. If disaster is what you are in the mood for you cannot go wrong, just don't expect it to shatter your senses.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No, this movie wasn't perfect... but as I expected another "Deep Impact"-style film, or some other stupid "we-re-all-gonna-die" movie, I was very positively surprised to really kinda like this one.The story is quite believable and the scenario convincing. I'm not a scientist, but the whole idea behind the "day after tomorrow" seemed really interesting and most of all, good material for a film. Acting is OK (especially Dennis Quaid is well casted) and the whole action (you actually have no time to rest and yawn with this one, there is something thrilling happening basically all the time) and effects more than impressive! It's not like it's one of my all-time-favorites... but yes, I enjoyed it a lot.If you need some entertainment, just gather a bunch of friends and go to see this one - you're not gonna be disappointed. Expect some really good action, very fine effects... and most of all: really good time :-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was expecting of some amazing effects and i was not disappointed by that. But that was all that impressed me. Other then the effects this is not a good movie, it is a crappy movie. The main story is okay, but the character story is horrible. He risk his life trying to find his son... okay, and what is his plan when he finds him? Does he even have one? The whole movie is filled with plot holes but a lot of movies have those. But seeing that this is one boring movie i found out that trying to find plot holes was much more exciting. After the first tornadoes and the wave hits the screen i was bored. Explain to me how some people south of New York can freeze to death while resting for a bit while the main character can climb on a steel railing without gloves and is only slightly chilly? And how did the wolves come aboard? I know it is a summer movie and not an Oscar candidate but i still hate it. If they had taken away the wolves i would have given this movie a 4. But the wolves are there so i rate this crappy movie 3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did not meet expectations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film for my birthday and wished I had picked a different film instead. Coming from the makers of Independence Day, I expected a film of equal caliber and so I went excitedly to the cinema. I was sadly disappointed. The acting was not up to par and a little flat for all except Jake Gyllenhaal (actually saw some emotion from him) and Arjay Smith (he had the funniest line about being the biggest geek). The CGI wolves were not realistic and were quite obviously computer generated. The storyline was also not believable as portrayed. Yes, global warming is an issue but I do not believe it would occur as laid out in this film. For example, why did only the Northern pole begin to melt? What about Antarctica? Isn't it affected by global warming too? And the ship in NYC would have needed more space, unless the library they were in is not the same one I visited, it just would not fit. I did however, like a few of the scenes for their cinematography. The tornado cluster in LA was well done and reminded me of Twister. The other piece was when the 3 helicopters went down. The person who instantly froze upon opening the door was quite believable and well done. Though I am not a professional film critic, I would say this film only deserve 5 out of 10 stars and that is mainly due to the cinematography and the two actors mentioned above. Sadly, I do not recommend spending the money to see this at a full price cinema, maybe when it comes to DVD or to one of those inexpensive cinemas that shows films a few months old if you must see it on the big screen. Thanks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie billed itself as a disaster movie, but as the climactic events began to occur it became obvious it was a comedy. The laughable science that the writer/director used made possible frightening events into hearty chuckles! Evacuating the entire southern U.S....HA HA HA, Ice age in a week! HA HA HA... Helicopters frozen right out of the sky! HA HA HA HA HA... Only Monty Python could've exaggerated more but of course they're trying to be funny! The initial theory that the writer is using is a well established one but the truth is that when the events begin to occur the process will take decades to centuries to change the weather on the earth. The tornado scene in Los Angeles is probably the funniest in the film. Not only do tens of tornados all appear at the same time in a small geographical area, but they specifically go after the weather reporters for the local t.v. station! I believe these were "smart storms" taking out the enemy!I also appreciated the wolves that escaped from the zoo who were ravenous and going after our main characters. The fact that there were millions of dead bodies lying about after the storm surge apparently didn't satisfy the hunger of these wolves and they were forced to hunt fresh meat! Of course, the storm surge came into Manhattan but forgot to leave, then it froze in a matter of hours! Salt water, at depths of 50 feet and more, freezing in a matter of hours! You have to love the imagination of this writer! Enjoy the laughs!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe because my expectations of this film were so high that when i finally saw it I felt disappointed after seeing it. Roland Emmerich seemed to borrow the same structure plot as he did in ID4. If your going to try to get a message across about global warming this is probably not the kinda movie to do it with. Yeah you have floods and tornado's and hurricanes in places they aren't common in being...But i don't feel many people went to see this movie because it was focusing on global warming, people went to see this movie because of the action it portrayed in the trailers with these huge tidal waves in N.Y and tornado's in L.A. As far as that goes i never had the feeling of being whoa that kind really happen? My feeling was like yeah thats cool. Another thing is you really never got a chance to connect with the characters. You never felt that urgency of real danger such as how are the characters going to survive..oh and don't get me started about the wolves ....in simple terms this would of been a nice 2 or 3 part Mini series on prime time as for the big screen..it's a disappointment. **/****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not a lot of good movies in the theaters on this blow-off afternoon, so I thought I'd go see something mindless. Mission accomplished!*** A MASSIVE LIST OF SPOILERS FOLLOWS, AS IF YOU REALLY CARE ***The premise is that the global melting of glaciers causes a sudden shift in ocean currents, shutting down the Gulf Stream and plunging the Northern Hemisphere into an Ice Age in a week. OK, fine. The premise of cinema itself involves willful suspension of disbelief at some point. Fair enough. I can accept this concept and watch the movie.But I can only suspend so much disbelief. It only took about ten minutes before I found myself shaking my head. A partial list of stupidities follows: The galley cart careening down the aisle of the plane in heavy turbulence. Killer tornadoes ripping down half of downtown L.A. (and causing an earthquake at the same time) - oh, but only after hitting their first target, the Hollywood sign. Helicopters suddenly falling from the sky because it's too cold. NASA having to ask space station astronauts if the clouds are dissipating, even though we have dozens of weather satellites orbiting the earth. Cellphones still working when all of New York is underwater and without power. Our protagonist having enough time to run half a block, grab his prospective girlfriend from a cab and escape to safety while a 100 foot high wall of water bears down on him. Already-frozen objects icing up when a blast of -150 F air hits them. Our protagonist's father surviving a hike from Philly to New York in weather so cold "you freeze to death in seconds". A container ship gliding a mile or more up a New York avenue without hitting any buildings. Timber wolves chasing three kids around said ship when there must be hundreds of thousands of dead bodies around for them to eat. Seven people in the poorly insulated New York Public Library being the only survivors of the big storm, among two million. Said survivors debating whether to burn a Gutenberg Bible for heat when they've got literally tons of magazines and pulp novels to burn instead.Once you get beyond the things that are physically unbelievable, you realize that to make this pseudo-scientific drama more human, the writers have incorporated more worn-out plot devices than you can preserve for eternity in the Bering Glacier: the budding teen romance, the more-confident kid who threatens it, the distant father, the conniving vice president. And what bad movie of this genre would be complete without a British-accented scientist at some point uttering, "My God!" At one point I found myself speculating whether this movie might have what it takes to become a campy cult classic.What amuses me is that in Real Life, our president has ordered NASA and NOAA not to speak to the press about this movie. Presumably they are afraid to fuel the public's concerns about climate change. They have nothing to worry about. Any scientist who confirmed the theories in this movie would have to be even nuttier (or more "bought") than the rare few who deny the existence of climate change. It's really too bad this movie was so over the top, because climate change is a serious issue, rational discussion of which is undermined by the blatant unbelievability of this movie.On the good side, the special effects are pretty spectacular and more realistic-looking than a lot of what I've seen the last couple of years. As a result, I have to give this one 3/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much Better than You've Heard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By this time, you know the plot, so this is simply a quick, subjective reaction. I had low expectations for this film, and that was perhaps why I was pleasantly surprised.Yeah, it hits all the correct PC notes, but, like Independence Day, it manages to do a semi-credible job of showing us what it would be like, at least in parts of the US, IF the premise of the film came to pass.There are a lot of dramatic conveniences, but the effective and sometimes stunning visuals are compelling. Too, the story of the father reaching out to his estranged son carries a certain iconic emotional weight that pushes us past some of the illogical choices.Overall, this is the first Big Summer Film I've seen this season that didn't disappoint. Van Helsing was crippled by anachronistic cleverness, Harry Potter, beautiful to look at but light on plot detail...The Day After Tomorrow, for all it's Big Budget, had modest aspirations and met all of them.Very enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So much could have been done with this. So little actually was. I guess what I expected was something a leetle beet more scientific and with better special effects, or use thereof. Instead it was like watching an Irwin Allen flick with all of these little dramas going on - none of which is all that interesting to start with. Mr. Quaid is wasted here but does a believable job. Part of the problem there is that none of the personalities are sketched beyond a rough draft. Walking talking cliches. I lived with them before in movies and had a good time - ho hum - I'll do it again.Ok, let me rip into those special effects. Some are quite good. One is even impressive. But the weather scenes in LA? Sometimes, boys, less is more. They may wish to consider that. Oh, they may even wish to consult a Meteorology 101 class as well. And those animals effects. After this scene I realized I was watching 'Airport' or 'The Towering Inferno' with ice. So, I geared down my expectations. I geared way down when I saw the VP clone. &gt;winkie&lt;If it was not for Mr. Quaid there would be no acting in this film.Virtually every unlikely yet plausible cliche occurs in this. We found more than a handful of obvious unresolved issues and paradoxes with reality. So, overall the story isn't even that good. But an unusual thing happened. I watched this whole movie - the time went quickly - and I had to admit it wasn't a complete waste. This movie could have been so much better. The hype seems to suggest one thing, but the movie isn't a blueprint for world destruction. It's 'Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea' on the rocks. The paranoid side of me thinks that this is a government plant designed to make us sensitive to the potential of the issue of global warming.I give it a 7. It was OK for what it was. It is a shame for what it wasn't. Most people should enjoy it on some level.</fullReview>

Crossing the Rio in droves-turnabout being fair play...Bad sequences-the wolves were idiotically done. The ship scraping right by the library, yah right. The pay phones working under 9 feet of water. Quaid thinking he can drive/snowshoe from Philly to NY in the middle of the Instant Ice Age. And didn't we somehow forget about the South Pole being Arctic too and maybe there'd be some Freezing all along S America, Aussie, S Africa, etc? Sure guys all in the north....This is simply your basic Disaster flick ala ID4, the Poseidon Adventure etc etc. Enjoy it for what it is. I liked the F/X and enjoyed the fam. faces as I said, though it's quite as believable as Armageddon and not as funny.*** for the Big Freeze.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent, Kept My Interest From the Start</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was the best that I have seen in the last year. It kept my interest from the start. The scary thing is that I can see this happening. The actors were great. And the special effects were some of the best that I have seen. I would recommend this movie to anyone, It was worth the money that we spent. It reminds me a lot of what can happen if we do not watch the global warming. To think that people were warned of what was going to happen and did not pay attention. To think that the world could loose so many people due to the Government not listening is far beyond my thoughts. This movie reminds me a lot of the movie with the meteor coming into our atmosphere, I can't remember the name of that movie, but again just imagine what could happen if it were true?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, wouldn't you know it, the world is coming to an end and once again, it's all our fault! This disaster-piece destroys Emmerich's favourite targets: New York, Los Angeles and Washington! Unfortunately, there are not enough Americans running for their lives in this feature as the dozen or so people we are forced to sit around and watch flatline the movie to death as best they can.Three super-hurricanes descend upon the Earth and create a new ice age in a way that only Roland Emmerich can understand.A dozen or so actors show up and the only character the audience cared about was the homeless guy with his intuitive dog. The hope of seeing a true disaster movie as everyone getting demolished or maybe even a type of actioner where mankind does their physical best against nature would have been better and more fun. Seeing the disasters might be a well rent, but the acting is more dulling of the mind if anything. This disaster-piece failed to deliver.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Special Effects Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, so, I went to see the movie because it seems as if natural disaster movies have become quite the rave over the last six or seven years --- from earthquakes ("Earthquake") to tornadoes and volcanoes ("Twister", "Dante's Peak" and "Volcano") to comets and asteroids ("Deep Impact", "Armageddon", and "Asteroid") to even the earth's core acting all crazy ("The Core")."The Day After Tomorrow" doesn't have much of a story line but the special effects are terrific. It basically shows what could very well happen if man-kind doesn't stop polluting the atmosphere.But --- let's be honest here --- large industrial countries like the U.S.A. really don't give a damn about Global Warming. I mean, yeah, they pay lip service to it, but nations like this one are built around individuals owning and driving their own vehicles. They "seem" to care about Global Warming but people aren't about to give up the luxury of being able to drive their own cars, no matter how much the environment suffers.Someone is going to have to mass produce vehicles that run on water --- and stop pumping out these fossil fuel guzzlers --- if they want people to stop polluting the air with carbon monoxide. Plain and simple.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Roland Emmerich may have scored huge with ID4, but the film was crippled by gung-ho flag-waving and a reluctance to explore the dark nature of the story. I think that Emmerich is a far better director than writer, but even though he once more pens the screenplay here he wisely opts to make it a much more serious film. Where he once destroyed the Big Apple and the Big Orange with fire, now he does it with water, but no one's laughing. And Will Smith isn't in it.Dennis Quaid (brother of ID4's hero) stars as a climatologist who predicts that a new ice age will freeze Planet Earth within the next few hundred years. An enormous chunk of the Larsen Ice Shelf in Antarctica breaks off and melts into the Atlantic, shutting down the gulf stream. Hurricanes form all over the world, with twisters and storms ripping though major cities. A flood submerges New York, trapping Jake Gyllenhaal and his classmates in the New York Public library. With nowhere to go they wait it out as dad Quaid promises to rescue them.There's no winning this time round. Everyone is a loser as the world goes into a deep freeze, covering most of America and Europe in a hundred feet of snow. But this film is about the journey, and the destination, not the end result. There are some clichés and a little bit of humor, but they're all subdued and do not annoy as much as they did in ID4. The only disappointment is Harald Kloser's bland, uninteresting score with is a far cry from the sorrowful, romantic themes from Armageddon by Trevor Rabin, an approach which really could have worked here.While it ain't no masterpiece, it's one of Emmerich's better movies and, despite the exaggerated portrayal of climate change, will last for the ages, unlike it's alien invasion older brother.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What I learned from `The Day After tomorrow'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't let a rookie run the core drill!!!No one thought it was possible but polar ice is more fragile than it looks and only the most experienced technician should be taking the samples. This movie tries to blame the ensuing disaster on some mythical global warming but it's clear that the real villains are the reckless environmental researchers. If it wasn't for them punching holes in the ice it never would have happened! I'm telling you people we need to stop all our careless `scientific' research now and just live in ignorant bliss.(That's what I got from this film)I also got that this happened before. Did the Wooly Mammoth's flatulence cause global warming? I don't recall anyone mentioning a meteor strike...isn't that what caused the last ice age? I'm so confused.I also learned that the poor innocent politicians get the blame for something that no doubt started well before they were ever elected and that scientist are the first to point the finger. The finger should be pointed at the software engineer who wrote the buggy CAD system that was used to design the flawed core drill that when operated by a novice can cause the ice to fail?ironic how our rush to technology was our eventual downfall. (or is that just poetic?) Anyway ? if you liked the deep heart wrenching story in Twister, then this is your film. The filler they used to stretch this out to 2 hours had the audience laughing when they shouldn't, and applauding at our own suffering. The effects are very nicely done and represent an evolution in doing massive realistic computer simulations. (Except for the lame ass wolves) The ONLY reasons to see this film in the theater ARE the effects. The `message' this film tries to convey is so transparent and presented in such a laughable manner, I think it is doing the environment more harm than good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>8.50 I'll never see again. And if there's any mercy in this life, I won't see this "film" again either. This is one of those movies where the script is bad, the acting is worse, the direction/editing still worse than that, and the effects pretty good. The foreshadowing they try to pull off is done with all the subtlety of a smack in the head with a sledgehammer. Most of the script just seems to be thought up to get a cool effects shot(but the tornadoes really, to me, look just like the ones in Twister, and the flood looks like they just re-used the footage from Independance day of the cars being picked up and tossed down the street, but with a wall of water behind them instead of fire.) And it would have been nice if it had been the least bit plausible- I mean, a guy freezing solid in seconds? The fuel in the helicopter instantly freezing(at 150 below zero)? I like disaster flicks and all, but they have to be good. This one, people in the theater were laughing at. And not when they were making jokes. Funnier than any joke in the movie is a scene where they go and use the "Evil Dead" technique of showing you the monster's point of view as it chases the terrified teenagers down the hallway. This works well when the monster is an undead zombie or some sort of mysterious evil creature. It doesn't work so well when the "monster" is, in fact, really cold air.Anyway, if you want to waste your money and time on this drivel, feel free. Just know in advance that you have to drop about 50 IQ points to reach the required level of suspension of disbelief to enjoy this movie.</fullReview>

Not only did we laugh and yell at the screen, but there were some parts of this movie that were real tear-jerkers. Some people may not agree but I think that the director did a great job on it. The actors were great, and the message got across clearly, I think. I'm not going to be paranoid, however, and run around screaming "THE WORLD IS GONNA END!" But I do feel that the movie gets the point across about global warming and it's effects. The Day After Tomorrow held me on the edge of my seat and I know that when it comes out on DVD I'm going to be one of the first to buy it. I really liked this movie, and think it deserves more than what people are saying about it.</fullReview>

The acting was good although a couple of the lines were a bit tacky; all the main characters played their parts well. The Storylines were good as well.The special effects were one of the main reasons I went to see this film and I was not disappointed, they were great, the bit where the Hollywood sign got destroyed was a bit over the top but who cares its a film. The best bit was when all the buildings were freezing up when they were in the center of the storm. I would defiantly recommend this film to anybody, if you're going to see it go to a showing in a big screen because it makes the special effects even better. I though rely enjoyed this film, it's even worth a second viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, does Emmerich hate NYC? He blasts us in ID4 (another stupid movie, see War of the Worlds instead), sends us that Lame Godzilla and now this. He needs to meet a NYer and get punched in the face! (Joking). This film was a stinker. Pseudo-science, a moron VP who was so obviously Dick Cheney, three good acting performances (Quaid, Tomita and Holm - who was wasted in this role) and a bunch of great SFX DON'T MAKE A GREAT FILM! The matrix sequels had great SFX and were boring as all hell. This wasn't as dull, but it was as dumb. Ice Ages do not happen in ten days. People do not freeze to death in seconds, but that's beside the point. Most of the cast seems to sleepwalk through this and the dialogue is so lame. The guy I rooted most for was the Homeless guy with the Dog. They made it, that made me pretty happy. The political sub messages I could have done without. This was just another over budgeted, understoried popcorn film. Between remakes and less than good scripts, I wonder why I even go to the movies. I will say that the SFX were spectacular, but the film wasn't. Wait for DVD or PPV.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This should have been a silent film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am rarely motivated to write a movie review and I was hoping to forget 'The Day After Tomorrow', well, by the day after tomorrow, but after I saw some people giving this 'film' a 10, I was more than a little stunned. I was shocked. I was so shocked that I was compelled to express my opinion because $10.50 is a lot of money to spend on a movie and you might just want to hold off on this one. Just a warning that there might be spoilers ahead, although I think that most of what I have mentioned has been regurgitated in trailers and interviews in the overbloat of press this film has already received.I didn't expect much from 'The Day After Tomorrow' other than cool eye-candy with a sci-fi/ action bent, but my enjoyment of this firm was severely hampered by it's lack of everything but special effects. Moviegoers should be insulted and outraged that Roland Emmerich believes us to be such morons that we wouldn't think the premise laughable or that we have enough brain cells to require even a vaguely believable story.My main problem with the film is the foundation on which it is based-a sudden Ice Age, preceded by a 'super-storm' that instantaneously freezes everything in it's path, all triggered by the effects of global warming. I am not a scientist, but I am also not an idiot. I would have had an easier time believing that the cousins of the aliens that were defeated in 'Independence Day' came back and zapped the Earth with a giant 'Freeze-o-ray'. Had these chilling events taken place over a much longer timeframe, perhaps suspending belief may have been a little easier, but then again, 'The Millennium After This Millennium' isn't quite as catchy. I'm sure in the hands of a talented screenwriter and director, this concept could have been not only credible, but interesting and thrilling. This is not the case here.To make matters worse, Emmerich dragged out every disaster movie cliché he could think of to substitute having to create any kind of story-and poorly at that. The crapfest escalates from the standard tale of a family separated as the impending doom approaches when such formulaic obstacles arise like a wife in jeopardy when she can't leave her wide-eyed young cancer patient behind, a bull-headed vice president and clueless president fumble the ball and make the situation worse (wonder where this 'plot' was borrowed from??), and a super- hero climatologist that can somehow trek hundreds of miles in the snow while mere mortals all pass out from the cold and die. But the most amazing of these plot devices is how the geeky son also gains super-powers (and imagine, just the day before he was failing calculus!) and now he can scale frozen ocean liners without mittens, make a homemade syringe out of charred encyclopedias and splinters to inject Penicillin into his dying love interest (must have been in the deleted scenes because I'm not sure just how his dying love interest was saved with just a bottle of injectable Penicillin and no syringe) and fend off a pack of rabid wolves with a ginsu knife (as if freezing to death wasn't enough). The son also suddenly has full understanding of climatology after a 5 second-long underwater conversation on a pay- phone with his climatologist father (not quite sure how the NYC pay-phone worked underwater as most of them don't even seem to work even when it isn't raining buckets) where the topic isn't mentioned, but he somehow knows that the approaching wall of gray special effects is bad and should be rapidly avoided. I can't say that the acting was bad because the actors didn't say much other that 'Get out of the way!' and 'Watch out!' Perhaps films of this genre would make the case for computer generated actors to a) save money and 2) preserve the reputations of the actors that trade in their integrity for the 'big pay day'. However, I give kudos to Jake Gyllenhaal because I read somewhere that he attempted to improvise some of his lines to make them better-notably visible in the heartfelt tap on the shoulder he gave to said love interest so they could scamper away from the approaching wall of Atlantic Ocean. That worked much better than the prescribed 'Look out!'The only part of the movie that was enjoyable was the special effects-the flooding and freezing of New York was pretty cool, the hail storms were very realistic, and the computer- generated storm graphics were impressive. The only special-effects which could have been better was the tornado-destruction of L.A. Although I enjoyed watching L.A. have it's first really bad hair day, it looked too much like animation. However, I could have sat for two hours just watching the special effects without any of the characters or 'plot' (or audio) and would have enjoyed the film much more. It is sad that Roland Emmerich chose to infuse such an important message about global warming into such a ridiculous package. And make no mistake-the message is quite heavy-handed throughout, down to blaming the no-so-coincidental look-alike Bush-Cheney nincompoops for freezing the entire population of the northern states. Perhaps Emmerich conceived the film in response to Bush's tragic pull-out from the Kyoto Protocol, which will have a serious impact on the environment. However, the hundreds of millions of dollars would have been better spent elsewhere (removing Bush from office perhaps?) rather than making this waste of a film that misinforms the world about the true catastrophic effects of global warming.So let's recap-a premise that doesn't make sense, no plot, actors that could've been replaced by CGI, and a resulting film that belittles the true global warming cause-I'd say we should all band together and get our money back from Fox.</fullReview>

If your looking for a 2 hour documentary or educational seminar on global warming this movie is not for you but if you seek entertainment this is good entertainment. Dennis Quaid puts in a good performance and is supported by a capable cast. The opening scene is well shot and a thrilling introduction to the film. The suspense and thrills are well paced and at no point does the movie seem to lag. The portrayal of the powers that be was a bit harsh however, there is a reality in the suffering of the masses because of slow reaction by the government. The story line is typical of the genre but its the visuals that set this movie apart, a visual masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epiphany</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You can read my posts earlier this week about the movie. I was skeptical, to say it the least. I'm happy to say I was completely wrong. Emmerich have learned a LOT since id4, and he must have had something similar to an epiphany. I loved the story from start to finish. We are presented head-on to the cataclysmic, totally unpredictable results of global warming. Los Angeles is destroyed by supertornados, and it's just getting worse from there. The special effects are absolutely stunning, and very necessary for the story, but the human element is never forgotten, and it is through them we experience the horror, a horror of humanity's own making. The current US administration is fiercely attacked, as they should be. I have always seen Emmerich as a right-wing/conservative, but if he was, he has clearly had a change of heart. My belief is that there will be no ice age, that it will «just» get warmer, a lot warmer, that the ocean will rise dramatically (about seventy meters/yards) when all ice on the globe melts, that we'll have an increase in the number and strength of storms, and that civilization will be completely destroyed, not just partially. But still, this is a great story, an important story that I hope will provoke debate all over the world. It will be a surprise if it is an economic success, since it's dealing with a very serious subject in a serious manner. We can only hope. It will be typical if the rather stupid id4 will be Emmerich's most successful movie. The right wing press and paid posters are gearing up. It's amazing how afraid they are of this movie, of any story, calling a spade a spade. We see it here, there and everywhere. Good. The movie has them running scared, scared that a majority will realize the truth and act accordingly.Very good.Another quality (of many) in the film's favor</fullReview>

Sci-fi fans will have a cult in the making. The only parts of the movie the really looks awful is the typical newsreel cuts from old storms events out of CNN or ABC news stock footage archives showing the same roof ripping scenes we all already seen countless of times at the Discovery Channel's million dollar storms. (Maybe they run out of money), Other than that the first hour will be like ID4, lots of jaw dropping effects leaving you very tire for the melancholic second hour of the movie, Roland Emmerich fans will have what they ask for. Fox will make lots of money and an environmental statement will be set. In the other hand conservative SUV drivers will see this like a B-Grade made for TV just to hurt the feelings of the average oil economy supporter. Anyway, I personally suggest if you the type that care about poor planet Earth's Amazon jungle go and see it, otherwise don't bother and skip it, or instead... go and check out Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 to get an eye opening view of where this world is really heading.</fullReview>

Don't even bother looking for a political message because you would have to have a chip on your shoulder to locate one. I will not spoil any of the scenes, but I will say that the movie delivers but it does have some necessary inaccuracies, such as: the timeline for the development of an ice age would be somewhere around 10,000 years- we only have a couple of hours in a film so of course this element is exaggerated.

		<fullReview>After a promising start in the American cinema with two good films like "Universal Soldier", the best Van Damme movie (along with 'Timecop') and, above all 'Stargate', Emmerich joined the club of big budgets' Independence Day ', interesting alien invasion film with a patriotism exacerbated. Then he made his version of the Japanese giant monster "Godzilla", 'The Patriot'. And finally, he directed 'The Day After Tomorrow' ... where again the best Emmerich. Without giving up the big show and exhibiting in 'Independence Day' and 'Godzilla' but with a script, we offer an adventure movie with a group of excellent actors (Dennis Quaid terrific and very good too Jake Gyllenhaal and Emmy Rossum, also highlight Jay O. Sanders and Dash Mihok) and some impressive special effects (something normal in the Emmerich film).The value of this film is remarkable because it is interesting to everything based on the strength of nature and man trying to survive. Movies like "Alive" 1993, "Armageddon" 1998, "Cast Away" 2000, "The Perfect Storm" 2000 ... like them because they show that the universe has forces that man can not fight, just adapt. I think it's one of the best disaster movies that have been made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Day After Tomorrow" isn't just fiction. It's fascinating and scary the way it comes close to reality. I mean, what we see in this movie might happen someday. The global warming isn't a game, it's a serious subject. Its consequences might be tragic."The Day After Tomorrow" is a reasonable movie, without much boring moments. The story is intriguing, the visuals are amazing, the special effects are impressing and stunning, the actors's performances are great (especially by Dennis Quaid - at his best here) and the movie has a good combination of drama, suspense, thriller, adventure and tension.The only negative side of its special effects is that, in some cases, they are unbelievably quick. For example, when the ice freezes in only very few seconds. We all know that's impossible.This is a movie to teach us to give the deserved value to Mother Nature and to take care of it, before it's too late. It also focus on things such as the value of family and friendship.Overall, an acceptable movie which also makes us think.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The thing that makes this unbearable is that the movie presents itself as fact and very clearly is based on grossly overcompensated estimates of doomsday climatology. It would have been as believable to have a Death Star in the picture, sorry, more believable to have a Death Star in the picture. There are some very neat special effects, the acting is alright, but the plausibility of what is happening in the movie detracts greatly from the otherwise good performances in the film. There are very dramatic moments in the film which do justice to the people who deliver the lines. The major problem being the pseudo-science presented as likely possibility has ruined an otherwise fun film. It comes off as very preachy towards the viewers who paid just to see the special effects. The more disturbing part of seeing a film like this is that when you are walking out, you have to deal with the idiots who say to others, "This could really happen, and next week for God's sakes!!"Worth a rental if you are bored, no more than that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Would You Do A Neanderthal? The Question of the Ice Age</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Day After Tomorrow is a well done action thriller where the world seems to fall at the hands of mother nature. Is it all the fault of the bad climates or do humans have something to do with it all? You will have to watch and see. Apart from the almost unreal consequences that rapidly seem to unfold during the course of the film, there are the usual parallel love stories and funny side characters that seem to have some say in the overall outcome of the story and other small nuances that make the audience laugh, or at the very lease, just smile. Would I have gone to see this in the theatres? No. In fact, I don't think it was in the theatres for very long, probably one of those summer flop films that survive for just entertainment. I do however think that there are some important messages that the US administration has to say at the end of the movie ? almost touching, in fact. Aside from its oddly James Bond type title, be aware that the action is more real and the science more Bond-like. Be prepared to say "that's just not true, and wouldn't happen." The special effects are superb and show off what modern CGI graphics can pull off without cardboard cutouts. RATING: 6/10"Uh, you guys ? there are some books on Tax Law here that we can burn!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Global warming on a grand, grand scale!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite some of the negative comments, this is well worth seeing for the awesome special effects alone. I wish the armchair critics would stop trying to analyze the "logic" behind this project and sit back and enjoy a good blockbuster thrill ride, which is obviously the aim of director Roland Emmerich. It's not meant to be a serious documentary about global warming, for God's sake! Sure, there are plot holes galore and the scientific data is not completely plausible, but this was meant to entertain popcorn audiences on a grand level of spectacular special effects and stunts, and it succeeds brilliantly on that level, greatly aided by a pulsating background score that accentuates the shocks and a soundtrack that gives all the visuals an extra punch.My chief complaint, if we must insist on logic, is the fact that we have to accept the idea that a scientist would decide that he must walk to New York from Philadelphia at the height of the most drastic weather the world has ever known. This is where the script really requires the viewer to forget reason and concentrate on the stormy weather and chillingly spectacular photography.Clearly, this is meant to be nothing more than spellbinding entertainment for the masses, not a serious treatment of global warming despite such pretensions. Enjoy the awesome effects and forget logic. The viewer has to realize it's all in the realm of impossibility anyway--so stop nitpicking every little scientific point and enjoy what is meant to be riveting entertainment.The performances are all competent enough, nothing deep required. Dennis Quaid, Emmy Rossum, Sela Ward and Jake Gyllenhaal bring some humanity to the proceedings and make us believe in their dire predicaments. The understated romance between Rossum and Gyllenhaal is nicely handled. And speaking of the cinematography, the opening shot under the credits is one of the most visually stunning achievements in the whole film.Sit back and enjoy the thrill ride!! Yeah, baby, it's cold outside!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked how they tossed in a few little shots when it comes to how some Americans treat illegal immigration and how some do take advantage of our natural resources and it is detrimental. But other than the little learning lessons they tried to put out there this was a pretty good movie. It was the story of survival which isn't original but the cast was pretty good and watching New York get flooded and then turn into a winter wonderland was really quite aesthetically pleasing. It's one of those movies that has a gloomy but at the same time optimistic ending. The best part about the movie is it isn't dinosaurs or aliens or an invading country that threatens the survival of others.. it's mother nature. The one thing we can't win a war against :).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>woeful plot, but it's always fun watching film makers devastate America</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS In 2004, Roland Emmerich, creator of fun films like "Independence Day" and "Stargate" wrote, directed and produced his latest disaster film. Based around the ecological problems of the world, Emmerich created a film which has a dreadful script, but is saved purely by the way in which it depicts the slow destruction of America.Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) is in the antarctic when he makes a discovery. Believing the world is facing another ice age in a hundred years or so, Hall is shocked when Terry Rapson (Ian Holm) contacts him with the news that events are happening sooner than expected. Suddenly the world's climate begins to go wrong and Hall sets out on a personal mission across America to save a family member.The earliest you abandon hope of a decent story, the sooner you begin to enjoy this film. Whilst Quaid, Jake Gyllenhaal and others all perform admirably, the flaw is that Emmerich's script is truly awful. It has some of the most annoying lines ever written, and a plot which is predictable and tedious. So, the story should be abandoned the second you put the film on.Like so many other disaster films, for example "The Core", the beauty of "The Day After Tomorrow" is the way it destroys the planet, especially America. With a scene where the Hollywood scene is wiped off the map, it's hard not to find this film amusing. It's not that people hate America, it's purely that watching the place be destroyed is always amusing.In fact, that is the key of this film. The graphics are outstanding with huge amounts of water and ice looking realistic and brilliant. The film is worth watching just for that."The Day After Tomorrow" is a dire film saved by it's special effects. Roland Emmerich has a record as a special effects, directorial guru, sadly though, he needs to learn that a film cannot survive purely on it's graphics. This film needs a decent plot and it simply doesn't deliver it.</fullReview>

It is SO bad that it is still playing downstairs while I'm typing this. Even though I paid for it. CRAPPY.The black man/dog, weird tremors, every bad element and more from the above mentioned movies is here. WHY? Why god, why is this movie in existence. THAT is how awful it is.DO NOT RENT THIS MOVIE.If I hadn't paid the money for it, I'd have stopped the movie. I may as well have since I'm not watching it and just online upstairs. This is insane.

People would flock to see the special effects...and with little overhead with no salaries to pay useless producers and directors who make junk films like "the day after tomorrow," the effects people would make a huge bundle money that they could keep to themselves.

		<fullReview>THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW (I think that is how it's spelled), vividly depicts one of the greatest fears of nature-loving individuals. This film clearly gives knowledge that man-kind is destroying the environment and that in order to save or preserve what is left of mother nature, every single person must assist with their part in rebuilding all damage. This action movie is exciting and leaves one at the edge of the seat; but it is more than a mere object for entertainment, it was produced to inform all of us that if as consumers and polluters we do not act now, we will most probably destroy our beautiful planet and home.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Roland Emmerich:He may not be great, but he gets the job done!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in 2000, director Roland Emmerich made THE PATRIOT, an terrific film about the Revolutionary War. But that's not the Roland we all know and love. No, the real Roland makes big, grandiose movies where talented but inexpensive actors get to dodge full-scale destruction of recognizable landmarks. Unlike Michael Bay (his primary competitor in this field), Mr. Emmerich doesn't like to fake us out with rapid editing. He wants us to take good long looks at the carnage which he is unleashing. And unlike many cynical, snide young filmmakers of today, he takes his work seriously . there are no knowing, post-modern winks to break the 4th wall, there is no supercilious disdain for the characters gracing his screens. When the actor James Spader was approached for the Emmerich sci-fi opus STARGATE, he initially wanted to turn it down because the script was not very good. Emmerich responded that the adventure of getting such a monumental film onto the screen would by its very nature create all the inherent drama the film would need. Roland was right back then, and that very philosophy continues to serve him right up to THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW. No matter how much of the movie is achieved through digital effects (which better win the Oscar if there's any justice on the planet), there is a sheer sense of awe at the blood sweat and tears that must have gone into creating this behemoth.Finally, it's fun to see a movie take its liberal message and couch it in such a populist entertainment that it will play in red and blue states with equal success.I love ya, Roland. The critics may sneer, the aesthetes may jibe, but film in, film out, the people come to see you, and rest assured that I'll be there for your next movie, too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a truly great catastrophe movie. It is a typical Hollywood product, so you have to be tolerant towards the tired reenactment of worn clichés. Also, you might regard the speculations of a new ice age as a placeholder for a plausible explanation, or just take it as the ordinary right to speculate that we grant sf writers. Finally, they don't know anything about wolves, but...shrug. It's a very well done movie. It has a perfect dramatic build-up, awesome effects and it does not become too cheesy. I enjoy seeing New York and Los Angeles getting smashed up so much that I have watched it three times already. Another delirious moment is when Mexico closes the border and Us citizens enter Mexico illegally. Finally the movie is a starting point for serious informaton and discussion about global warming and pending disasters. There is one very interesting fact in this movie that I must point out. You have seen in Hollywood movies that cars and helicopters explode if they crash. As seen in this movies, that is not valid for British helicopters. They crash with no explosion, thus making survival possible. I hope that American manufacturers of cars and helicopters will take this fact to their hearts when making new designs.</fullReview>

The loving yet neglected wife. The bitter and neglected son. The love interest. The cocky naive side kick. The salty veteran that dies), predictable scenes (hmmm, I wonder when the wolves are going to come into play?), Heston-esque moments ("When will people learn!") and just plain stupidity (wouldn't all those wood desks have burned a lot longer than continually burning paper from books? Walking to New York in a blizzard from just outside Philly?)This isn't a roller coaster ride of fun, it's simply insulting. Even if you haven't seen it, you've seen it.

		<shortDescription>Over-hyped, disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a film that had potential but fell far short of my expectations. It had an excellent cast that was wasted with over-used apocalyptic clichés and poor dialogue that I came to easily anticipate. It came across as being rapidly thrown together, packaged and then tossed out to get it to the screen. The opening of the film in the arctic was an excellent setup for the whole story, especially with the sudden cracking of the ice shelf. After that point, the whole story took a nose-dive. Where to begin.... For starters, it was scientifically unbelievable for such a sudden climate shift to occur and instantly begin melting polar ice at such a dramatic rate. Even the largest sections of polar ice that have broken apart in reality have never done this nor affected ocean currents as depicted. The multiple-tornadic storms over Los Angeles were completely implausible on the scale shown and the massive, hurricane-like storms drawing freezing air from the near-vacuum of the outer atmosphere all fed the impression that this was a story that had to build into a "mankind-is-doomed" warning very quickly. And, I'm sorry, but for Dennis Quaid and his pals to walk in a blizzard from eastern Pennsylvania to New York city was a total miss.Dennis Quaid and Ian Holm are awesome talents deserving of a better script. In the tent outisde New York when Quaid's character warns that "mankind must learn from his mistakes" with fossil fuels??? Even Jake Gyllenhaal, an emerging talent, warranted better lines than where he warned everyone leaving the library about the storm; "It's going to get bad....really, really bad...." There were relationships to tug at your heartstrings. Sela Ward worrying about the child cancer patient, Dennis Quaid saying good-bye to Ian Holm in snow-ridden Scotland and then Jake Gyllenhaal finally connecting with Emmy Rossum's "I-secretly-do-care-for-you" Laura character.The political messages were there, too. Who couldn't tell that Kenneth Welsh was a direct comparison to Vice President Cheney (of the "evil" corporation Halliburton)? The dialogue given his character about the how all this would affect the economy was an obvious political ploy and had no other reason in the story at all. Don't forget the obvious presence of the Saudi representatives at the beginning during the summit on "global warming".This doesn't come close to better disaster films such as "Deep Impact" or "Earthquake" from the 1970's. At the least, those films are much closer to scientific and human reality and had better screen writing. The special effects of "The Day After Tomorrow" were very good but not enough to rescue the story. I borrowed a copy from a friend and glad I didn't spend the cash to rent it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really liked Stargate, so I had to give this one a shot, and I have to admit that Roland Emmerich delivers eye candy by the boatload. But I have several problems with the movie. First, it is encumbent upon a writer to lure us into his premise by careful and deliberate steps designed to persuade us to suspend our disbelief. Emmerich has a speech regarding global climate changes being delivered in India, and as we step outside, the changes have already materialized. Is that a setup? Man, that is weak! Then we hear all about how disrupting the Atlantic Ocean currents could cause serious problems, and then we cut to disasters in Los Angeles and Tokyo. Now as far as I know, neither of those cities have frontage on the Atlantic Ocean.Well, I could go on, because the story has more holes than a block of Swiss cheese, but the point is that a lot more work should have been done on getting the science right. As if that weren't enough, the whole story degenerates into two lame plot lines; estranged family brought back together by catastrophe, and boy meets girl. Now that would be fine if the main story line were strong enough not to get stuck in the mud, but it isn't, and it does.In the end, Day After ends up being a life support system for its special effects. Yawn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is This Some Kind of Bad Joke?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great special effects, sound and editing can't make up for stupidity in writing. "The Day After Tomorrow" takes a fine hypothesis and runs it into the ground with unbelievably trite storytelling. CAN "Global Warming" usher in a new Ice Age? Maybe, but this movie leaves WAY too many questions unanswered, while violating some basic realities. For example, "Global Warming" caused by the excessive use of fossil fuels makes sense as presented. However, climatologists have been telling us since the 60s that we are overdue for another Ice age. Dennis Quaid's scientist tells us we have to look back 10,000 years for previous climate history. WHO was burning excessive amounts of fossil fuel then, "Atlantis"? I'm OK with that, but the movie never says so. WARNING: SPOILERS "The Day After Tomorrow" REALLY lost me in the second half, when Quaid travels to New York City to rescue his son. Let's see, he walks from north of Philadelphia to NYC, a distance of over 150 miles. How long does it take? The movie gives us the impression he does this in a couple of days(!!!) Initially, there were roughly 30 people held up in the New York City Public Library. They stayed until the ice froze 100 FEET from the city street. How long would that take, even under these conditions? Days? Weeks? No problem that 30 people have virtually no food, no drinking water and no sanitary conditions. After they leave, it still would have taken Quaid a month or more to walk to NYC. Yet, the movie would have us believe ten people could survive this long with a few tins of food and junk food. It also asks us to believe the "girl genius" would ignore a potentially fatal cut instead of asking the librarian for a first aid kit.My favorite stupidity was the belief that Mexico and Central American countries would allow close to 100 MILLION Americans into their country in exchange for "debt forgiveness"! Come on, WHO would be alive to collect those debts anyway. I could certainly believe the President would order National Guard and Army regulars to invade Mexico under the circumstances. Now THAT would have made for an interesting story.I hate to give a movie as well-made as "The Day After Tomorrow" a "4," but that is CERTAINLY as much as it deserves, given the plot stupidities. However, if you enjoyed "Independence Day," an even STUPIDER movie, you'll probably enjoy "The Day After Tomorrow." Which reminds, me, the Emmerich Brothers gave us a "heroic" Hillary Clinton in ID, but we have a stupid Dick Cheney in this one. Quick, what did Clinton-Gore do for reducing the consumption of fossil fuels? FACT: Corporate Average Fuel Consumption has been rising since REAGAN, thanks primarily to our love affairs with SUVs.</fullReview>

The one remark that gets me angry is the "cmon, ice age fRaom global WARMING, like OMG" Listen, you uneducated kids, the meanings appear largely different, but on the contrary they aren't. Many scientist, and current research, shows that before the first ice age the earth warmed up. How it worked out? Who knows. This may be a cycle that the earth goes through due to the position of the moon or something like that. But, I do understand your concern. If you're looking for a seemingly impossible movie that will get you excited and you want to see destruction, go see this movie. You will be satisfied.9/10 Jaden</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was awesome. Now, i'm not talking about "wow this movie was really cool", i'm talking about how this movie kept you on the edge of your seat the entire time!!! I loved it! I love how they mix like every movie genre into one huge, freakishly awesome action/suspense/romance/ everything else movie. i know you are tired of hearing me say "this movie was awesome", but it was. there is no question about it, YOU HAVE TO SEE IT! if you don't see it in theaters, rent it. if you don't feel like paying 5 bucks to go see it, find a two-dollar theater. Just do whatever you can to see this movie. Oh by the way they had Jake Gyllenhall (or however you spell his last name)in it so that made it all the better!!! Anyways, just one more time of me saying this, YOU MUST SEE THIS MOVIE! i definitely would rate this movie 10 outta 10, no question about it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The genre doesn't get any less silly as the years go by, that's for sure. This is as bogglingly incredible as POSEIDON ADVENTURE or TOWERING INFERNO or JURASSIC PARK or the director's own INDEPENDENCE DAY. Obviously there's no point in going to any of these movies for insights into human relationships, but Emmerich's work in this respect is more embarrassing than most. There's more characterisation in HALLOWEEN than there is in this movie. This is weird, since there are some very good actors on show. They all but one sink without trace not because of the dominance of special effects but because the parts they are playing are just sooooooo corny. Somehow, Ian Holm manages to keep his head above the rising waters. Maybe a film with amazing special effects has to trade in cardboard cut-outs, but I'm sure that LORD OF THE RINGS managed to avoid it a lot of the time, especially with Gollum. There's nothing remotely resembling the power of that character here. Emmerich is not in Peter Jackson's league, or anywhere near it. There's nothing as scary as Spielberg's T-Rex from JURASSIC PARK. There's nothing very much at all, I'm afraid. Get someone to wake you when NYC gets into cold water, and then go back to sleep again.</fullReview>

Sanders, Austin Nichols, Arjay Smith, Tamlyn Tomita, Kenneth Welsh, Perry King, Glenn Plummer. Stupendous special effects are the real stars of this blockbuster disaster flick involving a drastic change in the global weather, which unleashes unnatural activities, and a sudden Ice Age despite warnings from square jawed Quaid's American paleoclimatologist as all hell breaks loose on the world at large. Filmmaker Roland Emmerich ? the latter day Irwin Allen of epic f/x laden doomsday thrillers ? pulls out all the stops visually (best bits: cataclysmic twisters in LA and a gargantuan tsunamic wall of water heading to Manhattan as Lady Liberty becomes a body surfer of giantess proportions) but his sci-fi batty screenplay collaborated with Jeffrey Nachmanoff offers some stilted dialogue and questionable theories of the end of the world as we know it. The game cast however makes up for the plot holes and again the visuals are nothing short of astounding or original (check out a first: instead of out-running balls of flame, out-running wicked cold fronts that crystallize instant freezing!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is film is ANTI-Environment!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Emmerich made a lot out of this film being 'for the environment' and the speeches dragged from the green party manifesto on the surface support that, but everything else doesn't.This film glorifies the destruction of the environment and instead of building pathos with more relevant targets falls on more obvious and deeply crass victims such as sick children.Emmerich, as he did with the superior [and more fantastical] Independence Day, deals with the petty lives of a few individuals whilst millions of people are dying en masse. Surely no one can empathise with a group of rich kids trying to get medicine whilst being chased by obviously CGI wolves when the world is coming to an end?! This pettiness however means nothing to me, you expect as much from Emmerich but his treatment of an American president in this film is what sickened my in to loathing this film. If he was real environmentalist rather than just a hack cashing in on yet another FX joyride he'd have used this as a chance to take a shot at George Bush. More than any other president in history Bush has done his best to destroy the environment and promote his friends and his own cash flows, that isn't even a negotiable fact, that's numbers. [Spoilers]If Emmerich wanted to help the environment he'd at least make a crack at the pretzel gobbler. Instead you get a vice-president who doesn't care and a president who barely appears then dies. Most sickening of all the vice president who works against the environment gets a promotion in the end. What does this mean to the viewer?If he had the guts to make a social comment and the genuine regard for the environment, how about a vice-president who is an environmentalist and a president who works singularly for the profit of himself and his business friends. Then the film would actually have a bad guy and rather than dissipating at the end there would be a success for the environmentalist as the goody goody VP who gets a promotion and the baddie president gets an ice-cube coffin for a comeuppance. And don't tell me that'd be too crass. Emmerich could teach crass in the School Of Crass in Crassland.[End of Spoilers]Now I'm not particularly political, I like my fantasy, that's why I love films. I don't normally like political soap boxing in a film but here, if Emmerich was honest in his beliefs, it was due.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't expecting much from this, only some mild entertainment. Yet, I was disappointed. Halfway through the movie I was checking my watch and feeling like it was never going to end...The disaster scenes didn't seem very impressive (I guess there are only so many ways for a filmmaker to tear apart the statue of liberty and still make it noteworthy), and I really didn't care much for the characters. Even the confrontation between the noble scientist-hero and the stupid bureaucrat Vice-President seemed too stereotypical. On top of everything else, apparently reaching for the status of "serious movie" (without being successful) The Day After Tomorrow lacks any sense of humor. And what were they thinking on that stupid sequence with the obvious cgi wolves - how lame was that?Perhaps Emmerich's work is suffering with the absence of old partner Dean Devlin.ID4 was certainly not very brilliant, but at least was fun. And Stargate (an incomprehensibly underrated movie) had a really interesting premise. But then again, the idea for that wasn't really Emmerich's...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...or you will be disappointed.But if you go in expecting a corny, mindless catastrophe movie that you can pick apart for days MST3K-style, you won't be. The science is bad, the dialogue is cheezy as can be, the effects are overblown, sunsets and -rises are easily noticeable as done on a set, animals are obviously special effects, and in some places the scale of set pieces looks very much off. In short, it has all the ingredients of what I call a fun summer movie.Go to a matinee or wait for it on DVD, it's not worth the price of a full ticket, but if you love this sort of thing as much as I do, definitely see it. I give it a 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some people have written this film tries to convey a message or critique some social deficiency. This movie does not have a message. It does not try to sway your opinion. It is a piece of garbage, and this is why. Imagine a scenario where a studio head tells a group of computer software programmers to create some amazingly destructive special effects shots. Now, imagine the minimum amount of intelligent, time-consuming conversation they would aim for its intended audience and conversely, the smart ass 5-8 second clips for morning show gossip-fodder and late-night talk show plug. This is the worst movie since 'Armageddon.' But thats just my opinion. If you like movie's tailored to fans of the aforementioned catastrophe, demolition derbies, Steven Segal movies or maybe babies, then this is for you. Dammit, think about what you're watching once. I don't know what creature killed Roger Ebert and gave this movie 3 stars in his stead, but save yourself some writhing from the dialog and standard-issue plot points, and for that matter, $7.50.

Write what you want Mr. Direstor. But please learn how to write a good story with realistic dialogue! The president's speech at the end made me want to laugh out loud. Do you really think that a president - in that situation - would ever try to attempt such a childish speech? I never once believed in any of the characters. The actors were simply going through the motions on the way to picking up their big pay checks.

		<shortDescription>'I think we are on the verge of a major climate shift!'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though this film was made in 2004 and too few people realized the implications of Writer/Director Roland Emmerich's sci-fi fantasy as being in many ways a call to attention of the ignoring of the global climate due to our interference with the natural aspects of this planet, watching it again in 2013, with the backlashes of the hideous hurricanes and ice storms and the tsunamis and the drought and the hottest year on record being 2012, hopefully will provide a bit more serious look at the concept THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW offers. Yes, it is exaggerated for impact and the visual effects tend to take over the personal stories that lie so closely under the surface, but watch it and think. This is where we likely are headed - or something very like it.Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) is a Paleoclimatologist stationed in the Antarctica where he finds that a sheet of ice the size of Rhode Island has sheared off. 'Our climate is fragile. At the rate we're polluting the environment and burning fossil fuels, the ice caps will soon disappear.' Concurrently the planet is witnessing severe weather changes - and Jack's son Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) is in New York with friend Laura (Emmy Rossum) and others when enduring an endless rainstorm they witness a massive tidal wave in addition to freezing cold temperatures that could possibly kill them. In the background is Sam's physician mother (Sela Ward) who brings a sense of personal agony to the realization that the world is heading for a next Ice Age. From there the story is a matter of Jack's swearing to save his son trapped in the Library in New York and warning the President (Perry Blake) to take his head out of the sand and realize that the extermination of the human race is possible if evacuations South are not begun. How it ends is predictable and makes the film too shallow, but the message is strong and one we must all heed.The special effects are extraordinarily fine and the cast delivers the sub-stories with skill. Yes, it can be viewed as corny and overblown and a bit on the sanguine side, but the point of the film is well worth our serious attention. Just reflect on the events of the past year and the few years before that and try to deny that we are indeed harming our environment and future. Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So endlessly forced and yet so endlessly beautiful...great effects!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Day after Tomorrow (2004)Great and terrible.Wow, the effects are amazing, pure and simple. But--hey, look, really, this is such an absurd idea taken this far you have to laugh. And it's quite funny at times, not only when it wants to be (there are some funny one liners) but also in the whole scenario. And at other times it's seriously serious, action-adventure stuff.Of course you can't take any of it seriously, and so you go with the flow here and think the world's weather really could go south in a few days, that helicopters could run into a storm that would freeze the gas in the lines and make them crash, that a series of really pretty and awful tornadoes could wipe out Los Angeles in an hour, and so on. It's great visual stuff, and it's a perfect movie to watch while Hurricane Irene blows past and the trees are shaking their booty.Here's what's great. First, a huge range of scenes of terrifying weather, beautifully depicted. We're talking all kinds of hugely awful disasters, and lots of snow. Second, the acting though routine is vigorous and up to the task of talking over the storm noises and flashing lights. It's all pretty intense, start to finish. Even the Cheney-like vice-president plays his part well. And the idea that people are good is permeated in every scene. There are no looters, no selfish fools, just heroes and beautifully charitable people. It's too much, of course, but it's what you would hope for.What's fun? Lots of stuff. The homeless guy who knows good practical street stuff the rest don't know, the librarians who love books so much, the guys in space (brief but a new look), and all the weathermen who get whacked by flying buses. Okay, not so fun, but it's part of the free-for-all that is this movie. The wolves are amazing. What's wrong? Well, the science is bad, if anyone cares. An example comes right at the beginning when there is a large image of the ocean currents in the Atlantic, and the Gulf Stream is shown going backwards, or so it seems. It gets cold rather fast and rather extremely (150 below Fahrenheit). The hurricanes forming over land (without explanation) are gigantic. New York is abandoned (all 8 million people) except for a handful in said library. And the endless exceptionalism of people doing exactly what they are told they shouldn't do because they just have to. And their flashlights keep working, days later. Lucky.German director Roland Emmerich has a handful of similarly excessive films (like "Independence Day"), and I think he isn't a bad director. I say this only to point out that he wrote the story and screenplay, too, and that's where the weakness lies, for sure.Maybe this is a test of personality. If you are an optimist, you'll enjoy what's good here, and there are so many terrific scenes you can't help but just look sometimes at the effect and the set design. It's a disaster film, pure and simple.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Day after tomorrow my opinion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If one realizes that as bad as the film day after tomorrow may be to some, I can say that, In all respect, this film was very good taking into consideration that such a catastrophe could very well be fact if it happened in a realistic lifetime. Do not condemn this film because the result seems to me as a very possible occurrence. We must understand that the compilation of the film disasters arises to be a strong possibility in our everyday factual life. Watch the disasters on the news today. Hails of ice the size of golf balls, rain in driving torrents, twisters forming its vortex over cities and such. The disaster in this film can be a very real affair in full detail as it had appeared in this film. If you observe the various storms on Jupiter, Mars, Saturn, Neptune, the storms are quite similar in vivid detail. Tidal waves are no laughing matter and we have witnessed many in number across the world. I would not condemn this film in the least.starlifter</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Personally I thought this movie was terrific and very entertaining. I have also read the book and both of them had me waiting for more. The point of the movie, if you may not have noticed, was global warming. The polar ice caps were melting, yes, and caused the ocean currents to change direction and speed. As a result, New York and many other places around the world were in danger. If you could not see that then of course you didn't like the movie. True, the ending left you at a bit of bewilderment, but overall the movie is great. What good is it to watch a movie and worry about how this could never happen or how this was messed up? Think about it. It's for entertainment. Take my word for it and go see this movie. I give it a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Save your money and send a message to Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has all the earmarks of a student production based upon the instructor's mandate to use every special effect and plot twist and stereotyped character ever use in past movies within a 124 minute time frame. Computer simulation, scale modeling, green screening, etc. abound as the personal relationships among characters remained at the TV Soap Opera level. The plot is staid and "politically correct" with no surprises. The good guys always wear white hats (and are noble and selfless) and the bad guys are stupid and wrongheaded. Period. What a marvelously simple world! One special effect after another was stolen from Independence Day, Jurassic Park, Terminator, Escape from NY, the Poseidon Adventure, Planet of the Apes, and countless others. One of the few reasons to see this stinker is to play the game of pointing out just what scenes were stolen from what earlier film. As in Frankenstein, Godzilla and that ilk, the director and writers go to lengths to quickly throw polysyllabic words or concepts at the audience fast enough to give the patina of science, but not to bother to explain the contradictions or illogical assumptions of the film. Hollywood needs to find writers and actors who take their craft seriously and spare us the endless repletion of special effects as if that were all movie making should involve. Save your money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What the hell was this all about? Going into this one I wasn't expecting much in the way of depth of story or character, but at least we would get an action packed, effects laden romp along the lines of Independence Day or Godzilla. Well the effects are there but where was the story? What were we struggling against? There seemed little resolution in the story. This film seemed to have an end rather than a conclusion. It just seemed to stop, leaving me feeling decidedly unfulfilled. In the other films I've mentioned here there were the 'Alien Invasion' or Rampaging Monstrous Lizard' elements, Plausible,to some extent at least, enemies to overcome and make the world safe form. This film had little more than a large number of 'Whoa! Look what our new CGI playthings can do' moments. The best thing about the whole experience was, by far, my friend nearly drenching the poor lady infront of us when he accidentally spilled his Pespi while taking his seat.</fullReview>

To me, it had everything. I rented it and now I will definitely buy it.I'm especially happy that it didn't turn out to be a cheesy movie like Independence Day, or a stupid idiotic movie like Armageddon. Personally, I found The Day After Tomorrow to be perfect. It was serious, meaning there weren't moments like "Will Smith lighting a cigar and acting like some cool tough guy in the face of immense danger". Here, the people take everything seriously. Also, the acting is solid, unlike for example Godzilla were the acting was ridiculous. The special effects are out of this world, with the exception of the cgi wolves that could have been better. But otherwise, I am very happy and relieved how the movie turned out. Highly recommended.P.S: It's also by far the best disaster movie that I've seen. It's up there with my other favorite movies (Jurassic Park trilogy, The Mummy (1999), Pirates of the Caribbean, Planet of the Apes (1968), to name a few...)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsClimatologist Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) discovers erratic changes on the weather patterns on the climate.It is from here that the earth,finally rebelling against years of abuses from the greenhouse effect and global warming,unleashes a cataclysmic onslaught of hurricanes,floods and other natural disasters before everything freezes over.Hall must try and save his son Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) who is trapped over in New York.With a plot that straight-forward and basic,we're already set in motion in terms of where TDAT's priorities lie in terms of what constitutes filmic greatness.Coming from director Roland Emmerich,the man behind that most ultimate of summer blockbuster movies Independence Day,I think we can assume that means (admittently) rather breath-taking,awe-inspiring special effects over such things as plot,which here is really just to serve as a backdrop to give the film meaning,characterization which is woefully perfunctory and leaves you unable to care about any of the characters's fates whatsoever,and script,that just,well,su*ks.The performances don't seem to have had too much investment payed in to them,either.Quaid appears to have transfered some (though thankfully not quite all) of his Cold Creek Manor woodenness to his performance here,which is unappealing,Gyllenhaal is a talented and dynamic young actor here appearing in material which is below his station and which he is obviously only appearing in to raise his profile,whilst Adrian Lester rides on the popularity of his leading role in the recent hit BBC1 drama series Hustle with his role as Scotland based climate station operator Simon.This film,and others like it,are designed to be 'summer blockbusters' and deliver marvelous special effects,and not much else.As far as the plot goes,there is the interesting angle of how if we continue to abuse the planet in such a way,this is what could be waiting for us,but no informative insight is ever offered on this matter and to anyone not taken in by all the publicity surrounding the film,the message will probably just drift by completely unnoticed.By rights,I should give this film the ultimate five stars award.It satisfied me in the only way I expected it to (in terms of the special effects) and satisfied me very well.But it certainly didn't pleasantly surprise me in any way,either.It's the sort of cheesy,cheerfully condescending pap of entertainment that nobody takes seriously in the year 2004.It's just open to parody from comedy movies to be released by Hollywood in the near future (I had to stifle laughs as I sat in the auditorium,as I watched the tidal wave scene as it raced through New York,as I pictured surfers riding along the waves and a loud voice shouting 'waaaa-heeey-heeey,wipeout!!!','da naaa naaaa naaa naa...!!!' plays overhead (amongst other things).)Despite the lack of engaging plot and cardboard characters,I only expected the film to deliver on one level anyway,and on this level,it delivered and it wasn't pizzas.If you are a seasoned connoisseur of films and visit the cinema regularly,you should know exactly what to expect and only have yourself to blame if you expected too much. ***</fullReview>

Boring, unimaginitive effects (those escaped wolves look like they're ice skating)There was absolutely no tension. The whole disaster bit happened so quickly and implausibly leaving a vacuum that the rest of the film did not even attempt to fill. The characters just sit around for hours in their various locations looking glum until the world's worst disaster of a director decides it's too boring even for him, so slaps that whole, totally lame wolf scene in there. I'm never going to see a blockbuster again because there are no longer any masters of the art at the helm(Spielberg, Cameron, Burton) CGI rules Hollywood and nobody seems to care if the movies are actually any good. You still need good directors to make this stuff look good. The CGI effects in Jurassic Park and T2 were nowhere near as advanced as in this movie, but were used and directed brilliantly. Those days are fast disappearing. Boo Hoo! I think I'm actually going to cry. Hollywood really sucks!!!!!!!</fullReview>

What in the early stages I viewed as impolite and annoying, later I felt was an apt commentary on one of the worst films I have seen in a theatre. The over-the-top political commentary even insulted my liberal tendencies, and the constantly required leaps of faith demanded of the audience made Dennis Quaid's early leap across the crevasse seem like skipping over a crack in a sidewalk. It appears that this was a B+ level cast looking for a fast buck with little exertion (Emily Rossum goes from "Songcatcher" and "Mystic River" to this?!?!?). Only see this in a cheap movie theatre for the special effects.

Let me just fill you in on what it is.It's a rehash of Emmerich's tried and true destroy stuff disaster movies, and he even destroys the same round tower building in LA again, just like in ID4. Unlike ID4, there are no redeeming performances by Will Smith to make this movie bearable.You will love this movie, however, if you think the U.S. is evil, believe our climate is very fragile, believe that 3rd world nations have it right and we will grovel before them, and believe that it is better to wipe out half the world to have cleaner air.Emmerich also seems to think that North America only has 2 cities worth caring about being destroyed, NY and LA.A horrendous 1 out of 10, and 2 hours of your life you will never reclaim.</fullReview>

The majority of the movie is people standing around acting scared about the weather report! They go ON AND ON for over an HOUR, just people TALKING about the weather changing! It was INCREDIBLY BORING. Nothing exciting happens in this movie at all. It is a total waste. I hated it, and I wish I had my money back. Everyone in the theatre was GROANING as the horrible lines were delivered on the screen. Every cliché was used. The effects were very CGI in characteristic. The movie was just plain boring and stupid. The main subplot was about Dennis Quaid HIKING to New York, because his son was trapped there. That was VERY STUPID! What could Dennis Quaid POSSIBLE do to improve the circumstances once he arrived!Walk with the people some more? This movie was just stupid and boring. DON'T waste your money or your time. Not to mention, this movie had a STRONG ANTI American theme and message. I REALLY hated that. But really, it is nothing to worry about, since no one will even see this stupid movie because it was so BORING! Anyone who might watch this movie is going to be BORED to death. I saw most of the people in the theater FALL ASLEEP! On the IMDb the lowest rating is a 1, and that is what I voted on this movie. I wish I could have voted LOWER! This movie SUCKED!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visual Aside, This Movie Stinks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of a sudden change in the weather that brings an over night ice age is one of the dullest films in the past few years. If it weren't for the spectacular visuals this movie would sink to the "never to be remembered" pile faster than the winds change in this story. Worse is the fact that many of FX shots seem to have been cribbed from many other, better, films.Emmerich is, at his heart, a B-movie director. If you look at the films he's made they have all been glorified b-movies. What made them work was great characters that you could care about. The trouble here the characters are all one note and even the great leads can't work miracles with a script that simply calls for one emotion from most of them. You quickly learn not to care and you quickly lapse into boredom.I will not even get into the science which is so much a joke that anyone with a brain can't suspend disbelief.(Give me The Core any day)Unless you really feel the need to pay 10 bucks to see this on the big screen (the visuals are at best a third of the running time) stay home and wait for video....or cable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I ever saw a cornier, more implausible disaster movie, I can't remember. The special effects are its only saving grace, but they only make up about 20% of the running time. Director Emmerich put all his efforts in the effects, wasting a huge opportunity to develop interesting sub-plots and developing characters that we truly care about.Some parts are truly absurd, like when a cold wave chases the main characters down the library hallways, and they magically find refuge in this room that has a single fireplace.It was clear that the true intention was to send a political message, but it it ends up becoming a mockery with potentially counterproductive results.Save your $8, and rent it for when you have no other alternatives.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am ALWAYS leary of any movie that tries to beat me over the head with the political views of the director/producer/writer. If I wanted political commentary, I would turn on a news network and get some facts. The premise of this movie is so incredibly flawed, I couldn't get past it and the "Look what I can do special effects". The fact is, the earth has gone through at least 2 ice ages, both LONG before man had cars and manufacturing plants. Both these ice ages took YEARS to effect the environment.....it is impossible for the changes to take place so quickly. The thing that makes disaster movies work, is the basis of "This could really happen." This movie has no basis in reality, so I could not feel myself caring about the supposed plight of the main characters.This is one disaster of a disaster movie. Next time they might want to either make a movie for entertainment, or to make a propaganda film, not both.</fullReview>

At least Ian Holm had the decency to take to drink and die before the halfway mark.One thing - and just one - saves this movie from being a complete turkey, and that is that the premise is quite good, actually.Other than that, the acting is universally mediocre, the script is sub-soap and the direction leaves a lot to be desired. Perhaps the biggest problem is that so little energy is invested in any of the characters that, as a viewer, you don't really care what happens to them.And if that wasn't bad enough, the SFX are haphazard in effect - a great deal of the CGI looks extremely ropey.All in all, I kept expecting Charlton Heston to turn up clutching Ava Gardner to his bosom. It was then that I realised that Earthquake was actually a better movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Implausible, trite, and a waste of time...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was a major disappointment for several reasons. The pseudo science it was based on was ludicrous, and the thinly veiled political propaganda that ran throughout this film made it painful to watch. The story line was pitifully trite, and the cast of stock characters only made the film more banal. Great special effects and multiple crisis situations were not enough to save this movie from what it was... a pathetic waste of time.When I watch a movie, I don't want to know where it's going after the first five minutes. I don't want to be able to predict characters' lines or actions before they happen. I want a movie that keeps me thinking, and continuously surprises me as it unfolds. The only thing I thought about while watching this movie was, "When is it going to end?" The only thing that surprised me was that people actually paid money to go see it at the theater. (I got my DVD copy of it in a bargain discount 2-pack with the cartoon, "Ice Age". Hmm, maybe that says something about the movie.) One of the movie's many inaccuracies that I can address with some authority was the scene where three RAF helicopters crashed on their way to rescue the British Royal Family at Balmoral Castle in Scotland. Okay, I'll buy the bit that their fuel lines froze up, killing their engines. However, that would not have stopped the choppers' rotors from spinning. Helicopter pilots sent to rescue the Queen of England and her family would have to have been some of the best in the RAF. It is extremely hard to believe that these pilots and co-pilots would not have known how to autorotate their whirlybirds to a safe landing after their engines died. (I have over 1,000 hours of flight time at the controls of four different helicopters in years gone by, and have done countless autorotations. This is not a difficult thing to do. Even student pilots have no problem performing this basic maneuver.) However, this terribly flawed movie shows all three helicopters spiraling out of control until they impact the ground.I guess I no longer have to warn people about wasting their money to go see it at the theater. It's long gone. However, if you're looking to add it to your DVD collection, wait until you find it in a bargain discount 2-pack for under $10.00. Don't load it into your DVD player until late at night, when you're having trouble getting to sleep.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big Movie, Small Brain, No Dice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A disaster movie about global warming was inevitable. So was having it be directed by a director known for special effects movies. Then of course you'd also expect a big name cast (Quaid, Gyllenhaal, Holm... that's three at least). I think we all sort of expected something more in the drama department. Special effects and disaster film are not known for great dramatic conflict, but most of them at least take a stab at it. In "The Poseidon Adventure" the characters were pretty defined before they started to get killed off. "The Towering Inferno" successfully hinged on (somewhat cheesy) dramatic conflict around the characters of the architecture firm. More recently, brainless Bruckheimer himself injected enough solid sap into "Armageddon" to make us all go for our hankies. But then comes "The Day After Tomorrow"...Dennis Quaid is not just a climatologist, he's a bad-ass climatologist. We first meet him jumping a massive crack forming in an icecap just in time to save valuable plot devices. When he's done being cool, we go home and meet his somewhat estranged son/eye candy Jake Gyllenhaal, and his underused doctor wife Sela Ward. This family is so troubled by Quaid's career that they spend all their time repeating one another's lines. And there's the tear-jerking trouble that young Gyllenhaal is so smart that he fails calculus by offending his teacher. God forbid any of these characters get any real human flaws or that this family be allowed to represent anything more dysfunctional than common, average happy-family tiffs. These are our heroes.So, being a bad-ass climatologist, Quaid and his expensive smile, sets out to save the world by informing people that Global Warming is going to bring on another Ice Age and doom us all. As was well advertised at the time of this film's release, this is a real theory, but that theory says nothing about the effects setting in over the course of two days. Anyhow, no sooner does Quaid try to impart this knowledge to a skeptical public and an unlikable vice-president than does the weather start to turn nasty. And Ian Holm is there too suddenly, playing a British stereotype.Because the family is the center of the film, Gyllenhaal gets on a plane to New York with some kind of competitive knowledge team, pretty much to give a reason for them to be apart when things get bad. We meet his instant girlfriend, Emmy Rossum and a couple of instant friends. When they get to New York, we cut to the zoo and meet some CGI wolves that are acting strangely and are not foreshadowing at all.Anyhow, everything starts getting cold all around the world while these guys in a space station watch (they should be eating popcorn or something). There are scenes we saw before in "Twister", "The Core", and "Armageddon". New York floods and then freezes, trapping Gyllenhaal and insta-girlfriend. Dennis Quaid and his token buddy Frank head off through the snow to get Gyllenhaal. Oh, and then comes Sela Ward's harrowing plight which consists of occasionally cutting back to her sitting beside a sick child in a hospital bed looking concerned. I guess Roland Emmerich thinks action (and apparently dialog) is for the menfolk. Most of this stuff reminds one of that long tag-line to "Deep Impact" that got truncated to "Hope Survives" on the poster. Of course the only thing one hopes for during this film is for it to be over so you can watch something else.Among some of the standout bad moments in this film were: the most useless movie president ever, the unestablished reporter guy getting it, the fake wolves being used as an action device, the ultra-cheesy shots of the Statue of Liberty and American flag freezing (yes, I think we knew that New York was in the USA), the dialog that just throws the first character's line back at him, and last but not least; people being chased by the cold. In reality the cold just kinda comes at a non-impressive pace, but since this film is so action-packed, the cold pursues individual people and hunts them down without mercy. I began to feel by that point that the film was doing that to me.In the end I'd gladly take "Armageddon" or even "The Core" over this lame excuse for a movie. The characters are paper thin, the disaster is ridiculous (however possible), and the conclusion is no conclusion at all. It all comes down to bad writing. Even if the acting was incredible (it isn't), the direction was astounding, or the special effects convincing, this movie would still be junk because the script is some weak junk. The first rule of stories where people are in peril is making your audience care about those people and I couldn't bring myself to give a damn about any one of them.</fullReview>

The movie itself has a very poor story line. The main charter is trying to reach his son in New York City. It's too dangerous for anyone to travel but him. His son survives flash freezing, wild wolf attacks flooding etc. It draws conclusions to meet an end. Its push for UN globalization is very distressing, as seen in the finale moments of the movie. The parody of using an actor that looks similar to our vice president is outrageous. Reminds me of the anti-American strategy of M.Moore films. It is a typical 1970's style doomsday film, with better graphics. I give this movie an F-, for story line and an F- for left leaning liberal views.</fullReview>

There are far too many political cheap shots that can only elicit groans from anyone even remotely informed on issues of the environment and immigration. There seems to be a sense that the only parts in the U.S. that matter are Los Angeles, New York, and Washington D.C. No other part of the country is even mentioned. Finally, the special effects are just way over the top. Not content to have a tornado in Los Angeles, the special effects department puts in at least a dozen that are WAY more destructive than real tornadoes. Skip this junk.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Disaster epic that reminds you of films that became box office smashes in the 1970s. "The Day After Tomorrow" is fair for the genre, but ultimately its landmark special effects, haunting score, outstanding sound and surprisingly impressive cinematography is not enough to overcome cardboard-styled characters and a screenplay that really does nothing new or innovative. Climatologist Dennis Quaid believes that problems with global warming that have been ignored over the years will become real factors in possibly killing the human race in 1,000 or possibly only 100 years. Naturally his pleas to international delegates fall on deaf ears (most notably from U.S. vice president Kenneth Welsh). Of course we all know immediately that Quaid's predictions will come true and come true very quickly. Soon a whole host of characters get involved in destruction around the world as Los Angeles experiences killer twisters, D.C. falls to heavy snowfall and chilling temperatures (in the -100s Fahrenheit) while New York literally sinks due to heavy floods and future Ice Age-type elements. Quaid's son (Jake Gyllenhall), his love interest (Emmy Rossum), their group of high school academic competition players and a whole host of others (homeless man Glenn Plummer in particular) get stuck in the city's library. The test is to stay alive by staying warm. The entire country does its best to get as far south as possible (even going so far as to invade Mexico) to overcome the natural disasters. Quaid's wife (doctor Sela Ward) gets stuck in D.C. looking after a young cancer patient, while scientist Ian Holm and others become stranded in Europe. And through it all Quaid, assistants Dash Mihok and Jay O. Sanders go against convention to save Gyllenhall and others who may potentially survive the elements in New York City. "The Day After Tomorrow" is pretty good with its tone (admittedly there are some thought-provoking and scary possibilities presented here), but the movie turns to old cliches and tiring screenplay techniques to add to its length. The human aspect is the real minus (this is of course a very huge problem) as so many good things get overshadowed by the most important aspects of the cinema being near non-existent (direction, characterization and screenplay). 2.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

The fact that Mexico closed their borders so Americans couldn't get there was quite sobering, when actually, it's just the opposite. The fact that our government went there to try to normalize the things up north and that our neighbors to the south opened their arms and their country to make us get back on our feet is something that Hollywood, or for that matter, the powers that be, will never think of contemplating.As far as "The Day After Tomorrow", directed by Ronald Emmerich, it presents a situation that calls for preventive measures from our country and all industrialized nations in order to avoid the apocalypse the film presents. The idea of a storm, so huge as this one, serves as a warning to prevent it at all costs.Mr. Emmerich has given us a film that is entertaining and poses a lot of questions about the way we humans do things here on earth. Dennis Quaid, is good portraying the desperate father that risks his own life trying to look for his son, trapped in New York's public library. Jake Gyllenhaal, doesn't have his usual intensity in the role of the son. Emmy Rossum, Ian Holm, Tamlyn Tomita, Sela Ward, and the others in the cast do whatever they can to convey the dire conditions they have to battle."The Day After Tomorrow" is film that is a warning of what we are doing to the environment and the possible consequences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Day After Tomorrow - A Dangerous Piece of Environmental Hysteria</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roland Emmerich's ?The Day After Tomorrow' presumes that if the ocean convection current that cycles warm water north from the Equator to the North Atlantic, where it cools and gets cycled back down to the Equator, gets `broken', Northern Europe will no longer be receiving warmth transferred from the Equator and will fall into a new Ice Age. This also means that the Equator will heat up, since it won't be receiving cooler water cycled down from the North.This, thankfully, is a big load -- at least as depicted in this film. Don't get me wrong; Global Warming is a very serious issue that requires further research on how it can be more efficiently controlled. I'm not remotely enough of an educated environmentalist to argue the issue vigorously with someone who is, but what little I do know, reinforced with a hefty dollop of gut feeling, strongly suggests to me that it's the right course. Hey, at least I am willing to admit my relative ignorance. Most environmental groups on the other hand are sadly and grossly misinformed about environmental science and, since they also simultaneously carry many other, stupid agendas (like antiglobalization), the last thing they want to do is bring science to the table, simply because it will upset their carefully constructed propagandized house of cards. The environmental movement is simply chocked full of nuts, some of which were undoubtedly behind the disaster that is ?The Day After Tomorrow.' I fear this film will hurt the cause far more than it will help.This leads to an obvious question: Is Emmerich (who got the chief writing credit here) one of these nuts, or was he simply looking for another cheap excuse to satisfy his New York City destruction fetish? Or did one of his story advisors deliberately feed him misinformation?With most popcorn flicks I might be inclined to just shut up about the science and take the movie on its own terms, as long as it adheres to whatever narrative and physical rules established up front, but this is supposed to be a serious environmental disaster film, a caveat to all us polluters and exploiters of Mother Nature. That the earth is warming up is no longer in doubt. Everyone at this point (even the greenhouse `skeptics' of the 90's) agree that there is a definite warming trend. But the scenario presented by Emmerich is based on theories that have been debunked long ago, depicted so very ludicrously they could almost serve as parody.Hell, this film does for the environmentalists what ?The Life of David Gale' did for death penalty abolitionists. Sanctimonious political hooey, all of it. And what rebuttal does the movie present? A pseudo-Dick Cheney babbling about the fragility of the American economy. Oh, and Americans illegally immigrating into Mexico. Ho-ho.This isn't supposed to be ?Ferngully' after all. THAT's why I'm looking for some logic and an at least rudimentary scientific basis.- THAT's why I get angry when Jake Gyllenhaal doesn't loose his hand to frostbite after being outside on the ship with no glove.- THAT's why I get angry when our protagonists can outrun a freeze during which the temperature drops ten degrees a second. - THAT's why I get angry when an entire Ice Age comes and goes in four days.- THAT's why I get angry when the cancer kid has to wait for an ambulance even though he's really only on oxygen. - THAT's why I get angry when it never occurs to anyone in the library to burn the wooden furniture instead of valuable, historically significant books - THAT's why I get angry when it never occurs to the trekkers that left the library to simply enter another building when the storm gets really bad.Of course I didn't initially consider ?The Day After Tomorrow' to be some sort of scientifically-based anti-pollution story. I mean, I sure didn't read any ?Lord of the Rings' reviews that stated `This film is a poorly-veiled commentary on the modern use of magic rings in military operations, damn it to hell.' Having seen ?The Day After Tomorrow,' though, it does seem true that Emmerich is torn between wanting to save America and wanting to level New York. And that Jack Hall fellow, the one I believe was the hero, with the son, he did have a fairly unsubtle speech to make: `Whether we survive depends on whether human beings can learn from our mistakes. What say you, my son?'Donnie Darko: `I survived, thanks to the books at my local library!'Ok, just as a thought experiment let's assume that this indeed was merely supposed to be a stupid blockbuster and see if it succeeds on that level. For instance, let us compare this film to the ultimate twister epic (because both had tornados in it), a little independent film by the name of Twister, starring that very wooden actor, Will Paxton. Or Bill Patton. No matter. While I never was a big fan of ?Twister', at least it built tension -- much like a good orgasm -- liberally spreading progressively bigger-getting tornadoes all the way through its taut narrative. ?The Day After Tomorrow,' however, blows it's wad far too early and then timidly asks the audience to cuddle for the next hour and a half. It's a classic case of premature tornado ejaculation.Now if the tornados had faces like that of the Master Control Program from ?Tron' and spoke in deep, falsetto voices before devouring L.A., that would be a different story.Hell, at least that volcano in ?Volcano' was one hell of a huge volcano, if you catch my drift. Also, I like to say `volcano'. Volcano. Sorry, I'll stop now.Volcano.I don't say this often, but screw Emmerich. Screw Emmerich up his sanctimonious, political, German arse. The guy should have stuck with bad Van Damme cyborg movies or German homoerotic low-budget rape/prison dramas of the future. That's what he's good at, people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Why oh why do makers of bad films sometimes put a really good actor in a minor part? It just makes everything else seem cheap. In this case, Ian Holm has a few small scenes that anchor the film. He plays the part that Francois Truffaut played in 'Close Encounters,' that of interpreter and connection to the real work of excellent film.This film starts the same, with vignettes from all over the world, including a nod to the snippet that Attenborough filmed in India for Spielberg. Then it simply borrows bits and pieces from other movies: the father who wants to earn fatherhood, the loyal sidekick, the guy (same guy in this case) who cuts himself from a dangling rope to save others, the black supernerd kid, the smarmy Republicans and on and on.Its all pretty boring except for the wall of water, and we are left trying to sort out which of the 'facts' is plausible. The most unbelievable thing in this whole enterprise is the notion of a president who is the LAST to run away! But that business about a drastic drop of temperature. At least it is novel and we have the fertile mind of Art Bell (our modern Charles Fort, who incidentally all but lived in the New York Public Library) to thank for that. But if the temperature did drop that fast and deeply, those skyscrapers would have collapsed - most especially the Empire State Building. But I guess that would have reminded us of another people who bend science to their own broken imagination.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING, POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEADWhen The Day After Tomorrow first hit the theaters, I didn't see it because I was skeptical about the quality of the movie. I thought it would be 5 minutes of action and 2 hours of foreshadowing and pointless talking. I couldn't have been more wrong. Although I did enjoy the movie, it did not come without flaws. First the bad, then the good...For one thing, the entire height of the movie was incredibly anti-climactic. Here we've sat through an hour and 30/45 minutes of intense physical drama, when the "climax" of the movie is completely emotional!!!! Sadly enough, this does not follow the themes of the movie at all. Another thing which severely downplays the climax of the movie, the rest of it is so jam-packed with physical trauma and action, it all drowns each other out, resulting in somewhat of a monotonous movie for a long time. If you have too many heightened action-packed sequences, the audience no longer responds to them in the way that they should. Also, the character development wasn't that great. In a disaster movie such as The Day After Tomorrow, the surrounding peril should bring out the true character of the person, and the movie did this to an extent, but it wasn't nearly as powerful as it should have been considering the atmosphere of the movie. Now the good. Obviously, the special effects are top notch, and the storyline is somewhat enjoyable if you don't continuously search for flaws. The first few disaster scenes are very well done except after that, it all becomes a blur of snow and wind and ice, nothing in particular standing out. The relationship between Sam and Laura, while unnecessary, gave the actress, Emmy Rossum, more screen time and added much needed realistic human drama (along with about 10 minutes to the movie). I enjoyed how Roland Emmerich portrayed the storms like a monster, especially in one of my favorite little gimmicks. When I think, Dennis Quaid is talking on the phone and static comes up, it sounds exactly like a villainous laugh, like the storm is laughing at us because we can't compare with nature at all. Overall, a fun movie if you just take it for what it is, a decent disaster movie. Don't expect a great piece of work, but just sit back and enjoy watching it. I give it a B-.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I finally made myself watch this and I wasn't disappointed. I liked the special effects and the cast but that was about it. The storyline was so full of holes that it was evident that this was a Hollywood election year statement rather than a movie offering. The uncanny resemblance of the President to Al Gore, and the Vice-President to Harry Truman had to be part of the mix, along with the diatribe on the Kyoto Treaty. This was a movie designed to attract the extreme environmentalists while providing a token of an action/drama movie for the rest of us. It's no wonder Box Office sales are down when Hollywood has resigned itself to movies such as this and poorly done remakes of earlier movies and TV shows.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Professor Jack Hall discovers that due to global warming, the polar ice caps are melting, which is lowering ocean temperatures. This triggers a massive climate shift which causes many natural disasters and eventually a new ice age. Everyone he warned realises this too late, and as they try to evacuate to the warmer south, for half of the northern USA, and Canada, it's already too cold to go outside. Meanwhile, Jack's son, Sam, is in Manhattan on a trip with some friends. Jack heads north to try and rescue his son, but the cold is a powerful adversary....Its round three with Emmerich destroying the Big Apple, but this time it's not Aliens or Godzilla, its a bit of a chill, preceded with a tsunami, and a few Twisters.And as you'd expect,the film is all about the spectacle, rather than narrative and character development, and the film tells its story in a three tier way.The first part is all your favourite actors from around the world spouting out all the Basil Exposition, until we see what they were all on about, and that's part two (with added CG wolves), and the third part is Quaid and Co searching for his son.Its perfunctory stuff, you know all the main characters are going to survive, so all Gyllenhaal has to worry about is if that other guy will stop chatting up Rossum.Quaid is as reliable as ever, and he can do the best concerned parent look ever, but when a film features frost chasing people, you have to take the film with a huge pinch of salt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still a Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this 2004 disaster film once again today. If you've never seen it, the gist of the film is that global warming is real, but what no one has factored in is that its effects could happen all at once, taking place rapidly over a period of a few weeks rather than a hundred years or more.To be clear, my understanding from reading scientific reactions to the film is that this scenario is outlandish at best, and I understand why and how some people get tripped up on that. Global warming is a subject that triggers diverse reactions in people, from the passionate voice of those who are concerned for the fate of the planet to the unenthused conspiracy theorist who thinks it's all a sham. Using such subject matter in a way that is scientifically circumspect is sure to draw some angry reactions, with some people upset that the real issues are being distorted and not taken seriously, while others look at the material and see it as Hollywood propaganda. And, in fairness, the film is certainly written as a critical commentary on global warming--a virtual prophetic warning, at that.Whatever the case, if you can get past the outlandish nature of the entire film, the fact is that this is a great movie that has a fascinating plot and amazing special effects. This is a disaster movie extraordinaire, with everything from tidal waves to tornadoes to cargo ships floating through Manhattan. I also have a good appreciation for the acting in the movie. Personally, I find Dennis Quaid to be an excellent lead actor in the film, and it makes me wonder why he's not been cast for lead roles more often. The rest of the cast does a good job, as well. At times the script may feel slightly obvious, but regardless I find the story to be well told. A first time viewer should find the film to be entertaining, if not thrilling. Watch it in HD to get the full experience of the special effects--you won't be sorry.</fullReview>

Now that the world is very much aware of global warming, it seems more of a situation that is possible to occur in the near future. I also fell in love with the film because it gave me chills with all the sudden weather changes. From hail the size of golf balls, to the sea overflowing into the middle on NYC.With all those weather changes in the film, I am terrified that in the near future that this film will actually become a real event. The special effects were good, seemed real in some situations. There were some characters that were not needed to help tell the story. I thought Jack Gyllanhaal was too safe of a actor to play role. He seemed a little bit too calm at times. Overall, I enjoyed the film from a viewer aspect. If I were to view the film as a critique, it would of received a 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paleoclimatologist Jack witnesses some impressive breakups of polar ice. He discusses this during a conference. He gets a lot of scoffing, even when he predicts changes to the Atlantic currents that will likely bring on an ice age in 100 or 1000 years.Terry Rapson starts noticing some huge current anomalies. He convinces Jack to plug the current data into Jack's models for paleo-environments. Jack demurs at first; his model is not meant for making predictions. Jack adapts his work and fills in the data.While Jack is adapting and applying, odd weather shows up all over North America and Europe. In parallel themes, Sam takes a trip to New York for an academic contest, and Lucy is involved with a needy patient at her hospital.By the time Jack has a compelling case made with current data, he is asked to present to the President. He includes evacuating most of the southern United States. Sam is marooned in New York with some of his friends from the contest.After delivering his predictions and seeing some come true almost immediately, Jack treks to New York to find Sam.Will Jack find Sam? Will they get to long term safety, if there is such a thing? Will Lucy and her patient get rescued? -----Scores-----Cinematography: 8/10 Nice looking film for the most part.Sound: 8/10 No real problems.Acting: 8/10 Dennis Quaid, Jake Gyllenhaal, Sela Hall, Ian Holm, and Jay O.

Some of the scaling was off, such as the levels of ice and snow in NYC after some of the storms. The effects of the tidal wave coming into NYC seemed awfully weak.</fullReview>

Yes, some of it is quite predictable. The performances were decent except maybe for the supposedly teenage son of our hero who looks like he's ten years older than his teenage love interest (it's actually 6 and Rossum did look her young age). In all fairness, the writing was probably far more to blame for the awkward predictability than Gyllenhaal himself. Although, there is not a lot to the plot, it is entertaining enough overall that it can put my disbelief on the back burner. I have seen disaster movies going back as far as Poseidon Adventure. This one is actually pretty good for this genre, however, I am rating it based on movies in general.</fullReview>

Of course the characters are cardboard cutouts--this isn't African Queen or Brokeback Mountain--it's a Roland Emmerich film--remember Independence Day? Things are going to get blown up!!! The disaster film fan is given the promise, as the special effects in this fast-paced adventure are epic: the twisters through LA are spectacular effects, and the tidal washes through great cities are amazing work. Why are Quaid and Gyllenhall and Rossum in this? How about big paychecks? It's a disaster movie--you don't get on a roller coaster to cruise along as if you were in a new BMV.

Across the world, violent weather causes mass destruction, members of environmental and political advocacy groups distributed pamphlets to moviegoers describing what they believed to be the possible effects of global warming. Although the film depicts some effects of global warming predicted by scientists, such as rising sea levels, more destructive storms, and disruption of ocean currents and weather patterns, it depicts these events happening much more rapidly and severely than is considered scientifically plausible, and the theory that a "super storm" will create rapid worldwide climate change does not appear in the scientific literature. When the film was playing in theaters, much criticism was directed at U.S. In my opinion this movie was good because it tell about all consequences in all around the world and also talk why spend all these events in the world. I recommend this movie because it's interesting it have different forms of explain what happed in the world, about all events traffics.</fullReview>

The movie was so good but something's could be better with the acting in some parts the most important part is when Jake hall Jack Hall is in Antartica, he discovers that a huge ice sheet has sheared off. But what he does not know is that this event will trigger a massive climate shift that will affect the world population. Meanwhile, his son Sam is with friends in New York to attend an event. It was really sad when jack know the climate of the world going to change in one moment and he know the population of the people increase because a lot of people will die. Some parts of the movie not suitable for young people because some of the thing the happen in the movie one day can happen in realty. The most emotional part of the movie for me is when jack discovered that it has been raining non-stop for the past 3 weeks, and after a series of weather-related disasters begin to occur over the world, everybody realizes the world is entering a new Ice Age and the world population begins trying to evacuate to the warmer climates of the south. It's sad because they was speared Jack makes a daring attempt to rescue his son and his friends who are stuck in New York and who have managed to survive not only a massive wave but also freezing cold temperatures that could possibly kill them. Also it was something very special with the experiences the jack, his son and friends have during the global warming because they were trying to safe and they see a lots of thing the happens explosion, people dying and he know the most of he's friend will not survive. But jack also was also trying to get to his son Sam. Is so emotional when jack find he's son the was the best part.Thank you the movie was Good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Diana Zamora The Day After Tomorrow was a really cool movie because there was a lot of action and also emotion. I also thought that it was sad because a lot of people died. The main characters were Jack, who was a dad and a climate scientist, and Sam (his son). His son was the one that discovered that it kept raining in New York City because of the world climate change. Because of the climate and storm people started to struggle to survive. Also, the dad tries to go get his son from New York City, where he was trapped in a library by water, so that nothing bad will happen to him. Throughout the day the dad experienced disasters, for example, friends of Jack's died. The message of this film is that no matter what you do or where you are your family is ALWAYS going to be there for you to protect you. Also, the message about climate change is that you should treat the world with respect and love or really bad things could happen. The Day After Tomorrow changed my way of thinking about climate change. Since I watched it I think that things that benefit us right now will actually be bad for us in the future. We should change our attitudes and appreciate the things that we have because we never know when we could lose the things we love. We should also try to stop pollution from cars and trucks. Everyone should watch this movie because it touches you and teaches you.</fullReview>

Time has showed us that reality is even worse than this movie depicts, as just a tiny storm that hit New England this year wrecked more that this super hurricane. Imagine one hitting the entire northern hemisphere! Overall, amazing special effects, and fair, to good, acting. There are a few logical errors, like that the mobile phones work even after the storm has cut the power, and so on, but no major gaffs. Unless it is the bear in the cage that has moved sides, apparently (sharper eyes than mine has pointed out that the bear is in the same cage, but the film has been flipped over the second time, for no good reason, as the sign saying bear is mirrored).Dennis Quaid, and the rest of the actors, do their jobs, and are pretty good at it, but it is the FX that really makes this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Global Warming Disaster Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Day After Tomorrow is a science fiction disaster flick depicting catastrophic effects of global warming in a series of extreme weather events that usher in global cooling and leads to a new ice age.Directed by Roland Emmerich, this mega-budget, special-effects-laden epic revolves around the onset of an international series of crises brought on by the long-term results of the greenhouse effect.It stars Dennis Quaid and Jake Gyllenhaal together with Emmy Rossum,Ian Holm and Sela Ward.It was co-written by Jeffrey Nachmanoff and Emmerich himself.At the eye of the storm is paleoclimatologist,Jack Hall voluntarily takes on the preservation of the world in the dawn of the next ice age and all the disaster that comes along with it such as violent hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, tidal waves, massive floods and the likes. Hall must also contact his son Sam, who was in the middle of an academic competition in New York City when the chaos begun. In addition to facing the largest-scale onslaught of natural catastrophes in the history of humankind, Jack, in his journey north, must contend with the masses fleeing south in an attempt to resettle in a warmer climate.Supreme silliness doesn't stop The Day After Tomorrow from being lots of fun for connoisseurs of epic-scale disaster commercial film.Obviously,this is a ludicrous but an entertaining flick filled with clunky dialogues, but spectacular visuals save it from being a total disaster. Director Roland Emmerich uses global warming as a politically correct excuse for destroying most of the northern hemisphere. Like most of his films, this one emphasizes special effects over such lesser priorities as well-drawn characters and plausible plotting, and his dialogue is so laughably trite that it could be entirely eliminated without harming the movie. It's the spectacle that's important here, not the lame, recycled plot about father and son that endure an end-of-the-world scenario caused by the effects of global warming. Enjoy the awesome visions of tornado-ravaged Los Angeles, blizzards in New Delhi, Japan pummeled by grapefruit-sized hailstones, and Manhattan flooded by swelling oceans and then frozen by the onset of a modern ice age in this disaster film that practically offers nothing new.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like the basic idea of this movie, in great part because I always fall for the apocalypse/post-apocalypse genre. Freezing over isn't exactly my kind of thing but I gave it a shot. Biggest problem I have with this movie is that is is just partially based on science and had a lot of it's potential sacrificed to sci-fi just to get it enough "action packed". If one looks carefully at movies like Threads or The Book Of Eli the movie portrays other people as the main enemy, rather than the elements as in this movie. Real apocalyptic movies are perhaps 70% about chaos and the collapse of society, and the rest goes to the elements that create it. I guess riots, cannibalism, murder for food and heat was not really how Americans would like to see their peachy society in the "apocalypse of their dreams", so then the conclusion is - skip this flick, watch Mad Max or Waterworld instead. Perhaps with the post-apocalypse genre being pretty much well defined, the apocalypse genre is stuck between 5-pounds-of-makeup-on-their-faces-hollywood and a dark abyss that is the world after the disaster. Perhaps filmmakers haven't figured that part out yet. Despite the chill, it's a summer movie at its best (or worst): not to be taken too seriously, and not being rated as high as some people think.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In The Day After Tomorrow, the writers take a real life theory and magnify it by a billion, turning it into a apocalyptic special effects thrill ride. Something that is supposed to happen in thousands of years, happens in a couple days, with Jack and Sam Hall caught in the middle. While one is trapped in hard hit New York City, the other must track across the country to save him. Okay, it's a little cheesy and the acting isn't the best, but the special effects are some of the best I've ever seen. I like that it's based on fact and a look into a possible future, well beyond my lifetime and overall it was extremely entertaining. Many of my fellow reviews considered the film to be a warning on global warming, but that's really crazy. Unless you're Al Gore, you should see this movie for what it is. A bunch of smart writers having fun with a scientific theory that may or may not come true one day.</fullReview>

Especially tsunamis, tornados and global cooling are special Parts of the movie. Furthermore a emotional base of the father Jack and his son Sam, which are the characters, explain the dramatic in the film. In other words, the film deals with a problem of the future and shows some be feared effects. With regard to the happening, who is mainly playing in New York, the humans try to safe their Life.To begin with the actors, with the main actor Jack the climatologist, who tries to rescue the world because he notices the global cooling firstly. The film " the day after tomorrow" is produced and directed by Roland Emmerich and released in the year 2004 and is a kind of science-fiction disaster. To sum up the happening the film deals with catastrophic effects of global warming in a series of extreme weather. In Addition to that the problem of the global cooling becomes public too late because the government don't want to accept the disaster. Additionaly, the film is based on the roman "the coming global superstorm".With regard to the strength of the film, I noticed that the the music was missing and often loud. Besides happening is often exaggerated for example the scene with the helicopter or that the climatologists could sleep in a thin tent while the annoying and cold weather.In contrast to that standing out that the film has a lot of special effects like the ice cracks down or the hailstones flying down. For this reason, the viewer gets a better overview of the problematic situationAbove all, the lights take an important place in the film on account of choosing it you get the dramatic more clear. For example the light in the rooms around and wake up the feeling of danger.In conclusion, Roland Emmerich tries to make contribution in relation to clima change. By using some castastrophics like a frozen big city or a Tsunami. Furthermore he uses a loud backroundmusic and special effects like cracking ice in which the music is too loud and often poor chosen. All in all a successful film, because of the numbered special effects and the dramatic who describes the whole happening.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film "The Day After Tomorrow" is about a possible follow about global warming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have you thought that "The Day After Tomorrow" could be the last day? or do you suspect that the climatic change could be reason for the end of the world? The film "The Day After Tomorrow" by Roland Emmerich released in 2004 shows what will be in this case, and deals with a very actual topic. It is similar to the film "2012" also made by Roland Emmerich released in 2009.As a result of global warming a lot of catastrophes, like the hail in Japan, destroy the world and endanger the people. The long-term effect of this is the freezing of Europe, Russia, Canada and the north of the US. Now it is the job of Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) to save his son Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal), who is in New York with his friends fore they die due to the freezing of New York. The film shows the impacts of global warming like the cyclones and the hail, Sam and his friends while surviving in New York and Jack Hall on his rescue operation. At the beginning of the film you can see Jack Hall and his colleagues in the Arctic where they see the first phenomenon of climate change. It is a big tear in the ice,what suddenly appears. But the main part is about the flight of the people, the surviving in New York and the rescue operation from Jack Hall. The music is appropriate because it underline the atmosphere of the different scenes and helps to empathize for the situations of the people. In comparison to the music the special effects are only okay. They are well-done but sometimes not so realistic. I can neither identify with some actors nor reject some of them, but I can understand that Jack Hall want to help his son because all people want to save person, which they like especially a part of the family. The message is that we have to protect the environment for example, by reducing emissions, to stop the effect of global warming, otherwise we will get big problems maybe like in the film.The film has a lot of action and appropriate music, but the special effects aren't so fantastic. The storyline and the plot are okay. When you are interested in these films you can look "The Day After Tomorrow".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***All perfect in the movie "The Day after Tomorrow"?!*** Scientists have always warned about the effects of global warming ? just imagine yourself being faced with a new ice age that threatens to destroy our civilization. This is exactly what "The Day after Tomorrow", an apocalyptic movie by Roland Emmerich in 2004, deals with. It shows how a catastrophic climate change could destroy our modern everyday lives by creating a global super-storm with hail, tornadoes, floods and by confronting the viewer with a new ice age. All these spectacular events could happen and such natural disasters can threaten humanity.Climatologist Jack Hall forecasts a forthcoming ice age, his warning are ignored even by the government. However the catastrophe happens faster than expected and people, technology, machines and cities are overrun by ice and arctic temperatures. Millions of people die, and Jack Hall begins a struggle, he searches for his lost son who is trying to survive in a large library in Manhattan.Emmerich's movie contains amazing special effects, already beginning with a breathtaking camera fly above the mountains towards a little base camp situated on a glacier.Everything is perfectly mixed together: the ecological message, a very good cast of actors, family drama, action, suspense and feelings. Some viewers may claim that many aspects are too perfect but that's Hollywood, and it makes the movie an entertaining pastime, but makes also the viewer think about the importance of topics like climate change and that we are lost when nature decides to go its own way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This weather report brought to you by Rupert Murdoch's Fox News</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's easy to enjoy Roland Emmerich's "The Day After Tomorrow," if you have your brain surgically removed and put into cold storage.There are some entertaining and totally unrealistic special effects, kind of like a comic book brought to the big screen, and it wisely zooms in on some human interest stories, distracting from the incredible absurdity of the movie's premise.Which is, quoting from Roger Ebert:"The movie stars Dennis Quaid as the paleoclimatologist Jack Hall, whose computer models predict that global warming will lead to a new ice age." Not only that, it will strike with little warning, in a matter of hours.Now what's wrong with the reasoning here?Nothing, if you are a fan of Fox News because this movie is made by Fox, a part of the Rupert Murdoch media empire.In the Murdoch media world, black is white, and if you don't believe it, you're fired. So here, global warming equals global cooling.The funny thing is that there really are something resembling paleoclimatologists, and they happen to hold the key to why our current anthropogenic global warming is likely to wipe out most of the life on our planet. And it is not because of a new ice age.The period most closely resembling our own, in terms of temperature rise and CO2 increase, occurred during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), about 56 million years ago. Then, global warming of about 6 C degrees caused the greatest mass extinction ever recorded on Earth. Now, CO2 in the atmosphere is increasing 10 times faster than during the PETM. But in Murdoch World global warming causes the global temperatures to get colder. Those egg-headed scientists are such fools! Everyone knows when it gets warmer it really gets colder. Murdoch Logic: warm = cold. (And tax cuts for the rich mean more jobs for the poor.)Oh, and what caused the PETM? The release of methane hydrates from the coastal sea floor. As ocean temperatures rise, they will be released again. It is called the "clathrate gun hypothesis." Look it up.In Murdoch World the Antarctic ice melts. In the real world, it is the melting of Arctic ice that is the real danger. Melting of ocean ice covering the Arctic Ocean will contribute significantly to warming the ocean and releasing the methane into the atmosphere, a greenhouse gas 20 times more potent than CO2. Did I say "will"? How about "is."In Murdoch World, the facts are upside down. But, then, Rupert Murdoch is from Down Under.However, it is possible to enjoy "The Day After Tomorrow" if you watch it for what it really is: a comedy -- provided your brain has been surgically removed and placed for the duration in cryogenic stasis.Have a nice day.</fullReview>

When I watched this movie for the first time, and a couple more times after, the topic of the world ending back in 2004 was irrelevant at the time. Nobody believed in it, until this brief storm struck NYC. I've experienced this "the world ending soon" feeling during and after the storm. It was a disaster. I immediately thought back to this movie, and I really appreciate the movie now. I felt a strange feeling, a knot in my stomach looking at all the trees down in NYC. It was just a brief storm, but I immediately thought of "The Day After Tomorrow." NYC was definitely not ready for some strong winds, a tornado even, imagine if the scenario of what it was in this movie. Only now I can actually relate to the characters in a way, and be in their shoes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed and clichéd, but a mostly suspenseful and visually pleasing action adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was in my late teens when this polarizing action blockbuster came into theatres, and don't remember hearing anything about it at the time. "Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow", the "South Park" episode which parodies this film, was made the following year, and I remember seeing that when it first aired in Canada, but it would still be several years before I would actually see the Roland Emmerich film. In 2008, I saw two other movies from Emmerich, which were "The Patriot" and "10,000 BC", and couldn't say much positive about either of those. Before finally watching "The Day After Tomorrow" (which came in between those other two), I knew it wasn't generally regarded as a masterpiece, but then I found that it wasn't so bad.Jack Hall is a paleoclimatologist who is in Antarctica with two colleagues, drilling ice cores, when a chunk of ice the size of Rhode Island breaks off! After this expedition, he speaks at a United Nations conference about this evidence of global warming, and how it could lead to an ice age in around 100 to 1000 years if pollution continues, but his theory is dismissed. However, after this, significant drops in temperature are soon discovered in different parts of the world, and more than one weather-related disaster takes place! It turns out that Jack's theory was correct, only it is happening a LOT sooner than he imagined! The paleoclimatologist's son, Sam, has gone to New York with some friends to participate in a scholastic competition. He finds himself stuck in the city as it floods and then freezes over! Risking his life, Jack bravely sets out with two colleagues to try and get to New York to rescue his son! This film begins with the Antarctic expedition, and this part can be a little shaky, but it does get pretty exciting when the ice breaks. There are some fairly dull parts of the film, and while I watched it, it sometimes felt like I had seen it before. Yes, it does have its share of clichés, which it has often been criticized for. I think I had previously seen movies with characters a lot like the ones here (or at least some of them) facing natural disasters, and these weren't the only familiar elements I found. However, I eventually found that "The Day After Tomorrow" becomes very adrenaline-inducing, and is basically like that for the remainder of the film, with the New York flood, Sam Hall trying to talk to his father on the phone as the flood waters in the building rise, among other things Sam, his friends, and others experience while stuck in the city. Jack on his very rough trip to New York to save his son also leads to a lot of excitement, and viewers could easily admire this character for what he does. There may not be too many cast highlights, but Dennis Quaid and Jake Gyllenhaal stand out as the father and son respectively, and Ian Holm is also good as Professor Terry Rapson. I also can't forget to mention how great the visuals can be! Not only has this particular sci-fi action movie been criticized in terms of quality, it has also been criticized for being very scientifically inaccurate. I'm no scientist, but I can certainly believe that this movie is extremely inaccurate, even absurd, in that regard. I've learned a lot about pollution in my life, but if "The Day After Tomorrow" was trying to make me worry about it more, it failed. However, if it also tries to entertain, well, it clearly has failed at that to a lot of people, but not to me. It's certainly not the most amazing film ever made, nor is it the most original, but despite all the criticism, I personally think most of this polarizing Roland Emmerich film is pretty good, even if many people might wonder how I could possibly think that. So, I certainly don't recommend you watch this movie expecting it to be an amazing adventure like you've never seen before, but if you're a sucker for adrenaline-pumping action, like me, then you MIGHT find enough of that here to make it worthwhile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another High budget great effects disaster movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roland Emmerich has given us another disaster film. After ID4, Godzilla, and his latest film 2012, you could probably guess what it's about. A certain force is about to destroy the world, in real life it would be impossible to run away from an alien explosion, an earthquake, or a giant lizard. The day after tomorrow has own main characters running away from cold air. Tell me thats not the coolest and stupidest idea you've ever heard.None of Emmerich's movies are realistic, in this one they can survive freezing temperatures by hiding in a room with one fire. They outrun air, and the statue of liberty doesn't fall over when hit with a fifty foot high tsunami going 100 miles per hour.I recommend this movie, even if it is stupid, it's entertaining as Hell and you just got to have fun with it. It's a fun movie with an environmental message, what more do you want.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whether you want to call him dependable or predictable, once you've seen one Emmerich movie(particularly the disaster flicks), you've, to an extent, seen 'em all. Unless it's the first of his you watch or you expect him to surprise you, you can't really blame him if you wind up disappointed. He at least casts different actors in them, and the performances in this one are actually quite good, with fairly few exceptions. The effects are excellent, and this is rather exciting and entertaining, if you allow yourself to be captivated by it. By the time of the second half, logic goes out the window at such a rate that they knock down the entire wall to accommodate it(it never gets downright boring, though). Everything leading up to that point is largely credible enough, apart from the time-frame. The characters are reasonably well-written, and the ones there for comic relief aren't as irritating as they are in many other blockbusters. Humor varies in quality, but while a bunch of it falls flat, it doesn't really try too hard. The moral is marvelous, and relatively well-delivered(I'm not referring to the environmentalist one... that one's got all the subtlety of a sledgehammer to the face). Editing and cinematography are great, and this tends to get the reaction shots and the human moments in-between all the loud crashes and whatnot, so that we experience what is going on, instead of merely witnessing it. The script contains the usual clichés. There is disturbing content in this, a lot of suspense, and some mild violence. I recommend this to any and all fans of those who made it. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spectacular special effects, uneven film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Day After Tomorrow is not a bad movie by all means. In fact, it's an uneven but decent film. The film does start off absolutely brilliantly, with a wonderful idea for a story and truly spectacular special effects. As a matter of fact, the whole film is well worth watching for the special effects alone. The acting is not too bad; Jake Gyllanhaal is rather bland, but Dennis Quaid is a superb lead. Plus Emmy Rosum looks positively radiant and Ian Holm is as reliable as ever. The direction from Roland Emmerich was surprisingly good, there have been times when I have found his direction too murky and unfocused, but no it was above decent here.However, the second half isn't as impressive. Whereas the first half is very like a typical disaster movie, the second half for me as it focused on the rescue mission felt more of a thriller. The screenplay in general could have done with more precision and focus too, there is good interplay sometimes but on the whole I found the screenplay and some of the characters underdeveloped. My main problem though with The Day After Tomorrow was the pace, for my liking it was too leisurely and too stodgy.All in all, uneven it is but it is a decent disaster movie. The first half I can watch again and again, but the second half for me was a bit of a letdown. 7/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The special effects are great, and all characters are acting naturally and believably. The storyline is simplistic enough so not to distract from the special effects and action scenes. This is what's important for a disaster movie.This movie gets criticized for its "bad science" - who cares? The "bad science" in this film is not like a "factual error" in others - the heroes are placed in unusual circumstances which are impossible in real life. But, given these circumstances, they do everything (believably) right and survive. Great!Compare this with films like "Vertical Limit" where people get into very realistic unusual circumstances (being trapped in an ice cave), do *everything* wrong, and then survive. This is what makes you feel stupid.So, as long as you expect to watch a disaster movie and not a global warming primer, you're OK.</fullReview>

Or the child genius who was so much smarter than his unenlightened professor? Just to name a few liberal attitudes. Through the entire film all I could think of was "Damn it ? keep the damn politics out of it and just let me enjoy the damn movie!" But nooooo, every other scene was the liberals dealing with ignorant conservatives who didn't know anything about anything. Of course, in the end, the Republican vice president finally came around to the liberal way of thinking but only after the deaths of billions and being forced to take refuge in the morally superior country of Mexico. Disappointing and disgusting doesn't even begin to describe this movie. And I used to enjoy Dennis Quaid's films. But, politics aside; the special effects were amazing which saves the film. Sort of.

		<shortDescription>The Global Warming Disaster Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Day After Tomorrow is a guilty pleasure for me. I like a good action/disaster film, and this film appeals to my politics.The plot of film is that the ice caps start to melt rapidly and causes a lot environmental problems; twisters in Los Andreas, snow storms in Britain, deadly hailstorms in Japan and flooding New York. This all causes a new Ice Age and is based on the scientific theory that global warming could lead to a Ice Age. In the middle of this, the American government, lead by a Dick Cheney like Vice President, refuse to accept that global warming is a major problem and holds anti-environmentalist views. When the crisis starts he sees the error of his ways. In the middle of crisis is Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) and his son Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal). Jack was a senior climatologist who came up with the theory that global warming could start a new ice-age, whilst his some was in New York as it flooded. Whilst most people in America help south to avoid the gathering ice storm, Jack heads north from Washington to find his son.Everyone knows that the science in this film is far-fetched. No-one can believe that a Ice Age can happen in two days and that even the worst case scenario, that it would take years for a Ice Age to develop. However, this film does raise an important issue, that Global Warming is one of the most major crisis in human history. The Day After Tomorrow does criticise the Bush presidency on his handling of the issue. It also has a good joke that Americans try to break into Mexico and that the American government have to write off Latin American debt to allow the Americans in. The special effects are good for a film like this, especially when New York gets flooded and with the snow storms, like in Britain. There is also a decent cast, having Quaid and Gyllehenaal, and others like Adrian Lester and Ian Holm. They all do there best in this film.However, there are some moments that are totally stupid, such as the wolfs from Central Park zoo surviving the flood and attacking living people when there are a lot died bodies around, or that a Russian ship with no crew somehow sailing into the middle of New York and near the library, without hitting a single building.But the Day After Tomorrow is enjoyable, especially if you are an environmentalist like me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay for starters I think this was a very good movie despite the fact is does go against many of my movie standards and principles. The point of this film is to spread awareness and basically fear, of global warming; and it does a pretty good job of doing so. There are a lot of good quotes and cinematic scenes that will make you think a little harder about the way people abuse the earth.I'm sure that a lot of people reading this and who watched the movie would say how unrealistic and untrue the movie is; and they are right on some points but not overall. For example, coming to the end of the movie when the storm got really bad, and the empire state building was freezing and American flag froze into place their little nylon tent was fine and warm? Yes thats obviously ridiculous. But the fact is this movie itself is unrealistic in that global warming occurs in a few days and in this century. However, it depicts actual global warming effects very well. Which is that half the world is covered with ice and snow, water levels rise over 20 feet etc.The acting isn't so important. Gyllenhaul doesn't do such a good job but Quiad is alright. Sure there are a few cheesy parts and clichés but thats not what should be looked at in this movie. It's the message it gives that you should focus on. It also incorporates real life events. The piece of Antarctica that broke off that was the size of Rhode Island is true. They didn't make that up. So overall, even the hateful critics of this movie should be able to admit that it is worth watching at least once. Ignore the minor Hollywood faults of the movie for a little and you'll see that this movie can actually teach you a thing or two and hopefully make you understand what awaits our grand and great grand kids.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Al Gore, but tons of fun.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Take: Suspend your disbelief and enjoy the thrill-ride.Armed once again with a big budget and a cookie-cutter disaster movie of a script, director Roland Emmerich is ready to make another big-budgeted disaster epic this side of GODZILLA. Too bad the writers didn't consult Al Gore before writing their weather-gone-bad disaster epic called THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW, but even if its as silly as a guilty pleasure 70's disaster movie, it's still a lot of fun with some really neat special effects and fine action scenes. Sometimes you just have that hankering for a massive disaster movie, and I think other than the late Irwin Allen, no one does it like Roland Emmerich.The film is Emmerich's signaling of the overwhelming Global Warming issue, but it's sometimes silly, it can't quite be anymore than a summer movie. But then again, what summer movie is complete without a a little pseudo-science? The manner that the film doesn't want to be too deep makes it more enjoyable and makes us simple accept it as a popcorn summer flick. With that, its fairly enjoyable. Besides, the sight of tornadoes ripping Los Angeles apart (not sparing the Hollywood sign), a tidal wave ravage New York City (what Roland Emmerich film wouldn't), a quick freeze that makes icicles out of those it touches and falling hale the size of footballs is more than enough to see it as, simply, a summer movie with incredible sights.Dennis Quaid stars as a meteorologist Jack Hall who, like in all disaster movies, is the guy who predicts the danger. While doing an experiment in the polar regions, he discovers that all the ice is melting due to cause of Global Warming (but the dangers that follow can almost be enough to be called "Global Freezing"). Of course, there's the guy who doubts his paranoid delusions, and that man happens to be the Vice-President (Kenneth Walsh) who believes Jack's precautions could cost a million dollars of expense.When the calamity does arrive, as far as we know, Jack must make his way through bad weather to save his son (Jake Gyllenhaal), who goes to New York with his decathlon crew, while his wife (Sela Ward) waits haplessly with a cancer patient in a hospital waiting for rescue. Special effects abound for most of the running time. When Jack isn't being periled by a blizzard of flash freeze, his son in New York is being chased by savage wolves gone mad.At least THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW doesn't try to be anything else. It's fun for what it is: a throwback to the 70's disaster movie the likes of Irwin Allen. It's silly (cliches abound), but granted it's fun in its own merit. The special effects are great and enjoyable.Rating: **** out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>a great movie by Roland Emmerich good CGI and good acting plus some things in the movie could happen. score 7.0/10. a good choice of cast like Dennis Qauid and Jake Gellehenall. i personly liked Godzilla (1998) and independence day (1996) so this was a pretty good movie. but some of the weather in the movie is a little wrong like tornados in los angles. besides if this were to happen what would happen to the south because i live there. oh well also i would like to see 10,000 BC because it looks okay. overall this movie is good so i hope this comment helps anyone who wants to watch a disaster movie i give it a 6.6/10 this is one of my favorite diasater movies again this comment is my 2nd one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my FOURTH 8/10 in a row now, this is getting a bit scary, i mean i really know how to pick a good film, and this is another example, i bought the 1 Disc-Edition in HMV for a mere ?3 (forget the special editions, i buy DVD's for the film, not the special features) a real bargain for a cracker of a film!Who cares if the film lacks logic, you don't watch films for facts, you watch them for pleasure. If you want facts, watch the history channel or something, Airport '79 also lacked logic but i still enjoyed it!So, my overall opinion is that The Day After Tomorrow is a very good and enjoyable film, well worth the small ?3 i paid for it! Which gives it my fourth....8/10 in a row!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inconsistent but very exciting thriller, watch today or tomorrow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dennis Quaid (Any given Sunday) stars as Jack Hall, a scientist who discovers that the world is becoming even more vulnerable to global warming and as the weather takes dramatic turns over the world, he is in a rush against time to think of a solution, and to rescue his son Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie Darko) from New York.The whole ideology about global warming becoming as devastating as this has been questioned by many critics, I for one was a bit unsure that the world could suffer as badly as this. However this 2004 disaster film does hit on a fair enough point.The film basis itself on an idea focused upon in today's media but doesn't really dive deep within the causes of global warming, its more of a case of its happening so deal with it kind of concept. The film also runs on a few somewhat corny conventions such as saving the day and love. Also it is slightly confusing as a lot of cast is talking in specific scientist lexis for majority of the time. There are also too many characters to focus upon and not enough consistency regarding their personal issues.Despite these flaws, it is still a remarkable film. Its fast and tense throughout with great CGI and the acting and characters are acceptable enough to carry the film right to the very end where some viewers might feel slightly let down because it is a bit of an anticlimax. Many scenes are exciting and grab and surprise you.The plot is fairly consistent and focuses on the family who all have their own personal issues to revolve which are good little sub stories. Many scenes are quite dramatic especially with the water and the wolves later on.The use of the library was really significant and effective but most importantly claustrophobic. The settings were well established. The film is perhaps one of the best disaster films ever directed and justifies the genre beautifully.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So I admit. The only reason I got this movie was because I looked on the back to read the summary and recognized Jake Gyllenhaal in one of those tiny pictures that you get on the back of DVDs.But I found that it wasn't a horrible movie. I actually quite enjoyed it.Sure, there were some rather massive holes in the plot and some very unrealistic scenes. And there was that one scene that was so obviously taken from Vertical Limit. And the ending that left you hanging with really no idea what happened afterward - did that ice age really stay...? But like some people have pointed out, you go to an end-of-the-world movie not for its plot, but for its special effects. And in this movie, they were pretty darn awesome.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story is talk about : When global warming triggers the onset of a new Ice Age, tornadoes flatten Los Angeles, a tidal wave engulfs New York City and the entire Northern Hemisphere begins to freeze solid. Now, climatologist Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid), his son Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) and a small band of survivors must ride out the growing superstorm and stay alive in the face of an enemy more powerful and relentless than any they've ever encountered: Mother Nature! I feel that...We humans are such sinners. We pillage and plunder our planet's natural resources, carelessly and indignantly burn our fossil fuels, and throw caution to the wind for our wanton irresponsiblity. I hope that,all human in this earth can save our world together...Not just in some place or some country...Such as use the public transport,less plastic bags and recycle the things we can... THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW succeeds on the visual(e.g. CG),sound effects...So that by myself, I'm very enjoyed this movie...The story let me think about the earth we are now living... So I'll recommend this movie to all HUMAN and hope that all of you will be enjoy of this :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BOOM! BANG! ... ... shhh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's always slightly surprising when all the best moments of a film come at the start, and risky at best when what follows is not quite as good, but that is certainly what happens here. Indeed, if you missed the first part, you'd probably wonder what all the fuss was about. But fuss about it you should, as the destruction of the northern hemisphere is gleefully slammed through the screen. Scientific theories aside (well, do you really know if it's possible or not?), the effects of humanity's wasteful neglect of Planet Earth comes back to haunt us with a vengeance as America is taken by storm (ha!). The effects are certainly dazzling - the odd slip gets through but for the main part it's truly an amazing sight - Watch! LA destroyed by tornadoes! Gasp! As NY becomes part of the Atlantic. Cheer! As Scotland becomes a giant ice rink. Although the above sights are truly breathtaking at times, the small matter of the acting is a little less successful. Quaid does well enough as the Scientist Who Knew Too Much, but Gyllenhaal fares worse, as most of the time it's not quite evident whether he's trying to be sullen or is simply bored. As is usual with Emmerich, the supporting cast are largely forgettable and the best character turns out to be The Dog. It's difficult to be truly emotional in the film, as much of the time is spent simply staring slightly open mouthed at NY's icy facade. The impending doom that approaches mankind is almost an irritating distraction from the destruction that follows, and the second half of the film - in which Quaid tries to find his son - is more concerned with killing off minor characters than actually looking at the motivation behind the near-suicidal trek. Even the humble tanker, which gently floats into the centre of the city, suddenly becomes a rather tenuously-linked plot device to add a few more minutes to the running time. But to complain about the acting in this film is to miss the point. The point is, quite simply, the effects. If you can out up with the slightly daft rescue, cornball politics and the occasional dodgy comment (Mexico as a third world country? Ooh...), then just sit back, turn your brain to 'life support systems only', and enjoy. I did (dribble).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I used to laugh at this film before Katrina</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People forget that Hollywood DRAMATIZES things, and in this case, Hollywood sure didn't forget it, because what we have here is a dramatization of a predicted outcome of current events left unchecked.The political hot-button issue of global warming ensures that this movie will be attacked mercilessly for its technical inaccuracies, yet if we were to hold other films to the same standard, other classics like Star Trek (in which people are BEAMED around the galaxy; who were the guinea pigs?) and The Bad News Bears (a satire of overzealous little league parents in a litigious society) would never have gotten off the ground.The initial criticisms of this film are telling, especially in light of Katrina: a "superstorm" hits an unprepared America, stranding large amounts of people to the point where even the rescue workers can't locate them, and they are left to fend for themselves in horrible conditions. It might not play out as it did in the movie, but not only is it not nice to fool with Mother Nature, it's not wise to underestimate history's greatest terrorist by far, who can kill millions in an instant.The film itself lends itself to jokes and drinking games. Dennis Quaid stars as Jake Hall, the world's foremost expert on global warming. The subplots center around his relationship with his son, Sam (Jake Gyllenhall), an honors student caught in transit from New York City from a debate competition, but fortunately he has Laura Chapman (Emmy Rossum) to keep him company. Throw in an assortment of stereotypical New Yorkers (type A businessman, street-smart homeless man with dog, know-it-all cops, etc.), and we realize that this is the Big Storm because while the city may never sleep, it might just freeze if it doesn't drown first, thus grinding Manhattan to one of its rare halts. The cast is rounded out by the Washington Bureaucrats who are portrayed typically as well.The death scenes occasionally rival that of any horror movie, especially the Final Destination series, and the movie seems to draw on the theme that "death" has a design, or is a part of mother nature's design to fix the planet in one fell atmospheric swoop. There is tremendous historical precedent for climate change, but as the scientists point out, such changes takes years or decades rather than weeks. Why this is supposed to comfort me is beyond me, because it almost seems like the quick-kill of this film is better for humanity than the slow torture currently predicted. Is it any easier to adjust to a long-term climate change that will just as surely sink us, possibly without us realizing when we have reached the point of no return? Intelligent folks will see this film as dumbed-down, but who says that is a bad thing when the typical "dumb" American pays admission? That class of people needs overdramatization before it pays attention to an issue, and even finding the mistakes in the film would be a good exercise for youngsters who otherwise might not take much of an interest in science or global warming.I'll lose patience with films like this when I see other films held to the same standard. However, for as long as people are transported in the Star Trek films, or the Bad News Bears win their lawsuits so they can play out of their league, I'll forgive the scientific inaccuracies of which there are many here, and just enjoy the excellent cinematography and birds-eye view of nature putting humanity in its humble place."The Century After Tomorrow" just wouldn't have had the same ring to it. The truths in this film which remain after you strip away the impossible and fictitious are most inconvenient and need to be addressed. This movie is as good a starting point as any.</fullReview>

The huge scale of events, impressive special effects that support the plot rather than smother it, good performances and a decent pace make this film very watchable.Dennis Quaid appears to be more and more a Harrison Ford replacement as time goes on. He makes a great modern-day hero. Jake Gyllenhaal is superb as Quaid's son.The film is outrageous yet great entertainment. Space aliens and monsters are replaced by Mother Nature in Emmerich's disaster movie to end all disaster movies.7 out of 10. Worthy of a rental.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The world is about to see the second coming of the ice age. There is hail in Japan the size of softballs. There are tornadoes in L.A. that hurl huge objects at annoying reporters... cool. The rest of most of the world is about to experience a plethora of snowfall and temperatures 150 degrees south of zero. There was a lot of suspense and good CGI to help the movie along. There's nothing like a natural disaster to bring people together or tear them apart. Eventually everyone in the U.S. had to flee to Mexico to escape the unbearable cold weather. Towards the end of the movie you see droves of people crossing the U.S.-Mexican border and having to rely heavily upon the mercy of the Mexican government for their survival. It was truly an ironic scene, totally unlike the current U.S.-Mexican border issue we have now. No sane minded conservative republican would write a movie like this. A movie in which the president dies, most of America becomes an iceberg, and millions of Americans have to flee to Mexico. This is a G.O.P. member's worst nightmare. Bravo!

		<shortDescription>Awesome Mankind-meets-the-worst-of-Mother-Earth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A surreal film about what could happen if global warming increases. The movie was mostly a focus on the events that happened, as it should be. The sub-plot was kind of cheesy, but I guess it needed something else to tie the characters together and open up the audience to be a family-style movie, not just one for science people. I would have liked to see more of the possibly effects and reasoning for the large-scale environmental shifts in climate. They could have shown more at the end of the film about what happened to other parts of the movie, not just New York.There isn't a story about the future of the Earth more paramount than shown in the plot of The Day After Tomorrow. It's story tells the future of the effects of global warming reshaping the weather patterns of Earth. The movie starts in a field study in Antarctica. The scientists are drilling a glacier as the ice starts to crack; an entire shelf of ice breaks off, one the size of Rhode Island. In a science conference in India the scientists alert the group that they have witnessed the ice-caps breaking off, most likely due to global warming and suggest that this could be something of major concern within the next ten (10) to thirty (30) years. A control base in Scotland soon notices a drop in the oceans temperature in 4 different locations. Other major weather-related events take place in the next couple days such as large hail, strong hurricanes and astronomical rain. The elements of this progressive disaster get worse by the hour. Within hours it appears to the scientists that there is going to be a shift in global weather within the next few days. One of the scientists, Jack Hall, has his son, Sean, on a trip to New York, where the impact of the global shift is going to be severe. Jack wants to save his son from the extreme "cold wave" that is approaching the East Coast. The climax of the movie is while Jack is on his journey to save his son, and the eye of the storm hits the East Coast, causing people to freeze into ice within seconds. Jack and Sean both live the storm but face tragedy to many friends and people around them. This story's plot is very much the important aspect of the movie, as the series of events alone build up the movie and give it such astronomical content, yet somewhat relevant to near future possibilities to Earth's weather.The setting takes place mostly on the East Cost of the United States, primarily New York and Philadelphia. The memorable scenes include shots from India, Los Angelus, Tokyo and Antarctica. It is very realistic in the way that the weather disasters look very real happening to cities in the modern world; It makes the movie seem very real since it seems to be happening in the present day. The research-style scenes were either in laboratories, governmental conferences or "in the field", but the action scenes were outdoors or in the New York Public Library. All of the places in the movie seemed very authentic. There was only one scene towards the end that I could tell was computer animated, it was a shot of New York city covered in snow, other than that, all scenes appeared very imaginable.Nobody won any Oscars with the acting in this movie. It seemed like a lack of authenticity, but it somewhat gave the feeling like this is happening to ordinary people, not actors.The photography and cinematic was exceptional. They must have put a majority of the money into the special effects. All the disasters looked extremely real and very detailed. The shots of huge tornados swooping through Los Angelus were awesome, realistic and scary. I felt like I was right there in the middle of it all as billboards and cars were thrown threw the city, knocking out telephone poles and crushing people. Once you see this movie you will never forget many of the horrific, yet incredible scenes. The detail in the photography was very high except for the one scene of New York City from a flyby from over the Atlantic Ocean. The buildings looked amateur and jagged as though the production team most likely ran out of money by the end of it all. They could have done more I feel with showing the after affects, such as going back around the world and showing the effects for some time after the large global shift.The direction of the movie started by explaining the natural disasters that were effects of the global shift in climate. It focused on the details from city-to-city as it built up the story and explained how fast and enormous an actual event like this would cause. The sub-plot was then laced in as Jack Hall's son Sean was trapped in the worst part of the storm, New York City. The movie then swapped back to telling the events as soon as the public saw the animals in the city start to outrage and thousands of birds were rushing south. While building in both the sub-plot and the actual-plot together the movie ended with a primary focus on the sub-plot of Jack finally rescuing his son, and then showed a very brief summary of what happened to the rest of the world.In closing, I must say this movie is amazing to witness and makes me want to ask "Is global warming real? Can it really do all of that?" and inspires me to learn more about global warming. I enjoy movies that could almost be real, especially ones pertaining to science or world events. No matter how many times I see this movie I will still be blown away by the awesome Mankind-meets-the-worst-of-Mother-Earth scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The very best image of "The Day After Tomorrow" is the very last one. We see Earth from space, but the entire land of the North hemisphere, instead of being green and brown, is completely white along with little parts from the seas and oceans. It's an inarguably eloquent proof of nature's powers.As far as I can remember, I never anticipated a movie that much than "The Day After Tomorrow". I won't hide it, I've always been a fan of disaster movies in my youth and the fact that there have never been so many cataclysms depicted one single movie is simply irresistible.Roland Emmerich should get some credit for being one of the rare mainstream filmmakers to voluntarily take on the problem of global warming. Even if the events depicted in his movie will evidently never occur, Emmerich gives us a rather convincing demonstration of what Mother Nature is able to accomplish.The concept, despite it's not surprising when you think it's Emmerich, is also unique in its own way. While Emmerich, by the past, made big-budget sci-fi disaster movies about enemies which can be vanquished (Independence Day, Godzilla, Eight Legged Freaks), he now presents a terrifying enemy which can never been defeated: nature itself.Unsurprisingly, special effects get almost all the place and the characters and the screenplay are made up with the budget that's left. However, the story is one of the best of Emmerich's career and some of the actors, especially Jake Gyllenhall (in his breakthrough role) and Emmy Rossum, give some gravity to the film.Action scenes and special FX are indescribable. I've never seen something like that before. Emmerich literally hired an army of special FX teams. Actually, there are 16 of them and they're lead by the reference in this domain: Industrial Light &amp; Magic.The catastrophe sequences are extraordinary. Better than a thrill ride. It begins very quickly when the Antarctic ice shelf begins to detach itself and Jack Hall (the main character, played by Dennis Quaid) and his mates are stuck in the middle of it.Then, you see a hail storm hitting Tokyo. After that, it's the best of the lot: massive tornadoes hit Los Angeles. These scenes are better and more thrilling than in "Twister" (so it's not little words) and the sound effects shake our eardrums. The chaos sound almost prevents us from hearing the characters' voices, which adds to the realism already brought.Then it's the massive tidal wave which swallows New York City and the second half of the movie begins. The main attraction becomes the superb superstorm which lethally freezes everything on its path. I'm sure that after seeing the superstorm scenes, you'll never watch the sky the same way.Emmerich seems to include some political satire in his movie. Vice president Becker owns a strong resemblance to actual vice president Dick Cheney. To be honest, it's the first that I see a vice president having more screen time in a movie than the president himself. And the United States political plans are spoofed as well. It's evident when you hear Becker refusing to pay for Kyoto Protocol and declaring that finances should be a priority before environment. Is it a message that is sent here? Let's hope so...The world will never actually freezes over. At least in the way shown here. But "The Day After Tomorrow" sends its environment-caring message in a very shocking way and procures solid entertainment with its thrilling action scenes and its breathtaking special effects. This is easily Roland Emmerich's best movie and it is totally, the word is appropriate, cool.</fullReview>

This is about dazzling special effects, and lots of scary stunts, with people doing foolish and dangerous things.The disaster is on a GRAND scale, the entire northern hemisphere becoming uninhabitable by being suddenly covered in a new ice age. The surviving population of the USA become refugees in third world nations throughout the world. The president apologizes for his foolish short sighted anti-environmental policies that lead this catastrophe. This is not some petty disaster of a town being invaded by killer bees.The magical ability of the leads to survive in temperatures that freeze everyone else solid in seconds is never explained. However, I am good at suspension of disbelief, and the film kept me on the edge of my seat.Watching the New York skyscrapers turn into Popsicles is awe-inspiring and beautiful. Nature is like an avenging fury, majestic and beautiful. It is thus oddly deeply satisfying watching the massive tidal wave swamp New York.The science to justify all the mayhem is not ridiculously hokey as is usual in such flicks. At least the vocabulary rings true.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My holy hell. What an appalling excuse of a film. The second it ended I exclaimed - extremely loudly in the middle of the screening - "That was crap!". What was the point of the wolves? How the hell did they get to the boat? Of all the boats in the ocean, some wolves got to the same one as a small group of people? IT MAKES NO SENSE. In my eyes, this film should be dispatched to the murky depths of film hell, and have a rescue attempt made by everyone connected with it. Every time I see a clip, I nearly choke on my own despair - induced vomit. It is that bad. 6.2/10 - HOW IN HELL IS IT BETTER THAN ARMAGGEDON? Now THAT'S a good disaster film. Honestly</fullReview>

Good intention, I think they were in too much hurry to launch this movie. I would like a new and more serious one about the same subject.

		<fullReview>I liked how this movie made me think about global warming, it was entertaining, and that its basic premise was based in real science... But I must admit, I'm not an action movie fan, although this one was, for an action movie, pretty good. I liked the special effects. But rabid wolves? Give me a break! I got annoyed with very average acting, an average script and the general soppy feel. But there were some aspects I did enjoy. Gyllenhaul isn't bad to look at, it's interesting to see a frozen New York, and it was on the whole very entertaining. So if you like action movies, or staring at Jake Gyllenhaul, then this is the movie for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slavishly follows the standard disaster movie template</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dennis Quaid stars as climatologist Jack Hall, who predicts that the world is heading for a new ice age due to global warming, but nobody listens. However, extreme weather systems soon start erupting all over the planet.The recent hurricane season in America has made some of the severe weather in this film seem slightly less far-fetched, but this is still a ridiculous film, which subjugates science to the needs of a fast-paced action movie. Although this is understandable, using global warming as the basis for entertainment seems somewhat misguided.As with many disaster movies the characterisation in The Day After Tomorrow is wafer-thin. The film might have benefited from ditching it and concentrating on the action, which at least provides some excitement, despite some fairly average special effects. As in Deep Impact, sentimentality substitutes for meaningful characterisation. This explains the focus on Jack's son and the fact that his wife works in a hospital with sick children.The film is hampered by having too many sub-plots, one of which involves Ian Holm heading up a group of stereotypical Brits who send some data to the Americans. The over-abundance of sub-plots means that they become squeezed, with none given enough space to develop. Deep Impact at least had Morgan Freeman's impressive performance as the President, but here the President is almost anonymous, and only makes a few very brief appearances.The Day After Tomorrow is a lacklustre film, which slavishly follows the standard disaster movie template. It was never going to be a classic, but the piecemeal characterisation makes it very hard to care about the fate of the characters. Without the ability to generate empathy the film loses any tension it might otherwise have had.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disaster of a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One day they will make a visual effect-extravaganza with an intelligent story and character we care for. Until that day we have to do it with just the visual effects. 'The Day After Tomorrow' has some great ones and at least it talks about a real problem in the world, global warming. But besides that we have one ridiculous scene after another turning this Hollywood disaster movie into a dumb comedy. Think about a couple of wolves escaping from a zoo when the bad weather starts, staying out of the movie for more than an hour, only to pop up when the central characters go out to find some food in a Russian ship lying in the middle of Manhattan. (Just read that sentence again). That every other creature outside during that hour was immediately frozen is something the wolves don't care about, I guess, so there they are, threatening our heroes. Like the biggest storm we have ever seen on screen was not enough.The heroes here are Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid), who predicts the events in the movie, and his son Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal). Of course there are characters that belong to one of these two main characters and we have Ian Holm who is in Scotland helping Jack with finding out what is happening: global warming causes some bad weather like gigantic tornadoes in Los Angeles and a wave that flushes New York. Then it starts freezing. By the time a lot of people are dead and Sam and a couple of his friends including the girl he loves (Emmy Rossum) are in the library in New York, Jack is in Washington. We already know that you freeze immediately when you are outside in the eye of the hurricane that by then is above New York. Still, father Jack decides to walk to his son for a reason I can not think of. He travels not alone and we can think of the usual clichés the movies will give us. There is no disappointment in that area.Director Roland Emmerich kills a lot of people in his movies. Some by aliens, some by civil war, some by a giant monster and now some by bad weather. The heroes live and even find love so why should we care? I mean, the special effects look great, don't they? That he is pretty good with the special effects made sure I was entertained by 'Independence Day' but with 'Gozilla' the magic was already gone. The trailer for that film was more interesting and the same thing happens with 'The Day After Tomorrow'. The tornadoes, the big wave, the snow, it was all there in the trailer and it really is the only reason to see the movie. I can't wait to see the trailer of Emmerich's next one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big let down.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I looked forward to the movie as a sort of super disaster movie. The science of it looked hokey even in the previews. Watching the movie it continued to seriously decline. The acting was mostly so so with Dennis Quaid seeming a bit too stereotyped.The movie starts out with Jack Hall a climatologist preaching the evils of global warming to a delegation and insulting the VP of the US. All through the movie I thought I should be at the church of Green Peace instead of watching a movie. After the initial sermon was delivered we were propelled quickly into fairly well done natural disasters which tended to have no real basis in the movie except to slip in death and destruction. If it were meant to show a sample of the climate change it focused only on the "evil" industrial nations and ignored the likely more severe effects non-industrial nations would suffer.Then comes the storms. One of which leaves New York heavily flooded leaving Jack Hall's son and companions stranded in a NY City library. Their fight for survival is trivialized and social dynamics completely ignored. I never felt sympathy for the stranded nor did the preaching end at any time. Every scene had subtle political and social jibes. Few with any factual basis. Jack Hall soon as he is proved right by the disasters that only he predicted soon takes off on an epic journey, or what would be an epic journey that turns into a boring stroll to rescue his son.For a film that purportedly espouses environmental issues wolves are poorly portrayed in this film. So not only does the film do disservice to environmentalists with poor science it is an absolute insult to those who know wolf behavior. A polar bear would have been much more exciting and realistic as the danger to the stranded scholars (Jack Hall's son and companions).To cut a long and boring narrative short there are cut overs to Mexico blanketed in snow warmly accepting a billion or more US residents after initially closing the border. Lets see. Paniced refugees. A major countries Government evacuating an entire nation to Mexic. War would be a logical result. Mexico would not have the resources to support so many refugees. Where did Canada's population go or was Canada completely wiped out? What about nations in the South. The movie seemed to think only the Northern Hemisphere would be affected.I found this movie to be a grown up fairy tale for lip service environmentalists. There were some special effects that were cool. Other than that no real reason to see this movie unless you are extremely bored.</fullReview>

I remember better artificial film graphics from the early 90s. Everything in this film seemed artificial, the characters, the storyline, the events and the authenticity of the film-makers premise. There was no moral proposition to the serious issue of Global warming. I hated that millions died and the world was in total chaos and the whole film was centered around a bunch of imbeciles!I would not recommend this film.

		<fullReview>I've read varying comments about this film ranging from excellent to downright vomit inducing. I've read one comment where someone said that if you actually liked this film, you obviously don't care for quality films. I'd argue to the contrary.In the beginning we witness a variety of freak weather anomalies ranging from snowstorms in India, hailstorms in China and massive tornadoes in California. By the end, we find the world undergoing a new ice age. A little rash? Of course.But what those who think enjoying this film means we don't care, how about understanding some of us simply enjoy cheesy disaster films. I like an excellent, though provoking flick as much as the next person but sometimes, watching something so overly dramatic and impossible in real life provides that escape that we need.I personally loved this film. Through decent acting, a love story brought on by fear of rejection and trying to triumph against all odds and the fight for survival bring about a human element much needed into today's story lines. It doesn't need to be real. Why make movies seem real? Where's the point? Day After Tomorrow in all it's world destroying glory is entertainment. Nothing more...nothing less. And besides, watching New York get devastated by flood, snow and ice is kind of cool. Same with L.A. It's interesting to see two often overrated big cities get slammed to ruins.I'd recommend this to my friends. Real or not, clichéd or not, cheesy or not, this is a good thriller worthy of considering.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Special Effects Only Reason To See This</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the cataclysmic weather occurs in The Day After Tomorrow, there is a climatologist (played by Dennis Quaid) warning about the next ice age due to global warming. Then there's his wife (played by Sela Ward) who is trying to save a cancer patient, and his son (played by pretty boy Jake Gyllenhaal), who is part of an Academic Decathlon team visiting New York City to compete (and because the filmmaker's could think of no better reason to film ridiculously destructive scenes in Manhattan). Meanwhile, Jake, the son, while shifting into survival mode, becomes increasingly interested in Laura Chapman (played by Emmy Rossum) because she happens to be there. Director Roland Emmerich paints a pretty bleak picture for us, if we don't attend to these global warming issues and fast. Granted, it's obvious that the science, however unbelievable, is compacted into a convenient time frame to make this movie. You won't care too much about the characters in this movie; because, we're never really given enough time to do so. There's always another catastrophe waiting around the corner. The acting is nothing to write home about either. However, the special effects are outstanding from the unexpected tornadoes in Los Angeles to the frozen landscape of Manhattan. The special effects are the real reason to see this film and because they play a major role in the film, you don't notice that the movie is over 2 hours long. Perhaps another special effect worth mentioning is Dennis Quaid walking most of the way from Washington D.C. to Manhattan in a blizzard. There are also a few topical jokes alluded to that more discerning viewers may notice. Otherwise, don't think too much about the characters, plot, or science in this movie or you won't enjoy it. **1/2 of 4 stars.</fullReview>

It is poorly made environmentalist propaganda that should have paid its viewers $9 to watch instead of vice versa.There is nothing worth seeing in this entire film; even the special effects are not that original. It is a re-hash of all the other movies following invasions from other planets and natural disasters.

		<shortDescription>Why did people take this film as seriously as they did?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film got a lot of (in my humble opinion)unwarranted attention for its environmentalist message, both good and bad, and of course,I wondered:why? Even before seeing this film(OK,I read a few reviews,so I was already for what I was to see) I knew that this was,message aside,little more than a big-budget special effects blockbuster. After seeing it,my suspicions were confirmed. My politics would probably favor the general message of the movie,but I still found it hard to believe that groups like MoveOn.org were trying to do the hard-sell for this picture. For starters,the way the climate changes are portrayed in this film are so rapid and,at times,ridiculous that it siphons away much of the legitimacy of the "Global Warming as a legitimate threat" menace,which would seem to do more harm than good to the "Save the Environment" movement. The visual effects ARE impressive,but they are given such force and vibrancy that they become the stars of the show,rather than the message or (get this!)the actors involved.On that topic,really there is nothing at all distinctive of interesting about nearly all the characters involved. In particular,Dennis Quaid,JAke Gyllenhaal,Emmy Rossum,Sela Ward(overrated TV actress,also MHO),Jay O. Sanders among others seem to be mere readers to their script lines,truly wasting their talents. A subplot about a group of meteorologists in Scotland,led by Ian Holm,was,to me,more interesting and sympathetic but,naturally,this being an American film(directed by the Kaboom-obsessed German director Roland Emmerich),they will get easily left behind in favor of the pluckier American heroes. Being a Yank myself,I wouldn't mind this if I thought the characters from my country weren't as flat as the paper they were written on. IN short,I would recommend this film to watch more as a sort of topic-related adventure flick, rather than a stirring "call to arms" type picture,and that's if I were to recommend it at all. The White HOuse being alarmed by this film's message was unnecessary. If this film stirs you or someone to become more environmentally conscious,well...God bless ya,but I think you'd be in the minority of its viewers. A summer movie,pure and simple,and not a terribly good one at that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An entertaining couple of hours, with a couple of icky scenes perfectly positioned to make a cup of tea (or leave the theatre for more popcorn, I guess). The special effects are excellent, not least an undramatic but loving created title-sequence, traversing an ice shelf.The performances are good in depth, but largely as there's little character development to master; it's all about working through the story and expositing information (there are at least 3 debriefing scenes). Jake Gyllenhall stands out in particular. Dennis Quaid is reliable but no more, Ian Holm in his short appearance is more convincing as a quirky but sympathetic climate-geek.I disliked the 'necessary' addition of the wolves on the boat, not least because they were weaker graphics than the rest: I also felt that there was plenty of threat to be investigated in the meteorological conceit without having to throw in this more conventional plot twist. But this (and more obvious heartstrings pluckers aside) its all enjoyable, lightly thought provoking stuff. 5/10</fullReview>

I know it's fashionable to talk about being into things that are "so bad they're good", but I believe The Day After Tomorrow actually lives up to this premise quite well - and I mean that as praise! It's terribly hackneyed stuff, but it's almost like the movie is aware of how bad it is, and deliberately plays on that. So instead, it actually becomes pretty interesting seeing where the hell it's going to turn next. My favorite part: the irrelevancy of the ravenous wolves was a masterstroke. Totally random, but such fun. Also, the fact that the folks in Europe (Ian Holm and his crew) kind of just... well, disappeared - died maybe? Who knows? It wasn't explained, or did I miss something? The dude in the library saving the Guttenburg Bible... priceless. Rent this mindless entertainment because you know what? It's complete and utter FUN.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one of the most entertaining movies I have ever seen. Between the laughable premise, the awful overdone cgi and the constant need to inject action into the movie, this movie is a case study in how not to make a big budget movie. After it ended, friend and I stood in the parking lot recounting the movie. In the beginning of the movie, a portion of ice the size of Rhode Island splits off from the North Pole and the split happens right down the middle of a ten foot area between a tent and Dennis Quad. A cheesy jump over the gulf is just the first of nearly every cliché type of action sequence jammed into this behemoth. Later in the movie the characters run away from wolves and are chased down the hall by a wave of cold. Literally, cold chases them down the hall. If you are in the mood for a good laugh, or if you enjoy extremely formulaic action, rent this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We just get more and more disaster movies each year. Actually we don't give a damn about less than the half of them, but from time to time, a super production costing millions and we got to see it. Last year, "The Day After Tomorrow" was that super production.These movies don't get as wild as this one. German director Roland Emmerich makes a big effort to improve his style each time he makes a new movie. The movies he directs are not always potentially prepared to be "art", but the man takes the job too seriously, and you can tell the movies are "his"; even when he doesn't write them. He commits completely and achieves visual levels beyond imagination. He takes care of little details, like not showing some computer animated wolves closely, so they look as real as possible.Regretfully, I haven't seen any good movie under his direction. I never finished watching "The Patriot", though; and I was loving it. And yes, Emmerich's specialty is "disaster" films. There's a big dilemma with disaster films, because they try untiringly to mix action and, well, disaster, with emotion. I has worked for me with "Daylight", a movie that was for me a before and after disaster films (as one of Sylvester Stallone best performances). Why? Simply because its only cliché was the "disaster"; and that's for me the best compliment you can give a movie of this type.Other recent "disaster" film was "Deep Impact"; and I admit I tended to laugh in the most dramatic moments of the film; because I couldn't feel for the one-dimensional character and I preferred them to die than to listen to them saying melodramatic shits in their final moments.Now the thing is; Roland Emmerich may know a lot about disaster, but knows nothing about drama. As he has probably done before, he checks the book of clichés so he can provide some substance in what he does worse. What we get from him in this occasion is one weak father-son relationship, with separated marriages, a father that works constantly and doesn't have time for his son. Yet, when he father arrives late or forgets things, the boy forgives him?The boy loves him, and loves a girl, and has a friend?And the three of them go to New York for a contest, but Jack is working with professor Rapson and discovers the new Ice Age is coming (and you know how it goes from that)? In another ensemble cast with the stars of the moment, the father is called Jack Hall, and is played by Dennis Quaid; who has been climbing to the top since "The Rookie". I've heard he has been doing the same for a long time (although I was shocked by his performance in "Far From Heaven"), but even in his clichéd character with hero moments, he passes the acting test. The mother's name is Lucy, and Sela Ward gives her agility and emotion. Professor Rapson is in Ian Holm's skin, and Holm is bored; looking for money maybe.The son is called Sam Hall, in the skin of Jake Gyllenhaal, coming as the best element of the film; with a lot of personality and charm to a role that as easy as the one he had. It's another big step in his short career. The girl, Laura, it's played by Emmy Rossum. She looks gorgeous and very natural. They are the ones that will stay with a bunch of other, few people (the "Survivors"), as the victims with no way out, and Sam's responsibility according to script is not more than saving them. Do the "Survivors" survive? What do you think? To accentuate things more, Emmerich supports the dramatic environment with pathetic but sweet moving music, set decorations, designs and cinematography?Once said that, the movie looks beautiful, and the special effects are flawless; but maybe that's the only thing Emmerich can do without problems.As we will see many years from now, the movie had to be set in New York?They just love to destroy those things?The Statue of Liberty, The Empire State?If they are going to freeze a city, New York will be the first choice.When the film ended and the credits were rolling, I wondered: If Roland Emmerich knows so much about disaster and nothing about drama?Why doesn't he just destroys everything without leaving any trace of life? Then the screen was black.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie was too feel good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to this film when it first came out thinking it was going to be "The Day After" regarding the subject of Global warming and all it wound up being was a too cutesy-poo disaster flick. This should have had a lot grimmer ending. ID4's "ahhh, the danger's pretty much is over and all's well that ends well" ending was more plausible considering the circumstances in that particular film. The way the TDAT's movie makers depicted it, Earth was going to go through wild changes including the LONG TERM ice age due to the results of global warming--We aren't provided with long term, this thing lasts seemingly for a matter of days and did not spread beyond America and the Britain--the ending was whacked as the peril was abandoned completely when were led to believe over and over these people would have to endure this final meteorological cataclysm (sp)--Couldn't the writers imply the cessation was a brief respite, that the ice age would resume sooner than later instead of what we got, all sunshine bliss and happy faces? If I had had my way, it would have ended with another storm on the radar.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I decided not to go see this at the theater because of the negative reviews i've heard about the movie. I choose the decision I felt was right and waited for it to come out on video. I picked up at my local video store and gave it a look. It turned out that my suspicions were right. This movie has no real story to it, and the characters are not developed well enough for us to care about them. Dennis Quaid is totally wasted in this movie, and delivers some of the most ridiculous dialogue i've ever heard in a weather disaster movie. The scenes of global disaster are the only parts worth watching, and for the decent performances of Ian Holm and Emmy Rossum. Skip this one folks, and go see a better disaster movie like The Poseidon Adventure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just caught this on HBO. This movie was horrible! Outside of fancy special effects, (none of which were original), this movie was a waste of film. Under developed characters, under developed personal situations, and nonsensical actions.The characters out run a tidal wave, close a wooden door to keep out temperatures so low it shatters concrete, diagnose a sickness from a book, and just happen to find penicillin on a tanker ship that just happened to float down the street and stop conveniently in front of the library. The wolves were ridiculous. The could have eaten the bodies left from the folks who froze to death.What was the point of burning the books in the library, when it was filled with wooden tables,chairs and bookshelves? Can you spell stooooopid? What was the deal with the Dr staying at the hospital with the child? The child couldn't travel, but he could withstand freezing temperatures. And the police came back just for the two of them out of all the people left in New York? Dennis Quaid as the dad who walks across the frozen wilderness only to arrive in NY looking like he spent the day at the spa. Another thing about that trip. When the fellow falls through the roof of the shopping center, how was Quaid able to hold himself, the fallen fellow, and his sled with one hand on his hammer. Must have one hell of a grip! I want my money back, and I didn't even pay to see this pile of crap!</fullReview>

Something that might make people think about the environment and surviving natural disaster of prehistoric magnitude. But all they achieved was a laughable movie with the worse CGI wolves I have ever seen. Most of the characters were down right dumb especially the people in Los Angeles. I don't' remember people acting that stupid during any of the major earthquakes. The things these people did were just preposterous. Ian Holm's talent was utterly wasted in this farce. Just another special effect laden disaster for which people were suppose to fork over their hard earned money.

		<shortDescription>not all that great but still hard to resist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like a spoiled little brat having a temper tantrum in his overstuffed playroom, Roland Emmerich loves to destroy things - only he does so on a scale far beyond the dreams of even the most literal-minded schoolboy. Cars, buildings, national monuments, whole cities - nothing is too grand or sacrosanct that it can't be reduced to rubble in the filmmaker's quest for the almighty buck. He began his assault on the planet and audience sensibilities back in 1996 with "Independence Day," in which he used aliens from outer space to do his dirty work for him. Two years later, in "Godzilla," he resurrected a campy cultural icon to smash New York City into tiny little pieces for our pleasure and edification. Now, in "The Day After Tomorrow," Emmerich has gone for the gold by having Mother Nature herself - as the ultimate woman scorned - pushing humanity to the brink of extinction as payment for our sin of casual indifference to the ecologically-sensitive world around us. This is mass-market film-making with a social conscience."The Day After Tomorrow" is what people generally have in mind when they refer to "mindless summertime popcorn entertainment" - a big-budget disaster picture with state-of-the-art special effects, minimalist plotting and wafer-thin characterizations. This current vision of worldwide apocalypse shows what happens when mankind fails to heed the warnings of global warming: storms of unprecedented scope and ferocity are unleashed on major metropolitan areas in the Northern Hemisphere and a new ice age begins. The Chicken Little of the piece is one Dr. Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid), a climatologist who can't get anyone to listen to his dire predictions for the future until it's too late and the sky has literally fallen in. The "plot" involves Jack setting off on a suicide mission to rescue his son, Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) and some of his classmates who have been entombed in a snow- and ice-bound New York City.As a storyteller, Emmerich pays a price for his pedantry and social crusading, failing to provide the kind of dramatic arc that turned "Independence Day" into such a rabble-rousing entertainment. In "The Day After Tomorrow," once the destruction of LA and Manhattan have been effectively dramatized - the former by tornadoes and the latter by a tidal wave-cum-blizzard - the film lapses into a mundane narrative pattern, so that the final hour or so consists of little more than people trudging through the snow trying to stay warm. The film turns out to be almost all build-up with very little pay off. Nevertheless, some of the imagery is indeed fantastic, especially that of the skyline of New York City literally frozen under a coating of ice and snow. The characters barely register as people and we really don't care what happens to any of them, but there's still an irresistible pull to much of the film, particularly in the first half, mainly because it shows us how very vulnerable we are to the great natural forces that rule our planet. The movie makes us feel as if we are mere guests in this world, being allowed to exist here only by the grace and whim of a power that - either through malice or fatal indifference - could wipe us out in no time flat."The Day After Tomorrow" is the movie equivalent of a 50-car pileup. You know there's nothing particularly edifying to be gained by watching it, but you can't help looking at it anyway. You can con yourself into believing that you're studying it as a warning against unsafe driving when, deep down inside, you know that what is really holding your attention is all that destruction and carnage. So it is with this movie. The salutary environmental message is really only the pretext for watching the human race get a first-class ass-whippin'.My only question is what can Emmerich possibly do for an encore?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From the director of Independence Day comes another low plot, low intelligence, high special effects movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starring: Dennis Quaid, Jake Gylenhall Roland Emerich directed a few movies that I like. Independence Day, Stargate, and now The Day After Tomorrow. These movies tend to be lower on plot and higher on special effects, but they are still fun to watch. We do, after all, need popcorn movies sometimes.And this movie is definitely a turn off your brain and enjoy the ride kind of movie. If nothing else, you need to watch it just for the special effects. They are that cool.The plot is really quite simple. We've all heard climatologists and meteorologists and experts whining and complaining that at the rate we're burning fossil fuels, we're going to screw up our planet beyond all repair, right? According to this movie, we only have a few short years before that happens. At least that's the estimate Jack Hall (Quaid) comes up with. Then weird things start happening and he finds out his original estimate was a little bit long.What he meant was a few weeks.Hail the size of cabbages start to pummel foreign countries. Tidal waves flood New York. Tornados devastate Los Angelos. In a very short amount of time, a new of time, a new ice age is ushered in.And this ain't just some nasty Saskatchewan snow storm. Temperatures drop so low that stuff freezes faster than you can "Bob's yer uncle." Jack's son, Sam (Gylenhall) is stranded in New York with some of his friends. Jack contacts Sam with strict instructions not to leave the library he is shacked up in, because the storm is getting much worse. Just because he can walk around outside without freezing to death right now doesn't mean it'll stay like that.It's a Hollywood movie, so we already know the ending before it gets there. But this ain't a movie that we watch to have our brains strained, so does it really matter? Bottom Line: 3 out of 4 (watch it if you're bored)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I will not try to argue for the validity of the science in this movie, I will argue that it is flat out good fun. It's gorgeously shot and compelling from start to finish. The story follows a climatologist (Dennis Quaid) who finds signs of a massive climate shift resulting in huge changes in weather across the planet. The story then follows his search for his teen son, who is in NY City, with friends from high school, trying to survive the catastrophe. Sure, some of the scenarios are implausible, but if you're looking for an extremely entertaining weekend rental, look no further, you've found your film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The world ice caps are melting, snow is falling in India, and storms the size of hurricanes are forming over the entire planet. Caught in the middle of these events is a lone scientist, Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) who sometimes predicts a super storm that occurs every ten-thousand years and isn't believed until giving the most unbelievable proof. To add story they throw in a son, Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) who just happens to be in New York and is caught in the storm. Somehow, for a son that doesn't listen to his parents, he is able to give accurate forecast predictions and save a few people. The plot is pointless, a massive storm and mother nature being the enemy. The dialogue was lame but the actors did what they could with it. Truly the special effects was the only good part of the film.The Day After Tomorrow. Starring: Dennis Quaid, Jake Gyllenhaal, Emmy Rossum, Dash Mihok, and Jay O. Sanders. 1 out of 5 Stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dennis Quaid, Jake Gyllehaal, Emmy Rossum, Dash Mihok, Jay O. Sanders, Sela Waed, Ian Holm, and Sasha Roiz. Directed by Roland Emmerich.I think after seeing The Day After Tomorrow we could all agree that the true stars in this flick are graphics. Still Quaid gives a Bill Paxton performance, if you don't know that is an insult. It seems they are almost alike as if one was copying the other.Any way the story revolves around Climatologist Jack Hall (Quaid) whom believes that a giant storm will come very soon. When the storm does hit it traps his son whom is visiting in New York (Gyllenhal). Jack decides he must go and save him. Roland Emmerich whom directed Independnce Day, Which I have no idea why it's so popular, I feel it's just good because of all the glamor they try to give it. Yet again they hype you up only for a bigger let down.Day After Tomorrow just proves yet again that the true stars of both Paxton and Quaid's movie are not them but the effects. Overall I did like Day After Tomorrow. My final rating 7/10. Where the actors fail the graphics pick up to keep the movie more then interesting but a cool flick to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although the special effects were truly amazing and believable, they were the only points of interest in this otherwise dull movie. Even the great actor Ian Holm had to phone in his part (literally). The rest of the characters were as flat as the billboard that (SPOLIER AHEAD!) splatters a Fox news reporter in one LA tornado scene.Another gripe: the entire movie is about only the USA and what happens in L.A. and New York City. What about the rest of the world? Sure, there are a few references but some of those special effects could have shown the Eiffel Tower blowing over or Big Ben freezing or something. Judging from the cataclysmic events it seems all of Canada would be decimated but we never hear or see anything about that.One amusing yet disturbing aspect is ALL television news stations depicted are Fox. The Weather Channel is thrown in once or twice, most amusingly at the end (SPOILER!) when the new U.S. President addresses us from TV, for some reason it's the Weather Channel broadcasting his speech to the "new world." Finally, if anyone could bear it, the sequel "The Day After the Day After Tomorrow" could show how millions of people fleeing the northern hemisphere fare after making it to safety. Small matters such as housing and food and forging a new existence when you have nothing might be short on special effects but big on human interest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll keep this short as all the long comments have covered all the positive or negative aspects to this film already. I was enjoying the science and special effects in the early part of the movie, when to my dismay I noticed the large presentation screen at the multinational weather conference. Quaid was giving a detailed analysis of the possible effects of global warming, explaining how the gulf stream kept the northern countries warm. He explained how global warming could stop this gulf stream or as is known "turn off the tap" of the gulf stream. Meanwhile however, in full view of all concerned, the visual display had the gulf stream going in reverse! My understanding of the global effect is that it might stop the flow but not reverse it. Either way it looked ridiculous as it never was explained that the reverse process was being discussed. It looked like someone got the graphics wrong and nobody was aware of the "mistake".Apart from this, and some other meteorological anomalies the film is reasonably enjoyable.</fullReview>

Weather expert Quaid determines that global warming is going to trigger cataclysmic (and I mean Act of God cataclysmic) weather changes. His warnings go unheeded until most of North America is a skating rink. Almost all of the fascinating special effects are loaded up front. The rest of the movie (Quaid walking to Manhattan to search for his son) seems like a (bad) made-for-TV-movie - hokey, unbelievable, disjointed and uninteresting.

Sure, there are plenty of good movies based on impossible scenarios but all of these movies are meant to be purely fiction. Godzilla is a good movie despite the fact that a creature that large's legs would break under its own weight. It would be easier to suspend disbelief for The Day After Tomorrow if I didn't already know that it was made for us to believe it as truth.</fullReview>

There is the heroic genius, the skeptical government official, the hearty, faithful sidekicks and a fairly predictable ending. Dennis Quaid is rather wooden as a lead male, but at least his brother Randy does not show up as the "wild and crazy" sidekick. The rest of the cast is acceptable, but fairly forgettable.Drop it in with minimal expectations and you won't be too disappointed. But if you are looking for some profound angle on the potential long term dangers of abusing our environment, better turn to the Learning Channel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My summary truly is the summary of this lackluster film.Acting 7/10. Main character is decent, supporting actors are okay... The extras all look like they're going about there daily business.Storyline 6/10. Meh. Usually Post apocalyptic stuff, but with a few stupid things. For one, there is a whole "Wolf" thing, where the wolves escape from their cages, and come back about 40 minutes later in the film. Main problem: They were the only animals that escaped. A little unrealistic? No giraffes or elephants got out? Just the wolves? Also, the whole "running-from-ice" thing is pretty stupid. How the hell do you block out freezing cold weather? You close your doors and the cold can't get in? Yeah... My main problem with the plot was that the entire movie is basically the kid yelling "Save Me Dad!" And then the dad runs for him. "Save Me!" *dun dun dun dun* "Help!" *Dun dun dun dun* "Please Hurry!" *dun dun dun dun* Pretty lame.Characterization 2/10. The characters stay themselves basically. We care a teeny bit about them, mainly because a few of them look sad and cry on one another's shoulders, which gives us a but of pity, but aside form that, I'de kill them myself if it wasn't morally wrong.Special Effects 9/10. The one innovational thing of this movie. These graphics do what "The Matrix" did to the 90's, bringing new innovational amazing scenes of great and hardly noticeable CGI. The water that rises high above New York, really looks like water. Large Budget = Good graphics.Overall 3/10. Very boring at some points, laughable suspense, stupid and pointless scenes of idiocy, and really bad acting Extras bring this movie way down. The graphics give it two points, the acting gives it one. 3/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, there's some overplayed drama, but I think this film effectively fights denial from anthropocentric conservatives and oil-industry players. I liked the scene where the Vice President claims short-term economic harm is more important than possible calamitous damage from a climate shift. That level of arrogance is common in Washington these days, and millions of Americans get their sound bytes of "science" from talk shows hosted by Creationists with 2-year business degrees.It's too bad you have to show the average person a rapid tragedy to remind them of nature's power. If they made this movie about "boring" incremental heating, displacement of crops and slowly rising sea levels, few people would watch it. I wonder if the rapid freeze was the producer's clever way of dispelling Ice Age cultists who think warming is the wrong concern? I wish they'd developed the science angle more but I'm sure they had to weigh mixed audience reaction. They should have explained the warm water "conveyor belt" more thoroughly because the threat from fresh water intrusion is very real, even if it takes much longer than in the film. We shouldn't assume that, though.</fullReview>

You can see that this was a high budget movie but I must say the budget was poorly distributed.As I said, great special effects but a somewhat pathetic ending. After you see a huge storm freezing the entire northern hemisphere you wouldn't expect it to stop as sudden as it began, on the contrary I was very curious to see how they'll survive. But unfortunately it did stop and from that point on you can easily figure out what comes next.On the other hand it gives us some hope that when such a catastrophe actually happens it won't bother us for long( but who knows).Too bad they put so much money in the visual effects department but such a movie should not end after 110 minutes and they could have easily added another 30 min to the action. Maybe it is better this way because otherwise we would have had to endure another 30 min of predictable action.</fullReview>

Granted that in hindsight (after the Tsunami disaster in December 2004), we may well know that the forces of nature will push down the structures in New York City (Manhattan area), this story still has a profound message to mankind -- SAVE THE EARTH, else we will surely meet our demise with the next Ice Age !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This flick falls into the catastrophe category which has been repeated over and over as the end of mankind. Armageddon, Independence day etc. This film for me delivered what I expected it to.Yes, it has fantastic special effects but what big budget movie doesn't these days?. It's far too slow moving for my liking and without the special effects, I very much doubt whether I would have got to the end credits. At least Independence Day didn't rely solely on effects, it had characters in it with attitude (Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum &amp; Bill Pullman) as very important back-up to keep the prospective audience interested whilst they were not seeing mass destruction.Rating 6/10 Disappointing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dennis Quad is a climatologist smack dab in the worst scenario to strike the world in 10,000 years?another Hollywood special effects bonanza.The polar ice cap begins to melt thanks to the greenhouse effect, disrupting the Atlantic current and severely alters the climate. Massive tornadoes hit California, flooding and tidal waves in Manhattan, ice storms in Japan and three super-storms that closely resemble hurricanes appear with such speed that when the storms dissipate the world will be plunged into another ice age.Roland (ID4) Emmerich strikes again with another popcorn muncher. The eye-candy this time around needed a bit more time for polishing. Some of the effects look pretty bad but don't take away too much from the disastrous fun. But an eerie echo settles down in light of the recent tsunami disaster.Good mindless fun that provokes a bit of thought as you see the Hollywood sign obliterated and ships sail down New York City. Oh and there's a little father and son story too for those who like a little meat with your fat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some films, you want to make sure you understand the logical premises that precede them. Some films, you need to make sure things make sense. Some films, one of the cast needs to come up with a brilliant, memorable, Oscar-type performance.And some films, you just need to sit back and enjoy the film. This is one of those films.Okay, the story is totally illogical. Okay, so it's impossible for the weather to change that quickly (this shouldn't be a spoiler as it's in the back of the DVD). Okay, so it's impossible for a few other things that happen in the movie to happen. Okay, so the acting at times stretched the limits of believability.So what? Enjoy the movie. Enjoy the special effects. Enjoy the tale being told (even if it doesn't make much sense at times). If you can get past the logic test, you'll find that this is a great way to spend a couple of hours. The cast is decent enough, the special effects are quite remarkable, the basic premise behind the film makes sense, even though the rate at which things develop seem somewhat accelerated (maybe R. Emmerich should have stretched this out over a few months?) and the ending is pleasing enough. After the tsunami disaster of Dec 2004 we all need a happy ending to a "nature-gone-wild" story.Dennis Quaid did quite well, though this movie may have signalled the entry of a new hottie into Hollywood's ranks - Emmy Rossum. I kept thinking I'd seen her somewhere before, but apparently I haven't. She didn't have much to do in this movie, but I'll be looking out for any others that she does.And that image of the Statue of Liberty under ice sticks in the memory, doesn't it. Anyone else have "Planet of the Apes" flashbacks? Didn't think so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Special effects can't rescue this disaster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disaster movies must convince one not only that something very bad and unforeseen can happen, but also that the victims deserve sympathy, which requires acting.What could be more disastrous than the destruction of the great centers of civilization by a moving mountain of ice that grinds or crushes everything in its path? That's enough to bring instant overpopulation in a world whose resources are vastly diminished, which isn't quite the same as complete destruction of either humanity or the world, as through worldwide volcanism or the explosion of the sun.The budget goes to special effects at the expense of writing and acting, as is shown in this effort at a politically-correct warning that human activities may bring the swift demise of their world. All dialogue is a shout (which is tiresome) except for the implausible monologue at the end. Much of the rest is mocked-up news footage, and there's only so much of that that we can accept.It is scientifically implausible, which isn't the worst offense, but that does destroy much of the credibility. Although some glacial advances came very far very fast, they certainly did not arise from the freezing of floodwater, and didn't take a few weeks. A few decades, to be sure, but that scientific fact (distressing enough!) would tear at the plot. It is possible to play a sort of game of logging the scientific absurdities, but surely you have better things to do in life than to watch and analyze a dreadful flick. Part of it is -Twister- on a larger scale (Los Angeles); the wolf scene is an obvious rip-off of -Jurassic Park-. Nothing is really new except for the scale of the disaster, and scale is not enough to redeem an unwieldy plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic disaster movie but sadly, not a good one - 52%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It would be a fair assessment to suggest that superstar producer Roland Emmerich has something of a fixation for large-scale destruction. I imagine him playing "Sim City" in a similar fashion to the way I used to - take a perfectly functioning city and then destroy using as many different means as possible. Aliens (in "Independence Day") followed then by large scale lizards ("Godzilla", no less) and then a massive concentration of cyclones, snow storms, tornadoes and rain. Such devastation can be witnessed in this offering, cryptically titled "The Day After Tomorrow".Tree-huggers will love this. Climatologist Dennis Quaid discovers that the Earth is about to suffer a new Ice Age but his pleas for action fall on deaf ears, unsurprisingly. However, they are soon forced to question that belief when severe weather begins to affect all of the northern hemisphere (strange, that), plunging America into about several stories of snow and ice. Chilly! To make matters worse, Quaid's smart-arse student son (Jake Gyllenhaal) is trapped in New York which, naturally, bears the brunt of the cold snap. Strapping on some snow shoes, Quaid makes his way across the States to the Big Apple to rescue his son.Now, let's stop and think about this for a moment. I'm sure Mr Emmerich will be the first to admit that the truth, however well based in science it claims to be, is being stretched just a tad. Well, OK - this makes "U-571" look like a Discovery Channel documentary. Basically, it's cack. But when did obstacles like logic ever stop Hollywood? This is straight-up entertainment with a hard-hitting morality tale about fossil fuels and the Kyoto Treaty, something I never heard mentioned - the way it all pans out, you'd think that this was just another bad day at the Met Office. Yes, the sight of people freezing to death in a matter of seconds is deeply troubling but as it's about as likely as Janet Jackson being invited back to do this year's Superbowl half-time show (but still just as troubling).Considering the amount of blue-screen used, the actors feign horror and amazement to reasonable standards. But when you can predict scenarios and dialogue, you know you have a problem. And Quaid's ridiculous assertion that he'll walk to New York if he has to (from somewhere "just north of Phillidelphia") in a raging snowstorm is both stupid and film-threateningly bad. Gyllenhaal probably does the best out of the lot, considering the amount he has to go through - acting waist-deep in water and chased by crude CGI wolves on a frozen Russian supertanker parked in the middle of New York (don't ask) aren't really conducive to good acting. But he does OK, which is more than can be said for Kenneth Walsh as the stone-hearted Vice President who ignores Quaid at the beginning. I suggest everyone sits down and watches "Dante's Peak" (which this film practically mirrors) because you'll soon learn what happens when you don't listen to the expert. And despite Western civilisation being almost destroyed by the weather, everyone still seems to end this movie with a smile on their face, perfect teeth gleaming in the winter sun. It wouldn't surprise me if, after the cameras had gone, the characters made a snowman and rustled up a barbecue somehow.As you may have gathered, I'm not a huge fan of this film. It's expensive and graphic scare-mongering though I'm not claiming that global warming doesn't exist. It does and is one of the things that scares me the most, after fish and cats and Osama Bin Laden. In that order. But Emmerich's blockbuster approach merely remakes "Independence Day" and "Godzilla" but with a different monster wrecking New York. We all know how it ends, we all know who lives and who doesn't. The fact is this movie does nothing whatsoever to surprise or entertain you besides dusting New York with frost and if you're daft enough to pay money to see this then shame on you. Emmerich's desire is to recreate Orson Welles' "War Of The Worlds" and get the same sort of panic reaction. All he gets from me is a disinterested shrug and besides, if America was that desperate to halt climate change, why choose an oil tycoon President who shows as much concern for the rest of the world as he does for those he bombs in pursuit of profit? Sorry, rant's over now.And, of course, watching this film after the terrible events in south-east Asia doesn't help. We don't need to go to the movies to see natural disasters on an unimaginable scale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Embarrassing to those who really care about our world..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A typical Roland Emmerich movie, is the way to best describe this film. All effects, poor plot, And more appealing to popular U.S. sentiments. Normally I wouldn't watch a film from Roland Emmerich cause of those very reasons, but this time he was boasting about his intentions to arouse interest and concerned about our environmental state. Sadly this director's habits survived even in this film.Roland Emmerich is indeed a shocker of a director, he likes giving the audience a breathtaking shock or two in his scenes, which is not a bad thing, however he seems to expect this to replace a poor plot, cardboard characters and general humanity. The special effects were of prime quality of course, The best part in the entire film is the series of tornadoes leveling Los Angelis, And seeing New York getting buried in Ice. But this accounts for 2% of the movie, The other 98% accounts for a paper thin script, ridiculous fillers and sub par acting. Dennis Quaid however was a pleasant surprise as he seemed to gain some respect for acting over the years, he seemed to be embarrassed to be doing this film yet he was credible in this film. Sir Ian Holm also brought the only dignity this picture has.While something along the lines of what is portrayed in the film is possible with the escalation of pollution. People in general know that it is preposterous and doesn't help the cause of environmentalists one bit. Seeing tornadoes causeing destruction as well as floods and freezing is something we've all seen. Even exaggerated beyond measure in this movie, but what makes this film embarrassing for Environmental sympathizers is the small scope seen in the film. How the U.S. has 'again' a feel good climax and touching realizations, yet the rest of the world is utterly hopeless. An environmental crisis of this magnitude would affect the world as a whole. Roland Emmerich decided the Americans want to see Americans and to hell with those 'other people'. Waveing the star spangled banner at the end, even when there is nothing to be proud of.I do not doubt Roland Emmerich had good intentions with this film. Unfortunately old habits die hard with this filmmaker, and while he did cash in this film, It failed with it's mission. It turned into a 70's style disaster film instead of an eye opener about the real problems of the world. And became laughable instead of concerning. Try again Roland...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Day After Tomorrow" is about climatologist Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) who tries to save the world from global warming caused by the Greenhouse Effect. When the Ice Age does come, he must go to New York to save his son Sam Hall (Jake Gyllenhaal) from the natural disaster.First of all, the plot is terrible. An Ice Age is created because of global WARMING. I thought we got our heat mainly from the sun, not some ocean current! The acting is bottom of the barrel and the dialogue can be found in any other B movie. Also, the makers of this film didn't care about its artistic value, but only wanted to express their twisted ideas and call it art. An interesting thing is that someone involved in the movie's writing process appeared on 20/20 and said that, after nearly three years of research, he and most of the scientific community came to the conclusion that global warming is a hoax. He only wrote the script because Hollywood big shots blacklist anyone who won't cooperate with their propaganda. That is all "The Day After Tomorrow" should be viewed as: legalized propaganda. The main character is surrounded by stupid politicians to make his plight seem more plausible, but even more outrageous is that one politician looks very much like Dick Cheney.One thing many people give this movie credit for is the great special effects. If you want to see a movie with better special effects and a more believable and unpolluted plot, rent "The Lord of The Rings" instead.I'll finish this comment with something Robert Duvall once said: "They (Hollywood political activists) should keep their mouths shut." 2/10</fullReview>

Flesh can and does freeze within minutes of exposure to cold air, especially if there is a wind and if the skin is moist.My biggest problem is with the wolves. The escaped wolves would not have attacked the humans because if they can sense the impending storm, they would run away from the area. I also think they would have been more likely to attack the other arctic species, like moose and polar bears, than the humans.The climate change is hokey, it should have been stretched over weeks or years to make it more realistic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is it with Hollywood? Why could this movie not have spanned a couple of years instead of a measly week? The catastrophe would have been just as big and the images just as spectacular, and both much more believable. What could have been a thought provoking warning simply degraded into the disaster voyeurism we had with similar movies from the late 70s and early 80s, minus the gory but often creative highlights. This, and a strange stereotype scientist apparently still alive and kicking in Hollywood today, makes this an impressive b-movie. The stereotype of strangely preoccupied nerds working in very small groups and utterly incapable of social interaction. Take a look around! To cement its status as a b-movie, we'll just add a bit of sunshine and patriotism at the end. Where's the bitter reasoning? Where are the morales? Where are all those things that sold this movie? And for technical quality, let's quote someone at the production stage: "Wolves? Where do we get 5 live wolves? Hey, we'll CGI them and no one will never know"! Even a bunch of hearing impaired retired alsatians would have looked more real! Oh, and a tiny bus blocking a cargo ship? Anyone care to calculate the inertia of 50,000 tons of steel at walking speed? Not a whole lot of believability there. Outrunning a temperature drop? Operating cell phones in a complete wasteland? Active gas lines? Cross-Atlantic phone calls? An insult. A bloody insult!</fullReview>

This movie gives us appreciation the next time we see palm trees or just a few inches of snow though for sure!

		<fullReview>This movie has only one serious drawback - it lack everything that could make it interesting and unique. It is a moralization about family relationships(father-son, boyfriend-girlfriend) and it could be quite OK, cause people come to see human relationships in the movies, but in this case it's too cliché. The special effects are OK, but special effects alone don't make a movie good. The script is weak, even more - if you have seen any catastrophe movies like Dante's peek, Twister etc. you have already seen Day after tomorrow. I was seriously disappointed by this movie cause at first it seemed to be like a post-apocalyptic drama, but turned out to be just a catastrophic script. And for those who think that bad script can be saved by good acting - the acting is weak too, the dying people look like they are dying from boredom not terrible catastrophe. The leading actors act either too shy or overact and it makes the movie even worse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Granted, the whole massive-climate-change thing is ludicrous, the hike to New York on what must be at least 30 feet of snow is crazy, and the huge waves that come into Manhattan without doing much damage to the buildings is unrealistic.BUT, what I want to know is this: Why do people freeze so fast? The air can't be THAT cold. Cold air has to come from somewhere, it's not just manufactured by elves down in caves somewhere. The coldest air available to be swept down into the lower latitudes would be polar air, which rarely gets cold enough to freeze exposed skin instantly and kill a person. Even if we got some butt-freezing arctic air, it would be warmed at least a little by ambient ground temperature, the Atlantic Ocean, and the little bit of sunlight that gets through the cloud cover. But that's OK because Dennis Quaid seems to be immune to it anyway.** out of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I could not have seen this film at a worst possible time. Hurricanes in the Caribbean, Tidal waves and Typhones hitting Asia, 100 km/h winds and snow hitting Atlantic Canada. This film certainly got me thinking about a few things.The most interesting concept was its 'super-cell' sucking Tropospheric cold air down to the surface at the eye of a 'winter' hurricane - forming over land. I did some research to discover that Nor'easter's actually exist - a scaled down version of a hurricane, except it brings snow instead of rain and has a cold centre instead of a warm one (like a real hurricane). You can look it up in your yahoo search engine under Nor'easter to find out about the 'cold' or 'winter' hurricane. It also has an eye in the centre. IN fact, Atlantic Canada was hit by conditions resembling of one.Scientifically - there is not much merit on the film, but then again they had to exagerrate a few things to make it interesting. Despite what other have said, I throughly have enjoyed this film.The most important message within the film would be that, we are not in control of the weather. We could have the best army, the richest and strongest cities, but it is all nothing if a weather disaster strikes. In fact, it could be worst than a terrorist attack or a thermonuclear bomb if it is a really bad storm. Perhaps we would have to think twice as a society about the Kyota accord and reducing emissions after seeing this film.What was lacking in this film is the 'supernatural', that is an element of the wrath of God, or judgement, or something to that effect, or people talking about religion. It lacked depth. It may be that many Hollywood films like to avoid the religion subject and just go to mere chance, but in this case, if the progonist prayed, or if there was a preacher talking about the judgment of God and urging people to repent, it may have taken a more controversial or convincing spin. I think in this case, a bit of religion would have really helped this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why They're Called "Disaster" Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has it all - all the trite situations, hackneyed dialogue and banal clichés you can think of. It reminded me of a National Lampoon magazine cover from the disaster-film-craze days of the mid-'70's: depicting a satiric poster for a non-existent film called "Armageddon '75," it showed an aerial view of a major urban center with a tidal wave (complete with capsizing ship) washing over it, a volcano erupting, a plane crashing...all of it during an earthquake, of course.THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW isn't content with catastrophic global climate change; it has to cover the usual dysfunctional marriage/family ground, visit the hospital ward with the de rigueur kid dying of cancer (with whom the noble doc must stay behind after all others have evacuated) and trot out a pack of ravenous escaped wolves roaming frozen Manhattan (how come they can stay alive when the storm is flash-freezing everybody else who ventures out into it?) for good measure. Characters who are supposed to be smarter than everybody else ignore their own dire warnings and venture out on a mission of (practically) certain death, because (heavy music here), "I made a promise." Did I mention the young lovers who discover they've worshiped each other from afar but were too shy to make a move (what year is this, again?), and find romance only when it's (practically) too late?One of director Roland Emmerich's earlier efforts in this vein, "Independence Day," tacky as it was, at least had the benefit of not taking itself too seriously; a virtue missing here. It's easy to see why those who realize the gravity of the issue of global climate change felt this silly exercise would do more damage than good to the cause.Oh, sure, the special effects are well-rendered and impressive, but when they can do so much - so convincingly (like sail an oil tanker down a flooded Fifth Avenue) - these days without leaving the comfort of the computer terminal, one really doesn't expect any less (with a $125 million budget, anyway). It kinda takes the "special" out of "special effects."All in all, I'd put it down at the bottom of the dramatic dumpster with "Twister," If you absolutely must see how Lady Liberty looks in snow up to her skirts - or are wondering whatever became of Perry King - and have a couple of hours to kill, go for it. But consider yourself warned: been there; done that.</fullReview>

The movie certainly delivered in terms of big special effects and action. The concept is a good one--that global warming finally causes catastrophic weather change. Unfortunately, attempts to "Hollywoodize" that concept resulted in a movie that is quite unbelievable from a variety of perspectives (physics being the most obvious). This makes it difficult to connect with the characters and really get pulled into their plight.Overall, worth a rental if you like this kind of thing.

		<fullReview>I've seen several of these apocalyptic-type movies, where some natural disaster (or alien invasion) threatens the existence of humanity, i.e. - "Deep Impact," "Independence Day," and "Armageddon," but this was probably my favorite thus far. It does a better job of capturing the awe and general creepiness of the destruction of our society and all its renowned landmarks (There's a chilling shot of the New York skyline with about 100 feet of its skyscrapers protruding from a sea of snow.). My criticism of the film comes from its subplots. There are several of them, and while one of them is interesting and valuable, the others are generally a waste of time. Dennis Quaid plays Jack Hall, a government meteorologist who predicts the natural disaster, and becomes the leading authority on the subject. His son, Sam, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, is trapped in New York in the storm, and Jack bravely treks across barren fields of snow and deadly weather to rescue his son - who he's not even sure is still alive. This subplot gives the story a human connection, and allows us to experience some real emotion along with our fear and thrill. Among the other subplots, the most useless is a sweet little romance between the son, Sam, and one of his classmates, Laura. They do a decent enough job of being lovey and cute, but it's fairly difficult to care much about whether or not they end up together in light of global annihilation. Anyway, I generally recommend this film, especially for a group or a family. I was impressed with how clean it is, also. There's very little bad language, and no sexual content at all. Anyway, good, clean, fun movie. And oh yeah, the special effects are incredible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had read reviews of the day after tomorrow some to its praise and others not, so when I spotted the video of it when out shopping decided to give it a look. My overall impression of the movie was that it was harmless fun to watch. I did not finish the movie feeling that 2 hours of my life had been stolen from me yet I felt I wanted to see more. The special affects were no less than astonishing in my view yet this is not the movie to watch if you want a deep and meaningful storyline and characters interesting to watch. As well as the story lacking in detail in lacked in my view any sense. It was hard to believe and follow that at the start of the movie the main character [Jack Hall the climatologist] was predicting the affects of global warming to be seen in hundreds of years and therefore urging the US Government to act, yet by the end of the movie had reduced his prediction to a matter of hours. However one small redeeming factor of this was the fact of seeing a trade mark disaster movie dog. The one dog that survives when millions of civilians die. The slight attempt at romance fell a little short but any movie containing Jake Gyllenhaal cant be too much of a disaster. Overall I would give this film an 8 out of 10. Another good watchable disaster movie.</fullReview>

The wolf scene, however, was thoroughly forgettable.The acting was sub-par, at best. Jake G's character got under my skin more than anything, and I never quite could relate with Quaid's character (he was much better in "The Rookie".)And lastly....the griping African-American guy with the dog. I seem to recall this scenario being played in another disaster movie...hmmm...what was it? Oh, yeah...Armageddon. C'mon....was this element REALLY required for this movie? And the Vice President's speech was thoroughly not motivating. I got more of a rise from the President's speech in "Independence Day," as cheesy as that one was.Although you have to take this movie with a grain of salt, I'll begrudgingly admit that I wasn't totally bored with it. It's definitely watchable at least once.5 out of 10 stars, mostly for the CGI representation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, if only that statement was true, then there might be more films of substance and less by-the-numbers rubbish films like this.The only thing that this predictable disaster farce was lacking was the villain that we all hope will die a grizzly death (and of course he does!).I question the film-maker's moral agenda (and respect for all human life) when we are shown the death of a news reporter. He is slammed by flying debris while bravely reporting the Hollywood storms. However later when one of the main characters heroically sacrifices himself and falls to his death to save others we are not privileged to see his demise. Why do we value and respect him enough not to show his death yet shock value death of less important characters is OK? We all know why, because this is a crass piece of Hollywood shlock designed to make oodles of cash.Some good CG, of course it's totally ridiculous and ALL the performances are utterly forgettable... I wonder how many awards it won?End of rant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At best dopey, at worst offensive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dopey, borderline offensive trash. The first half of the film is basically an excuse to unleash massive destruction on major American cities, but events of the past four years have robbed such an effort of a lot of the thrill and potential humor. Not that it would be terribly funny anyway, at least not in this director's hands. The disaster epics of the 1970s had their tongues firmly in cheek, and their ability to laugh at themselves allows even the most intelligent viewer to forgive a lot of excess. Roland Emmerich, on the other hand, approaches his story not with high seriousness, but with a kind of embarrassing TV-movie earnestness that's even worse. The fact that the hoariest of movie clichés are here intended to be genuinely heartwarming is a little pathetic, and doesn't jibe at all with the fanboyish cyberviolence of the movie's first act. Getting back to that violence, I'll never understand why these sorts of FX-travaganzas are always shot in the most unrealistic, unfrightening ways possible. Wouldn't it be much scarier to see a tornado (or three, in this case) from the perspective of someone on the *ground*, someone whose life is threatened, then from someone in the air? Ridiculous. 1 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unfortunately, I missed watching the film when it was shown in the cinema, so I had to make do with the DVD. But, that was a chilling enough experience - especially as it was a cold and dreary November day! Although the plot is of course exaggerated, the basic message is clear enough and brought home with spectacular visual effects. The other thing I liked about the film is that the characters are people you can relate to: the scientist whose warnings are being ignored for far too long because the politicians don't want to hear them, the scientist's son and his friends who get caught in the chaos but keep their "cool" so to speak and therefore survive.All in all a very good film to watch (but check the outside temperature before you do it ;-) !)Cheers Baerbel</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Day After Tomorrow Already Forgotten</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Day After Tomorrow is a noble film, in concept. The political statement - or dialogue initiative - is timely and provocative. The film though, loses any political endeavor underneath the bubbling drama of the storm. The plot, however, does not do much more than fizzle. The characters and their relationships are never fully developed. The audience is not drawn into the story line, and the characters' dilemmas are unmoving and almost superfluous. The plot, like the world in film, is washed away by the awesome special effects. The awesome special effects are just that - awesome. But because they do not have a plot to support them, the film does not go far beyond the thrills of a broadcast network's report of an impending storm, leaving The Day After Tomorrow already forgotten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>New York is up to it's neck in trouble. Los Angeles is in total mayhem. American residents flee to Mexico. And people stay inside waiting out the chaos burning tax law books. What's going on? Nope, it's not the morning of the 2004 American presidential election. It's the "Day after Tomorrow", a movie of gigantic proportions.Day After Tomorrow follows the struggles and desperation of a group of people trapped in New York City from a major global climate shift due to global warming. America and indeed the entire Northern hemisphere are facing the worst challenges they'll ever face because the temperature is rappidly dropping and Western civilization is about to disappear under 15 feet of snow. The case for: The CGI in this film is darn right spectacular. The best example of this is LA being destroyed by a series of gigantic tornadoes. I was biting my fingernails with pure excitement in this sequence. It blew me away (uh, no pun intended). There were also some great scenes with some people freezing to death in seconds (eeew) and some entertaining scenes of peril. Jake Gylenhaal makes a thumbs up performance as Sam.The case against: Don't expect Tolstoy when renting this. Things freeze. Things blow up. Things blow away. The whole film is about showing off impressive CGI and a certain handsome young actor, not an Oscar-nomination for Best Screenplay or Best Actor. If you considder these things, I'll guarantee you'll have a fun time. I enjoyed it immensely and look forward to pop the popcorn and enjoy it again.Grade: 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad for the environment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this movie as a disaster film. On the other hand, the disaster in a film like the Poseidon adventure was just a freak of nature. The Day After Tomorrow derives much of its interest from social concern over the very real consequences of global warming. Unfortunately, it doesn't reciprocate that concern with credible science or non-formulaic storytelling. Amid climatic chaos, the story focuses on the trials of one family--Dennis Quaid as a busy climatologist, Sela Ward, his doctor wife, and their son Jake Gyllenhaal, a high school student who goes to New York City to compete in a quiz competition. Quaid has been so busy running around the globe measuring the effects of global warming that he hasn't had adequate time to bond with his son. Once in New York, Gyllenhaal is less interested in questions about Aztecs then in whether he can score with his fetching fellow contestant, Emmy Rossum. Being the shy intellectual type, he spends the first half of the picture staring at his father resentfully and at the girl balefully. He's wounded and shy. But nothing that a little global disaster can't fix.The ostensible politics of the film are clearly 'liberal' At an environmental conference in India, the vice president (a Dick Cheney stand in) questions Quaid about his motives for making 'sensational' claims about global warming. As a political film, however, I wonder if this depiction of the effects of global warming actually do more harm than good for those concerned about the buildup of greenhouse gasses. Yes, global warming could cause the polar ice caps to melt and screw up the flow of the gulf stream and even cause a new ice age. But what's the deal with a tornado whose vortex sends down killer temperatures that act more like Freddy Kruger than a natural phenomenon. This stuff is so outlandish that nobody can take it seriously--or worse, actually give fodder to politically right-leaning claims that global warning is all hype. But don't let that worry you, even as millions freeze to death. The important thing is to spend more time with your family.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I tried to like this movie. I wanted to see these tremendous special effects but I couldn't get through it. The first scene of big special effects was the tornado scene in Los Angeles.We see a helicopter flying around reporting that there are several tornadoes. But the tornadoes do not look very real when compared to other movies and how are we to believe that a chopper would stay up surrounded by funnel clouds less than a quarter of a mile away. Impossible!Later we see this tidal wave come in and flood New York City. As it comes closer, the Statue of Liberty is covered up to her neck. Then minutes later the water comes ashore in lower Manhattan. This could never happen quite like that. Anyone who has been there could see that in ten seconds.I was extremely disappointed to have spent $15 to buy this on DVD. I strongly urge anyone with any grey matter to stay away from this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Day After ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After work yesterday, I went to the gigantic screen Continental 6 theatre in glorious Denver and saw The Day After Tomorrow. It's about time another extravagant doomsday motion picture summer blockbuster hit the big screen. Director Roland Emmerich of The Patriot (2000), Godzilla (1998), Independence Day (1996) and Stargate (1994) fame really socked it to the audience with this one. I enjoyed this film. It's so Emmerich-esque! Dennis Quaid is Jack Hall, a climatologist who figures out the world will suffer from abrupt global warming. Instead of occurring a hundred to a thousand years in the future, it begins to happen now. The special effects tense fest begins. It's a wacky special FX extravaganza! The audience is assaulted with natural disaster after natural disaster from Los Angles tornados to massive tidal waves slamming unfortunate New York City to quick freezes in the 'eye' of the storm. Quaid makes a promise that he'll get to his young son in New York, which is now being taken over by a new ice age.Jake Gyllenhaal, who played Homer Hickam in October Sky (1999) (a rocketry film which inspires me each and every time I see it), plays Quaid's son Sam Hall. Gyllenhaal does a decent job with some extreme action sequences.Plus this film has a dirty homeless guy as comic relief. One cannot go wrong with positive or negative portrayals of street people and their newspaper insulation. The film gets kudos for having a destitute guy and his dog prominently featured.It's not the best movie ever made, but it is entertaining. I recommend seeing it in theaters where one can point and laugh at the cowering/weeping children in the audience. This film is Rated PG-13 for intense situations of peril. And if the weather scenes don't scare you, the ravaging and hungry wolves will.Trivia: Emmerich executive produced the film Eight Legged Freaks (2002), but I will not hold against him.</fullReview>

The opening scene had me convinced I might like it. (I was like woah!) but later on in the movie I was laughing so hard I was crying. Of course there were some perilous scenes in the movie, but the airplane scene? That was the biggest ripoff of Lost that I've ever seen! It was very funny how they portrayed the Pres/Vice (So much like Bush/Cheyney that I can believe the controversy)But I was glad at the ending of the movie that wasn't to corny.

More disastrous than Godzilla, funnier than Alien, and colder than Volcano. One reviewer commented that it's most hysterically funny moment is when our heroes literally "run from the cold". I agree. Choice B- movie cinema is made from such moments. Giant ape climbs the Empire State building. Martians survive nuclear bombardment to be destroyed by bacteria.

Disaster - on a global scale, frees you from the necessity to brush your teeth - or get up early. In The Day After Tomorrow, the disaster is not over - like love in a Carpenters song, it has only just begun. That's what I like. America ends up living in Mexico, all national debt for South America removed, until (it seems by implication) the attack helicopters get there.

That's for novels anyway!) and cut-out all the film-school flunky, catty remarks and just admire the ferocious atmospheric (painterly) spectacle of this film, perhaps they could appreciate, "The Day After Tomorrow" as the highest of the High Art in film-making.Now that "CGI" digital has crescendo'd-out with, "The Day After Tomorrow, I'm waiting to see what the super Digital Era of Film can bring forth for imaginative, quality adult-type films (what Pixar is to the kiddies).Aside from that, "The Day After Tomorrow" remains the Highest of High Art of Film-making, Direction, and Special FX.

The special effects are pretty decent, although the sudden freezing of everything isn't terribly good. The story is pretty well written, and should be a warning to everyone that our climate is changing because of our insatiable demand for fossil fuels. It's definitely an ecological wake-up call. I almost bought this but decided to rent instead and am glad I did. It's not a "keeper" for me. Others will really enjoy it more than I did.

		<fullReview>Lets put this into context. I hate disaster movies but end up watching them and hating myself for it. Here in the UK they grace Channel Five (the tabloid of TV channels) on Sunday afternoons and late at night and to my embarrassment I have therefore seen quite a few of these terrible works. Each Disaster movie follows the same formula. There will be a tragedy. A minor character will die. There will be some flag waving. The tragedy will be overcome by the grouping together of resources and strengths of the, always unwilling, stars. Unfortunately this is EXACTLY what happens in The Day After Tomorrow. And it is even worse than the Channel 5 flicks because it make s such a big thing of all these terribly obvious and predictable scenes. The effects are mindblowing but they serve no more that wrapping a piece of clay in shiny paper. Yes the premise is good. But that's it. The actors look embarrassed and any credibility and mystery Jake Gyllenhaal had has been ruined by this film. I have only once ever come across another film of such poor quality and that was Wild Wild West. 1 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now, don't get me wrong. I thought Independence Day was an incredibly stupid, pointless movie, and also ridiculously patriotic, although this director is actually German, not American!! But my main problem with The Day after Tomorrow, is that, although the main premise of sudden climate changes due to the effects of global warming may be grossly exaggerated and therefore maybe not entirely true, at least this was a serious, existent subject. And Emmerich took this subject and turned it into Independence Day, damn him! When I think of all the interviews he gave before the movie premiered in Germany, stating his deep concern for our environment and especially the American attitude towards steps to protect it, like the Kyoto protocol, I really believed him! And there he was, on the DVD in an interview, stating he originally wasn't attracted to TDAT, "because I thought it was just like Independence Day. But then I thought, no, this story is different, because I never really believed in aliens attacking Earth." Duh! That must be the dumbest thing I've ever heard a director say, and it ruined this film for me completely. However, despite my issues with Roland Emmerich, I must say Jake Gyllenhaal did a really good job with his role, Dennis Quaid tried to rise above the cheesy dialogue (scriptwriting just isn't R.E.'s forte), and the CGI are fantastic! Both the tornado storms in LA as well as New York first drowning, then freezing over, were really well executed, and very impressive. So, I guess, if you are looking for a great visual to sudden climate change, this is your movie. If you're interested in the human development during major catastrophes, any other movie will deliver more credible stories.</fullReview>

There is always some father who doesn't take good care of his kids, divorced from his wife, kids get in trouble, boy loves girl, girl loves boy, jadajadajada. Cut all this s**t out and you might actually have an entertaining movie. O and they added some wolves (ehr, computer animations they want to look like wolves but they look more like the wolf from American werewolf in London), and 3 guys in some sort of arctic station or something, drinkin' scotch when it gets colder, but you never see them at the end of the movie. What's the matter guys, run out of money? The idea of the movie is nice, and it works well with the issues of global warming we are facing today, but, come on, tornado's in LA??? A ship in downtown NYC??? A Russian SHIP?????? How far fetched can you get. And in the end......they all survive. The only good parts in these movie are: the kid in the plane, on his way to NYC when the oxygenmasks come dropping down right in front of him, that actually made me laugh, the view from the space station, looking down on a few massive storms. And the idea of cold winds dropping down into the eye of the storms was OK as well. But if you are looking for an good movie, with a lot of thrills and entertainment, you might as well go see Titanic instead...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Day After Tomorrow....A Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Day After Tomorrow is quite simply one of the greatest films ever made. The use of special effects in this film are the best I've ever seen, and anybody who likes films, will LOVE this title. It's also an extreme eye-opener for government officials in countries producing far too much pollution. Its just a damn pity none of em listen or pay attention to the disastrous effect that global warming can have on our planet. Countries like Britain, and America are going to be the worst hit, just like in this fantastic film, yet nobody seems to pay any attention to whats going to happen tomorrow.Hopefully, we'll avert a catastrophe like in this film in the future, but until we find out, you REALLY should check this movie out, it is absolutely incredible, and if you don't like it, then you obviously don't like films that much, because at this stage, this masterpiece is extremely hard to topple in my bookFinal Score... 9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good start, Awful ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie, IMO, epitomize the flaw of many Hollywood movies. The Day after Tomorrow opens up with a series of eye-candies, suitable for a disaster movie such as Twister or Titanic. Therefore the first hour or so of the movie is enjoyable. Then the movie turns to much worse. Attempt to intertwine cliché Hollywood heroism with some touchy romance, which eventually ruined the movie. The later half of the movie involves some of most ridiculous plot in the history of my movie viewing experience. The director and writer should be has major responsibility for the later half of this "disasterful" disaster movie. Otherwise this movie should be the disaster movie of the year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Allow me to open by saying, as emphatically as is possible through generic, unformatted text, that this is quite possibly the worst movie I have *ever* seen over the span of my 18 years on this planet. It is my personal recommendation that the person or persons responsible for creating this reprehensible piece of garbage should be severely reprimanded -- if not banned from film-making for all eternity and forced to surrender their immortal souls to the prince of darkness, Satan, himself.I arrived at the dollar theater in a positive, open minded mood -- with a close friend visiting from out of state, no less, thus feeling nothing short of unattractively chipper -- ready to welcome an ass kicking new movie starring two of my favorite actors (Dennis Quaid and Jake Gyllenhaal) with open arms. By the end of this two hour trainwreck, however, I found myself in a state of absolute shock, my mouth hanging slack, mind struggling to digest the horrendous chunk of painfully insipid, asinine cow dung I had just been forced to swallow. Not only did this tired, predictable, appallingly moronic excuse for a movie leech 124 minutes of my life I can *never* hope to regain, but it cost my poor friend (who was reduced to nothing more than a shell of his former self after viewing this monstrosity) two whole dollars and a potentially enjoyable Tuesday evening.The only aspect of this film vaguely *reminiscent* of *some obscure kind* of redeeming quality, was the scene in which some hungry wolves -- presumably bred in captivity and handled by humans their entire lives, "domesticated" in every sense of the word -- escaped from the zoo with a newly acquired the taste for human flesh and proceeded to hunt down Jake Gyllenhaal and his cronies on a conveniently parked ship outside the library. I laughed from the sheer absurdity of the situation, tears leaking from the corners of my eyes, as everyone else in the darkened theater gasped and held their breaths out of genuine concern. Inside, though, a piece of me was dying: the piece that retained my last shred of hope for humanity. Thank you, Mr. Roland Emmerich, for destroying my will to live.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Roland Emmerich is NO Irwin Allen........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If our former Vice President Al Gore made a science fiction movie to warn the dangers of global warming,would it resemble this climatological super-spectacle by Roland Emmerich,the director of such summer blockbusters as "Independence Day","Godzilla",and "The Patriot"? Probably not,but lets face facts here:Roland Emmerich is NO Irwin Allen whom was better at disaster related flicks then this spectacle of disaster strikes without warning as part of the biggest hokem of the summer and then some since this film was released during the Memorial Day weekend of 2004,and as of this commentary its still is in theatres! There is about one part-relevant science fiction to one part disaster movie hokum in Emmerich's effort,which envisions a new ice age descending on the earth in a little over a week after the eruption of a bizarre super storm in the northern hemisphere with horrifying results.Here we have Dennis Quaid as the obligatory earnest scientist,the movie is as at once essentially silly and genially effective in delivering the popcorn thrills and special-effects mayhem(which is the main part of the film that is the best part). The most memorable features include the storm's spectacular decimation of New York,and a right wing U.S. Vice President who is a ringer for Dick Cheney who gets to lead America's evacuation into of all places--Mexico. And since the events of 9/11,has America had its fascination with things that become destroyed since we fantasized about this at the movies? Of course because we go and see it,and then went it happens then what in heavens name in the hell do we do next? Something to think about when we see events like this hoping that the unexpected doesn't happened.</fullReview>

Just every physics law was broken in this film that was supposed to be some kind of a "ralistic" beginning of an ice age, well it is more realistic for me to be a scooby doo. I don't spoil the film ,watch it, just for me there was no entertainment from the beginning, so when there is no entertainment there is no possibility to like it, i give it a 1/10, because special effects don't buy me anymore.</fullReview>

I have seen The Passion of the Christ, Shrek 2, Troy, Dodgeball, and now this movie. I liked all those movies but not really this one. The acting sucked, mostly by Jake Gyllenhaal and his girlfriend or whatever. Dennis Quaid was ok and Jay O. Sanders was ok but had to much of a small part. The story was the worst for the film. The whole movie was non-stop effects which had pretty nice special effects but there was no story in the background. I was anticipated to see this movie but I was disappointed. The ending was very good when there in the spaceship or satellite or whatever looking at the ice on Earth clearing up. I'd have to credit that and the effects were good but that doesn't make a movie.

		<shortDescription>Don't worry too much about the message in Emmerich's latest - just enjoy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rating: *** (out of *****)Earth is under attack - from its own climate. Excessive global warming is set to bring about the next Ice Age, something that scientist Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) suspects long before anyone else. Of course (as is often the case in Hollywood disaster films) few heed his warnings, and, sooner than expected, tornadoes and floods are destroying the major cities in the north of America. Hall has the additional worry of trying to rescue his son, Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) who happens to be in New York when the disaster occurs.As if Independence Day wasn't enough, Roland Emmerich now wants destruction on a new, more realistic (hang on, did I just say "realistic"?) level. Funnily enough, he succeeds. If you liked ID4, you'll definitely like this.I think it's best to compare The Day After Tomorrow with ID4. The similarities are there, alright: there's the Big Presidential Speech, the "important" characters who don't believe our heroes when they should, and "touching" subplots involving kids. Then again, "It's the End of the World as we Know It" is nowhere to be heard. But at the end of this, you'll definitely feel fine.To be fair to Emmerich, he does touch on a clear warning about global warming. Yet despite his attempt to convey a serious message, you can never picture him outside the popcorn genre. And in every possible way, this is a Roland Emmerich film. But it succeeds better than his other disaster efforts, though, the reasons being less characters (just look at ID4's bloated cast for comparison), greater emotional restraint and a more frightening premise. I'm not even going to analyse the special effects, because you'll know how good they are from either the trailers or the standard Emmerich set in his previous disaster films.It helps that he has chosen solid actors like Dennis Quaid, Jake Gyllenhaal, Ian Holm and relative newcomer Emmy Rossum. (I could've sworn I saw a young Norah Jones when I looked at her - interestingly, we'll see how she fares as a singer when the film version of The Phantom of the Opera is released in the near future.)Forget the factual errors, blatant conveniences, corny ending, bad dialogue, product placement overload and attempts at clever pseudo-science. The Day After Tomorrow is a genuinely thrilling popcorn film, even if it is unremarkable and shamelessly manipulative. One that's best enjoyed when you don't want to think.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Long, yet short, but entertaining enough :). *SPOILERS*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to watch this movie earlier today. I had no idea what to expect, as I had not watched the trailers nor followed any of the reviews that had been played over and over again on TV. However, I was pleasantly surprised.The movie didn't feel as if it dragged on for a long time at all. I wouldn't say that I was at the edge of my seat throughout the movie either but looked forward to what was next in line. Thus in that sense, it captured my interest.As a disaster movie, one can't expect much more than what it's supposed to portray. When you're smacked in the middle of a disaster, what kind of "plot" are you actually expected to have? Imagine yourself being in the middle of one... and think about the possible outcomes. Given that you are not allowed to portray the disasters and destruction caused by them, which you had just witnessed, will you see it as an interesting story to tell? Not really right? At the end of the day, it's a "I WANTED TO SURVIVE!" situation, where people are going to react spontaneously or not at all. Anything can basically happen.TDAT is a simple story without many angles and is focused in the US but finds ways to hint that the issues relate to other countries as well. The government doesn't want to listen to the scientists; the scientists are of course more or less correct; incidents occur; the main man has to fulfill a promise that he has made and end of story. Where haven't we seen that before? But does it really matter? Life itself is filled with clichés. I believe its how a movie is willing to portray these clichés, which is interesting. And how many plots does one really want to focus on, in such a movie? One could of course focus on how different families would react to such an ordeal, due to their upbringing, environment etc. however, despite the lack of foreshadowing, that wasn't the point of the movie afterall :).We're again in Manhatten and L.A. again. New York is up north and it happens to carry plenty of symbols. The Statue of Liberty for one, I believe, is a symbol of hope and people working together to find solutions for any ordeal. One good thing for picking such busy cities is that there's plenty of activity and most people are rather infatuated and caught up with their daily lives. With this in mind, the director probably threw a disaster upon them, just to watch how they'd react (some funny scenes there). It also added extra magnificent work for the CGI creators. The effects and cinematography were excellent, making the movie a 'cinema must see.'The character development wasn't at its best. But it was enough to get to know the characters a bit. However, if one is expects to feel deeply for the characters, this is not the movie to watch. The characters are skimmed over, as the main issue of the movie after all, is the climatic shift, in which the whole world is in. I would have liked more character development but on the other hand, what I liked about the movie not having weighed a lot on this is that you get a better feel of what's happening everywhere else.The script itself could have been better of course but then again, there's not much to say, when you're in such a situation, besides, "OH MY GOD!" or "LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THAT WAVE!" etc. I don't think it's a time to get all poetic now. Despite having its flaws, the dialogue was natural enough and had its humorous moments.The acting wasn't too bad. Bits could have been done better, as I couldn't feel the hurt and pain. On the other hand, the camera didn't focus on that dimension, as anyone will notice, when watching the movie. However, there's a feel of anger, frustration and despair that arises in the movie, due to the conflicts between the characters.The students in the movie created an interesting enough subplot. This subplot also gave rise, later on in the movie, to a rather exciting scene, which was nicely made.I thought that the ending of the movie was pretty good, despite it "suddenly ending". However, the audience is after all expected to figure out what things are happening throughout the movie. The thought I had in the end was, "Mess with Earth and Earth will find a way to balance itself, even if it means the death to all of us."The political issue was a rather amusing part as I saw it as what some would stereotypically call it, "Anti-American". I think that it's basically giving out a partial message reminding of how materialistic that many people in the world are becoming. So materialistic that anything which goes against their goals of being able to obtain these items, should be shot down; that they have end up looking at things in the short run.With regards to the way the movie displayed stereotypes in the movie, I found it funny but OK. There are particular stereotypes in this world, which will set the audience's mind off into thinking, "Okay, I've seen X and I relate X to that culture." Thus in that sense, I thought it was okay, as the movie was probably trying to pace the introduction.The musical score was beautiful. It had a bit of everything. It had similarities to some other soundtracks like Vertical Limit but that was fine.Overall, I found the movie entertaining. If you're expecting a mind wrenching experience, this is not the kind of movie for one to watch in the first place. It could have focused more on the pain and so forth; how it feels like to be frozen, infected, etc. However, I thought that it was fine the way it was. I would give it a 7-7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm 15 and even i realized the most obvious error in this film. It is impossible to have two storm cells/hurricanes rotating in opposite direction in the same hemisphere. Also when the kids are coming back from the ship and they're running from the ice, the whole point of that scene was that the air temp was low. Therefore the couldn't possible run away from it. You would think that in a movie about a new ice age the directors might have hired a climatologist or meteorologist but it seems that they cut costs. Perhaps if they had hired someone to check what they were doing the movie could've been a little more accurate. It seems these days that directors are taking fantastic stories and ruining them just to try and make the movie better in there eyes, such as Braveheart. Personally I'm not holding much hope for the upcoming "King Arthur" (it's not released here yet). If writers and directors would pay a little more attention then maybe they would be making better films. This is not to say that these movies are bad, just made completely inaccurate so that a love story or special effects can be added.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"On the Nose Dialogue"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't have much to add to what's already been said here, but this movie is very guilty of what's called "on the nose dialogue." A very rough translation of that is.... the characters are saying, in a wooden way, exactly what was the situation in front of them without any interesting subtext. Or, in cliché's without any buildup (which is worse than a cliché' that isn't at least earned along the way.For example, in TDAT, the world is coming to an end and Jack Hall is asleep on a coach in the office, after having worked for 24 hours straight, and someone asks his assistant, "Does he always work this hard." What dedication.Plot wise, I'm missing something. Why does Jack have to "walk" from DC to NYC to save his son. Jack's presence would not, and doesn't change anything. The special effects were fantastic, but this script wouldn't have gotten past a "reader" at a studio. It did in this case because the writer, director, and producer were one and the same.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Emmerich must have hoped he'd be the "big budget disaster" answer to "Farenheit-9/11", unfortunately, he blew it because he let the special effects out-pace science and the politics out-pace the story. I knew this failed when I heard Mark Moran on Air America's "Morning Sedition" talk about how much he hated it. He kinda gave it away that the reason was it let the "Dick Cheney" character "off-the-hook" for his "evil, anti-environmental ways" at the end. Fun to watch, but as bash-you-over-the-head with message as a tidal surge up Broadway. I wonder if a second "global warming" flick will be produced, if President Bush is re-elected...or if, like homelessness when Bill Clinton was elected, it will amazingly 'disappear' from the Hollywood radar if Kerry becomes President.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best human (d)evolution movie since Quest for Fire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I once saw a Quebecois movie made in the early 80s. It was called La Guerre du Feu (Quest for Fire). It had a similar plotting problem to this movie: how do you compress hominid evolution over thousands of years into two hours or less? A lot of my friends, who had a professional interest in the subject as anthropologists, were down on it for being inaccurate. It's alright to have fire discovered suddenly, but the nuclear family? In any case, the idea of the last as a human universal is a western myth. I rejected their analysis on the grounds that it was unfair to judge a movie by the best current knowledge. Rather it should be judged in relation to previous examples of the genre and, in the case of Quest for Fire, that was caveman movies like One Million Years BC starring Raquel Welch. By that standard, this movie was a great leap forward ? intelligent, realistic and humane, even if its anthropology was, well, dodgy. It just had a plotting problem and so does The Day After Tomorrow.How do you represent the coming of the next ice age as a human interest drama? Well, it has to take place in a couple of days. Who cares if this is implausible? Griffith invented close-up and panorama to represent the individual in society. The panoramas in this movie are breathtaking -- it simply couldn't have been made five years ago -- and the plot has to take liberties to put people in them. It opens with a spectacular tracking shot of the melting polar icecaps and, if a piece the size of Rhode Island breaks off while we watch, it is more dramatic than implausible for some American scientists to fall down the crack. Panorama and close-up.The human interest is vintage Hollywood kitsch, featuring the nuclear family, of course ? in its broken, reunited and adolescent forms. The movie's political line is quite subversive and well-realized, with a Cheney look-alike as Vice-President and Americans streaming South across the Rio Grande for refuge in the Third World. I also liked the cod symbolism of western civilization going down the tubes while doughty survivors hid in the New York public library and burned the books to keep warm. An original Gutenberg bible was rescued by helicopter... But the harsh reality of having to forget SAT scores and explore other career possibilities in a frozen world was at least acknowledgedAnother plotting problem reminded me of The Pianist. The first half of the movie is taken up with the sheer momentum and drama of the Disaster, but the second half resolves into a chase whose successful outcome is known in advance, since this is a Hollywood movie. Emmerich succeeded better than the Polanski in this respect and he has now replaced Robert Zemeckis as my favourite director. I thought this was the best disaster movie ever and a great advance on Quest for Fire as a thrilling commentary on the process of human evolution ? or should that be devolution? It had integrity because it knew itself and was not ashamed.</fullReview>

The acting WOULD be good if the script wasn't so terrible, and the message being sent to the audience about global warming isn't as subtle as most would like it to be. However, this IS a disaster film and well, it pretty much comes with the territory. There really isn't much to say about this film, its not GOOD, but it is very entertaining...in first half. The second half, however, while reasonably entertaining, isn't as good. Why? Because after we've seen the special effects orgy that was the destruction of Manhattan, there's nothing much for the characters to do but spew out Roland Emmerich's dreadful dialogue. I wish he's just let somebody else write his films. The Day After Tomorrow is basically a silly, fun film with a made for TV movie feel to it - despite it's awesome special effects.</fullReview>

ITS LIKE ALL OTHER DISASTERS FILMS BEFORE IT. I did enjoy the special effects and the less than passable storyline. But you have to remember that this movie sole purpose is to entertain. To destroy stuff and to give that false hope that they give us in every flick of this nature. I did like the special effects but it wasn't enough destruction for the story that was being provided. These are the same guys that brought us ID4 and it seemed they had some left-over special effects they wanted to use. They are certainly no writers due to the lame and over used dialogue, but dialogue is not the point of this picture. This film is also best seen on a big screen. I saw it at a drive in with a bunch of friends and this is the perfect drive-in movie. This is the film to eat popcorn, drink sodas, stuff yourself with hotdogs and when it's over there is nothing to really think about. Its good entertainment to waste time with family and friends. It's not thought provoking, not controversial and you will not be blown away, but it's good cheesy fun and we all need those types of films from time to time. So go to the drive in and watch the world get destroy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into "The Day After Tomorrow" with high expectations. However,these expectations were never met. A silly plot intermingled with admittedly spectacular special effects makes for a highly improbable yet entertaining film. I do have questions for the writers though; 1. Could you have not strayed from the "Independance Day" Emmerich style token destruction of LA and New York? There are other cities in the US and, gasp, the world!!!! 2. Walking from Philidelphia to New York? Come on! 3. This one is more personal, with me being Canadian and all. Canada and the northern states were "done for" at the start of the film. Come on. Canadians and Americans in the northern states get by fine in the winter. We are the toughest breed. North Dakotans and Minnesotans know what I'm talking about.The acting was so-so as the actors had a shotty script to begin with. Dennis Quaid and Jake Gyllenhal do their best with the dialogue provided. I recommend people save this as a rental or go a cheap theater, the special effects can't save this from from being an occasionally thrilling, mostly tedious film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See it on the big screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Due to many reviews calling this film mediocre, I went into it with lowered expectations. Maybe that was why I ended up enjoying it. Sure, the science is bad, but the effects make for quite a ride. And while the characters are superficial, they're really only there as window dressing. Face it - this movie is all about watching the human world get trashed by Mother Nature. Go see it on the big screen and sit up front, because that's the way to enjoy this sort of film. If you sit in the back or wait for the DVD, it's probably not worth it. I'd compare it favorably with Emmerich's two other big budget disaster films - "Godzilla" and "Independence Day". The latter film is probably the better comparison. "Tomorrow" lacks some of the humor of "ID4", but the effects have improved and the plot resolution isn't quite so cheesy. I give "The Day After Tomorrow" a 7 on the big screen, but probably only a 4 or 5 otherwise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That was cool. Okay lets do this now.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This hodgepodge of special effects makes Twisters plot seem like English literature. The compilation of happenstance, political commentary, lack of scientific fact (especially in meteorology, climatology and geography), and bizarre twists fill this disaster flick with more clichés than the Irwin Allen disaster schlock of the 1970's.Here we have an intelligent climatologist studying glacial core samples in the arctic. He is dedicated and a genius (but not too much of genius not to be working on a thin shelf of the arctic that happens to break of in the middle of his camp). Flash forward to the same scientist speaking to a meeting of the UN in a snow New Dehli, which just happens to be co-chaired by the evil, greedy, "Dick Cheney" look-a-like of a vice president who becomes a central 'evil-doer'. Flash forward to character development, let's give the scientist an estranged wife and son in the States. I could go on and on.This movie does its work in a nonsensical manner adding layers of gee whiz special effects, stereo typical characters and comments about the lack of political process and America's greed as means of trying to establish a plot. And what a plot. The genius scientist has discovered that the earth is facing "abrupt global warming". The polar ice caps are going to melt very fast, disrupt the natural flow of the oceans and then cause an ice-age. How fast? 6 to 8 months.Whoops. That will take too long in story time. 6 to 8 weeks. That major change in time frame is probably why only New York is besieged with a torrent of water putting most roads 30 feet or more under water but leaves the rest of the coastal US unscathed. That was cool. Okay now lets flash freeze the Northern Hemisphere. **ZAP** Now the majority of the "Western World" is frozen solid. But of course not the oceans. The best of this movie is in the special effects and the unintended comedy. (A main character places a phone call from a hardwired, submerged pay phone while the power to everything else has been shorted out. A president, too inept that he has to defer to the advice of his vice president. The ability of a person to but their bare hands on metal surfaces in sub-zero temps without ripping the flesh from his bones. The absolutely worst depiction of animals through the use of CGI. Americans crossing the Rio - which should have been 10 times wider than depicted because of the melting ice caps - desperate to sneak into Mexico. -...and I could go on and on)This idiotic, mindless drivel would have been better had they used a variation of Twister's plot, which was to show some cool effects and admit that there really was no plot.So how bad was it? "The Day After Tomorrow"'s plot made "The Core"'s seem completely realistic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Election Year Debut...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning***SPOILERS AHEAD***As far as disaster flicks go, the special effects were outstanding and worth the price of admission. As for the rest of the movie, well....most everybody knows it's bad science and most movies don't usually get everything right anyway. However this movie is a patently obvious springboard for the environmental alarmist agenda. We have the closed-minded, science-hating, baleful VP, a Dick Cheney lookalike and obviously a Republican. The president on the other hand, is much more open-minded, moderate, and willing to save North American humanity, sacrificially sticks around the Oval Office until the bitter end and freezes to death on his way out of the district. He also bears a striking resemblance to Al Gore. Coincidence? I'm thinking no. At the end of the movie, Lady Liberty is sticking out of the snow Planet of the Apes style and President Cheney's evil twin is groveling before what's left of the nation how was wrong about global warming and thanking Mexico for their generosity at letting the US flee there, insinuating that they're much more magnanimous than he ever was.I can't really see why the wolf scene was inserted. As the rains are pouring into the zoo, the zoo keepers come in to check on the animals and oh no! The timber wolves have escaped! Nothing comes of this initially (I still can't figure out how they escaped drowning along with everything else) until another 30 minutes or so. We then see three snarling curs, growling and skulking towards the ship where our young heroes are on a rescue mission, looking more like demon dogs from hell with glowing eyes than actual, real-life wolves. Why is this in the movie? It really doesn't fit. Maybe it's representative of some sort of primitive struggle between man and beast perhaps? Or maybe, they just needed something to fill 15 minutes of film.This movie was great on special effects, but low on reality. Most movies are, but the problem with this one is that I'm sure there will be people who walk out and think this could really happen. It's an object lesson in deconstructionism and Emmerich is a perfect shill for environmental alarmists. What better movie to debut during the summer before a presidential election?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Modern computer animation hasn't done that much to catastrophe films as you would expect. And if you do such a movie, you ought to concentrate on the catastrophe, not on another pale "father tries to rescue his son"-theme.This is supposed to be a somewhat radical film. As have been seen in thousands of movies before, those who are in power doesn't take warnings seriously, but they learn in the end and the good people are the wise ones. Not much of radicalism really.There is a little fun in the ending, where you find border-problems turned inside out. And those who have the power become humble. Still, it would have been more interesting having more rain, snow and thunder in this movie, instead of some cheap moral.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into DAT (The Day After Tomorrow) under the impression it was some sort of unholy combination, Twister meets Armageddon if you will. Those are two of the worst event movies I have seen. Twister because it is boringly repetetive with no arc to proceedings, it just goes nowhere. Armageddon, which forgetting it's hubristic jingoistic approach and callous disregard for life (the easy destruction of Shanghai and Paris really soured it for me) is poorly edited to the point it makes no sense. DAT has the crazy weather and destruction on a global scale, but it's infinitely better than either of those two films, because it is far more involving, with the disaster movie approach adopted it allows for a proper story arc. Furthermore it avoids the heavy handed approach adopted by Armageddon. Areas of the world suffer greatly, but it isn't just glossed over when the heroes save the day, rather there is an undercurrent of melancholic regret punctuating the movie, well represented in the scene where we say goodbye to Ian Holm's professor and his team.In fact it is to Emmerich's credit that he has managed to fill the movie with good character actors, who genuinely give the film a sense of humanity. Ok so some of it is a bit on the cheesy side, but the thought is a good one. These are real people being put through appalling stuff, so it's important that we have some sympathy for them. Dennis Quaid in particular brings a solid presence to the film. There is an honourable stoicism to his Dr Jack Hall. I felt genuinely moved by the scene where he decides to go to retrieve his son. Jake Gylenhaal as son Sam plays along well, he's more than capable of making this stuff believable.I did like the scenes in the British weather outpost. Ian Holm, Adrian Lester and the other guy (sorry perhaps someone can put me right here) felt more than just "weather fodder", they played it low key, and kinda helped sum up the human cost. There's a serious point being made here, and whether the science involved errs closer to fiction or not, it does make you think. By ignoring the scientists and continuing to harm the planet we could end up causing a catastrophe, maybe not on this scale, but many lives would be lost.All of which makes it sound like a depressing two hours, which it most certainly isn't. There's a guilty pleasure to be had in seeing how Emmerich wrecks the place. Twisters rip through the Hollywood sign and tidal waves submerge the Statue of Liberty. I don't know whether Emmerich meant anything by this, but to me this a symbolic of the humbling of the Western World. Underscored by the irony of having Americans pouring in to Mexico as refugees and having the American Vice President announce that we are now dependent on the Third World.The first builds up with ominous events alerting us to the dangers to come. We see snow in New Delhi and hailstones in Tokyo. The LA storm for me was the highpoint though, it demands to be seen on a big screen. There's so much detail to it. The flooding of New York is superbly orchestrated too, with the masterstroke for me being the sight of the ship floating up to the library.The look of the film is pretty dark. Refreshing in fact to see a film that isn't reliant on the warm colours. The cinematography and editing are bang on with the action all shot in a steady style, with wide angles capturing the full scope of the mayhem, with chaos occurring all over the screen. The sound is good too, with storm fx coming from all sides of the auditorium, you genuinely feel part of the experience at points.After my misgivings going into DAT, I have to admit this is a very good film. It does drag a touch in the final half hour, but it's hit you with so much by then, and your so involved in the protagonists fight for survival, that it takes you all the way. It does go through a number of disaster movie cliches (the people who go don't listen to the hero and go off anyway, the heroic friend who buys it), but the characters feel genuine and the scale of events and spectacle generated is awesome. If I'm marking, it's Eight out of Ten for me</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've always wondered if there's an upper limit to the global disaster genre. After nuclear Armageddon, alien invasions, zombie attacks, comet collisions, well, what's left but ecological catastrophe? In the "really bad weather" variant of movie house eschatology, the "Day After Tomorrow" delivers some terrific globe-as-spooky-ice house visuals, but suffers from the usual disaster movie defect, soapy multi-character story lines which put questions like "will he get the girl?" on equal footing with "will he survive the next ice age?" The juggle between such disparate tensions can only reassure the audience that however disastrous things may look, they can't be completely hopeless. After all, what fun is global disaster without a little dewy-eyed teen romance? As with most any disaster movie, CGI-enhanced appearances take the upper-hand over reality.</fullReview>

I would love to see a mountain climber cut his rope with one quick slice of the knife.If they were going for a record number of entries under the "Goofs" section, they may have succeeded.

Ian Home was typically amazing and very watchable as well. Jake Guyllenhaal (Sp?) is a recently rising actor, and was less of THE 'Toby McGuire wannabe' that he seemed to be in the past.

I was surprised. Many of my friends had said that they didn't enjoy it. But, I always want to make sure for myself, as I'm sure most of you do. The acting was good, not great. I'm sure better characters could have been chosen instead of Quaid and Gyllenhaal.The disaster situations were realistic, especially the situation in Los Angeles. But, again, you only saw events that were occurring in America (with the exception of a couple of helicopters going down over Europe)and they were selected (i.e. the story stuck strictly to New York, Washington DC, and Los Angeles). Graphics and detailing was done extremely well, especially the tsunami heading for New York. I was also impressed with the scene when Hall (Quaid) and his associate were walking north of Philadelphia and the American flag froze. So, this movie was quite impressive and much different than some viewers may expect it to be. I'm a little shaky on the title (and everything else I've critized on by now) but I really did enjoy this movie!</fullReview>

Holm did his job well, despite the disparity of his scenes. Quaid, Ward, et al, were merely there to collect a paycheck, and it REALLY shows. Instead of paying theater prices, rent TDAT and keep your thumb near the FF button.NOTE! Any popcorn you buy at the grocery is 70% cheaper than the theater stuff. Soda is 80% less, as is candy!!

Dennis Quaid is not Harrison Ford, unfortunately, and Jake Gyllenhaal better realize that reading the script in a deliberative manner combined with vacant stares does not constitute acting. It is a shame that with the vast budget for films like these that some funds are not used to hire a decent scriptwriter or to develop the screenplay. Scenes that should have had some feeling to them (simply because of disaster film conventions) were curiously devoid of impact, such as Quaid's wife being left behind with the cancer victim during the storm.

How about those sub-plots?

		<shortDescription>'Tomorrow' subsists another typical end of the world movie, with an explicit political message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Roland Emmerich's 'The Day After Tomorrow' is merely another typical end-of-the-world film, with an explicit political message.The story follows Climatologist Jack Hall (Denis Quaid) whose prediction of another ice age, due to global warming disrupting the Atlantic current, happens far sooner than hypothesized. Almost overnight, freak storms begin to ravage the whole northern hemisphere, with tornados in California, hail the size of softballs in Japan and a gigantic tidal wave in New York City. As the storms get worse, Hall must convince the president to evacuate the country into Latin America, and then he must trek from Washington DC to New York to rescue his son (Jake Gyllenhaal) who got stuck in the thick of this new ice age. The plot carries a blunt message of global warming and how we can't continue to exploit our natural resources or Mother Nature will fight back. The film also includes an ignorant vice-president that strikingly resembles Dick Cheney. Although some of the weather in the movie seems authentic, most of the special effects are hyperbolized, synthetic-looking storms in which the main characters always seem to miraculously escape. At times it became ridiculous as to how extreme and quickly this ice age happens.The only thing more artificial than the storms, are the movie's effusive lines. In their efforts to capture the compassion felt in a disaster, this poorly written movie becomes a schmaltzy mess of forced dialogue. For example, in one scene, J.D. (Austin Nichols), the jerk who was trying to steal Gyllenhaal's crush, tells Gyllenhaal to 'tell her how you feel.' They simply tried too hard to make it emotional and powerful.On top of this, 'The Day After Tomorrow' is filled with dry characters and a clichéd family plot, with the father always being absent on his research trips, and breaking his promises to his son. It is crammed with side plots that are never completed. A little boy with cancer at the hospitable where Hall's wife works is waiting for his parents to call, but soon his parents are forgotten. J.D. is trying to contact his little brother, yet he too is forgotten. The plot's predictability annihilates any bit of tension they try to build. In fact much of the film ended up being humorous, most of which is unintentional. The film's cinematography is mediocre, although there is one brilliant scene when a janitor in LA is the only one left in a skyscraper after the tornadoes hit. A greenish light streams in from the torn walls behind his silhouette, as he walks to open a door and finds the wall missing. He stands there many stories off the ground and looks out at the ruins of Los Angeles. At more than two hours long, 'The Day After Tomorrow' is a clichéd, saccharine and boring attempt to show the world the possible (yet Hollywood-ized) effects of global warming.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>not that i was expecting much. while watching the movie, i couldn't help but think that this is emmerich's homage to the 70's disaster flicks that we all know and love :D anyway, here's the breakdown:story: yes, it's a bit politically charged but i don't really care about that. the story is pretty derivative, like you probably already know, but i like how the basis of a parent taking a quest to save their son or daughter is renewed for the new millennium. as for the science behind the disaster, well, it's just a movie. it's just a movie.acting: the acting is decent, even though you don't see much of it because of the visuals. i would've hope to have seen sela ward act more instead of pushing her aside for the more father-son-centered plot. other than that, it has the kind of cheesy dialogue and delivery that you'd expect from a 70's disaster flick.direction: eh. it's roland emmerich. of course it's visuals over substance. but i've always liked his humor in times of peril. my one major complaint on the film is how the majority is centered around new york, ten minutes of los angeles, and 30-second clips of new delhi and japan. for a worldwide disaster, it doesn't show anywhere else like independence day did.visuals: read the second and third sentences above. the science might be far-fetched, but the visuals are amazing. the tornadoes in los angeles and the flooding, then freezing, of new york look absolutely stunning. there's nothing more to say. just look at emmerich's other movies.overall: it's a movie for those who like well-done special effects and not much else. but the 70's homage is a nice touch, intentional or not.(8 out of 10)</fullReview>

Now thirty years later we can all rest assured that Hollywood is still making silly and unbelievable disaster films. This story starts out with a respected Climatologist named Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) who along with his cohorts in the Antarctica discover that the climate of the earth is about to change and that another Ice Age is about to happen! No sooner than you can open an umbrella there are tornadoes ripping apart Los Angeles and Europe is covered with 15 feet of snow. Jack's teenage son Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) is in New York City with his friends from school when a gigantic tidal wave puts the whole city underwater. Then the cold front comes in and everything starts to freeze but Sam is told by his father to stay put in the library because he is coming to get him.*****SPOILER ALERT*****A small group stays in the library while the rest of the country freezes and Jack decides to drive and then walk to New York to find his son. While in the library they burn books to keep warm but they need to get medicine and food to stay alive and while all of this is going on there is a mass exodus to Mexico where it is warmer.This film is directed by Roland Emmerich who has directed other big budget blockbusters and unfortunately for him the pattern seems to be the same. He's quite adept at handling the scenes with special effects and action but when it comes to the characters he's at best clumsy. The effects are the star of the film and it's due to the fact that the characters are all badly written. Emmerich uses as many cliches as he can in this story such as Sela Ward staying back with the sick child in the hospital. You have to wonder why it took Gyllenhaal and his pals so long to finally go out and search for food and medicine and we also get scenes with characters arguing about which books should be burned and which ones to save. I didn't hate this film and it's mainly because of the attraction of watching Los Angeles get torn apart by tornadoes but lets face it, this is a very silly and badly written film. I'll go on record right now and say that "The Poseidon Adventure" is a much better film. Emmerich can handle action scenes as well as anyone in Hollywood but when it comes to dialogue for characters he should definitely let someone else write the script.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a happy to be B-movie that wraps you up in warm CGI blankets on the coldest day imaginable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rolland Emmerich must really have something for New York. I think it's great that he finds an inspiration in the city to have it be the setting for just about every disaster imaginable. Slimy aliens kicked Liberty's ass in "Independence Day," a ferocious lizard ate the big apple in "Godzilla" and now Mother Nature herself has turned a cold shoulder to one of America's most recognizable cities. Is Emmerich intentionally trying to remind us of 9/11, or does he hold a reserve that New Yorkers are really so tough they can take anything?Whatever the answer there's still no mercy in a movie like this. The trailers and TV spots alone let us know that walls of water will somehow come crashing through Manhattan and monster snow storms will bury Central Park in flash-freezes that haven't occurred since the last ice age. Dr. Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) is the paleoclimatologist tracking the Arctic ice shelf when he realizes something strange is happening to the planet's climate. He theorizes that life on earth is about to become radically different and spends the first half of the film trying to convince the White House that big things are in our forecast.Since the average audience aren't willing to wait the decades it would actually take to have an ice age occur on a scale like this we have to believe it can occur in a matter of days. While trying to smooth over a rocky marriage Quaid's character calculates that little time is left before the super storms begin to hit. He urges his college-bound son Sam (Jake Gyllenhal) to seek shelter in New York and wait for him.The special effects in this film are astounding and it's somewhat refreshing to have them not just look like good CGI, but to feel and sound like it too.As Quaid's character makes an unlikely jaunt from DC to New York with his arctic gear conveniently available his son makes preparations in the New York library with some other survivors. As is always the case there's not much else to the plot than survival tactics. Characters come into conflict with each other when they can't agree on the best course of action, not because their natures just don't compare. Maybe that would make it slightly more interesting or complicated, but I kept wanting a little more to ponder than just the spectacular effects.Disaster movies can bring a certain inspiration to them if done correctly, I think "Deep Impact" was the best recently. You can still have fun if they're just adrenaline fodder like "Armageddon". And sometimes they can be just plain ridiculous like "Twister". One thing they all require though is at least one thrilling sequence that makes us feel the crunch of time, the ferocity of the elements and the panic of the characters -- of which there's no real shortage in this film. It's a B movie that knows it's a B movie, and at least that makes us accept it and not feel like it wants to be anything else.</fullReview>

I realize the director is most likely looking for a little 'down' time to build the suspense, but can't they EVER dig up more original stuff? It was the same with Titanic and so MANY movies I've since seen on TV.Other than this, a really good movie. My eyes flipped wide open during the first minute and pretty much stayed that way - at least, when the real (disaster) storyline was taking place. This was just TOO lame, though: Wasn't there enough disaster going on already without the extremely unlikely scenario of 1)wolves getting loose from the zoo 2)somehow climbing aboard a Russian ship which was 3)iced-in on a New York City street - and menacing the show's heroes?If the temp was really supposed to be at around -100 degrees, no one - the wolves or anyone else - would have survived it around a lit stove or fireplace, which was soon the only source of heat.And at the end, you would have thought everything was A-OK, happy as the survivors were, despite much of the world being caught in a new Ice Age with so many of it's people destroyed!Unless moviemakers go back to real plots and dialogue, it will be a long time before I go to see or even rent another movie (the "Coming Soons" looked really lame) though, like I said, the special effects are well worth the price of admission.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me get started by saying that I like Godzilla, I consider it to be a pretty well done film of it's type. I expected a brainless but enjoyable action/monster flick and that was exactly what I got. Seeing that The Day After Tomorrow was by the same guy, I thought "must be good" as it seemed to have an interesting scenario and decent actors, Quaid and Gyllenhall. I'd heard that it got some bad reviews, and on here there were a fair amount of the same, but given that the feelings toward Godzilla were mixed I felt I could safely discount them.From the opening scenes in Antarctica I knew this was going to be good, I was glad I didn't wait for it to come out on DVD, and even if the science was fairly heavily stretched I wasn't expecting a documentary on climatology. The weather will never change from today's weather to an Ice Age over a week in a single storm, but if that were to happen it'd be pretty spectacular. Overall this is another slick, visually appealing film by Emmerich and anyone who likes this type of film should definately see it in the cinema if they haven't already.</fullReview>

I was, however, hoping that the movie would actually be a little more about the day after tomorrow rather then, well, tomorrow. That is that instead of seeing the northern hemisphere getting destroyed I was hoping for what happens afterwards. Furthermore, the movie was centered way too much on America. What is the deal with the two "even bigger" hurricane things over Europe and Asia. Last, but not least, the subject of this message. If the world was ever destroyed by a storm of the magnitude then there would be chernobyl-like nuclear explosions all over and the world would be a very, very, different place for at least a few million years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun....actions flicks aren't meant to be completely real</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie and I was sitting in the middle of the second row from the front in a mega theatre &amp; actually managed to enjoy this film. Sitting through the trailers I thought it was going to be a horrible experience, and that the movie didn't warrant sitting that close &amp; spending $13 bucks on a ticket.The movie though is actually not that cheesy &amp; I even think it was a pretty good action flick. Remember I managed to really enjoy the whole thing, sitting way up in the front, not even being able to take in the magnitude of all that was happening on the wide screen, because I was so darn close.People always go on &amp; on about the fact that movies of this nature are not believable, or that "that" could never happen. In my opinion all action films to some degree or another have part of their plots or scenes in the film blown way out of proportion to reality. The point of that being, the resulting action that ensues makes the film all the more exciting &amp; dramatic. If it's real, how fun can it be? If you really knew it could happen in real life, than why are you paying $13 bucks to see a movie that isn't going to make your jaw drop or keep you on the edge of your seat? All in all this movie did all of the above for me. Yes I heard myself a few times going "Oh! Come on, as if?!!" But by the time I walked out of the theatre I came away fully entertained. Yes I said fully entertained, despite some gaps in the plot and some extravagant scenes, I had fun. And I'm even considering going to see the movie again, where I can actually have a decent seat. The very front makes you dizzy during the opening montage. (although I may go to a cheap matinee, because there are still several more films that are yet to come out this summer!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Moose Hole - Review of The Day After Tomorrow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who would have thought that one of the summer's most anticipated films would become the political lightening rod the liberal activists have made it today? How did this happen? Whether 20th Century Fox or the filmmakers wanted it or not, radical activist groups such as the ever-delusional Moveon.org have openly embraced the film, even going so far as to hold a rally not far from the premiere of the film. Among the speakers that were expected to attend was environmental nut-job himself, Al Gore, who spoke in New York City about the subject of global-warming on the coldest day in over half-a-century. That alone should demonstrate the credibility of these people but they embraced the film none the less, all to no avail to be sure. With less then one-third of the country concerning themselves with the environment, few will find this film to be more then flashy special-effects and unrelenting, if not mindless, destruction.The story centers on the aftermath of global warming as one 'rogue' scientist battles both man-made and natural blockades in order to save his son who is trapped in a now ice-incased New York City. Professor Adrian Hall is one of the leading scientists in his field trying to raise awareness over the growing environmental problem the planet will eventually face in the not too distant future but few will listen. That is until numerous natural disasters begin to engulf the planet. Tornadoes rip through California, snowstorms pound Eastern Asia, and gigantic tidal waves slam into New York City, where his son is attending an academic-decathlon competition. While the rest of the United States heads further south in order to avoid continuing cataclysmic disasters, Adrian Hall is the only one marching north all in an effort to rescue his son and save any hope left for humanity. The story for The Day After Tomorrow is so ridiculously absurd and laughably clichéd that you may actually question the mentality of the radical liberals using this film as a launching pad to resurrect a dying, if not already dead, environmental proposal. To start things off, the film's entire concept, outside of the myth of global-warming being taken for serious fact, is decisively unrealistic. Granted that was the same situation with another Emmerich disaster-flick, Independence Day, but at least that film had a credible script and a group of heroing characters that the audience cared about; something The Day After seriously lacks. The problem lies in the fact that the film becomes tremendously bogged down by so many intertwining characters and their separate story lines that it becomes increasingly difficult for any audience to singularly attach themselves to a particular character within the film which, as a result, makes any actions on screen emotionally-meaningless.The supposed hero of the film is Professor Adrian Hall, played to the best of his abilities by Dennis Quaid. As great of a ruggish actor as Quaid can be, it doesn't fit well with this particular character that is suppose to be a rogue but isn't, in that Hall has to report to someone before any situation even if it concerns the life of his son. While on that subject, why does Hall go to New York after stating just minutes earlier that the best they could do for the people stranded in the area was pray? And supposing he did make it to New York then what did he plan on doing? All communications were out so how was he going to get them out of there? And is it asking too much to question Hall's skills as a scientist? All these freakish weather anomalies are occurring that apply to your theory and yet you let your son go to New York. Does that make sense? And why is it that he is able to have this shocking theory that many slowly begin to accept but only begins collecting data to back it up once the effects of global warming are in full swing? Samuel Hall, played by environmental wacko Jake Gyllenhaal, is a prime example of the typical emotionally depressed teenager always fervent in clichéd films. He mopes because his father isn't around all the time ? Boo-hoo! At least he has a father, it's not like his father is dead or his parents are divorced and he's never around. And the story about the 'F' he received for not showing work on his mathematics test and talking back to the teacher ? What bull-crap! Show your damn work even if you can do it in your head (to be sure, his teacher isn't the only one in mathematics within the country who enforces such a policy) and don't talk back. It's that simple! And if Sam is as upset with his father as he appears to be, why does he choose to believe his father's promise to get him in New York if he has failed him so many times in the past? Worse-case scenario or not, it doesn't make sense. Overall, Roland Emmerich and his band of disaster-flick cronies dispatch with all concepts of space and time, not to mention any at all scientific merit, in order to achieve their goal of promoting an overly-drawn out environmental agenda so clichéd that by the end of the film's nearly two hour run you'll be saddened to contemplate the thought of this being the last stand of the environmental wackos of the world. If these people so vividly believe the ideas that they promote, why would they ever soil their core beliefs by having them mixed together with over-the-top special effects and bad science that, in the end, contradicts any serious scientific merit they are trying to achieve? Time serves no purpose within the film, although humanity seems to be always short of it whenever the script calls for it to be. In what should take it thousands, if not millions, of years, the cataclysmic effects of global warming unfold before our eyes in a time frame of less then two weeks, though that is a rough estimate as no accurate time line of events is given. Granted things need to fit within a two hour film but even for the sake of global warming even that is a little ridiculous. On top of that, the liberal propaganda machine rolls out a weak excuse to lift current immigration policies via a turning of the tables scenario late within the film. In the future has Mexico gone loco when they are dealing with a global catastrophe and they are more concerned about getting even on immigration policies then saving lives? As was said earlier, The Day After suffers severely from predictable and overly clichéd situations that become more abundantly clear as the movie progresses. So much so that one wonders why not a single studio executive raised the red-flag before letting this get off the drawing-board. Without rambling out an entire list, which would be tediously long, let's say the best, if not the most unnoticed, example lied in the scene in which Sam Hall watches another guy come in and flirt with Laura, the girl he likes, while 'You don't want to hurt me ? You don't want to make me cry' plays softly in the background of the cafeteria. And lastly, it is absolutely disturbing to contemplate the filmmakers ever wanting to showcase the destruction of New York City after the destructive event that took place on September 11th, 2001, and yet it is prominent here. Haven't New Yorkers, let alone Americans in general, been through enough that they should witness this on screen? How many damn times does Emmerich have to destroy NYC before he gets his final kicks? Perhaps one day the FBI would like a conversation with Mr. Emmerich and his disaster team. On a more serious note, no amount of eye-popping special-effects can save this film from being anything more then environmental propaganda to warn of an event they themselves can not substantially prove.My Rating: * out of 5 (Grade: F+)</fullReview>

I disliked this film because the dialogue is like a cardboard version of "The West Wing" on a bad night. It insults many members of its *paying* audience without thought or remorse. This will not bode well for this movie in the total box office. (Most people don't appreciate being called idiots, the last time I checked.;&gt;) The plot is predictable, although the sequence of the events doesn't really pass the sensibility test. The only redeeming quality of this movie is its special effects and some of the action scenes.

		<fullReview>At first when I became aware of this movie, it seemed interesting. The special effects were eye catching, and the premise had not yet been tainted by bickering over if the depicted plot will really come to pass, or if it is just a variable of fiction. Usually the summer is a welcome time for disaster movies, even if they are lacking in substance. I thought Independence Day was the last movie of this nature which left me with the notion that I would actually rent it or see it again. However, when the dust of left wingers fighting right wingers clears in the comment column, what still remains is the fact that this move is plain awful. I find there to be more entertaining venues regarding people shouting back and forth at each other in regards to their point of view. Carry on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Disaster of a Disaster Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No amount of edible swag could save "The Day After Tomorrow," a $200 million disaster film that is quite the disaster, indeed. Hilariously awful in most places, with an incoherent script and questionable acting, "Day After" will come on Friday and the question will be: Can innumerable, mind-numbing special effects, nearly all of them created on a computer and placed in what can only be called a random order, overcome sheer inanity? It's not like I'm a snob, either. I count Emmerich's "Independence Day" - or "ID4" as it became known - as one of my favorite films. But "ID4" had a strong script with, well, developed characters. Bill Pullman and Will Smith, not to mention Mary McDonnell, Jeff Goldblum, Vivica A. Fox and Margaret Colin, made the otherwise preposterous story of aliens invading Earth seem plausible. They each had a tremendous nobility and spoke with wit and intelligence, and there was a feeling of a common threat and an equally shared goal. None of this, not one bit of it, is evident in "The Day After Tomorrow." This fish stinks from the head down, the head in this case being Emmerich's president (Perry King) and vice president (Kenneth Welsh).Unlike Pullman in "ID4," this president is a bumbling idiot, a puppet manipulated by his evil, self-motivated vice president. I guess this is supposed to be a clever reference, but it backfires instead, disarming the film and undermining it critically. You see, when America is imperiled in a disaster film, it's the president to whom we turn as the moral compass. The hero - in this case, a poorly conceived one played by Dennis Quaid - can have all the adventures, but he must report ultimately to a fair and wise leader. For example: If Batman walked in on Commissioner Gordon taking a bribe, all hope would be lost. That's what happens in "Day." Quaid's storyline doesn't help matters. His Jack Hall is a "climatologist" who knows that global warming may catalyze a new ice age. When tornados hit Hollywood and start ripping up other cities instantaneously, he still lets his moody high-school-age son (Jake Gyllenhaal) go to New York on a school outing. After the son leaves, and Quaid realizes that the world may be ending, he decides that in order to bond with the boy he will brave the calamitous floods, blizzards, hurricanes and tidal waves bearing down on the Northeast corridor and walk - yes, walk, if he must - from Washington, D.C. to Manhattan just to show the boy he cares, he really, really cares.His trek replaces Diane Keaton's walk through the snowy Russian woods in "Reds" as the most ill-conceived hike in movie history.For some reasons that are unexplained, Quaid takes with him on this quest two buddies who you know will not make it. This is supposed to be noble just because it's noble. Do these men have families of their own? Do they owe Quaid's character some debt? The answer to each of these questions is: We never know.Is Jack's son either perilously young or terminally ill? No, and no. He is fully grown and able to take care of himself, or at least wait until the catastrophe passes to be reunited with dear old dad. The rest of "Day After" is simply a rehash of past triumphs. The special effects are clearly from the Emmerich school: lots of stopped traffic, yellow cabs' horns honking furiously, crowds running in all directions from the oncoming horror of meteor-sized hail. You've seen it before in "ID4" and "Godzilla." Whole cities are demolished and flood waters rise to the tops of buildings while the main characters fret that "things are getting really bad out there." You'd think when the sea level rises to the chin of the Statue of Liberty people would be smart enough to evacuate themselves, if they are not already dead. But there's no logic at work here. There's also a peculiar insensitivity, I think, to those of us who lived through September 11. In "Day After," downtown New York, in an aerial view, is flooded with water and then snow. The whole thing resembles the billowing smoke that poured between the canyons of buildings on that horrible day from real life. Later, survivors are seen waving from rooftops of buildings, a grisly reminder of the tragic souls who made that mistake at the World Trade Center hoping for safety. New Yorkers do not need to see our city in this condition, whether or not it's fantasy. I'd rather fly on the wings of soaring birds with Harry Potter than relive those grim images as entertainment. The premiere last night, by the way, was preceded by a "red carpet" of fake snow which Fox sprinkled on the steps of the Museum of Natural History. The guests included Quaid, Gyllenhaal (along with his famous sister Maggie and their parents, plus the younger Gyllenhaals' respective beaux: Kirsten Dunst and Peter Sarsgaard), the lovely Sela Ward (she plays Quaid's wife, the Mary McDonnell role), Michele Lee (who came with "Good Morning America" film critic Joel Siegel), plus Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, and Julianne Moore and Bart Freundlich. I was told by an off-duty member of the NYPD that there were three security teams employed by Fox in addition to the police. "And it's not like there are any really big stars here," observed the very nice cop, who wore a 9/11 pin on his lapel. Then he changed his mind. "Don't let Dennis Quaid hear me saying that."-- Roger Friedman, FoxNews</fullReview>

This could be the worst movie ever made. In a movie such as this there has to be a shred of believability or an acting performance so good that it can overshadow the lack of reality. But it doesn't.

		<fullReview>I watched this movie about a year ago and I didn't fully grasp the concept of it. Then I watched it a couple of nights ago and got wrapped up in the global warming and the ice age. All because I am taking a college course and Science 207 was one of the courses on global warming and our ecosystem. This is a must see movie and very educational. I just ordered this movie online as I want to watch it over and over again as I absorb everything that is happening. I rate this movie a 10 because I feel that it should be in all college and school libraries for students. I feel by watching this movie that it made me understand what was going on in my text at college, since I do my courses online. Great job! Hope you make more movies leaning toward educational purposes, as that was great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disaster film about the terrible impacts of global warming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A new ice age is coming..The movie "The day after Tomorrow"directed by Roland Emmerich which was published in 2004, deals with natural disaster caused by the global warming. In the action movie, tries the climatologist Jack Hall to figure out a way to save the world from abrupt global warming. He must get to his young son in New York, which is being taken over by a new ice age.Although the beginning is really calm and the main part is full of tension and it develops into a fast action movie, moreover the effects are remarkable, because they seem to be real, but in some scenes the effect is exaggerated, for example, when the helicopters crashed, because they are frozen. The monster wave in New York was impressive, furthermore the camera shows the special effects very good. The music is by Harald Kloser, an Austrian film composer and fits very well to this movie, because is a dramatic music.The message from the film is that we disrespectful to deal with the world, besides the American people find help in Mexico, but who built a 1.000 kilometer long border fence? This implies that we need more tolerance between different countries.To sum up I would recommend the film to action fans, who likes the films "2012" or "The final storm". The film has many special effects, great action scenes and a very good story, therefore I like the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Day After RiffTrax</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Probably this is a good film for kids and gamers but it's a tedious cliché-ridden maelstrom for older film-watchers like me with any serious message frozen or drowned. I wish I could have seen it at 11 ? at 49 I think I've seen it all before except for the eye-boggling cgi cartoonery they use for cheapness nowadays.Global capitalism's efforts to get global warming going finally causes Earth to catch a cold ushering in a new Ice Age, and giving poor old New York some more cataclysmic breakdowns to recover from. Liberty Don't Surf! Dennis Quaid (paleo-climatologist) has to rescue son Jake Gyllenhaal (schmuck) and friends from freezer. It's all pretty harmless laughable stuff anyway, but the RiffTrax soundtrack version is absolutely hilarious, a relentless pisstake I recommend watching instead of the original tosh. The scenes in the public library stumbling over all that burnable furniture to burn books and keep warm are amongst the best I've seen, along with the indestructible digi-wolves on the huge ghost ship that managed to get into the centre of the city without turning. And Gyllenhaal's watery phone call to his Dad is turned into a real tearjerker! The cartoonery is impressive, and generally a lot of money was spent to make it look good, pity the plot was plastic and the acting was wooden. At the end the Free World was given time to recover from the safety of the 51st state of the USA, Mexico.I can't imagine ever watching the proper version because it's so so-so (maybe a 6/10), but with RiffTrax you can laugh in Armageddon's face and chuckle at catastrophe if you like.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't comment on the ending of this film because I was forced to switch off after about an hour or so of over-the-top CGI and overwrought plotting."The Day After Tomorrow" was trumpeted as Hollywood's first Carbon Neutral movie. Unfortunately, it's also Talent Neutral. Roland Emmerich has some good films in his bio, but this is not one of them. The film's grand scale is what lets it down, reducing the possible effects of a global super-storm to popcorn movie levels. The big set-piece destruction scenes of LA and New York are obviously rendered by guys sat in front of PCs in air-conditioned offices. They are therefore even less realistic than the destruction of a plaster and balsa wood Tokyo by a guy in a rubber lizard suit.Oh yes, "TDAT" harks back to another Emmerich clunker, "Godzilla". Despite the director's ability to elicit good performances from his human actors, Emmerich has yet to learn that less is more when it comes to special effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What an awful film - a walk in a blizzard would be more fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this yesterday because my daughter insisted on us turning it on; the film failed miserably to reach my very low expectations.A diabolic mix of bad science, weak plotting, worse dialogue and ethno-centrism. Some people have praised the special effects but I found them tedious and uninspiring and about as scary as a sleepy kitten. There was a montage of a snowbound New York that would not have looked out of place in the cardboard sets of a worse than average 1950s sci-fi film.The science started poor and got worse, the north Atlantic currents were shown going anti-clockwise instead of clockwise, hurricanes which get their energy from warm water somehow started over ice-cold land and so on. When Sam climbs his way round a ship in far sub-zero temperatures he puts his bare hand onto metal without his skin being ripped off, nice trick if you can manage it, and everyone gets soaked in freezing water without any fear of hypothermia...Plotting, Jack sets off to walk to New York, will he get there? Well, I won't ruin the suspense for anyone not able to work out the answer.Ethno-centrism: after cursory chaos in India and Japan we concentrate on the US with short asides to Scotland, suddenly on the same latitude as northern Canada and Siberia, where the surprising reaction to disaster is to pour three stiff glasses of 12 year old scotch.When half the population of the US migrates to Mexico we see the heroic feeding of the refugees, but what happened to the Mexicans in the freezing cold? As far as the dialogue goes - not very far I must say - I have managed not to remember any of the lines that made me groan out loud. I've just looked at the 'memorable quotes' and I can't bear to type any of them out. If those are the high spots, imagine the rest.There are good films to be made on global warming that are more thrilling than Al Gore's, what a pity they wasted money on this instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading several comments about the movie I decided to comment.First and foremost. This is a Sci-Fi movie. Everything about the movie was Sci-Fi. We don't know what would really happen if the events in the movie really took place. I mean seriously some of you people need to get a grip. Yes, it's obvious that some of the things in the movie are impossible, but as with most disaster movies they do those things for screen value. If you went to see this movie thinking that it was gonna be a factual movie or are a science nerd and expected it to be right on for everything you really should take a reality check. This movie did just what I expected it to do. Entertain. I think everyone should see this movie, if nothing else than because it follows greatly in the disaster film genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Day after tomorrow ... a real turkey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is without a doubt one of the the worst movies I have ever seen. Judging from other review sites such an opinion seems to be widespread .... which is refreshing since popularity usually equals mediocrity, at least in this century. The partial basis for this garbage ( not to mention a really bad, "bad weather" book by UFOlogist Art Bell and one of his buddies ) is some "flash frozen" mammoth discovered in Siberia and now resident at the Smithsonian. Well kiddies the internal organs of that unfortunate animal showed evidence of the normal damage associated with mortality, ie. it's guts were rotten. Other scientific faux pas included a violation of the Ideal Gas law ... again no instant frozen mammoths, helicopters, flags or people are possible. Of course bad science does not always mean completely bad acting ( even the Klingons have their good moments ) but D.A.T. comes up cold and empty on this score. The acting reminds me of Canadian soap opera from the 1960s AND THAT STORY!! ... billions of people die while this Paterfamilia walks from Pennsylvania to New York in a couple of days without the slightest idea what he is going to do when he gets there??? Superstorm equals Superturkey.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>End of the World?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nah, it's not all that bad, but pretty close. This movie could be called "Independence Day 2: Attack of the Bad Weather!" as it has about the same amount of intelligence as the famous Aliens-Attack-tripe. As always when it comes to this kind of movies, special effects goes first, and script, acting, mood, everything else, comes second. And even the effects are bad.Movie kicks off by piling cliché after cliché, and we already know how the movie is going to end. Wait, we've still got about five hours of drivel to watch, haven't we? Oh, well...Then disaster kicks in. Literally for both the main characters and for everyone watching the piece of manure on the screen. Suddenly Earth (America) is under attack by CGI weather effects, and people (ugly people) starts dying. The beautiful people, and a dog, survive. Alright, and this is supposed to be based on science? Right.Now comes the heroic tale of one man (and his expendable side-kicks) and his journey to save his estranged son who is saving his friends in a New York library by burning a lot of books. We get to follow the main character's arduous walk from Philadelphia (?) to New York, a walk that seem to take a little under two days, and that in a terrible blizzard.I've got to stop here... this is too hard. Here we are, faced with a very real problem, something that may very well change our planet, eradicating many forms of life, and this is the way to make people aware of it? In the DVD-box I even found a flyer informing me about the effects of global warming, telling me that many of the events in the film may come true. What? Are people really so stupid or thick-headed that we have to force feed them disinformation to make them start thinking about a problem? This is like those people saying that one cigarette will kill you, or that if you exercise and don't eat a lot, people will like you. It's not only bad cinema, it's dangerous cinema. Sure, obviously Americans need to be educated a bit to be able to take the environmental problems of this planet seriously, but this is not the way to do it.Shame on you Emmerich! Shame on you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Below Average Disaster Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some interesting scenes, but mostly this apocalyptic mess fails as an entertaining movie.Seventies disaster movies meet global warming. As you can expect, this is a movie where contrived rescue missions and horrible acting meet relentless demographic scanning.Almost all the Black characters in here are geeks, Emmy Rossum ("Mystic River") continually has this crazy eyed expression, Jake Gyllenhaal's "cute" acting is getting boring really quickly and is strictly aimed at teen-aged girls, and the Dennis Quaid/Harrison Ford role is a little too "heroic" and unthinking at the same time.To top it all off, two regulars from the "24" TV series are in there, AND the lead character is called "Jack".The plot devices come on heavy and strong. You cringe, every time someone suggests "let's take the plane" or "let's take the train". Of course Jack's son is in Manhattan. Of course Jack will try and walk there, even though we have just seen seasoned RAF pilots turn into popsicles in the blink of an eye. You cringe when Emmy Rossum risks her life to retrieve a passport, even though a 100 foot wall of water is raging toward her. She survives by walking up a flight of stairs, of course, otherwise the love interest would have disappeared from the story. And what would a movie about the next ice age be without a love interest.Like so many movies, this one started off as a good idea, and the movie was sort of organized around that idea. As a result, no one managed to stop and think about a plot.Recommended only if you are a hardcore disaster movie fan and want to be able to say "I have seen them all".</fullReview>

Typical "special effects" is all we need to sell the story movie making from the same genius behind Independence DAY and GODZILLA. This guy runs hot and cold-- hey! A pun!THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW even has a typical "we Americans suck!" ending so prevalent with the Hollywood elite, without taking into account that the cheap Japanese monster movies of the 60's and 70's offered the same hokey "man as bad guy" scenarios! Anyone remember GODZILLA VS. THE SMOG MONSTER? Laughable performances, especially the scene where a French woman and child are trapped in a cab, trying to get out, and the dumbest cop in the world sees them beating on the window glass and he says "What do you want? I don't understand French!" Pass on this junk-- but hey-- it may be too late-- it's made a fortune from the global warming crowd-- it's just good to know that when the world freezes over (not a spoiler, since it shows it on the box art, right?) those clowns will freeze with the rest of us morons too stupid to heed their warnings.</fullReview>

In either way, it was a lame attempt by the prodcuers to bolster support for the current administration.The funniest part of this movie was the fact that 20th Century Fox shows "Fox News", the most right-wing media company in the U.S.A., reporting on global warming and then sending out a left-wing message that people should be careful with respect to the environment to avoid such a catastrophe. This contradiction is indicative of one of the silliest and most contrived disaster movies ever made.

He's spent the sfx budget in the first half hour. After the usual explosions, we get to experience 2 hours of typically tedious 'Emmerichian' dialog, lots of polystyrene snow, and the inside of a library before the words 'The End' crawl on to the screen, in front of a comatose audience.

		<fullReview>This movie has to be the worst piece of utterly ridiculous and predictable nonsense that I have ever seen. Its so bad that it actually has comic appeal. The real disaster here is that Hollywood actually spent $125 million on this monstrosity and wasted the talent of actors such as Denis Quaid and Jake Gyllenhaal. I wonder how they were able to keep a straight face while reciting the idiotic lines for this junk. I am personally insulted that Hollywood apparently believes that us "little people" are so naive that we could actually fall for this propaganda. And just where do they get the idea that a new ice age could be brought about by global warming as a result of us using up our natural resources and creating too much pollution? While I am environmentally conscious myself, we cannot ignore that the last ice age occurred thousands of years ago, well before there were cars or anything else polluting the environment. Put this movie on the shelf with Plan 9 From Outer Space and the rest of the Golden Turkeys.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this review may contain a small spoiler or 2.OK, call me a nut, but i think scenario's like this are very interesting and frighting in a way, because it could really happen! Maybe not in one day (or 2), but in years. Maybe! OK, back to the movie. What i saw of it in the trailers and so on, i though this to be a really good, realistic movie. And i went to the cinema with a feeling: OK, this is gonna be great movie. Will have me on the edge of my seat.The first half, the storm, Special effects and all are really Awsume. Some what a little over the top, but (for the majority) acceptable. Roland has done this funny, but over the top thing before (8 legged freaks, ID4). ID4, one of my favorite movies of all time. But with TDaT Roland really misted out! big time. I really can't believe that a reporter would let himself be killed just for good rating. It's dangerous and except in wartime people are evacuated for there own safety. Now these tornado's came without warning, but these reporters would NOT have been allowed so close by.The story... what story?? There is no story, i could not and i mean i could NOT relate with any of the characters. They just move around on screen, do amazingly stupid, crazy and unnecessary things (like getting themselves killed or almost killed just for the fun of it). Burning books??? Hmm... maybe they should have started with the wood (stair, table, etc.) first. I mean how dumb are they? Just to make a joke about Taxes (whaah well it had me laughing for sure NOT!). Just to save *a* bible?? The woman who is staying being with a child. Why??? Why can't he be evacuated like everybody else. Why is there an ambulance coming, when they where all gone. Why are they still alive, while it was and still is freezing? Why was this in the movie? Sentiment? Boring!!!!!It didn't work, neither did Quaids character (Jack). Quaid did his best, i'm sure but all of the characters where made out of cardboard, no depth, no background, no story, nothing. There was nothing in it, nothing what maybe me feel sorry for Jack (almost)loosing his son, or his best friend. (who kills himself to *save* them) Things like that may and can work, but this just made me laugh. I don't know the guy, so i didn't give a damn about his *heroic* act (unlike ID4's Russel). Of course they just get to New York in time, on their way they come across a small storm, find a lot of dead (the stupid) people. New York is sooooo big, really huge, but of course Jack finds his son (and luckily just in time!). No one was sure to survive, but of course Jack, Sam and his new girlfriend do. Jack was an idiot, sure to die if he would go to New York. He would NOT make it (he himself! advised everyone to stay inside). But sure enough, at the end hundreds of people gather on rooftops, who survive this cold (they all knew, what Sam knew. (and he only knew it thanks to his well educated father) Weird huh!) At least now i know that they all have fireplaces, books or wood in those big New York skyscrapers to keep warm.I can accept that it's about America only, there is about 5 minutes about Japan or so. But i can accept that. There is no way this can be done showing the effect world wide, it would be to confusing and you can't focus on characters (not that they successfully did it in this version, but OK). I can all accept that, but what is this thing about Mexico?? What happens to Canada?? Bad bad bad!!! This movie disappointed me. Really, it did. It's not good, it's not realistic, the story Roland chose is way off!! My advice, rent this movie on a Sunday when you have absolutely nothing else to do, watch the first hour and then switch it off. Or ask someone to rent it for you and watch it when you are sick and laying in bed all day. Any other day, or any other time is a big waste of your time.</fullReview>

Everything else was another drama to show what could happen if there was a climate shift and half of the world suddenly froze. Many of reviewers claim this movie is unrealistic. Of course it is unrealistic... its made to entertain us just like other "disaster" films (e.g. Armaggedon). I can't say that I didn't like the movie at all. If I could rate it, I'd give it 6/10. I think we need to look at disaster films as a different genre, they are not designed to tell a true story or give you in depth character development. Instead, they rely on lots of Special effects and lots of unbelievable scenarious. If you accept this fact, then you will enjoy some of them.</fullReview>

Once again it is Americans fault for being prosperous the world over. And Mr. Emmerich makes sure we pay this time. Notice the subtle hints in the movie. The U.S.A and Great Britain, our closest ally, are the only two nations we see destroyed. It is supposed to be assumed that other countries are suffering as well, but capitalists must pay. The little speech at the end where the "President" states that the third world countries that we have oppressed now become our savior. The electric cars the "good guys" drive and the evilness of using fossil fuels. This type of ideology, mass marketed to the dimwitted and uninformed, is what drives liberalism into our homes. WE ARE EVIL! That is what the left believes. It is our fault we were attacked on September the 11th 3 years ago. It is our fault that there are people trying to kill us just for being free. And now, apparently, we are going to cause the mass destruction of the earth because we drive a 17MPG SUV.

Since when would throwing books on a fire hold off a temperature drop of 10 degrees per second? Why after 100's of millions of people dead (I suppose since it was stated that Europe and Asia got it much worse than North America) would anyone mobilize a rescue effort to save a handful of people? Aren't there bigger issues like how are you going to feed and shelter the millions of displaced people? Not to mention the laughable idea that getting the penicilan for the girl was a magic drug that will fix all. Anyway this movie is crap. There are many more examples of trash in this movie I could list but I am writing a review not a book (there is enough junk to write a book),the timeline is poorly laid out, the effects are good but not enough of them and the story is insulting and poorly written.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this film expecting not to like it because of some negative comments I'd read about it and was surprisingly engaged by it - as were the two people with me.The effects, of course, are absolutely magnificent, especially the flooding of New York, the twisters, and the coming of the great cold, and the performances by Dennis Quade and Jake W were OK.I realize that the events depicted could not take place within such a short period of time, but they could nonetheless occur over a longer period. If nothing else, the film might make a few people aware of what humans are doing to the planet, so that is a good thing.The only things I really didn't like were the inclusion of the obligatory Hollywood love interest (the girl with the son), and the completely unnecessary addition of the Quade character's wife.Nonethless, 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let's get real!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>These are mere scare tactics to get people to follow the false premises of the environmentalists. It is scientifically impossible for man to cause such events to happen, and I speak with a MA based in Geology, Meteorology, Climatology, and Earth Science. Now if you really want to see something scary, view all the footage of Mt St. Helens explosion, or any other Volcano that has erupted. Or if you want to experience a real natural experience, put yourself in the middle of a tornado or a level 5 earthquake, or an erupting volcano; now there you will have some real sound and visual effects. To view a film as "Day after Tomorrow" you would hope there was some plausibility of it really happening. If I bet a trillion dollars to the first person to cause one of these events, guess who would win the bet?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once the tsunami swallows NYC, a bad script swallows the movie. What a waste of a great premise and great EFX team! Why did they burn books and not furniture?? Wood burns longer and hotter than paper! How did the wolves survive the tidal wave? Why did the wolves pass up the 500,000 dead people in NYC to come find Jake and friends? What happened to JD's little brother? Father? Why open plots and leave them dangling? Could the characters have been anymore one dimensional? The President with a cowboy hat looking befuddled and being told what to do by the grandfatherly Veep? People in my theater actually laughed at some of the supposedly dramatic moments.I loved Independence Day, even with it's political overtones that it didn't need, this was even worse and more preachy.

		<shortDescription>Well, I'm still here after "The Day After Tomorrow"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I'm going to make this short and simple: I'm not an environmentalist, don't know any, nor do I care to get swept up in their crusade to save our planet. BUT, I do respect what they try to do (not to mention the lengths), and that is in that they try to change the course of the grim direction that our world is headed, especially in today's times. I try to not get caught up in politics, but "The Day After Tomorrow" has already stirred up so much heated debate in the weeks before its release, I might as well speak out on some of them. I didn't go to this film to judge it on its "science"; that would basically defeat the purpose of going to the theater and watching it. What I will say, even though I'm no climatologist, is that it isn't the science that's important, it's the effect.Believe it or not, many will flock to this film just to see Lady Liberty (not to mention most of New York) get trashed by a massive tidal wave, but will be surprised by the human element of the film. Though much of the first half of the film is dedicated to special effects, the second half is made up mostly of characters; that's an achievement in film-making. A special effects bonanza that actually takes time to let us get to know and feel for the characters. I'm not saying that the performances were bad, but they were all in fact, pretty convincing.Roland Emmerich, the director of "The Day After Tomorrow," has a long resume of special effects blockbusters listed as his achievements. This is the same man that brought us "Independence Day" and "Godzilla" and who can now add this movie to his list as his next great film. Much of the debate surrounding "The Day After Tomorrow" has been centered on him, and that is wrong. He set out to make a movie about global warming and the onset of another ice age, not to convert the audience into environmentalists.Now here I come. I had originally wanted to see this film just to try to make sense of the controversy, and I did, more or less. People will judge this movie, not just for its credibility, but because of who and what it's supposedly aimed at: our government, which is said by some to be quite lax on the environment, especially under President George W. Bush. Indeed, I believe he hasn't done much for the environment, but I'm not here to rip him to shreds.I've read a number of articles judging this film's science and whilst they all say it's hogwash, the scenario that it depicts is not that far from the truth, and it's for that reason I gave "The Day After Tomorrow" a "10." I'm more likely to believe men and women who have written books on the possibility of a new ice age than the people who say that this movie is total bull****, and most likely haven't seen it yet. Whether or not people will use "The Day After Tomorrow" as a model for environmental change and awareness, I say let them use it; it probably won't do them that much good anyway. If people want to bash it because they say, "That's not going to happen," let them say it. But for those, like me, who went to this movie with an open mind about its message, don't ruin it for us; since we're most likely in the minority, we could laugh at those who use this movie as some kind of tool or gimmick for their causes.P.S.: This film's final closing shots of New York City with a frozen Statue of Liberty, and a half-frozen North America are both sure to start debate on those startling images alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, this movie was better than I was expecting. A nice disaster film with some rather good story and great special effects. Sure it is a bit unrealistic, the type of disasters shown here could not take place in our life time without massive volcanic eruptions, but hey it is a movie so it is best to watch and enjoy and not worry about the scientific facts. The cast is rather good as Dennis Quaid turns in one of his better performances. I just wish Ian Holm had a bigger part in this one. As for the effects, as I said before they were great. I also enjoyed the story although there was one unresolved plot point involving the one guy's brother in Philly. The first half of the film shows the beginnings of the super storm and the second half is more of a rescue mission over the frozen areas of the United States. The movie could have shown the effects of the storm on a few more countries as it tended to only show the United States and of course as in any disaster flick there tends to be a rather pointless subplot that never really goes anywhere...here it was a boy with cancer. All in all though I enjoyed it more than I was expecting, I was just wanting to go to the movies and it was either this or Shrek 2.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why does Hollywood still not understand Science 101?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was a huge disappointment. It was supposed to be about the effects of global warming. Instead, the movie trivialized the whole thing. First off, if it was to get to 150 below zero, where was NASA? Do you know how cold that would be? That would be a cold temperature on Mars. If there were only 8 days left before the deep freeze why assign a minor scientist to solve the problem? NASA would have been madly trying to develop space suits. You would need a space suit just to survive those temperatures. Instead, we have people running around with their faces exposed. The biggest joke was believing that if you shut the door on the New York Public Library that you would be protected from the cold. You would need triple-paned glass, and space suits just to survive 150 below zero. All the creators had to do was say 70 below zero. That would have been realistic for survivability, although still Fairbanks, Alaska cold. Then, the freeze happens all of a sudden. People are running outside, and then all of a sudden the cold comes. How silly. In addition, for no reason it warms up to about 20 degrees Fahrenheit. Yippee!! Not! If that were not ridiculous enough, when the tidal wave is heading towards downtown Manhattan, people are walking around slowly to get each other together. Hello. The water would be coming at about 500 miles per hour. And why the New York Public Library? There were plenty of bigger, more secure buildings. You might have survived better if you cordoned yourself into a stairwell in one of the skyscrapers. And why all of a sudden do all these people decide to leave and walk south for food? In rural New Jersey, you would find far less then if you stormed into all the big buildings in New York City. There would have been cafeterias and fridges all over the place. Why would they leave New York City? What happened to the ship? Why was it abandoned? I also thought that wolves don't attack humans. About the only good thing about this movie was the special effects. Although, there was a huge period for about an hour where people were boringly sitting around a fire in the library talking about nothing</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good storytelling. However, I wouldn't call it a good movie. I also wouldn't call The Day After Tomorrow a bad movie. It falls somewhere in the middle. It's classic Enviro-Nazi propaganda. Yes, Earth's climate is fragile. So is the economy. Everything's interconnected. If you make claims about the environment, you have to back them up scientifically. It's like the boy who cried wolf. When the wolf does come and eats the sheep, nobody will listen. We need more information. We don't have it. But you have to consider the source here, and that's scientists, looking for government grants, who brought us just the opposite back in the '70s. What's the opposite of global warming? Global cooling of course. When I was in junior high and high school back in the '70s, you couldn't turn on the news, radio or television, without hearing about global cooling, and how we were heading for the next ice age. The events in the movie are too preposterous to be real. It was done for dramatic effect.. The redeeming feature of the movie was the special effects.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've just seen The Day After Tomorrow for the first time and found it brilliant.The world is suddenly hit by adverse weather conditions due to global warming. Tornadoes hit Los Angles, New York gets heavy rain, a tidal wave causing flooding and then turns to snow and freezes, Britain and Northern Europe also get very heavy snow and huge hailstones hit other places. Once the storms pass over, a new Ice Age will begin. A professor, Jack Hall heads for New York to find his son, Sam who is there as part of his schooling. He and a small group of others including a dropout and his dog are in New York Library where they have built a fire to avoid freezing to death. He falls in love through all this too. His dad appears at the end and they are rescued.The special effects in The Day After Tomorrow are fantastic.The cast includes Dennis Quaid as Jack Hall, Jake Gyllenhaal as his son Sam, Sela Ward as his wife, Ian Holm and Emmy Rossum as Sam's love interest. Excellent parts from all.If you haven't seen The Day After Tomorrow yet, you are missing a treat. Fantastic.Rating: 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I won't go into details, but this film is plain and simply one of the worst films of all time - from Dennis Quaid's 'I-just-blagged-$20,000,000' grin right up to the terrible CGI effects of the Empire State Building's windows shattering, I personally do not give a damn if I spoil this for anybody. Frankly, everybody who has seen a disaster film knows that all the main characters survive, the animals survive, the dying kid survives, and the president is involved in a major plot-hole at least twice in the film. You know what needs to happen? A film where nearly everybody dies, starting with the child actors, and then the few survivors left eat the surviving animals. In a nuclear holocaust, for example, you would not expect anybody to survive, you wouldn't expect some two-bit president actually taking the time to sit down in front of a camera broadcasting to a nation that isn't watching. These films are the lowest of the low, as far as I'm concerned. 'Independence Day', 'Armageddon', 'Deep Impact', 'The Core'... they're all based around the same principle - decadent western civilisation saves the world, yet can you truly see this actually happening when it can't even negotiate peace in some middle-eastern country that western civilisation is currently helping to tear apart? Every single performance in this film will be forgotten - Jake 'Bubble Boy' Gydiantitisflap or whatever his name is, Dennis Quaid, and a bunch of other people, with one of the worst directors in cinematic history at the helm, 70% of the budget spent on building miniatures and CGI... what else can you expect other than rubbish? This film is directed at the same people who Jerry Bruckheimer makes his movies for, the MTV audience, people whose attention spans are less than that of a goldfish, why? Because these 'people' are bound to find this manure absolutely riveting, despite the fact that they probably never stop to question the logic of such a film. These 'people' would never stop to ask, 'how can humans use up all of the earth's natural resources?', these are the same people who actually believed that 'The Patriot' starring one Mel Gibson was based on a true story and was completely and historically accurate.I can't even believe I'm actually here on this website discussing this film, why do I need to type up a review that might not even be submitted to the website? I don't know, maybe it's because I'm annoyed at the fact I wasted two hours and thirty minutes of my life on this rubbish and I can't have it back, and maybe, just maybe, I can persuade people who haven't seen this film NOT to see it thus saving two hours and thirty minutes of their lives.0 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The end of the world + Wolves = I love it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS***Can you make a movie chronicling the destruction of almost all of modern civilization, and still give it a satisfyingly feel-good ending where everyone lives happily ever after? Quite frankly, no, you cannot. But don't try to explain that to Roland Emmerich! The Day After Tomorrow follows the adventures of the creatively named Jack Hall. (Never would have thought of that one! Next time, just call him "Joe Everyman"). Jack is a roguish and undisciplined climatologist (how often do you come across one of those?), who discovers that the world is well on its way to death by global warming, and the following world freeze caused by an alteration in the ocean's currents. His cries are silenced, however, by an eye-rollingly familiar, half-witted President, whose decisions are made by sinister old Vice President Becker. At the sight of this Dick Cheney look-alike, I was tempted to switch off the DVD and tune into the TV show Becker. At least Ted Danson used to be entertaining. Sort of.Poop hits the fan sooner than even our lone hero expected, sending a super awesome and cool tidal wave crashing through New York City. The wave leaves Jack's son Sam trapped in a public library with his brainy friend, his button-cute crush, and a preppy, rich snob, who is his rival for the lady's attention. It's the plight of every teen aged boy? with an apocalyptic twist!Our heroically heroic hero of heroes decides to do the only insanely brave thing, and sets out to find his son and the young man's peers. Because, once he reaches them, they'll automatically be safe and everything will go back to normal. I guess. "Don't worry, son! Daddy will save you from the ice age!"In addition to millions of other Americans, the life of our dear President is lost in the turmoil. Now you've done it, Dick Che? er, "Vice President Becker". When will you learn to listen to scruffy hippies about world policy, and that your daughter's sexuality is not a choice, but the way that she was born? While Jack and some of his friends journey onward, Sam's lovely crush comes down with a nasty bout of blood poisoning. In order to save her life (and score some major brownie points), Sam decides to follow in dad's footsteps and play hero, and, in search of penicillin, boards an abandoned ship that had been floating around outside the building before the big freeze. He and his friends board the ship, only to realize that, not only is it balls-cold, but there is a terrible horror lurking about the ship? CGI killer wolves, escaped from their zoo and gone weather kah-RAZY! I'd love to have been present at the brainstorming session where Roland &amp; Company thought that one up. "Well, guys, we've got a major action adventure with an important message and insane special effects on our hands, but I can't help but feel like we're missing something. Wait, I've got it! WOLVES, baby!"The rich snob (turned lovable friend) meets his tragic demise aboard the ship. I forget how (can you blame me?). But now there are bigger things to worry about? Sam and his brainy friend (who has been injured and can't walk) must make it back to the library before a creeping super-frost reaches them! Sorry, Roland, but anyone who has ever seen The Mummy Returns will tell you that scenes involving any character trying to outrun nature are hoaky and sigh-worthy.As the American people fight for survival, news is released that, the farther south you go, the less you will be affected by the killer weather. This news causes a great overflow of illegal immigrants into (dun dun duuuunn?) Mexico! It's a role reversal, get it? After many generations of Americans have looked upon illegal immigrants with scorn, WE are now the intruders! So, you see, we should be understanding and supportive of illegal immigrants, because they may be native to a country that is our one and only hope of survival, should we ever be caught in the middle of an instant Ice Age (just add greenhouse gases!).In order to gain clearance for all of our destitute citizens, the United States is forced to cut a deal to clear all of Mexico's debts with our fair land. Now THAT'S compassion! In the end, everything just clears up to normal. Sam's lass is cured, our virile and endearing hero reaches the kids in time, and the Ice Age clears up after scarcely a week (the rest of America is fast-paced, so why shouldn't the same apply to our natural disasters?).What's more, our churlish, environment-abusing President Becker softens up and offers and apology to the people of the United States. Never mind that millions of lives and trillions of dollars worth of civilization have been lost forever? he's sorry! Isn't that cute? And, of course, he offers gratitude and apologies towards the Mexican government. For you see, after years of referring to Mexico as a third-world country, the Mexican government took us in out of the kindness of their hearts. Never mind that we had to clear all debts with the country in order to make it happen, or that I've never once heard Mexico referred to as a third-world country in all my life. It was just so sweet of them to do us a favor! Now, as much as I've joked my way through this review, I must admit that I was not quite so easy while viewing this movie. In all its implacable stupidity, it's almost unbearable to watch, and may very well cause you to lose even more faith in summer blockbusters. Avoid it, unless you are simply starved for new special effects. Even then, you may want to do some careful scene selection and press the mute button.2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie message in 'The Day After Tomorrow' is mostly hot air</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>June 7, 2004Unable to develop a coherent political ideology to oppose President George W. Bush, the anti-Bush cabal has turned to humor and Hollywood. The CBS Evening News borrows jokes from late-night comedy shows to jab at Bush every Friday evening, and we have just been treated to big fanfare about a new anti-Bush movie.The thesis of "The Day After Tomorrow" is that the Bush administration has failed to protect us from global warming. According to this theory, global warming caused by carbon dioxide emissions will melt the ice at the North Pole, which will then warm the Atlantic current, making Northern Hemisphere temperatures drop precipitously and bring about a new ice age within hours.New York City is hit by a huge tidal wave and a catastrophic ice storm. It's all pretty grim; only the wolves that escape from the Bronx Zoo are having a good time.This climate disaster might come tomorrow, 100 years from now or in 1,000 years. Regardless, it's all the fault of our insensitive, out-of-touch president who refuses to ratify former Vice President Al Gore's favorite treaty, the Kyoto Protocol. In the movie, the president meets the fate he deserves along with everyone else in Washington, D.C.The real bad guy is the vice president, a look-alike for Dick Cheney, who puts budgetary constraints ahead of incurring the gigantic costs of environmental regulations demanded by global-warming fear mongers. He is made to eat crow at the end of the movie, publicly confessing the error of his ways and thanking the Third World for accepting the mass migration of U.S. citizens fleeing south to escape the ice.We must credit the movie producers for making the audience laugh out loud at the scene of Americans wading across the Rio Grande to cross our southern border illegally, begging for entry into Mexico to escape the cold. At first, Mexico tries to seal the border against the influx of Americans, but our president's cozy relationship with the Mexican president enables them to work out a deal: the United States forgives all Mexico's debts and Mexico graciously allows Americans to enter Mexico.The hero of the movie, the scientist who predicted it all, is a man of unbelievable endurance. He warns his son to stay inside the New York Public Library because, if he ventures outside, he will freeze to death within minutes. But the father somehow walks through ice and blizzard all the way from Philadelphia to New York to join him.The son and friends holed up in the library keep warm by burning books. The movie audience responded with lusty cheers when the volumes containing the tax code were tossed into the fireplace.We see Manhattan covered with ice up to the roof of the public library and the arms of the Statue of Liberty, as well as tornadoes in Los Angeles, ice sheets breaking up in Antarctica, hail the size of baseballs in Japan, and snow in India. The special effects of "The Day After Tomorrow" are fun to watch, but their utter improbability defeats the propaganda message.Nevertheless, Gore, Al Franken, and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., are hoping this summer disaster flick will make Americans take global warming seriously and turn it into a presidential campaign issue. MoveOn.org and the National Resources Defense Council are distributing leaflets at theaters to explain the message to moviegoers.Environmental groups are urging Americans to do their part to save the environment by riding bicycles to the movie theater. I didn't notice any movie stars giving up their SUVs or Gore riding his bike; it is President Bush who has made news by bicycle riding.Global warming isn't science; it's leftist propaganda to promote global regulation of our economy. If the predictions of the movie were true, it is obvious that absolutely nothing we could do - even abandoning every automobile in America - would make any difference.In April, a team from Harvard University concluded the most comprehensive study ever made of global temperature over the last 1,000 years. The team reported that the world was much warmer during the Middle Ages, between A.D. 800 and 1,300, than it is today.Bush is in good company in rejecting Kyoto. The U.S. Senate voted 95-0 in 1997 against Kyoto because it would cost jobs and drastically reduce the standard of living in the United States, while exempting most other countries from its regulations. The various international conferences on global warming have produced mostly hot air, and Russia gave Kyoto the kiss of death last year when Russian President Vladimir Putin pulled out, saying that Kyoto would stunt his country's economic growth.Phyllis Schlafly</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Big-budget special effects. To quote the star Dennis Quaid, "this is the mother of all disaster movies". Quaid plays Professor Adrian Hall, a scientist who studies the ways weather patterns changed in the past. He comes up with a theory that the world will suffer from a new Ice Age in the next 100 years or so. But suddenly the effect of global warming brings about earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes and tidal waves forcing most of the North American population to migrated to Mexico. Around the world humanity races to southern, warmer climate trying to outrun the New Ice Age that has developed rapidly with the ignored warning from Dr. Hall.Adding to the major peril, Hall must travel against the flow of migration and head north to New York City where his son(Jake Gyllenhaal)is wisely hold up with fellow classmates in the snow buried NYC municipal library. I really liked this movie. Making it even better is watching on a big screen in a chilled theater. Also in the cast of this dramatic Sci-Fi thriller: Emmy Rossum, Dash Mihok, Jay O. Sanders and Sela Ward. Watch the Statue of Liberty get pounded by a gigantic tidal wave and witness a waving "Old Glory" freeze solid in seconds. And then there are the ships stranded frozen in the streets of NYC. Kudos to writer/director Roland Emmerich and his F/X staff. Is it wrong to think disaster is entertainment? This is the first of the great ones of the summer '04.</fullReview>

It also focuses on the fact that government chooses to ignore educated scientists. The truth behind the matter is that over the last 4 years our environmental policies have gone down the toilet. Our government has permitted more pollution. I personally feel that this movie was made to be a wake up call to people to think carefully about how we are handling everyday decisions about our environment.Although this movie was somewhat predictable in parts, it was rather compelling and kept my family glued to their seats.</fullReview>

If the slightest shred of doubt that Emmerich was practically living on another planet after Independence Day or Godzilla existed, The Day After Tomorrow has completely erased it.NASA has actually stated that the events depicted in this film were so ridiculous that they could never occur. Emmerich has it that they could occur, but he sped up the time frame. Given that Emmerich can't even hold a camera without insulting someone's intelligence or ethnicity (seriously, Godzilla was one of the most racist films of the late 1990s), I know which side of this story I believe.The major problem with the film is that when we're not being subjected to shots of impossible action from the weather, the film is as boring as hell. Even some of the action sequences, such as the Vertical Limit ripoff, are about as interesting as the constant scare campaigns that anti-choice groups such as Greenpeace come out with. It is a supreme irony that during one of the book-burning sequences, one character states that he wants to preserve the Gutenberg bible because it represents the greatest achievement of mankind. The written word has been with us far longer than the Gutenberg bible, and since the original purpose of the written word was to share knowledge, it is more of a great misuse.Apparently, plausible story elements are not the only thing that Roland Emmerich forgot about. During one shot of the sky as birds migrate to who knows where, said birds go straight through buildings. Then we have a sequence where three of our heroes are attacked by wolves who traveled across Manhattan to find them. Apparently, wolves are invulnerable to all the spontaneous tornadoes, blizzards, and tidal waves, we witnessed earlier. And don't get me started on the infected cut plot device. It is truly amazing how film characters can defy the laws of physics in one second by outrunning a tidal wave, and be on death's door in the next.In all honesty, I want to know how much Greenpeace contributed towards the film's budget. If plausibility were essential to box office success, The Day After Tomorrow would have been the biggest tax write-off in the history of Hollywood. If things ever get to the stage where we have to burn books in order to keep warm, it won't be in spite of people like Roland Emmerich. It will be because of them. Ergo, nobody should be surprised that I gave this pile a one out of ten.</fullReview>

It's deja vu to the point of pathetic and beyond.An everyday Joe-turned-superhero? Check.Joe's dysfunctional family brought to reconciliation thru a disaster? Check.Joe's precocious multitalented kid? Check.Joe's kid's cute floozy, also boasting nigh-on preternatural abilities (except when she has to play the damsel in distress for Joe's kid to save)? Check.Politically correct side-characters (e.g. the African American hobo with the intellect of an Ivy League chaired professor)? Check.Intransigent, maladroit, aggressively stubborn politicians (American, of course)? Check.Barely 20 minutes into the movie I was rooting for them to perish. Now, THAT, would have been a movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching this movie was a strange experience. It's like the producer has given us the sensationalist premise of environmental catastrophe, provided us with all eye candy of special effects, and then told us to fill in the gaps my writing a story to fit it all in. It's quite an easy task because there is so much potential for a good story and dramatic scenes, and while I was watching the movie I was already anticipating these fantastically dramatic scenes that were bound to come up but never did. It begs the question, with all these possibilities for a good story, why did not the makers of this film write one. Because there is absolutely no story that really touches you, and no dramatic scene that really moves you. It does the legwork of introducing characters and inserting plot elements. But that's where it stays because nothing gets done with them. It's an absolute waste of a fantastic premise and great special effects. Since "special effects does not a movie make", this gets the lowest rating in my book.</fullReview>

The writers of this trash could not have consulted a single scientist when they compiled it. There is not a single scientific fact mentioned in the entire movie. They got EVERYTHING wrong. IF the tropospheric air could be brought down at great speed, it would warm up to around 30 degrees. AND it is only about -50 degrees at that altitude to begin with.The credits of this movie should have read, "Made by Al Gore and the pseudo-science crowd of low IQ idiots." Global warming is a myth and this movie didn't help the cause of the global alarmists. By the way, even the "global warming alarmists" have openly criticized this piece of garbage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is the worst one that I have watched. The plot of the movie is terrible and boring. It puts too much emphasis on the 'terrible impact of global warming'. Everything happening in the movie is certainly impossible and unreal. A lot of scientists strongly criticize the plot of the movie. Some said that series of natural disasters like those happening in the movie are unlikely to happen in a short period of time. They state that global warming only changes the average climate gradually. Besides, is it really possible for a man to walk from Philadelphia to New York during the 'second ice age' in a few days to find his son? It is ridiculous. The whole movie only talks about climate--- an extremely boring topic in school that can make all of us sleep in a second. Also, there are lots of, lots of extreme storms followed by many, many huge tornadoes followed by plenty of, plenty of horrible waves and so on. I am bored and tired of watching at so many disasters in a short time. Finally, this is my most hated movie and I strongly recommend you not watching it even for one time. It is a waste of time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Godzilla" was marginally less dumb than the incredibly dumb "Independence Day". "The Day After Tomorrow" is marginally less stupid than "Godzilla". At this rate of improvement we should expect a terrific and intelligent movie from Roland Emmerich... somewhere around the year 2368. Alas, by then we'll have a real Ice Age (one that doesn't distinguish between the rich and the poor) hence nowhere to watch his great films...TDAT is exactly what I expected it to be: not dull, good special effects, grand visual moments, cliché characters, filler scenes, sappy moments galore, a dumb premise, scientific gobbledygook, cretinous plot-devices, and political correctness of the most pathetic kind.It's the year 2004. Emmerich is writing a script for Hollywood. It's an election year. Emmerich is upset. Hollywood is upset. "We can't allow Bush to win again! Hopefully Michael Moore's latest fantasy propaganda film will sway enough voters to vote Socialist!" Emmerich wants to live in a "better" world i.e. one in which he can still make 100-million dollar movies through corporation money - and still live in San Trope villas - while fighting those oh-so evil corporations and their damn damn Capitalism. "I know what I'll do... I, the greatest Germanic Roland of all time, will redefine the term 'poetic justice'. I will make those evil Americans look so foolish as they run away from an ice storm into Mexico. I am so smart! I will make those right-wing doubters show what their wicked Capitalism can do to nature and their precious America... And maybe I'll be rewarded by an Oscar or two for my blatant PC-ness..." Roland Emmerich isn't the brightest cookie in the world. Nothing new there. Most Hollywood people have s*** for brains. One of Roland's silliest jabs at the much-hated Republicans is his dumb Vice-Presidential character, an obvious and subtle-as-a-f*rt allusion to Dick Chenney. Those scenes with Chenney making a fool out of himself in an international conference and then later again talking to Quaid are so utterly absurd that they just keep reminding you that you're watching an Emmerich movie, which means that anything silly can happen at any given moment. Of course, what Em doesn't know is that the REAL Chenney's I.Q. is actually larger than that of Ron and all the cast involved in this movie combined.Evil, evil Capitalism and industry will bring an Ice Age! If only we drove those solar-energy-fueled cars that Robert Redford promoted, and if only we didn't use so much hair-spray!Oh, those whining liberals with their "superior" theories on various political, social, and environmental issues... Poor misguides souls. So much emotion, so little rationale.(Will this review get deleted, too? Does this site punish those who don't think Left? We'll see...) Is ice politically correct? Is it Marxist? Does it work for Al-Qaida? I ask this because it seems that Ron's ice selects its victim-nations according to how much money they have. "Zambia?... No, I won't freeze Zambia. They are poor. It wouldn't be right. Must freeze evil America." Of course, Ron's Germany isn't evil. They're the good guys - as they've always been. Germany's frozen, too, but we don't get to see any of it...Fortunately for Em, like most viewers of this movie I am not a meteorologist so I can't identify all the nonsense Em has managed to pile up here. But something tells me that at least half of the science here is malarkey. Gay cowboy Gyllenhaal and other characters here are outrunning tsunamis, encroaching ice even (that scene was DUMB!), hell - they're even outrunning wolves at one point! You name it - it's been outrun by someone or other in TDAT.Speaking of wolves, why are Ron's wolves CGI wolves? Does it perhaps have something to do with the fact that even wolves are transformed into fantasy-land beasts of the apocalypse in Emmerich's movies, hence real wolves just wouldn't be good enough because they'd come off as a bunch of extra-furry dogs - which is all they really are. And what are they doing in Manhattan? So basically Em wants us to believe that in spite of there being millions of corpses to chew on, on the periphery of New York, the wolves had to go look for food ALL THE WAY in the center of NY?? The wolves appearing on that ship was the unintentionally funniest baloney Em came up with. It was very very funny.To be fair, not all of Em's INTENDED gags misfired. The homeless guy saying "what about the garbage cans? There's always something to eat in the garbage" was very funny.I also think that the library as the main setting in the second half was a very good idea. Emmerich comes from a country that has a tradition of book-burning, so the gags relating to that were to be sort of expected. They should have burnt Emmerich's scripts to keep warm...Most of the movie is all gloom and doom. However, there is a bright side: all future Oscar ceremonies will be canceled in an Ice Age! Now why didn't the movie focus on that? More optimism is what the world needs.What was the purpose of Quaid's absurd journey through Ice Age America? Just to see his son and say "hello"? Because that's exactly what happened. He didn't get him food or medicine, he just showed up and than a little later a helicopter came to pick them all up.There was an extremely dumb scene (one of many) when the gay cowboy and his gal discussed their feelings - after half of NY was being engulfed by a tsunami! Does Em really think we the viewers give a toss about whether the sweet-voiced Gyll will hook up with his goody-two-shoes girl?Gore and his environmentalist extremist doom-sayers will be laughed at in 50 years - while this movie will be hailed as a camp classic.</fullReview>

Enid Blyton could have written this.Locked medical rooms, wolves, scratches going septic overnight, a huge ocean liner appearing in the middle of a city, a dad walking 100s of miles through the storm that killed millions, just to say "hi son, I promised I would get to the library to pick you up". Pathetic. And there's more! Snow that was reportedly only 13 feet thick, yet people were walking over the top of shopping precincts. The glass on the roof of a shopping precinct shattered under the weight of just 2 men. Not 1 single person of the hundreds in the library decided to stay with our lead characters. The Pratt of a lead character stayed on the phone until the water was over his head! What the hell kind of idiot is that, and more to the point what the hell kind of phone works under water!It's the end of the world, and one character turns to the other and says "you ought to tell her you have feelings for her". Surely neither the time or place for such sentiments. Proving without a doubt that under the veneer, this is a girls film.Why does Hollywood turn out such trash? I can only guess it was aimed at 12 year old girls.If you are not a 12 year old girl, steer well clear of this turkey.If you liked it and you are not a 12 year old girl, man you need to see some quality, gripping and well acted films. Go and rent Fight Club and see what a real movie should be like.Film ratings just don't tell you enough. There should be a warning on this one. Perhaps the logo of a turkey or something.

It wasn't as bad as some disastrous TV disaster movies out there (Locusts), but the endless closeups of American flags, firemen showing up when all hope is lost, droning on and on about "rebuilding", and statue of liberty closeups made my eyes water. Just what are they trying to say? Is there a point to these endless Manhattan skyline shots? We low paid movie renters prefer getting to the point.It was at once a tirade about global warming and what climactic tragedy could happen if the evil republicans keep getting elected, a tribute to something that happened in New York, and a contest to fit the most American flags on the screen before giving the audience a red, white, and blue sunburn.Now as for seeing a Dennis Quaid revival, forget it. His only significant acting is the first 5 minutes. The rest is unknown teenage actors fighting impossible dialog and groping around like paraplegics. For crying out loud!!! How hard can it be to close a door before the supersonic blast of subfreezing air wipes out the cast?!?#!!?And don't forget to save the purse before it is engulfed in a 1000 ft tidal wave. The purse is all that matters.In Innerspace, Dennis Quaid was good as a low paid, low end, drunk staff scientist who always got into trouble doing things only his bosses were supposed to know. Instead he is now a bureaucrat miles away from the action, giving speeches to diplomats on high level issues, being referenced only in 3rd person by the kids on the ground, then stooping so low as to drive a truck only as a last resort.As for heroines, forget it. The heroine saved her boyfriend once from frostbite but the rest was all extreme manliness overcoming completely random obstacles.</fullReview>

I went in expecting 2 hours of fun entertainment, and that is exactly what I got. The Day After Tomorrow makes no claim whatsoever to being anything other than a fun action flick. Tornado movies have been done, tsunamis have been done, ice ages have been done. So let's just have a movie with all of them.If you go to see The Day After Tomorrow, don't expect a work of art.

		<fullReview>So, as the movie starts, and you see Roland Emmerich as the screenplay, story writer, director, and I'm assuming part producer of the film as well. This can only mean one thing: Unless your George Lucas, this is YOUR vision of what's going to happen unless everyone changes the way they think and begins voting for Kerry and supporting the Peoria Convention. First, Ronnie has you get a "very bad vibe" from a Vice President that couldn't possibly be a better stab at depicting Dick Cheney.Second, all Hell (frozen over) breaks loose because we've neglected nature's rights and she decides to shaft us with an unbelievable snow storm whose "eye" turns conservative pricks, (the president's motorcade), and "those not in the know" into icicles. Third, we, (the Zionistic Americans), evacuate to third world countries whoms redemptious qualities include harboring us until we figure out a way to snow shovel an entire continent so we can "get the heck out of THEIR country (so to speak)". Fourth, this event has changed the heart of, (Lets face it, it's Dick Cheney no matter how you doctor it up), the Vice President (Now the President) and makes a "State of the (totally shaken, snow covered, and unorganized) Union" address from an Embassy on foreign soil. The jist is "We will never again act as though we are 'above 3rd world countries' and 'We really should give socialism a try'". Summary: If you vote Kerry, go see it and support more friends of greenpeace such as Micheal Moore, and CNN (and don't say it ain't so with CNN, I'm from Atlanta)...If you vote anything other than for the donks (socialist party of amerika), don't even bother. It's simply another ploy to spread communist poop to the moviegoer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen and it is an absolutely terrible script acted out by an awful cast! I saw this at the cinema and was excited to be viewing the, then, blockbuster of the summer and looking forward to some heroic tale of survival in the worst possible conditions of a global natural disaster. OK...what i felt i got made as much sense, and i had as much compassion for, as making 24 (Keifer Sutherland) casting Benny Hill (if he were still alive obviously) as jack Bauer. It was ridiculous!***MAY CONTAIN 'SPOILER'***Dennis Quaid plays some scientist who no-one listens to (he keeps his job though) and reports on forthcoming catastrophes to his bosses and a handful of other people which they then choose to ignore as utter crap (he still keeps his job). However the weather turns rough (ice tornadoes etc) and now they listen to him and he...wait for it...predicts a new ice age of a great magnitude that starts tomorrow, which is what hes been babbling on about to his bosses so now they are forced to listen to him but it's all too late and it's all YOUR (the audience) fault for not listening to the dangers of global warning! We find out that Quaid's wife is a doctor and a very, very dedicated one at that! When the time comes that she is trapped with one of her cancer patients, a kid of course, she decides to stay and die with her patient. However don't worry she finds some transport and ends up with Quaid and their 'genius' son at the end! At one point Quaid decides that he will walk to NYC to help his div (sorry genius) son, he enlists the help (although they did seem quite keen) of his 2 best mates and manages to get them both killed on the journey, but he doesn't seem to mind too much as he has set his sights on rescuing his kid who, as it turns out in the end, didn't need rescuing after all...what's a little death between friends.Also look for patronizing small and lengthy speeches from various characters, not forgetting that absolute sentimental rubbish the new president of the USA blabs on about including uniting the west and the third world, how it is wrong to burn fossil fuels etc, the wolves that escape from the zoo and start terrorizing the div (sorry genius) son and all his 'buddies', the Russian...yes Russian...ship that runs aground in new york (don't ask!), the poor and the rich burying their differences and working together...This is utter garbage and offensive to watch.What is even more unbelievable is that there are people who watch this film and actually enjoy it! For them I am certain this is an account of what could happen if we ignore all the social problems we face as a society. For the rest of us the fact that these people may now be in the majority is much more scary than a real day after tomorrow!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After viewing "Independence Day," which was brought to you by the same directors, I was expecting a total piece of crap, and as I don't believe most of the claims coming from the "global warming" crowd, I was pleasantly surprised to find that "The Day After Tomorrow" was a fairly well-crafted movie. The cinematography and the effects were quite good, the writing not bad, and the acting reasonably convincing, with an emotional ending that was better than might be expected. Of course, the premise is strictly science fiction, and not very good science fiction, so for people to take this story seriously is absurd. Frankly, I still don't get how "global warming" is supposed to trigger an ice age, but I have yet to figure out how sketchy and contradictory data regarding an alleged slight increase in ocean temperature can be plugged into flawed computer models of a climate we barely understand, extrapolated for a century, and then somehow used to "prove" the hypothesis of "global warming." I also don't understand how apparent regional warming automatically indicates "global warming," or how a bunch of hurricanes one year are a direct result of it, while almost no hurricanes the next year is simply ignored. That several "peer reviewed" scientific journals seem to accept this research and routinely suppress all evidence and opinion to the contrary is another matter altogether. I can accept that the increase in human population, coupled with expanded industrialization in Asia and the Third World is going to have some negative environmental effects, but not enough to produce any significant "global warming." After all, CO2 is not the primary greenhouse gas. Water vapor is, and that is produced naturally. Further, we are in an interglacial period, the last ice age having occurred about 11,000 years ago and the next one expected in a few thousand more years. Finally, the earth's temperature has varied considerably over geologic time. It has been cooler than it is now and much warmer, too. I just can't buy this "global warming" crap and I have yet to hear any convincing arguments to the contrary by anyone whose opinion I respect. A far more pressing question, biologically speaking, is how soon we are going to reach the carrying capacity of the biosphere to support human life. In this regard, there are many ways that nature could work to substantially reduce the human population, "global warming" being one of the least likely. A series of pandemics or droughts followed by mass starvation are but two examples. Unfortunately, that "global warming" advocates continue to push this sort of fantasy is one reason why the environmental movement is given so little credibility by too many people these days. Guys like Rush Limbaugh, who may understand politics and economics fairly well but who is a total boob when it comes to Biology, gets away with calling serious intellectuals "environmentalist whackos" and nobody is able to refute his ignorant bigotry effectively. When so many other people seriously believe the outlandish claims made in movies such as this one, it is no wonder.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Expecting a good story.......but got leftist tripe !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had great hopes in this film as I am particularly interested in meteorology, weather systems and satellite photos myself ! I found the film watcheable but the story line really was weak. Not enough character development. I was expecting something emotional like between the characters in "Deep Impact", but I found it was very difficult to get involved with the characters of this film. Even Independence Day was more emotional than this.Meteorologically, the synoptic charts shown seemed quite implausible and the developments would never be so rapid on such a large scale !! The special effects were numerous but appeared synthetic and artificial even more so that Independence Day - seemed a shame as I'm sure they could have done better without a less extreme but more plausible weather scenario plus a bit more character development.Also it should be stated that for many millions of years there have been warm-ups and ice ages in the climate. Man has a disease at the end of the 20th/beginning 21st century and that each time there is a disaster in nature, fellow human beings must be blamed. Not nature itself, or God, or the solar system, but fellow human beings. What is called a partisan approach. This is totally stupid of course but it persists today in all walks of life, in Western Europe and the USA at least ( if a man falls over a cliff edge, its not his fault but the fault of the local mayor of the area for not having put a fence in the area to stop the man from falling over - just an example to illustrate this attitude !!).The film then seeks to "put blame" on USA and developed countries for warming up the atmosphere and then seeking refuge in warmer climes because their countries have become too cold !! It's logically unsound and smells of leftist/liberal/ecological ( all 3 words designate the same loonies who propound these ideas ) propaganda.I would have preferred no propaganda, less special effects, a more sound and plausible meteo dilemma, and above all much more emotional character developments ( bonds and emotions between the characters ). Basically the film left me "cold" in all senses of the world.........</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I AM NOT an enviromentalist. I did enjoy this movie. I see it as a piece of SciFi... no different than the director's other notable movie... Indep Day... Aliens and Man-Induced Ice Age... sounds about right. The science here is sketchy at best... although I do not doubt that changing the warm water currents would be less than good for the world, I don't think that if it happens it will be because of my Crown Vic sedan... Mt. Pinotuba in the Phillipine let out more "greenhouse" gasses in the early 90's eruption than man has managed to scrape up in his entire existence. Couple that with the hundreds (thousands?) of volcanoes that occasionally blow their top... some regularly (Hawaii)... and I think we are gnats compared to their great outputs... but enough already. The Movie was enjoyable. The effects were effective and lent to the story. This was way better than Indep Day. Although the VP Cheney look-alike in the same job was hard to miss... the Algore-ish stand-in for the president was laughable. At least the leaders didn't fall in to smarmy, campy acting like the President in Indep Day. It was worth the popcorn needed to watch it. I gave it a solid 7.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Special effects extravaganza marred by doomsday politics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The typical disaster movie plays up our deepest fears and tries to balance them with human drama. At one minute people are running for their lives, the next they're cowered together, trying to outlast Mother Nature's fury.The elements are usually in place for a good story, but filmmakers tend to overdo the human aspects and end up making the movie melodramatic. "The Day After Tomorrow" is certainly no exception, but thankfully the ultra-goofy dialogue that sunk NBC's recent disaster telepic "10.5" is mercifully kept to a minimum. Instead we have just a big, dumb action movie that's easy on the brain and filled with lots of visual treats.Nature is a harsh mistress, and it seems she had enough of our selfishness. Scientist Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) specializes in studying the climate patterns of the Earth, and has detected what might be the first traces of a major shift in the temperature of the planet due to global warming. His statements are of course met with skepticism by the American government, particularly by Vice-President Becker (Kenneth Welsh, who looks too much like Dick Cheney for it to be a coincidence).Hall gets a sympathetic listener in Terry Rapson (Ian Holm) a fellow climatologist studying ocean temperatures. When his ominous warnings start to come true, Hall is forced to accept that the world may be heading for another ice age. Meanwhile, Hall's son Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) is in New York at an academic competition, which is in the path of a massive tidal wave that threatens to flood the city."The Day After Tomorrow" is certainly loaded with some powerful images. Tornadoes destroy downtown Los Angeles, waters flood New York and then the city becomes a frozen tundra, and in one deliciously ironic moment thousands of Americans illegally cross the Rio Grande to sneak into Mexico.It is a well-intentioned film, but like all "message-driven" movies its reasoning is absolute and the main characters are either fall into two camps: the noble idealists and the cynical curmudgeons.It's been six years since the last time director Roland Emmerich destroyed New York, and kudos to him for managing to do it again with flare. He directs the disaster scenes with a seasoned professionalism, making them both intense and frightening, and he thankfully manages to downplay the melodrama so it doesn't come off annoying.Quaid is the anchor that keeps this film together, and his performance as Hall is nicely even-keeled. He manages to almost make the conflict in this film believable, but he's still saddled with goofy emotional baggage. His estrangement with his son (a typical plot device in disaster films) is too ill-conceived and by-the-books to be powerful, as is the `heartwarming' decision of his wife (Sela Ward) to stay behind with a young cancer patient in the middle of a blizzard.Gyllenhaal turns in a nice performance as Sam, playing the survivor who, to the screenplay's credit, manages to use reason instead of self-righteous bullheadedness, though he still does a few stupid things as well. It's still a nice star turn for the young actor, and he pulls it off without insulting our intelligence too bad.But "The Day After Tomorrow" ultimately suffers from the major problems evident in the disaster genre. Its politics are goofy, the special effects outweigh the human drama and most notably its views on social Darwinism are hypocritical at best.The movie suggests mankind should just accept that in catastrophes there's going to be massive casualties that people can do nothing to stop, but at the same time every attempt by the heroes to save the ones they care about, no matter how foolish a long shot it may be, is always smiled upon. Only in a disaster movie could a selfish decision such as leaving behind millions of people who need your help to seek out one's son be construed as altruistic and noble.The science of the film is of course far-fetched to say the least, suggesting a major world-wide climate change could occur within a few weeks. The fact is global warming still remains a touchy subject, one that can either be proven or disproven with different data. Plus it's always disheartening to see a movie use a straw man approach to discredit opposing viewpoints on the issue by making them come from the mouths of people driven by that dependable goal of every movie villain -- money."The Day After Tomorrow" comes with controversy already built on the issue of global warming, but it's doubtful this movie will change many opinions. It certainly is a well made film with great special effects and likable main characters, but like all disaster movies it tries to scare people into submission. You better change your ways, or THIS could happen to you.Still, despite the shortcomings of the film itself, it is an powerful reminder that no matter what your thoughts on the greenhouse effect, the fact remains that mankind is completely at the mercy of nature. It's sobering to be reminded that despite our advances throughout the centuries, at any moment disaster can strike and render all our accomplishments moot.7 out of 10 stars. The movie is good for what it is, but please, less complaining about the evils of technology only to use that same technology when the survivors need it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Day After Tomorrow is an excellent film that boasts a excellent cast which includes Dennis Quaid, Jake Gyllenhaal, Emmy Rossum, Dash Mihok, Jay O. Sanders, Frank Harris, Sela Ward, Ian Holm, Mark Thompson, and Glen Plummer. The acting by all of these is very good. The special effects are superb and tons of weather action and it all looks realistic. The film is very exciting and the music by Harald Kloser is great. Roland Emmerich has directed another major film this excellent! This really the ultimate disaster film. Once again this is a great film and its arguably one of the greatest movies ever in My opinion! Strongly recommended! Movie Nuttball's NOTE: If love Roland Emmerich then I recommend that you see the following films: Making Contact (a very different yet great movie), Universal Soldier (an awesome movie, one of the best!), Stargate (another excellent film!), Godzilla 1998 (Don't get Me wrong, its a great movie but I still feel that it is nothing like the classic Godzilla movies so I only recommend you see it if you like American monster films and/or Roland Emmerich),and The Patriot,(2000, this is a fine film!.</fullReview>

The thinly disguised pockshots at republicans and the current administration are not to be missed!America bashing at its best! WE caused the disaster that affected the world and now we have to immigrate to Third World countries to escape our "stupidity" thereby showing us that OUR immigration policies were always wrong! For the right-wingers there are a few shots worth your while in this flick. Silly liberals falling into ice crevices, getting frozen solid because they don't have enough sense to go inside and warm up, DNC members trying to walk (not drive or fly) south to escape a huge (fast-moving) ice storm, etc.I normally try and keep politics out of my movie comments but this movie is so blatant with it that it just can't go unsaid.If your a shrub-hugger or confirmed liberal then this is your "feel-good" movie of the year!The special effects were good but if your a real thinking person, there is little here for you to appreciate.Firefox9 in Houston</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>terrible story and already've been done special effects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm glad I didn't pay to see this. When will they learn a bunch of computer special effects does not make a good movie. The basic plot is a scientist, Quaid, hypothesizes the earth's climate is changing and moving toward an ice age. But he never thought it would happen in a few days.At the beginning, there is a ridiculous scene in which Quaid jumps this chasm to get some metal rods. When he jumps back, he makes it with both feet landing right on the edge. It's beyond silly.Then there is a ridiculous subplot involving Quaid's ex-wife, who is a doctor. All the northern states are being evacuated but she says she will wait with a child who must be transported in an ambulance. And no explanation is given why the kid needs an ambulance; he's not hooked up to some breathing machine. So, you are telling me that kid was the only patient in the hospital that required an ambulance. What about the people in ICU! The other subplot is about Quaid's son, who is in New York City when the severe storm, that can kill people outside because of negative degree weather, strikes. He and some friends find refuge in the public library. A silly out-of-place romance is thrown in between the son and his classmate. But the worst part of all involves a pack of wolves that attack the group of 3 on a ship. 3 of them leave to find medicine for the girl who has cellulitis from a cut the director made sure of showing earlier in the movie. These wolves make their way onto the ship and give a good chase. It makes you laugh.Then Quaid goes with his two buddies to New York to rescue his son. Luckily for him, when the killing temps reach them, they happen to be over some store they can wait it out in. Plus, they must have had an extra warm tent. It was also funny when they mention Mexico letting Americans in because the US forgave all Latin American debt! The tornadoes were the best CGI effects, but tornadoes have been done so many times in other disaster movies. But, they only had one scene of natural disaster in foreign countries unlike movies before it. That's real original! Then the ending was horrible because it just stops with out a real resolution.FINAL VERDICT: This was a bad movie. Only watch it if you are looking for something so bad, it's funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Roland Emmerich makes up for "Independence Day" and "Godzilla".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Knowing that "The Day After Tomorrow" is directed by the same guy behind Hollywood garbage such as "Independence Day" and "Godzilla", a person would likely assume this movie to be the same. In fact, this one is much different. Portraying global warming unleashing an ice age across the northern hemisphere, the movie should be a warning to us (especially after Hurricane Katrina).When the movie came out, there was some controversy about the vice president looking very similar to Dick Cheney. I wish to assert that it's appropriate for him to resemble the Bush administration, given the way that the Bush administration pursues policies increasing global warming.All in all, this is a popcorn movie - and (hopefully) improbable - but definitely worth seeing. Dennis Quaid, Jake Gyllenhaal, Emmy Rossum, and Ian Holm all do quite well in their roles.</fullReview>

We - not volcanoes or natural cyclic weather patterns - are the sole cause of global warming! Therefore, the entire United States is locked in an instant deep freeze! Global Warming = Instant Freeze? (see what I mean?) The "moral" of this insipid story is that, because of our "misuse" of our environment and resources, we must sit in the dark and freeze - or suffer the "consequences". Of course, we would have to keep our radios on in order to listen to Lame-Night AM with the noisy moron, Art Smell.Another commenter suggested that we dispel our higher thinking processes and watch the pretty pictures... believe me, it's not worth it.

But in this stupid "the day after tomorrow" they didn't even drink one BIT of water!!!! How can they even live??????Fifth, the whole city was full of ice, and it's even higher than some buildings.

		<fullReview>I must admit that "Independence Day" was not a really great movie, but it at least provided for dumb fun; it had a sense of humor and if you turned your brain off for a while, it was very enjoyable. I had expected the same from "The Day After Tomorrow" since it was made by the same people. The first obstacle to an enjoyable movie experience was the overt political propaganda of the film--hey, if I wanted a lecture based on lies and/or bad science, I would watch a Michael Moore movie. At the end of the movie I noticed that it was inspired by "The Coming Global Superstorm," a book written by a radio commentator that survives on paranoid conspiracy theories (Art Bell) and an author whose most famous book was about his own abduction by aliens (Whitley Strieber). So in reality, the movie has about as much credibility as a Moore film.Okay, so getting past the political pap that populates the film--the story is full of inconsistencies and plot holes, the acting is substandard even for the B-list that fills the roster, and the special effects are really not that special. A hundred foot wall of water doesn't pound into New York but instead gently sloshes through the streets like water in a bathtub, for Pete's sake!I nominate this film for worst film of 2004--not an easy prize to win when we're talking about a year that featured "Garfield," "Alien vs. Predator," and "Fahrenheit 9/11!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of those times to send the harsh but real messages home on global warming.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was one of those movies my father was kind of looking forward to watch when it first came out on the cable here. I know, being once a Geography student makes him aware of climate changes and all that in between.For me, since once the class few years back had to do researches on each type of pollution that each group has chosen (my group was on water pollution), it's something which has really made me more aware about the state of the world we are living in. Thanks to our careless ignorance of the increasing global warming.The movie centre around a climatologist Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) who has been giving lectures on the impending danger of a new ice age on planet Earth, and his son Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) who was caught stranded in New York with his friends because of the ice age. But in the movie, who will care a hoot on what Jack is saying anyway? And in the case of Sam, no matter how much he and his friends tried to persuade those who were trapped in the same building as them about waiting for help to arrive to them because of the alarming decrease of the temperature, not all heeded his word.Sometimes, it's all a matter of whether one wants to believe what others will say in desperate times. As it's often being told time and again that the truth is always stranger than fiction and the truth always hurts, this was one of those times which drove it home.I know I heard so many about this movie before I saw it with my family on the cable then, but then maybe sometimes we need a little 'pushing' to remember that our Earth is very vulnerable nowadays. And no one can dare to mess with Mother Nature when she's angry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crappy plot, hokey dialogue; great special effects (which is really all I expected)...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Day After Tomorrow" has been promoted as a potentially true story. Filmmaker Roland Emmerich has tried to attract huge box office returns by claiming that scientists have predicted something similar to the events depicted in this film really could happen. I very much doubt it.The film's theory is rather thin, which may explain why it is simultaneously confusing. A scientist (played by Dennis Quaid) foresees a global disaster involving polar ice caps. His theory is that the earth's natural cycle of heat will be disrupted, resulting in the "next ice age." Of course, as New York City and Los Angeles are destroyed, and the United Kingdom is frozen solid, it is considered that mankind is being destroyed. Really? What about areas south of the US, such as Africa, Australia, and New Zealand?Emmerich doesn't deal with any other countries than the US and UK, which will serve as fuel for those who claim the United States is ignorant when it comes to other countries. But regardless, we are supposed to believe that the next ice age is occurring. Temperatures drop at rapid paces. Tidal waves roar across cities, destroying everything and everyone in their path. Tornadoes demolish large buildings and blow debris into cars and humans as they grow larger. While this happens, Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) is trapped in Manhattan's public library. His father (Quaid) tells him to stay put, and that he'll come get him. There are some fine action sequences prior to the rescue, such as when Sam finds himself trapped in a large vessel with a pack of wolves that have escaped from a zoo (don't ask). Great special effects and tense sequences are ultimately what make silly scenes like this so fun.Emmerich is notorious for his big-budget disaster flicks such as the colossal "Independence Day" and equally gargantuan "Godzilla." Neither of those two movies worked for me. "Independence Day" was rather stupid and "Godzilla" was both stupid and inept; a totally joyless B-monster movie homage complete with a multi-million dollar budget and famous stars. If "Godzilla" was an homage to those cheesy cult monster flicks, then "The Day After Tomorrow" is Emmerich's ode to the disaster flicks of the 1950s and '60s, when the Cold War had just begun to settle, and when novels such as "Alas, Babylon" depicted vivid images of a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Indeed, "Day" contains all the fundamental elements of a B-movie, but happens to boast one of the largest budgets in cinema history as a counter to this summary.Emmerich's best film, so far, has been the one in which he abandoned disastrous activities for a touching story in "The Patriot," which starred Mel Gibson, and which I highly recommend despite its historical inaccuracies. However, "The Day After Tomorrow" also comes with a recommendation (albeit a half-hearted one) because it has one vital ingredient that Emmerich's other disaster movies sorely lacked: A sense of fun and bouncy spirit.Yes, "The Day After Tomorrow," while admittedly stupid, is also a very fun movie with some of -- if not the -- best CGI sequences I have ever seen. Many people might argue that the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy boasted superior visual effects, but I beg to differ. Here, we see New York City demolished before our very eyes. Tidal waves pour across Manhattan -- most of them seemed so real that even my very cynical perception failed to trace them."Day" represents a breakthrough in computer generated images -- I had a hard time spotting quite a number of them in this film. I am usually rather anti-CGI. I consider it to be a generally sloppy way of film-making for directors too lazy to put effort into making more realistic stunt sequences for their films. But here, one of the only reasons I can recommend the movie in the first place is because of its CGI. The New York City sequence (roughly ten minutes long) is worth the admission price alone.The acting is fairly impressive. Quaid does his best with the dialogue he is given. Gyllenhaal (who frequently demanded dialogue re-writes on the set of the film) makes his character likable and a relatable hero. The movie is not great by any means but the performances are far better than those in "Independence Day."On the downside, Emmerich's film is so blatantly liberal that it almost ruins some of the fun. The President of the United States bears an uncanny resemblance to Al Gore. He is depicted as the "good guy." When he dies, the Vice President takes over. He is the "bad guy" who ignores the warnings of scientists and is responsible for the deaths of millions. Towards the end of the film (without ruining all of it) he apologizes to America for being ignorant and declares that we have been stealing from Mother Earth too long, and should have been more careful with our resources, yadda yadda. I feel like I've seen this movie before. And I feel like I've seen this same sort of speech before. Could it be from "Independence Day"? Maybe. Either way, "The Day After Tomorrow" has some of the best special effects I've ever seen. And that is really all I expected from this movie, and I was surprised to find a fair amount of humor, fun, and tense scenes that I really didn't expect at all. I think Emmerich is finally learning how to make a good disaster movie -- hopefully his next will be as good as this.</fullReview>

The story itself is based on a theory that the ice age is induced by weather pattern changes from the ocean's currents. Sorry no meteor in this one. A little sappy and preachy but not the pc rubbish the left coast can create. The film is some what believable of how the United States would react to a New Ice Age. The next new world power would be Australia and Argentina if the Northern Hemisphere is wiped out, and everyone moves to Mexico. This movie follows all the disaster movie's topics such as people learning to adapt and improvise or die. My guess for "The Day After Tomorrow" if my science is right. Some of the coastal areas would be ok because of the Ocean's ability to absorb the cold. The US could do some ice blasting and moving and Paint the snow black in order to melt the ice faster and have the sun's rays absorb instead of reflect the heat would help with the battle with the new glacier. The U S would be the Gulf states and what is left around the Mexican border. Not a bad movie, one worth watching 7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Day After Tommarrow was a great movie! A GREAT GREAT GREAT Movie! It was filled with suspense, horror, comedy, romance and plain, flat-out entertaining fun!!!! Its about a group of friends who seek the end of the world as we know it. There are floods in NYC and the whole north hemisphere is going through the 2nd Ice Age. Only a group of people decide to make the right decision and stay in a NYC library. They burn books to keep each other warm. They stick together and make it through! If your going to visit the movie rental store for your Saturday night, The Day After Tommarrow is a movie you'll want to watch all that weekend, and throughout the week!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To Kyoto Convention on Climate Change With Love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) is a climatologist, who advises the American government about the problems of the greenhouse effect and global warming, but is not listened by the authorities. While his son Sam Hall (Jake Gyllenhaal) is in a competition with his school friends in New York, the north hemisphere has a sudden climate change, with huge hurricanes, tornadoes and waves and Manhattan is flooded, beginning a new Ice Age. Jack tries to save the life of his son. 'The Day After Tomorrow' recalls those type of movies very common in the 70's related to catastrophes. The difference is the very impressive state-of-art special effects. The storyline is very shallow, but the theme, which has been discussed for years in the Kyoto Convention, and the special-effects make this movie a worthwhile entertainment. This high-budget movie is not a film of characters, but visual and sound effects. The DVD has many Extras, but I have not watched them yet. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): 'O Dia Depois de Amanh?' ('The Day After Tomorrow')</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Day After Tomorrow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no mention of 'the day after tomorrow', but it doesn't matter because we don't know when it is going to happen anyway, which makes it even more believable and a good story. After the success of Independence Day, director Roland Emmerich obviously wanted another disaster movie. But after the terrible 9/11 incident with the twin towers, he had to make it a natural disaster rather than aliens or monsters. So Dennis Quaid plays Jack Hall, a scientist convinced that some time in the future an incident that happened at least 10,000 years ago will happen again. All terrifying weather conditions happening within the same times. Sir Ian Holm as Terry Rapson also joins him with his proof for a while. So we have many tornadoes, intense wind, a very high flood and very, very cold freeze. Oh, and Jack's son, Sam (Jake Gyllenhaul) is caught in the destruction of New York. Also starring Emmy Rossum as Laura Chapman, Glenn Plummer as Luther and Adrian Lester as Simon. Very good!</fullReview>
